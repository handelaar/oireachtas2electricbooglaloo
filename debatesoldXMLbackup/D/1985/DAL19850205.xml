    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he will designate one of his Ministers to take overall responsibility for Government policy towards commercial State-sponsored bodies in view of the fact that they are now spread over nine Departments and have many common difficulties and features.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to change the working relationship between Ministers responsible for policy and the commercial State-sponsored bodies responsible for executing it.</P>
      <P>The existing position is that three Ministers, the Ministers for Finance, for Energy and for Communications have direct responsibility for the majority of commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>There is also adequate provision for central co-ordination.  The Minister for Finance has traditionally exercised co-ordinating responsibility in relation to commercial State-sponsored bodies in the areas of the terms and conditions of borrowing; the provision of exchequer finance by way of equity and loans, and the appraisal of investment proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1458" /> The Minister for Finance has also initiated the preparation and submission of corporate plans by commercial State-sponsored bodies.  He will submit to the Government periodic reports on those plans and on the financial position of the bodies.</P>
    <P>At present also proposals for improving the reports and accounts of both commercial and non-commercial State bodies are being finalised by the Department of Finance, after consultation with other Departments.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has, of course, overall responsibility for financial management in Government Departments and this extends to commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service is responsible for policies on pay and related matters in relation to commercial State-sponsored bodies in the context of overall national incomes policy.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service is also taking steps to improve the management processes in Government Departments. These improvements will cover all areas of Departments' activities including the activities concerned with the effectiveness and efficiency of commercial State-sponsored bodies.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Taoiseach say if he is satisfied with the performance of commercial semi-State companies? Would he say what precise plans the Government have for these 28 or so companies which now employ 50,000 people turning over £3 billion and account for approximately 20 per cent of State debt with some three-quarters of them in financial difficulties?  Would the Taoiseach inform the House if he is satisfied with that type of performance and does he not now think that the time has come for a more radical look at the way these State companies are co-ordinated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not say that I am satisfied with the performance of all commercial State-sponsored bodies. While many of them continue to perform very efficiently, in a number of cases there have been problems.  Some of these <Col N="1459" /> problems may derive from the impact upon them of policy decisions of different Governments, others may have arisen from inadequacies in their own management and direction.  I would not attempt to obscure the fact that there are problems but the Minister for Finance has initiated the submission of corporate plans by these bodies and will be submitting a periodical report on them to the Government.  The process under which each body have to submit their corporate plans for the years ahead has concentrated the minds of people considerably and will give the Government a much better overall view of where these bodies think they are going and will put the Government in a better position to co-ordinate their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Government's intention to provide the additional equity which these companies will require over the next few years, which according to some will run into hundreds of millions of pounds over the next five or six years? I do not see that in the national plan and I wonder if the Taoiseach has provided for that kind of injection of equity over the next couple of years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NiallAndrews" hpid="Mr. N. Andrews Mr. N. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister satisfied with the general performance of semi-State companies since their formation and would he agree that it is only now in these recessionary times that people are trying to undermine the confidence of the people working in these sectors?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The overall performance of semi-State bodies and their contribution to the State since their establishment is of great importance to <Col N="1460" /> this State.  As somebody who worked in one for a long time I am aware of the great value of these bodies and I am aware of the fact that because they work in the public interest it can beneficially affect the morale of the staff.  But problems have arisen in recent years, partly because of the recession, partly because of the impact of Government policies which have sometimes misdirected them and partly because there have been some deficiencies in management and direction which need to be remedied.  The steps that have been taken and are being taken will ensure that these bodies will be able to contribute as effectively as they have in the past to the general national welfare.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach and the Government consider releasing the commercial State-sponsored bodies from the shackles of Devlin so that they may employ the best people at the most appropriate salaries, because of the huge commercial enterprises which they now are?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It arises on the management of semi-State bodies which the Taoiseach referred to in the final part of his answer.  I am asking the Taoiseach a straight question.  Would he consider that the shackles of Devlin inhibit the proper development of many of our semi-State bodies at the moment?</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the total cost of the reception hosted by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach at the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, on 22 January last; the total number of guests who were present; the purpose of the reception; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The total cost of catering for the State reception to which the Deputy refers amounted to £2,378.80 and the total number of guests who were present was 450.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of the reception was to mark the closing year of the United Nation's Decade for Women, which commenced after International Women's Year, 1975, and ends this year.  The guests at the reception included a Government Minister; Ministers of State; Members of the Oireachtas; members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Women's Rights; members of the Diplomatic Corps; people from Northern Ireland; representatives from the Council for the Status of Women and from other women's groups not affiliated to the Council, such as the Ballymun Pre-School Playgroups Association; trade <Col N="1462" /> unionists and other representative groups and individuals drawn from the sub-themes of the decade, which are employment, health and education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he has noted a recent proposal by the Policy Director of the Confederation of Irish Industries in which he advocated a greater role for the private sector in the provision of public infrastructure; and, if so, if he will comment on the proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien) Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment (Mr. F. O'Brien)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have seen details of the proposal referred to. The Government have already stated that they are prepared to consider a greater role for the private sector in the provision of public infrastructure and indeed have taken action in a number of areas to facilitate this.  The position in relation to programmes of my Department is as follows.</P>
      <P>As regards road improvement projects, the Government clearly indicated in the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> and in the <i>Planning and Policy Framework for Roads</i> published on 29 January that it was interested in pursuing the potential for private sector investment. Deputies will, no doubt, be aware that the Ringsend bridge was the first road project to be financed by the private sector.  A proposal for the construction of a major toll road linking the Navan road and the Lucan road is generally acceptable to the Government.  In accordance with the commitment given in the national plan, my Department will shortly be making available to interested parties details of other potentially suitable projects for toll roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of sanitary services, joint venture arrangements between local authorities and the private sector have operated in the case of a number of major projects, with funding being shared by the local authorities and the relevant industries.  In rural areas, the scheme of State grants and the provision of headworks by local authorities facilitate the provision by the private sector of piped <Col N="1465" /> water supplies which would otherwise fall to be provided as public supplies.</P>
    <P>As regards joint venture housing schemes my Department wrote to housing authorities at the beginning of 1982 asking them to undertake these schemes as a means of encouraging people to buy private houses.  The national economic plan also emphasised the importance which the Government attach to the concept of joint venture housing.  The plan introduced the new £5,000 grant to enable tenants and tenant purchasers with certain residency qualifications to provide housing for themselves in the private sector and thus make available additional local authority houses for letting to persons who are unable to provide accommodation from their own resources. The £5,000 grant does not apply to applicants on local authority approved waiting lists for houses.  However, it is intended to extend to such persons and to tenants or sub-tenants of local authority houses, who are purchasing joint venture houses but do not qualify for the £5,000 grant, a subsidy on the lines of that presently payable in respect of developed private sites.  The subsidy will consist of a contribution of one third of the loan charges incurred on the acquisition of a joint venture housing site, subject to a capital cost limit of £3,000 per site.  Local authorities will shortly be notified of the details of this revision to the joint venture scheme and will be asked to ensure that the full benefit of the subsidy is passed on to the relevant categories of purchaser at the time of sale.</P>
    <P>As regards the proposal for a part equity house purchase scheme, special incentives already exist under the Housing Finance Agency scheme to enable low income purchasers to obtain the full ownership of their homes with income related repayments.  As indicated in the national plan, the scope for the provision by financial institutions of accommodation that could be rented or occupied on some form of tenure such as co-ownership-equity sharing is at present being examined.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that practically no progress would appear to have been made over the last 12 months since I asked a similar question prompted by publication of a report from the federation?  They were critical then and appear to be critical now.  It appears from the Minister's reply now that the joint venture site subsidy is practically the only new element introduced.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>No, indeed.  As I indicated, there are plans for a joint venture road in the Lucan area, which will cost about £22 million.  There are a number of proposals which will very shortly be put to interested parties in the industry, so that they can examine them to see if they are viable.  It will be up to the industry to take those up or not.  The additional site plans for joint venture housing is a positive response and an encouragement to joint venture housing.</P>

      <P>That is what I wanted.  I thank the Minister.  On the question of attracting private investment for the provision of public infrastructure, is it not true to say that it will be 1986, 1987, 1988 or years after before we see any of this work under way on the ground because difficult land acquisition proceedings are involved in nearly all of the cases mentioned.  Extensive design work will be required which will involve extensive delays.  Therefore, would he agree that we can foresee very little new employment in the construction sector of our economy arising from private investment in infrastructure if one is to take the present Government's policies at face value?</P>

      <P>The important thing is that we are doing it.  There is always a lead-in time in regard to any contract, which is at present the case with regard to the western parkway, in respect of which a lot of work has been done.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Evironment if the various fire authorities throughout the country are made aware of the range of dangerous or potentially dangerous chemicals in use in Irish industry; and whether the fire authorities are adequately equipped and trained for spillages of such materials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>All fire authorities were notified by my Department last year of the results of a survey by the Department of Labour of the movement by road of dangerous substances throughout the country.  In addition, my Department have circulated to fire authorities a list of industrial activities using dangerous substances which, in case of accident, could present major hazards.</P>
      <P>The provision of equipment and training for dealing with spillages of dangerous substances is a matter for each fire authority taking account of the level of risk in their area.  My Department provide loans, with 50 per cent subsidy, to fire authorities to purchase necessary equipment. The Fire Services Council supplement training at local level with a broad range of central training courses, many of which are relevant to incidents involving dangerous chemicals.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that there has been an increase in volume of such chemical materials being transported?  Would he also agree that it would be most important that there be detailed information always available <Col N="1471" /> from the transporter, given that such a large area of the country is covered by part time fire crews only, rendering it even more important that there be information available from the transporter in advance?</P>

      <P>There is now a computer system being set up &mdash; Chemdata Systems &mdash; for local authorities, a computer-based information system designed to provide fire authorities with essential, basic information relating to any chemical which may be the cause of fire.  It is expected that the system will have been installed very shortly in up to ten local authorities and we are examining and monitoring the progress of this system. That will be of very great help to local authorities when, if a substance goes wrong, they can refer back to the computer. There is a particular card called the Hazcard for use in gaining access to the computer which will give local authorities all of the information available as to the manner in which they should deal with such an occurrence.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the steps which have been taken by this country at an international level to ensure that Ireland is fully protected in the future from serious environmental damage being caused by acid rain.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>While this country is neither a significant contributor to, or receiver of, transboundary air pollution, it has participated fully in the action taken at international level to combat the causes of damage to the environment from the effects of acid rain.  Moreover, a positive attitude has been adopted to EC proposals in relation to air quality standards for sulphur dioxide, suspended particulates, lead and nitrogen dioxide; the combating of air pollution from industrial plant and the elimination of lead from petrol.  Ireland, together with the other EC member states, is a party to the Geneva Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution under which contracting states have undertaken to limit and, as far as possible, gradually to reduce emissions of polluting substances which contribute to acid rain and to engage in research and the collection of data of the causes and levels of acidity in rainfall.  In addition, Ireland participates in the EMEP &mdash; the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme &mdash; which provides data on acid deposition and its origins.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Acidity in rainfall is monitored by the Meteorological Service on a monthly basis at eight meteorological stations and on a daily basis at the station in Valentia. While the considerable volume of data assembled indicates an overall trend <Col N="1474" /> towards increased acidity, levels are, however, still generally satisfactory when compared with more industrialised countries.</P>
    <P>In 1982, An Foras Forbartha, with partial funding from the EC, commenced a study involving extensive and specific rainfall analyses at a range of stations in the Dublin region.  The project, which was originally scheduled to terminate at end-November 1984 will run until February 1986.  The results so far suggest that an incipient problem exists on the eastern seaboard.  However, they are not definitive and must be regarded primarily as an initial batch of data which will serve, <i>inter alia</i>, as the foundation for future work programmes.  A further study by An Foras which commenced in early 1984, and is scheduled to run for two years, aims to establish a well defined baseline for those lakes susceptible to damage from acid deposition by means of extensive physical chemical and biological studies on lake and rain waters in two areas in the east and west of the country.</P>
    <P>Research on the effects of acid rain on buildings is being undertaken at Trinity College, Dublin, using rainfall data collected at the college.  The college also hope to carry out, as resources permit, additional chemical determinations on soil and air using the data at their disposal.</P>
    <P>In the light of national and international requirements the preparation of comprehensive new air pollution legislation under way in my Department.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>Arising from the Minister's very detailed reply, he referred to an overall trend of increased acidity and an acidity problem developing on the eastern seaboard.  Could the Minister clarify the exact nature of the problem? What impact has been evident from the research done to date?  Is the Minister satisfied that the problem will not grow to the proportions it reached in Scandinavia and Germany where the extent of the problem was discovered well after the <Col N="1475" /> damage was done?  What action will be taken to ensure that any increased acidity on the eastern seaboard does not have the effect of causing permanent environmental damage to rivers and lakes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The study indicated a slight increase on the eastern seaboard. It did not indicate any other pattern. There are EC directives with regard to lead and petrol emissions from cars.  We are looking at the large combustion plants.  These will all have a significant effect in controlling acid rain.  Even with a slight increase on the eastern seaboard our problem is still lower than it is in other countries.  I am not saying we should be satisfied with that, or that we should leave it at that.  We are very much aware of the problem.  In countries like Germany and France and other industrial countries they are taking this matter very seriously. In time this will have beneficial effects right across the board.  We are fortunate that we have not been plagued with this acid rain problem.  The global measures being taken will have a significant impact in the future on protecting our environment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>
      <P>In the context of the increase which has been evident on the eastern seaboard is it yet known what the origin of this increase is?  Is our environment being affected due to emissions from Britain?  Have any representations been made in this regard in the light of representations made by Scandinavian countries and Germany to Britain in relation to the contributory effects of British emissions giving rise to acid rain throughout Europe?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>That is coming.  I have to point out the context in which it is coming.  Is the Minister aware that we are embarking on a plant which will pump out 70,000 tonnes of sulphur dioxide, contravening EC regulations, without any desulphurising or sulphur recovering process at that plant?  I refer to Money-point. The acid rain, sulphur dioxide and nitrous oxide will increase by 50 per cent at that stage.  Will the Minister use his good offices to enable the ESB to acquire a grant from the EC to install sulphur recovery equipment at that plant?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The discussion on major plants is at Council of Ministers level.  No agreement has been reached on what the levels should or should not be. Until they come to some sort of arrangement the question of a grant from the EC is not on.  They have not yet reached a conclusion on what the controls should be.  Collectively we have not agreed. Various countries have their own stand-points. We are endeavouring to hammer out a common policy for the Ten on emissions from heavy combustion plants and how they should be controlled.  There are serious cost implications, as the Deputy is aware, with regard to the price of electricity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>That could be used as a bargaining ploy across the table.  I would not like to say a grant will be forthcoming.  We will not be behind the door in looking for a grant if a grant is available.  The discussion has not reached that stage yet.  A common formula has not been found.  Different countries have different attitudes.  Some of the big industrial countries have pretty strong views on this matter.</P>

      <P>Obviously the Minister is not aware that a final agreement has been reached as and from January of this year.  That is why I raised this point.  I am sure the Minister is aware that a similar plant in Saxony in Germany was refused planning permission because it would have produced huge quantities of sulphur dioxide.  Bearing in mind the fact that Moneypoint is at an advanced stage, the Department should be seeking a grant for sulphur recovery.</P>

I believe that at the next meeting in March no conclusion will be reached.  It is an ongoing situation.</P>

      <P>Information of the kind referred to in the question is available only in relation to the deposition of sulphur (dry and wet).</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Data from the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (EMEP) for the period from October 1980 to May 1981 and from March 1982 to November 1982 in relation to estimated emissions and depositions of sulphur shows that during that period some 28 per cent of the total deposition of sulphur in Ireland resulted from sources in Ireland.  A further 30 per cent resulted from emissions in other EC countries; some 3 per cent resulted from emissions in non EC countries; and the source of 39 per cent of depositions was undetermined.  These <Col N="1478" /> estimates are based on computer models designed to predict transboundary fluxes and depositions of sulphur throughout Europe.  The work of updating sulphur emission inventories in the EMEP context is continuing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It would appear that we obtain a sizeable amount of Trans-local pollution in the country.  Should we not try to set an example to other European countries by not being seen as a country that would in effect subscribe to acid rain through prevailing winds to the Scandanavian countries and to Scotland?  That is my point in talking about the Money-point plant.  I ask the Minister to do all he can to ensure that emissions from that plant will not pollute other countries?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanShatter" hpid="Mr. Shatter Mr. Shatter">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Shatter</NameTxt>

The figures are: Belgium, 1.6 per cent, France, 4.7 per cent, West Germany, 3.1 per cent, Ireland, 28.1 per cent, the Netherlands, 1.6 per cent, the UK, 18.8 per cent and other countries not in the EC, 3.1 per cent.</P>

      <P>As mentioned in my reply to Questions Nos. 561 and 562 of 13 December 1984, various options for improving air quality generally are being examined by my Department in conjunction with the preparation of new air pollution legislation.  Among these options would be the possibility of incentives for the burning of clean fuels.</P>
      <P>Figures produced by the Department of Energy show that total national use of coal in the domestic sector, in thousand tonnes of oil equivalent, increased from 358 in 1976 to 688 in 1983.  It is estimated that coal consumption in Dublin in 1983 was about one-third of total national consumption and that the corresponding proportion of 1976 consumption would have been somewhat higher.  However, there is no detailed information available to support these estimates.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister, being a Dubliner living in the heart of the city, is aware that the air in the capital is appalling.  Would he not agree, given that medical evidence is available to support the fact that people are dying as a result of the quality of the air in Dublin, that rather than await a new Clean Air Act the Minister would take immediate steps to correct this matter by declaring Dublin a smoke free zone and give incentives to burn smokeless fuels?</P>

      <P>I am as concerned as the Deputy about pollution not only in Dublin but in all other large urban areas. I have asked my Department to inquire into the possibility of declaring smoke-free zones.  The cost may be astronomical. I have asked the Department to do a cost-benefit analysis and to let me know what the cost would be.  There is the <Col N="1480" /> incentive to use natural gas for heating purposes.  A number of measures taken together would give us what we want.  I have asked for all this information and I should have it before next winter so that we will be able to make decisions before the onset of winter.  The Clean Air Bill will enable us to declare smoke free zones.  I assure the Deputy that we are looking into this matter and I am hoping to have a decision as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>In view of the fact that capital cities throughout the world &mdash; I take London, 20 times the size of Dublin &mdash; are smoke free zones, would he commission a team from the Department to go to London or to Coventry to find out immediately how they declared their cities to be smoke free.  I believe it was done very quickly.  A similar operation was carried out in Detroit recently.  The Minister should set about that type of action immediately.  Will the Minister indicate if his Department's records show that any person was prosecuted for <Col N="1481" /> transgressing the 1970 Act dealing with atmospheric pollution?</P>

If officials consider it necessary to go to England or other centres, they will do so.  I want to get a cost analysis on this to make sure that whatever decision we take will be carried out rather than making bland statements declaring some areas smoke free without going into the cost of such action.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will give details of the principal components of toxic waste; the amount being dumped annually in this country; and if he will outline his plans for the future disposal of waste of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>Twenty-seven categories of toxic and dangerous waste are listed in EC Directive No. 78/319 of 20 March, 1978 on this subject.  This directive was given effect in this country by the European Communities (Toxic and Dangerous Waste) Regulations, 1982.  It defines toxic and dangerous waste as any waste containing or contaminated by these substances in such quantities or in such concentrations as to constitute a risk to health or the environment.</P>
      <P>Pending the completion of special waste plans by all of the local authorities designated in the regulations, precise information on the quantities of such toxic and dangerous wastes arising in Ireland and of the amounts being disposed of to landfill is not available.  However, the indications are that up to 70 per cent of the wastes are disposed of either by incineration or in-plant recovery and that most of the balance is exported, either for recovery or incineration, leaving some 5 per cent to be landfilled either here or abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national waste disposal strategy <Col N="1482" /> for problem wastes, which has already been well publicised, provides for the establishment of a central waste transfer station which will streamline export arrangments for producers of hazardous wastes that do not at present have satisfactory economic disposal outlets available to them.  It provides also for the development of a network of carefully designed and managed co-disposal sites at which industrial wastes suitable for landfill disposal can be safely disposed and for the vigourous enforcement by local authorities of the 1982 regulations on toxic and dangerous wastes.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that indiscriminate dumping of toxic waste is taking place throughout the country?  If the Minister is aware of that, is he in a position to give the House an idea of the extent of the dumping that cannot be accounted for?  Will the Minister agree that it is high time we set about establishing a national toxic waste dump rather than having dumping areas throughout the country?  If such a national toxic waste dump was established the Department would be in a position to keep a closer watch on what is going on.  Chemicals that are too hot to handle are being dumped indiscriminately by fly by night disposal people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not any hard evidence that large scale indiscriminate dumping is taking place.  If the Deputy has such evidence he should pass it on to me.  I can assure him that I will take appropriate action in the event of any offences.  We propose to have a toxic waste unit for the transfer of such waste. The whole question of disposing of it as one unit and having one disposal centre has not up to now been considered an economic proposition.  However, the matter is always kept under review.  If it is felt that it would be economically viable to establish such a centre we will do so. The need at present is for the establishing of a transfer or storage area.  We are looking at that and, hopefully, we will be seeking planning permission for one.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardBrady-DUB" hpid="Mr. G. Brady Mr. G. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the number of prosecutions that have taken place under the Litter Act, 1982; and if he intends to instruct local authorities to use their <Col N="1485" /> power to better effect to combat indiscriminate littering which is rapidly bringing this Act into disrepute in the eyes of the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FergusOBrien" hpid="Mr. F. O'Brien Mr. F. O'Brien">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. O'Brien</NameTxt>
      <P>The Litter Act, 1982, became law on 1 August 1982 and I understand that in the first two years of its operation 429 prosecutions for various offences under the Act were taken by local authorities.</P>
      <P>I have repeatedly urged local authorities to vigorously enforce the provisions of the Act and to utilise the strengthened statutory powers which the Act conferred on them to control and prevent litter. While I will continue to encourage them to intensify their efforts in this regard, I am nonetheless firmly convinced that success in dealing with the litter problem cannot be measured simply by reference to the number of prosecutions taken under the Act.  It is my view that the litter problem can only be solved by the wholehearted support and co-operation of the general public who must be made aware of the need to maintain and improve the cleanliness and quality of their own local environment.</P>
      <P>Under section 2 of the Act local authorities are empowered to take appropriate measures to prevent and overcome the harmful effects of litter in their functional areas and with this in mind I have promoted and encouraged local environment campaigns under which local communities are encouraged to improve their local environment with the active support of the local authority.</P>
      <P>I also intend to launch a special environmental awareness programme within the next few weeks which will aim at fostering at all levels of society a greater appreciation of environmental values and of the need for conservation of environmental resources.  Provision has been made in subhead U6 of my Department's Vote to finance the new programme this year.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister will agree that the Litter Act, 1982, has in effect fallen into disrepute despite the altruistic reply the Minister has given the <Col N="1486" /> House.  Would he not, as a matter of urgency, given the high level of young unemployed, seek means to instigate a litter corps composed of young people who will do this work very effectively, trying to educate people to counteract this problem?  The litter problem in Dublin has worsened, something like 45 tonnes of litter are removed from Dublin streets every day.</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply we have encouraged local environmental campaigns throughout the country and I have made available a sum of £100,000 to encourage and promote a better attitude towards a clean environment.  While legislation is a very good thing in itself, a better approach would be to educate the people, particularly young people.  The idea behind this approach is to give our young people a greater sense of responsibility towards preserving a good clean environment.  The money I am making available will help in this area.  I encourage local authorities to take the necessary steps to improve the environment and I am willing to listen to any suggestions.  I want to assure the Deputy of that because I am very concerned about this matter. If we do not have a clean environment this is a reflection on us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>Last week I spoke about the difficulties which the building industry would experience particularly in relation to the imposition of the extra 5 per cent VAT.  As it has transpired I do not need to say anything more about that because it has become a matter of widespread concern.  The Minister is still arguing about whether the increase will be £750 on a £30,000 house or £630.  It would appear as if the Revenue Commissioners have been carrying on a practice which differs from what the Minister has been saying in the House.  That is a matter which can be settled now.  If the Minister is correct it may well be that builders will be due a rebate of tax.  As far as the purchaser is concerned, it is clear that the net extra cost will be somewhere in the region of £630 to £750.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Building societies would need approximately ½ per cent per annum or £12 per <Col N="1595" /> month of an increase in mortgage rates to meet the increased tax being imposed on them.  I do not need to say anything more about that now because others have become aware of it.  The Minister will have to see what can be done to ease that burden.</P>
    <P>On 24 January this year, in a speech made by the Minister for the Environment on building societies, he said they were the major providers of mortgage finance and that their contribution had been one of the most important elements in the success of the housing programme over the years.  He pointed out that in 1984 they provided loans at least equal to and probably exceeding the £406 million of loans provided in 1983.  He said he would like to acknowledge the commendable restraint which the building societies had shown in relation to interest rates.  For showing such commendable restraint the Government imposed an extra ½ per cent tax on them.</P>
    <P>The more I look at the budget the more I realise it will result in widespread poverty and increased emigration.  The Government plan to export unemployment and throw away our trained and educated manpower.  The policy should be to encourage our young people to stay at home and sell abroad.  The Government's approach and that of some of our prominent businessmen has been to tell our youth to go abroad and find work, but I would say to them to stay here and sell abroad.  We need young people with ability to find new markets and we should support and encourage them to go out and do so.</P>
    <P>The family has been particularly badly hit by the Government's economic strategy. Families need jobs, reasonable living costs and adequate supports.  As far as jobs are concerned, the prospects are bleak.  The Government must be reeling from the increase in the end January unemployment figures.  From what we hear it seems as if there will be a further increase.  The 10 per cent increase in footwear costs is another blunder on the part of the Minister.  He does not realise how important this is to the family.  From <Col N="1596" /> the ages of 12 years onwards young people can go through shoes in three or four months.  The Minister must not realise that.  The family is being hit hard. The cost of fuel, clothes, housing and mortgages will all rise.</P>
    <P>One significant omission in the Minister's statement was any reference to children's allowance.  This has been reduced in real terms by 24 per cent or almost one quarter since Fianna Fáil left office.  The basis for that is the inflation rate in that period.  In 1982 the rate was £11.25 per child per month.  At that time we had just increased the rate from £6 and £9 to £11, an increase of 30 per cent.  We did that because the allowance was so small in comparison with our European partners. At the time Deputy Desmond, now Minister for Social Welfare, said it should be £11.25 a week and not £11.25 a month. No increase was given in 1983.  The allowance should have been increased to £16.13 in 1983 to take the 17 per cent inflation rate into account.  However, it was not increased at all.  In 1984 an increase of 7 per cent was given but it was delayed.  This is a delayed action Government.  As far as the poor are concerned everything is delayed action.  The miserable increase of £1 given in the fuel allowance has been delayed until October. However there is no delay when the Government are taking in money.</P>
    <P>In 1984 the Government gave an increase of 7 per cent but it was delayed until August.  The allowances were increased to £12.05 for the first five children. There is an increased rate for other children. That increase was given against an inflation rate of 10½ per cent.  It should have been £14.54.  For 1985 we have no increase in the children's allowance although we had an 8½ per cent increase in inflation.  To keep in line with inflation the children's allowance should be £15.78 instead of £12.05.  It is important that people realise that this is a major transfer of resources to families.  The present situation illustrates the way in which the Government are treating families.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism made a <Col N="1597" /> point about all that the Government have done, it was amusing to hear him go back to 1981 for his figures.  The Minister had to do that to show any real increase.  Ever since 1982 the poor have been losing in real terms and families in general have been losing.  It may be possible for the Minister to cod the public on radio and television with the assistance of his public relations team but when he comes into the House he must face the reality.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision of employment the prospects are bleak.  There were no prospects for real jobs in the budget. The Government should concentrate in the area of selling abroad.  The people who have gone abroad and set up markets for themselves are the people who get the least State assistance.  We should give more support in that area.  For instance we should use some of the youth employment money and transfer it to CTT so that they could train about 500 young people in overseas selling and then let them go abroad to see the markets and get on-the-job training so that they would come back in a position to assist in small business development here.  There is a great opportunity for the development of smaller businesses based on natural resources.  Many of the people who have set up small businesses here worked with CTT and got their experience overseas. A scheme such as I have suggested would have to be structured and we would have to be sure to get commitments from the people to be trained that they would work here afterwards for some time, but those are details that could be worked out if the principle were accepted.  It is a question of developing our expertise in one area in which we are most lacking.</P>
    <P>I have been very concerned about the direction of Government policy in relation to private business particularly in the area of the health services where the Minister for Health seems to want to centralise everything.  In our health services at the moment we have a mixture of State and private enterprise.  There is scope to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our health services and to provide much needed financial support. It is obvious that the Minister is <Col N="1598" /> trying to nationalise the health services to the maximum possible extent.  That can be seen from what is happening with the VHI who are being put under tremendous pressure because of the Minister's refusal to allow private hospital on grounds that were provided.  In relation to Beaumont Hospital, I as Minister provided to site for a private hospital alongside the public hospital but the Minister, Deputy Desmond, revoked that decision. There would have been very little cost to the State and there would have been many benefits to the public in having a private hospital on the same campus as the public hospital.  What is now happening is that the private hospital which was being developed in the south side of the city is attracting the consultants.  If the consultants are on the south side they will not be where the public hospital is, and all the things that we said would be likely to happen are now happening.  These things will continue to happen more and more because this Minister is suppressing the development of private enterprise in that area.</P>
    <P>During the last year the Irish Health Services Development Corporation was set up in recognition of the need to establish structurally strong Irish companies especially in the export area.</P>

      <P>This company was set up to add momentum to the existing public and private enterprise in this area.  I noticed recently that they managed to secure a contract in Saudi Arabia.  This was lauded in a newspaper article and in their newsletter of 11 January 1985.  A contract was in for £61 million to run this fine new hospital, and as the lowest bidder at £21.6 million, they won the contract.  The Minister for Finance should have a very close look at what is happening there.  It should not be our policy to sell our labour over-cheaply abroad just to turn up some figures.  I note that recruitment is taking place at the moment through this IHSDC and the recruitment is being done in competition with the other groups such as <Col N="1599" /> PARK, Irish Health Care, Irish Nursing Services and so on, who are already in that area.  One wonders why it is not possible to make use of these services when a contract has been developed.  It may well be that they have left themselves so tight on the contract price that this is not feasible.  This will have to be watched very closely.  It is a major area which has been developing a great deal in recent years and which is very welcome. The role and function of such bodies as this, set up by the NDC, would want to be studied very carefully.</P>
      <P>I said that the Minister made a major blunder as regards the building industry. As I understand it, at the moment house sales are suspended and the future looks bleak.  The Minister will have to rectify his mistake and repair the damage he has done.  At present there are 45,000 unemployed in the building industry.  The latest step can only lead to further unemployment. What we could foresee happening has now been admitted &mdash; the Minister's action has put a ½ per cent on to mortgage rates and his earlier borrowing policies forced the rate up another 1½ per cent.  This means that a 2 per cent increase is imminent.  The 1½ per cent increase may be temporary, but the ½ per cent increase is permanent.  The Minister should review his policy in that regard.</P>
      <P>We see in this budget no plan for creating real jobs or for the development of our natural resources and no hope for the unemployed.  These are this Coalition Government's forgotten people.  They have to suffer the increased costs of fuel, clothing and footwear and yet are getting only a 6 per cent increase, again put back to 1 July next.  That is the equivalent of 4 per cent for the rest of the year.  There is no increase in their children's allowances.</P>
      <P>In relation to the building industry in particular, the Minister should recognise and correct his blunder.  The interesting point is that now secondhand houses are not affected.  There is only a 4 per cent stamp duty on these, so their prices have improved by 6 per cent over the prices of new housing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1600" /> In the Justice area, I would be concerned about where the £28.6 million cuts will come.  There is to be a £30 million cut in the public service pay area.  This could affect the Garda with regard to overtime and availability.  I have learned that the Department Estimates were frozen yesterday while the Government work out further cutbacks.  The budget is very disappointing in relation to the objectives of employment creation and protection of the less well-off in these very difficult times.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I give this budget a very general welcome, not just because it deals with many specific problems articulated for some time by Members on both sides of this House, but because its clear approach is one of structural tax reform. One of my disappointments with the national plan was that it did not deal with tax reform at all, but this budget responds to that need.  The case for tax reform goes back a long time.  The late seventies saw huge masses protesting on the streets for reform of our tax system.  As a response to that, the Commission on Taxation were established and subsequently produced a number of reports, the first and third of which are the most significant. The first report is on direct taxation and the third on indirect spending taxation. This budget goes half-way towards meeting these two reports.  By rationalising six rates of income tax and six of VAT down to three in each case the way will be left open towards going the one further step opened up by the Commission on Taxation, that of having one rate of income tax and one of VAT.  The criteria laid down, of simplicity, equity and efficiency in our tax code, are now being met.  There will be greater efficiency from the point of view of the taxpayer, those in small businesses who have to do the tax collection, either for their employees or the business, and the Revenue authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Tax reform never has meant and never will mean tax reduction.  That is a misnomer. There were a number of significant reasons that this budget could not and should not have been a giveaway one.  First, 1985 is a particularly difficult <Col N="1601" /> year as regards the bulge in debt services, especially on foreign loans.  This was no year in which to embark upon a procedure of widening the Exchequer borrowing account to any great extent.  There are crucial economic problems because of our dependency ratio of 70 per cent, which is unique in western Europe.  One million of our people are at school and cannot produce anything.  One must also include all those dependent on social welfare, the elderly and so forth.  It is because of our unique dependency ratio that there was not room for manoeuvre.  In relation to the overall fiscal stance of this Government, the time is not yet ripe for a giveaway budget.</P>
    <P>Dealing specifically with tax reform, we have, first, income tax.  All taxpayers will benefit under present incomes.  Tax free allowances and tax bands have been improved and the rates have been reduced to 35, 48 and 60 per cent.  This will solve some of the problems resulting from the income tax code, the first of which is that we have one of the highest rates of absenteeism in Europe.  We saw the Travenol experience recently, with 20 per cent absenteeism.  We are half way towards solving the problem.  Why is absenteeism so prominent?  The principal underlying reason was the narrowness of the 35 per cent tax band, which means that it pays people in the last six to ten weeks of the tax year to leave work in order to get a tax rebate.  This budget has widened the 35 per cent band by 12½ per cent and will deal directly with the absenteeism problem.</P>
    <P>In terms of international trade we are talking about unit cost production and absenteeism costs money within those units.  It must be dealt with.  I agree totally with this Government's stance in relation to prior consideration being given to absenteeism records before any IDA grant aid is given.  Employers will not talk about absenteeism because if reflects poorly on their management performance.</P>
    <P>The second positive response in the income tax code is plugging of the brain drain.  In our work on the Committee on Small Businesses, we had access to a <Col N="1602" /> survey among the key technology personnel and key marketing and management personnel in a number of firms who had left this country and gone abroad.  The abolition of the 65 per cent tax band will be crucial in this regard.  I was recently at a conference hosted by the Confederation on Electronic Information.  One IDA representative at the conference said that he was recently in the United States and saw a particularly crucial technological engineering post vacancy.  Of the 28 applications, 12 were from Irish people.  There is an incredible rate of emigration of extremely mobile and skilled personnel that this country so badly needs.  It is hoped that the abolition of the top rate of tax will deal with that.  It will also deal with another huge problem. Whatever else about international statistics, the number of man days lost through strikes last year went up to 43,500.  That was a substantial increase and one of the reasons, in my view, was that in many firms there were pay disputes because any increase given by the employers meant so little increase in take-home pay.  It is perfectly reasonable that employees should be dissatisfied at that.  It is to be hoped that the modifications will also deal with that and that the more one earns the more one keeps.</P>
    <P>The general exemption limits being increased for the low paid are particularly welcome, as are the age exemption limits for old age pensioners many of whom have a contributory or retirement old age pension and a superannuation pension from their previous work place.  That will not now be taxed as severely as heretofore. These are modest changes but given the Minister's lack of room to manoeuvre they maximise its effect cost-wise in the best possible way.</P>
    <P>In relation to VAT, in the second report of the Joint Committee on Small Businesses we said that the six rates of VAT were untenable and unviable and that they should be rationalised into three.  I am particularly delighted that they have been so rationalised.  I might give those who have not worked in the retail sector an example.  If one is a draper and happens to sell household towels, <Col N="1603" /> sheets, sportwear, fur coats or other types of ordinary clothing, one had to complete forms in respect of five different rates of VAT, with every item sold being entered in a different column causing huge problems in regard to paperwork alone.  This will now be covered by a single rate of VAT for most of those items and, in the case of the remainder, 23 per cent which will eliminate a bugbear for many smaller retailers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the cross-Border situation we estimated &mdash; in our study of the black economy, when we had the Revenue Commissioners sitting on the benches opposite, and having heard their complacent attitude in regard to cross-Border trade &mdash; the losses to be of the order of £300 million in illegal and legal imports.  There is no doubt that the black hole through which those funds fell will become considerably smaller by the 50 per cent reduction in excise duties on televisions and by the reduction in the 35 per cent top rate of VAT.</P>
    <P>There were many capital goods and raw materials for industry subjected to VAT at 35 per cent which caused huge cash flow problems for companies, and delays in VAT rebates, which in turn meant unemployment was a factor in many of those companies purely because of cash flow considerations.  The overall effect of the changes in VAT rates is that the Minister is giving away £9.2 million, which is very modest.  Fianna Fáil naively put forward the point that the Minister will take in £122.6 million extra in VAT revenue next year and that he is giving nothing away.  If Fianna Fáil's basic understanding of arithmetic and net returns on volume sales is that poor, if they do not understand that £10 will buy one less now than £10 bought last year, or more importantly that it will take more than £10 to buy the same goods next year, they cannot base their criticism on that type of fictitious response.</P>
    <P>The retail sector of the electrical industry will benefit particularly from the effects of this budget.  The combined effects of these two areas of reform &mdash; income tax and VAT &mdash; will be such that <Col N="1604" /> first of all we shall have an increase in net disposable incomes for the first time in four years.  Net disposable incomes are due to rise by 1½ per cent to 2 per cent. Real incomes have dropped by 10 per cent over the last four years.  Generally speaking, everybody has had less money in his pocket and the real purchasing power of that money is less than it was ten years ago.  That trend will be reversed under the provisions of this budget.  The single greatest ingredient to the success and expansion of the service and retail sector is the amount of disposable incomes in circulation.  They will benefit greatly from this budget.  This budget will have a minimal effect on inflation, a quarter of one per cent, the lowest for many years, which will ensure that competitiveness is restored and the necessary climate for enterprise and expansion created.</P>
    <P>In those comments I have dealt with what is contained in the budget.  For the remainder of my contribution I shall deal with unemployment.  We have seen the figure this week of 234,000 constituting the biggest single social problem we have at present.  If one looks at the OECD figures of 31 million unemployed, or the EC figure of 13 million unemployed, one will realise that this problem is not unique to us.  I would be the last among politicians to hesitate to tell the truth about unemployment and the difficulties we have in relation to our young population.</P>
    <P>I should like to put forward some suggestions in relation to the creation of jobs and the possibilities therefor in our economy.  Before doing so I shall make two brief points.  One is that perhaps more beneficial to employment than anything in the budget was the announcement by the Minister for Energy of a 6 per cent reduction in ESB charges, being reduced to 2 per cent for smaller users. The second point is that, while there is an air of depression, a drop in morale and in confidence, the fact is that job losses in 1982 amounted to 38,800, in 1983 they dropped to 28,000 and last year to 17,400.  That is not good news but the bad news is less so and is abating.  There are 15,000 extra school leavers seeking <Col N="1605" /> jobs.  We have never had the type of employment creation record that can sustain that type of job record.  Changes in technology have a direct bearing on this. There is need for a new move in relation to employment creation policy.  When one speaks to the State's best experts in employment creation one foresees two difficulties.  The first is that years ago, through the IDA, we offered the best capital grant aid, 10 per cent corporation profits tax, and we were ahead of our competitors in attracting investment. Now the Welsh and Scottish development agencies are competing with 10 per cent corporation profits tax.  Given our peripheral location in Europe we find it particularly difficult to attract investment.  Fixed investment was down 2 per cent in 1984. Foreign investment in terms of manufacturing industry has been down in terms of new industry.  We must ask ourselves where have we gone wrong?  The fact is that our competitors have caught up with us and to get ahead of the posse again we must think up new policies.  That is the first difficulty I foresee.  The second difficulty I foresee is that in this industry, and perhaps within this Government, we have an ideological conflict between what is to be done about the future role of job creation.  Some people insist that it must be effected through greater State enterprise. Others insist on a total dependence on the private sector.  I believe that those two difficulties combined &mdash; the paralysis of other countries getting their act together in industrial development and the ideological conflict we have had &mdash; have resulted in a lack of progress.</P>
    <P>I should like to put forward this afternoon a new policy for job creation in relation to a third sector.  We talk about the private sector and the public sector. There is a third sector, the joint venture, partnership, sector between the State and industry, not based on any ideological conflict.  I should like to specify in some detail how I foresee this working.  There are three principal areas, firstly in relation to infrastructure and capital expenditure. There is the whole joint venture area in which I shall outline some detailed areas for job creation between the State <Col N="1606" /> and the private sector.  The second area is to be found among semi-State bodies &mdash; the losses and problems encountered there, their future and the role of partnership in that third sector.  Finally there is the National Development Corporation with new potential, opening up new opportunities, a way in which partnership between private enterprise and the public sector can be worked to create jobs.</P>
    <P>Firstly, I should like to turn to joint ventures.  If we take the £420 million allocated under the national plan for the roads plan and roads programme we will see there are on the table approximately six potential developments for toll facilities for roads.  We have seen already the East Link development.  I understand that at present there are detailed negotiations being finalised for the Navan-Lucan by-pass with a bridge across the Liffey, in respect of which planning problems must be overcome.  The East Link development speaks for itself.  The private sector having had the go-ahead from the State, incurred the necessary expenditure and, through their own company, recoup that expenditure through tolls. There is another area of joint venture there.  For example, take the town of Athlone or, say, Wexford.  Let us say there is a desperate need for a by-pass road around those towns.  If this was done on a toll basis it would be only 60 per cent viable.  What do we do in such circumstances? Do we wait until the State has all the money to construct that by-pass itself?  Do we neglect the possibility of tolls?</P>
    <P>There is a new formula which should be available under which the Wexford town by-pass would be 60 per cent viable and 40 per cent would be put up by the State.  It would be quite simple to work it up as a limited liability company.  The Government would put 40 per cent up front.  The rest would be put up by the contractor or developer and the percentage of the return on the tolls would be 60:40.  For every extra £100 million we generate in construction on infrastructures, you are also generating a 5 per cent growth in construction activities and 4,000 extra jobs.  I am putting forward <Col N="1607" /> formulae to get extra development without over-committing the State.</P>
    <P>I strongly welcome the three year roads plan, but there are additional needs.  Let us look at a third formula.  The Naas by-pass cost £18 million and it was almost unique in so far as it was brought in on time and on budget.  It was a success because they ran it like a business.  Kildare County Council were given responsibility as project managers.  They subcontracted out to the private sector elements of the work.  I am putting forward three proposals for joint venture in the roads infrastructural programme. The first is straightforward tolls.  The private sector builds them and gets all the receipts.  The second is that where only a proportion of it is viable, all the tolls will not pay for the total costs.  The State puts up a subvention in the first place and tries to recoup it.  It only puts up 40 per cent if it is 60 per cent viable.  Therefore you get more construction work for less State expenditure.  The third area is greater sub-contracting combined with the direct labour of the local authority through a sub-contracting mechanism.  Those three formulae will generate jobs in the construction sector.</P>
    <P>The partnership in housing for the third sector I would see as this.  At the moment we are building 6,500 local authority houses per annum.  The waiting list for local authority houses has remained at about 30,000.  This has meant that the number of new houses we are building is approximately commensurate with the number of new applicants.  At the same time the State has in its possession sites for 44,340 houses.  The land is owned by local authorities, owned by the taxpayers and suitable for building.  How can we build houses on that land without incurring extra State expenditure?  There is a formula in the third sector in the State's private enterprise partnership for this to be done.</P>
    <P>You would give land to the contractor to develop under five different strict terms of reference.  You would tell him in advance who the tenants would be. Funding would be arranged through the <Col N="1608" /> Housing Finance Agency loans scheme or the SDA loans.  He would be contracted to build houses specifically geared to those markets.  He could not sell the houses to somebody else.  The State has no up-front involvement and the contractor and the housing applicants would be able to do this.</P>
    <P>I suggest that up to at least one-third, or perhaps 20 per cent, of the 30,000 housing applicants could afford 100 per cent mortgage on the house.  The difficulty would be the deposit.  If the State arranged 100 per cent mortgages and got the private sector to develop the houses in housing schemes, we would get more jobs and more houses, and improve the standard of accommodation and not commit the Department of Finance to extra expenditure.  There is enormous potential for that.  We already have 11 projects.  We have one in Limerick.  We have one in Tipperary where they have been successful.  There is one in County Kilkenny.  They have worked on a very small scale.  They are working very extensively in the United Kingdom.  I see no reason why an extra 4,000 to 4,500 houses could not be built every year without committing the State to extra expenditure. That is a typical example of where the third sector can be used to generate wealth and create economic activity and jobs.</P>
    <P>The second area of partnership is that of the semi-State bodies.  I am speaking strictly about the commercial semi-State bodies.  I should like to say bluntly that the difficulty is the losses of semi-State bodies.  Irish Steel managed to lose more than their total turnover, which seems incredible.  The losses are appalling.  It is unfair to brand all semi-State bodies as inefficient, or poorly run, or inherently having many problems.  They are all different. They all have different loan charges. They are all set up under different Acts and under different company registrations, or whatever.</P>
    <P>If some of them come to the Government looking for money and their problem is that they have too much loan commitment and what they need is equity, the Government say: &ldquo;We are <Col N="1609" /> very sorry.  You have a great case but we have not got the money.&rdquo;  Therefore, political considerations can act to the detriment of the company's future and vice versa.  Then there could be a company which should be made insolvent because there is no possible future for them.  They are an albatross around the neck of the taxpayers.  For political reasons the Government will not take the necessary action.  Surely that is wrong. Surely that is not the way a State commercial sector should be run.  There is nothing wrong with a company being a State company. There is no reason why they cannot make profits.  There is no excuse for inefficiency in the name of the State.</P>
    <P>I suggest a number of formulae to strengthen the semi-State sector, to expand and sustain it, and to expand job creation.  If you look at a number of them you could float 25 per cent or less on the Stock Exchange.  This would give them the funds they require to strengthen their capital base.  If you want to be reasonable about it, in having a Stock Exchange flotation, a rights issue, or whatever, you could give first preference to the employees and you could limit any individual as to the number of shares he would have so that there would be no controlling stake in it.  Existing companies such as Irish Life and Aer Rianta would be very suitable for this.  I am not saying we should sell all the semi-State companies.  I am saying we should get money into them by raising money on the Stock Exchange without committing the Government to put money into them.</P>
    <P>For the second procedure let us take Aer Lingus.  I understand that in the eighties Aer Lingus will need somewhere in the region of £650 million to replace their trans-Atlantic and European fleet. The Government have not got £650 million. Aer Lingus have not got £650 million. This is a national airline.  It must be made competitive.  It could raise half that on loan capital, but after that there is an over-dependence on loan capital.  What needs to be done here?  Aer Lingus need capital.  If the KLM airline in Holland can sell 25 per cent of their airline to get capital and make sure they are efficient <Col N="1610" /> and have the latest technology, I do not see why Aer Lingus could not do that.</P>
    <P>The third formula would be a straight joint venture.  I understand discussions are taking place between ICI and NET. I totally endorse that.  NET's problem is that they are making a profit but they cannot pay off all the debts they ran up over the past decade.  We must inject £50 million of equity in the hope that we will get a return on the equity through a dividend instead of paying premium interest rates on loans.  I suggest a straight joint venture deal bringing a competitor into your business.</P>
    <P>The third area would be a direct sale of ancillary services.  An example, although not necessarily a correct one, would be to sell the Aer Lingus hotels to get money into the company.  We have a number of formulae.  I am not suggesting we should just flog off our semi-State sector but strengthen our semi-State sector which is grossly under-capitalised to give it a chance to make a profit, to secure the employment in it, and to give it a viable future.  That can only be done through a third sector of partnership between the private and the public sectors.</P>
    <P>The third area about which I have great concern relates to the National Development Corporation.  We have the sterile argument about the ideological conflict between the public and private sectors. We should bear in mind that we are giving grants which amount to £96,000 per job in certain factories.  I am not condemning it &mdash; there was an example of it in Greystones in the last month.  However, this must be examined because it is an enormous amount of money.  It is a non-repayable present.  In relation to larger industries, surely there is a question that must be asked on behalf of the taxpayer: is it better to give a non-repayable present than to take an equity stake in the company? I specifically request that when the NDC are being established the State should arrange to take a substantial stake, a minority one, in companies being established, and that the IDA when dealing with larger industries which they are trying to attract would draw up a formula <Col N="1611" /> whereby the State would take accumulative redeemable participating preference shares in those companies.</P>
    <P>The State would deal with multinationals and say it would put in 40 per cent of the equity: if the project was costing £100 million the State would put up £40 million &mdash; of course, the grant-in-aid is 45 per cent.  A moratorium would then be put on dividends so that for the first five or seven years dividends would not be taken by the State but after that, because the shares would be cumulative and preference, the owner of the private sector involved would have to pay preference dividends to the State.  That would be attractive to many companies and it would generate employment in certain crucial growth sectors that we so greatly desire.  It would give better quality projects, and this formula, which has been agreed by the CII and is before the Government, has not been tried in any other country.  If we want to compete for foreign investment and if we find other countries have caught up with us and our development agencies, we have got to try to go one step ahead.</P>
    <P>I should like to speak about job losses in our traditional industries and I will give the typical reasons for job losses in many sectors.  In the sixties there were voluntary quotas and we can take the flour industry as a simple example.  There were agreed percentage quotas, everything was nice and cosy, there were no imports and everyone got on fine.  We joined the EC in the early seventies, the competition started and imports began.  In the first 18 months the native producers cut their prices to compete with imports. They started to trade at a loss and they sustained losses for two years.  Then the losses became unsustainable and the industries went bankrupt.  That applied repeatedly in traditional industries. There was nothing wrong with the companies which were perfectly efficient, but they could not compete.</P>
    <P>It is in the national interest at this stage that we look at our traditional industries which have surplus capacity.  When they <Col N="1612" /> are in competition with imports, whatever price our industries sell at the price of imports will drop by 5 per cent or whatever because they are on marginal cost production.  In England they just put on a third shift but it takes us our total prime production costs to produce the goods.</P>
    <P>What will we do?  I suggest that we make a case to the EC whereby we, Belgium and the Greeks look for modest selective tariffs.  Since we joined the EC the rich countries have got richer and the poor have got poorer according to GNP and spending <i>per capita.</i>  Therefore, we must ask that there be selective tariffs on imported goods which we do not export and in which we have a genuine national interest.</P>
    <P>The best example I can give is our farming industry.  UK farmers have said that they can sell flour at a price 15 per cent lower than Irish farmers can produce it at.  They are selling flour at less than the price they charged two years ago.  We do not export any flour and therefore there must be a case, particularly when it is appreciated that we have the second highest unemployment rate in the EC, for saying to the EC: &ldquo;Your highly industrialised economies have gained on the backs of our poorer economies.&rdquo;  We are not suggesting that free trade is not good or that the principles of the EC are not what we agreed to, but selective medium tariffs should be introduced to protect our traditional industries.  It would not conflict with EC free trade policy, it would not conflict with our stated policy in relation to competition and of trying to obtain extra access in spite of technical trade barriers put up by the French and others, but it would take account of the fact that we are facing a damn bad year for agriculture and that the gloss has gone off the EC for Ireland.  The benefits which we thought would accrue have dried up considerably in real terms.</P>
    <P>We must tell the EC there are breaking points as far as Irish industry is concerned, particularly traditional industries which need to be protected, not by rewriting the Treaty of Rome but by putting up very selective, modest trade tariffs. <Col N="1613" /> The EC has population one and a half times the population of the US, yet the US GNP is more than one and a half times that of the EC.  We saw that the EC was not very clever in dealing with the oil crisis during the recession.  My suggestion would provide a way for small countires like Ireland, the Belgians and the Greeks to do something modest to help ourselves.</P>
    <P>I should like to make some points in relation to employment <i>vis-à-vis</i> the budget.  The budget will create jobs in the retail electronics industry.  I understand 5,000 jobs have been lost in relation to the sale of hi-fi equipment, televisions and so on and that 1,500 other jobs were in danger.  That position will be reversed because of the budget.  The provincial press were badly hit.  The <i>Wexford People</i> in my constituency had its employees on a three day week.  I should like to see the reduction in newspaper VAT extended to newspaper advertising.  Those involved in the production of toys, detergents and so on will all benefit by the VAT reduction and this will create jobs.  I understand there will be a particularly interesting provision in the Finance Bill in relation to multi-residential development which will benefit the construction industry. The £980 million provided in the budget for the construction industry will help employment there.  I understand that the business expansion scheme will be amended in the Finance Bill which will assist capital development in small companies. The unit trust legislation is to be amended so that the trusts can advertise for designated funds.</P>
    <P>Tourism receipts this year should hit the £1 billion mark and with the strength of the dollar the North American market looks very promising.  I hope tour operators and handlers will produce a package to get the optimum benefit from the changes in the budget, thereby ensuring that tourism earnings hit the £1 billion mark.  The Joint Committee on Small Businesses are preparing a report on tourism and, as chairman of that joint committee, I am aware of the difficulties of those involved in car rental, caravan and boat hiring businesses.  Car stocks <Col N="1614" /> have dropped to 5,500.  Boat hiring on the Shannon has run into enormous difficulties becase the German market has dried up.  The reduction to 10 per cent in the VAT rate will benefit those operators.</P>
    <P>The provision of £30 million for the social employment scheme and the creation of 10,000 part time jobs will help. Growth in manufacturing industry of the order of 3,000 to 5,000 extra jobs this year is another positive factor arising out of the budget.</P>
    <P>I should like to pinpoint some areas where more can be done about jobs and discuss the whole area of pay-related social insurance.  Employers' contributions under PRSI costs approximately 13 per cent.  That works out at 10 per cent of their operating surplus or profits.  However, if one looks at the labour intensive industries such as textiles or the construction sector, one will see that because they employ more people the employers' share of PRSI payment amounts to 40 per cent of their operating surplus.  The simple and logical conclusion that one can gain from that is the more one employs the more one pays.  That amounts to a tax on employment, a disincentive to employ more people.  Before a worker does a tap of work for an employer on a Monday morning he costs the employer £11.50 on average industrial earnings.  That is one of the inhibiting factors to job creation.</P>
    <P>I realise that what goes out on unemployment, disability and pay-related benefits is greater than what is collected under PRSI.  Genuinely there is a problem there for the Government but I should like to suggest some ways around this.  The Commission on Taxation recommended that there should be a percentage social security tax on everybody and that it would not be paid only by those good enough to recruit employees. They suggested that it be paid by everybody who is earning.  The suggestion was that those earning pay a 5 per cent social security tax, as happens in other countries such as the US, based on one's income. It may be said that 5 per cent is too low and that the figure should be 7 per cent <Col N="1615" /> but irrespective of the figure decided on it would not have the same effect on employment that PRSI has.  Where there are proven labour intensive industries there should be a halving to a figure in the region of 7½ per cent employer's PRSI. Surely it is wrong that 40 per cent of an employer's profits go on PRSI simply because he takes on more people.</P>
    <P>I suggest that PRSI be waived where apprentices are recruited.  They suffer enough in terms of labour market policies.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a number of selected measures taken to create jobs.  I should like to deal with the service sector first.  That sector is seen as a revenue earner and is penalised as such.  There is one benefit I should like to see passed on to the service sector which is directly related to job creation.  A manufacturing employer who takes on an extra worker gets relief of £10 per week for every extra employee taken on or £500 per year.  For every worker taken on in that sector the employer writes of his corporation tax bill a total of £500.  Why not extend that to the service sector which pays the higher rate of corporation tax?  In order to stimulate jobs I suggest that if there are base levels of employment statistics within a firm, like those that exist for the employment incentive scheme, the Government say to employers that for every extra person taken on their tax bill will be cut by £500.  That is a simple and effective method.</P>
    <P>The second area I should like to refer to &mdash; it does not have anything to do with employers &mdash; relates to job sharing.  We have spoken about the social employment scheme and have seen the developments for part time work, 40 hours work per fortnight, but I suggest that where people are prepared to consider splitting a job that the Government introduce a tax break.  I am thinking of the many people whom part time work would suit. I suggest that there be an increase in tax free allowances of 50 per cent for all those who split their jobs in an official job sharing programme.  The employer could submit to the tax authority a note to the <Col N="1616" /> effect that he had a job which he was permitting two employees to share.  The PRSI contribution class could be adjusted.  In return for that the take home pay of the person involved could be increased by increasing their tax free allowance by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>The third measure I should like to suggest relates to early retirement.  It is true to say that if on a once off basis the pension age is reduced from 66 years to 60 years at the stroke of a pen, but at great cost to the Department of Finance who may shudder at the thought, the Government would create 10,000 jobs.  I accept that it would be a once off gain. However, if people were given an inducement to retire early without having to cough up the pension such a suggestion would become more viable.  I understand that the Department of Finance have been saying that the reason the retirement age cannot be reduced to generate jobs is because it would be too costly in relation to pensions.  However, there are many people in good employment who have private insurance and pension plans within their companies.  I suggest that the age exemption tax limit which now stands at £3,000 for a single person and £6,000 for a married couple, be given to those who opt for early retirement after 55 years of age and do not obtain a pension. Such a worker having given 30 years service to the company may have an indexed linked pension of £180 per week but as things stand that pension would be taxable. The reason why many people with such conditions do not retire is because they may be entitled to a contributory pension from the Department of Social Welfare also but may lose it if they retire early.  I suggest that the age exemption limits that now apply to those over 65 years of age apply to those over 55 if they opt for early retirement.  That would stimulate jobs in the economy.  The remaining income of those involved could be treated in the same way as those in part time jobs or the self-employed.</P>
    <P>With regard to the 15,000 school leavers who seek jobs annually there is a fundamental need that they be taught <Col N="1617" /> self-help, entrepreneurship and enterprise. Career guidance teachers hand out pamphlets on how to get into the bank, sit interviews or pass examinations, but what about the most obvious opportunity that exists in a free society such as we have, the opportunity for self-employment? We need a once off stimulus to encourage people when they are young to think about being self-employed, being their own bosses.  The enterprise allowance scheme, and other schemes, are moving in this direction and why is it that the tax system does not move in that direction also?  I recommend that young people who leave school between 16 and 24 years and who become self-employed be exempt from schedule D income tax. Under that schedule the self-employed pay income tax on the current year's assessment.  I suggest that such young people go to their local friendly inspector of taxes and register as a self-employed person.  After that they would not pay tax until they reached 25.  From then on the tax authorities could catch up with them whether they are chimney sweeps, are operating creche facilities, a garage repair shop or in manufacturing industry. The important point is that the State recognises the value of people who look after themselves not by pushing them into the black economy but by exempting them from income tax.  This would be very cost effective and very reasonable.</P>
    <P>We see Ministers, members of the IDA and everybody else going abroad on trade missions, junkets or whatever to drum up business because we depend on a market led policy.  The crucial people involved are not rewarded.  There are double taxation agreements between all the economies with which these marketing executives work.  I suggest that marketing executives, tour operators and people who are trying to drum up business for this country who spend more than 90 days abroad on what is officially audited as market business would get a special once off free allowance of £2,000. This is not a perk for people who go abroad; it is simply a recognition of the crucial role these people play.  Because <Col N="1618" /> of the orders they obtain and the income they generate there will be a job spinoff in the manufacturing industries and the service sector.</P>
    <P>If we want to solve our balance of payments problems all we have to do is sell as much to West Germany as we do to the Dutch.  We sell £11 <i>per capita</i> of exports to the West Germans and £29 <i>per capita</i> to the Dutch.  If we sold as much to the Germans as we do to the Dutch we would generate an extra £1.1 billion. From Waterford Glass to the most basic textile product this is a very attainable possibility.</P>
    <P>This budget is very good for my constituency. Wexford is in the sunny southeast and tourism will benefit.  County Wexford has been selected as the pilot area for the social employment scheme and we are hoping to create 400 to 500 part time jobs in the near future.  Rosslare has received £632,000 in this budget &mdash; £500,000 for the development of the port for which we have been asking for a long time and £132,000 for lifeboat facilities. Payments to Rosslare this year and last year come to £1.017 million.  That is indicative of this Government's commitment to County Wexford.</P>
    <P>From the Government's perspective the Coalition budgets of July 1981 and January 1983 caught the Fianna Fáil runaway horse.  Some people said to me that this was a Fianna Fáil budget and I laughed.  It was alleged that because this budget was not hard on the people it was like a Fianna Fáil budget; but if we look at their last three budgets we see that their figures for the current budget deficits overran from 45 per cent, their best effort, to 80 per cent, their worst effort.  It would be very wrong to compare this budget with a Fianna Fáil budget because in terms of accuracy alone such comparison would be incredible.  The Coalition budgets of July 1981 and January 1983 caught the Fianna Fáil runaway horse but their 1984 budget was broadly neutral.  It was negative in relation to disposable incomes and increasing tax consumption in the economy.  This budget is the first step towards reforming the tax system and it will give a modest <Col N="1619" /> reflationary boost to income and volume sales at retail level.  If one were on the Continent looking at the Irish economy one would have to say that every economy indicator is going in the right direction. Output and exports are up, inflation is down and heading for the lowest level since the sixties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Growth in this economy is sustainable and is set at 2½ per cent of GDP, the best prediction I have seen this year.  Last year growth of 3 per cent of GDP was also excellent.  In terms of the macroeconomic situation, all the factors we inherited have greatly improved. Nineteen eighty five can be a year of opportunity.  Growth in the OECD countries will not be good this year but we will <Col N="1620" /> be slightly better in the EC because we are not dependent on growth in the American economy.  The single greatest problem facing most countries is unemployment. There are 31 million people unemployed in the OECD countries and 12½ million in the EC and these figures are projected to increase by one million each in 1985.  These are very complex problems and I have made a dozen suggestions where jobs can be created.</P>
      <P>We should recognise a third sector, partnership between the public and private sector.  Instead of giving grants we should combine the equity participation of both sectors.  I have suggested ways in which we can stimulate the economy with tax reliefs through selective tax reductions for job sharing, early retirement and employers' PRSI for recruitment.</P>

      <P>Do not worry about that. The outturn for this year will be quite satisfactory.  It is very easy to increase disposable income by 3 per cent simply by borrowing an extra £400 million or £500 million, but everything done in this budget was done within the constraints of the figures laid down in the national plan.  Unlike nearly all the economic experts who write in the Sunday papers, I am quite happy with this budget.  On the one hand, they were saying that this Government would not give the money for this, that or the other and, on the other, they had the audacity to say that this budget was introduced at the cost of killing the national plan, that the figures in the plan were not maintained and that figures for Exchequer borrowing requirements were not adhered to.  They cannot <Col N="1621" /> have it both ways.  They want more spending and less taxes, but you cannot do that.  It is about time people understood this because the public are willing to be misled on this matter because they think they would benefit.</P>
      <P>We have to make a decision on the right course for tuning the economy for 1985.  I believe that a broadly neutral stance on the current budget deficit is the correct procedure and there is a reduction from the opening deficit &mdash; £1,250 million to £1,234 million &mdash; in the budget.  That is the correct policy and I do not believe in the hypocrisy and double standards of many experts.  Dr. Whitaker used to refer to a one-armed economist who could not say &ldquo;on the other hand&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Government have laid down the conditions for enterprise and expansion through increased competitiveness and reduced cost of electricity and have stimulated certain sectors by greater investment, which has not been done by robbing Peter to pay Paul.  I support this budget and I have no doubt that when we come back this time next year or look at specific changes in the Finance Bill that the outturn and the policy decisions taken by the Government will have resulted in a higher than anticipated growth in GDP.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): It is obvious listening to Deputy Yates that he has been taken in by the propaganda of the Government in their public relations operation since the budget was introduced. I am reminded by his reference to commentators of the old saying: &ldquo;Everyone is out of step except my Johnny&rdquo;. Many of the contributors to whom he referred are eminent economists and eventually the real effects of the budget will dawn on Deputy Yates and also on the public.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This budget speech will go down in history because, for the first time, it was not written by the Minister for Finance or by any of his officials in Merrion Square.  It was written by the Government's public relations advisers. The devious thoughts of the national handlers run through the entire speech and between them they managed to <Col N="1622" /> convey the impression that the budget provisions were soft, that the tax burden was reduced, that VAT rates will yield more jobs and that the growth in foreign borrowing has been halted.  At first glance all these extravagant claims appears to be true and the national handlers coldly sowed this impression in the safe knowledge that first impressions are lasting.</P>
    <P>The national handlers conveniently forgot that the first rule of public relations is always to tell the truth, however it is coloured.  Shame on the national handlers for the presentation of this budget.  This is not a soft budget.  The tax burden has not been reduced, VAT rate changes will not yield any new jobs and the growth in foreign borrowing, far from being halted, has been increased.  How can this be labelled a soft budget when the Government's own figures show a substantial anticipated increase in PAYE take?  There will be fewer people at work, so from whose pocket will the extra revenue come?  Any marginal differences the adjustment in the tax bands will make will be more than wiped out by the additional taxes on such items as petrol, cigarettes, clothing and shoes.  How can this be termed a soft budget?</P>
    <P>Nobody can seriously criticise the abolition of the 35 per cent VAT rate.  It was a penal rate which was resented by all who were forced to pay it and it was introduced by the Government a couple of years ago.  However, to give the impression that VAT is being reduced is false because the Government's figures show substantial anticipated increases in the VAT take for the coming year in spite of the abolition of the 35 per cent rate. There were no banners proclaiming that there would be huge and significant increases in VAT on housing, the construction industry, car repairs, clothes, footwear and fuel.  Far from producing new jobs, VAT changes will add to the number of jobless.</P>
    <P>Ask the 370 employees of Clarks, Dundalk, what they think of a 10 per cent VAT rate on shoes which finally sealed their fate?  How many others will join them on the dole queues from the construction industry where VAT has been <Col N="1623" /> doubled?  How many will join them from the motor industry where VAT has been increased on repair bills and from the clothing industry where VAT has also been increased?  There is also an increase in taxation on petrol, road tax and employers' PRSI.  The net effect of those changes will probably be job losses and not job gains.</P>
    <P>Another sinister effect will be an increase in the volume of the black economy, especially in the motor repair industry, where the back street mechanics must be rubbing their hands with glee at the Government's decision to increase VAT on repairs.</P>
    <P>We are told that the rate of growth in foreign borrowing has been halted.  I suppose the national handlers believe that if it is said often enough it will be believed by the general public.  They have used that tactic time and time again to discredit Fianna Fáil and Deputy Haughey, the leader of this party.  They are using it again.  There has been no halt in foreign borrowing.  In fact it has increased and there are plans to increase it still further.  From a Government which pledged to cut out foreign borrowing during the last election and which vilified Fianna Fáil for their foreign borrowing that statement is not good enough.  It must also be remembered and should be placed on the record of the House that the Coalition Government of 1973-77 contributed most to creating our foreign debt.  For all the public relations presentations, this Coalition Government are no different from previous Coalition Governments.  They have presided over a record unemployment crisis.  They have decimated our industry and agriculture. They have brought the construction industry to its knees and have destroyed the confidence of the people.  There is nothing in the budget which will change that dismal picture.</P>
    <P>These are not my words.  I am not quoting from any of our daily or Sunday newspapers but from today's <i>The Wall Street Journal.</i>  It states:</P>
    <P>Far be it from this newspaper to <Col N="1624" /> argue against tax breaks for multinational business.  We've long argued that the best way to develop a nation is to tear down barriers governments put in the way of business.  But tax breaks for big business aren't going to help if they are denied to the average citizen.  Yet this is exactly the misguided policy now being pursued in Ireland by the government of Garret FitzGerald.</P>
    <P>When a government sets out to woo foreign investors, what it wants is jobs for its people.  But how much is gained from having these jobs if the government uses exorbitant income taxes to grab two-thirds of everything an individual earns over, say, $10,000?  Consider how the Irish worker must feel after scratching away for his measly net income....</P>
    <P>After all, the Irishman cannot take his wages out of the country if he manages to save enough and wants to find a more attractive place to invest his money.  Nor does he enjoy any of the benefits available to the foreign companies unless he is in manufacturing or one of the government's other approved activities.  If he is a domestic businessman, he is stuck with the normal corporate tax rate of 50 per cent.  Not only that, but he pays the punitive marginal rates of personal income tax as high as 60 per cent under the new budget, as well as higher prices for all goods resulting from Ireland's excessive VAT and excise tax.</P>
    <P>If the people who are barely getting by after what the government takes out of their earnings feel something is wrong, those out of work are understandably more bitter.  That Ireland's unemployment is so high &mdash; 17.5 per cent &mdash; ought not come as a surprise. The greatest source of new jobs has always been small businesses....  What this says bluntly is that the government's great success in bringing big business to Ireland has not been a success for Ireland's people....</P>
    <P>That is an impartial view of this budget and was not written by any of our daily or Sunday newspaper commentators.  It is a true picture of the position here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1625" /> Severe increases in the budget will result in increased farm production costs thereby reducing the prospects of farm profitability in 1985.  The only reference to farming made by the Minister in the budget was to double the take of tax from farming.  Once again this Government, who are Dublin based and whose thoughts are purely Dublin, have left agricultural development to Brussels. With the record of this Government in Brussels and particularly the record of the Minister for Agriculture the prospects are not encouraging.</P>
    <P>In order to compensate for this negative budget farmers would need a substantial increase from Brussels this year. This would need to be in the region of 4p per gallon in the price of milk and a substantial increase in beef prices.  It is anticipated that as a result of the budget farm income will drop by something in the region of 6 per cent in real terms in 1985.  The main architect of this reversal of farm incomes is the Minister for Agriculture. His legacy to farmers in the past year and in 1983 can be seen in the increase in the number of farmers in financial difficulties.</P>
    <P>The intervention payment system resulted in £200 million being taken out of farming last year.  The recent increase in interest rates will add a further £25 million to farmers' costs.  This is a direct result of increased Government borrowing on the domestic market.  The continued undermining of Irish agriculture has devastated confidence and accelerated the drift from the land.  The Government are destroying any prospect of people living on farms and will ultimately destabilise rural society to the detriment of the nation.  I call on the Minister for Agriculture and the Taoiseach to reverse their recent decisions as regards the farm package.  Speaking on radio on the night of the budget the Minister for Agriculture stated that the farm rescue package, involving 6,500 farmers in financial difficulties, was being discontinued from March this year.  This important decision was obviously deliberately omitted from the Budget Statement.</P>
    <P>Will the Taoiseach say specifically what <Col N="1626" /> saving in Government expenditure will result from this decision to discontinue the farm rescue package?  This reduced interest subsidy scheme was introduced by Fianna Fáil some years ago to enable more farmers to regain economic viability. The Government have underspent the original allocation of this scheme by at least £11 million.  Instead of discontinuing it this scheme should be extended.  In view of the under-spending it would not cost the Exchequer additional funds this year.  Farmers will face a most difficult year in 1985.  By extending the scheme the Minister will display some willingness on the Government's part to restore farmer confidence.  This scheme has helped farmers to get back on the rails. It is vital to extend it to ensure the survival of farmers and to enable them to reach profitability in 1985.  If this Government abolish the scheme, this party on returning to Government are committed to the extension of this rescue package. The scheme has been a success and farming organisations are clamouring for its restoration.  I appeal to the Minister and to the Taoiseach to ensure that this rescue package is continued beyond the end of March.</P>
    <P>There was no reference in the Minister's budget speech to disease eradication. Some time ago I outlined a ten point plan for the eradication of bovine TB in particular.  The Government in their recent plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, gave the impression that they were the only people who were seriously concerned at the progress of our TB eradication scheme. Nobody is more disturbed by this lack of progress than the farmers.  Not only do they contribute indirectly to the cost of this scheme but they also contribute directly in milk and livestock levies. These levies are now to be doubled and farmers will be more critical than ever about how this programme is being managed. There are dangers in imposing levies for specific purposes.  At first glance they look small; £3.80 seems to be a small levy on the price of a bullock but it can be a very substantial proportion of the profit on that animal.  In relation to the milk levy, where a farmer's livelihood <Col N="1627" /> is threatened by disease in his herd the levy on milk production can be an enormous burden.  The ten point plan which I outlined shows how disease can be eradicated over a short period.  In that plan I outlined many areas to be tackled but we need the leadership of the Minister in regard to disease eradication.  The Minister needs to bring together the veterinary surgeons, the farmers, the Department and all interests concerned. The Minister's present approach is a coercive approach.  I appeal to the Minister before it is too late, before we have a repetition of what happened in 1974-1975 under a previous Coalition Government when disease eradication was set back for many years, to compromise and I appeal to the IVU who are in dispute with the Minister to compromise so that both sides can reach agreement as quickly as possible. If they do not do so it is the farmer who will be the meat in the sandwich. We do not want a repetition of what happened before.</P>
    <P>The recent plan promoted by the Government has only paid lip service to the four year plan produced by this party when in Government.  We have an opportunity to plan for the development of the agricultural sector.  The Minister said that this year's budget was designed to bring us towards the objectives set out in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i>  That plan said that the main emphasis in increasing agricultural production would be in the cattle and beef sectors.  The plan said that sheep, tillage and crop production would also offer good prospects for expansion.  Even if there was a slight ray of hope for the agricultural sector as a whole in the document, <i>Building on Reality</i>, the latest budget has shattered any illusion.  The prospects of the agricultural industry for 1985 are not good.  On the basis of the resources available no increase in output can be expected.  The major components of the farming industry, milk, beef and tillage, were handicapped in different ways.  First, milk production is stifled as a result of the penal super-levy allowed to be imposed by the Minister for Agriculture.  We <Col N="1628" /> had no way of increasing cattle output this year because sadly, cattle stocks at the end of 1984 showed a fall.  Our national beef cow herd has reached an all time low in numbers.  Last year's abnormal cereal yields per acre could not be expected to be repeated in the current year.  Statistics indicate also that there will be a reduction in output from the pig sector.  At the same time farmers' costs, notably for fertilisers, have already risen significantly.  As a result all objective commentators can see no hope of increase in Irish farm incomes in 1985 or, indeed, in the years immediately following.</P>
    <P>Let us now examine the impact of the budget on the agricultural scene.  I am sorry to say that it brings no joy.  Firstly, I do not deplore in any way, but rather welcome, the increased income tax benefits generally bestowed.  However, these have little influence on farm welfare. I look forward to the day when as many farmers as possible will have incomes sufficiently high to bring them into the income tax net.  Regrettably, that stage has not been reached and only approximately one-third of our farmers will gain any benefit from the revised income tax regulations.  We must remember that the remaining two-thirds will be lumbered with the land tax.</P>
    <P>According to the Minister for Finance farmers taxation will be the subject of legislation soon.  The Government's stupid, stubborn attitude about this tax is simply amazing.  Everybody has told them that this is both inequitable and impractical, but nevertheless they persist. I understand that the latest voice in that respect is that of the NESC who have labelled it undesirable, inappropriate and having no regard whatever to the person's ability to pay.  Continued insistence on this penal levy is both demoralising and discouraging.  For young farmers, in particular, it is a very heavy price to pay for the continuation of Labour in Government.</P>
    <P>We have grown weary listening to repeated promises from this Government of an elightened land policy and repeated statements over the years since 1982. <Col N="1629" /> Yet, two years down the road, what have we?  Nothing in so far as land policy is concerned.  Notwithstanding the promises made by the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, over the last two years, nothing has emerged.  What has emerged is the abolition of the Land Commission which body promoted, to a certain extent, land policy over the years.</P>
    <P>The latest crumb from this table is what is referred to in this budget as an incentive for land leasing &mdash; the proposal for exemption from income tax on the first £2,000 of leasing income by a lessor over 55 years of age, which lease must be for at least seven years.  It is insulting to the intelligence of young farmers of today to suggest that this measure will promote the long term leasing of land by persons unable to work it to its proper potential. It is a disgrace and an utter insult to the farming community.  I deplore this attitude on the part of the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>I welcome the retention of the stamp duty exemption in respect of the transfer of land to young, trained farmers.  That is nothing new, I might add.  This innovation, this original thinking was introduced by a Fianna Fáil Government and &mdash; I must give credit where credit is due &mdash; thankfully, the Minister is continuing that exemption.  I welcome also tax exemption on stallion fees.  This will be of benefit to our bloodstock industry.</P>
    <P>The good aspects of this budget are, indeed, very limited.  More disastrous situations arise in agricultural development as a result of the budget.  I deplore the doubling of the VAT rate on certain agricultural contracting services.  The depression in agriculture generally has reduced the overall demand for contractors in recent times.  Suspension of the farm modernisation scheme two years ago by the Minister for Finance has hit them hard.  In addition, high interest rates and depreciation costs have placed a number of contractors in financial difficulty. This latest measure will further lessen the availability of contractors, in particular for silage cutting, but also for cereal harvesting.  In other words, the approach by the Government will hit the <Col N="1630" /> smaller and less well-off section of our farming community.  These farmers in the disadvantaged areas are not in a position to purchase machinery of their own, but must depend on contracting services.  The charges for these services will be increased because of the VAT being imposed.</P>
    <P>I have said previously in the House, and repeat, that a car is an essential element of a farmer's normal living.  The raising of the road tax will further add to his costs, as will the doubling of tax on tractors and excavators.  I wonder what other areas this Government will hit as far as the agricultural sector are concerned. They have suspended the farm modernisation scheme, have abolished the calf-heifer scheme, the lime and AI subsidies and the retirement scheme.  I could go on and on.  They are reducing the budgetary contribution to agricultural development.</P>
    <P>All these schemes were introduced by Fianna Fáil, or indeed won by Fianna Fáil at the negotiating table in Brussels. These have been totally abolished with immense loss to our farmers.  But that is half the story only.  Those schemes are of immense loss to our economy because the money emanating therefrom was availed of and spent locally.  Our economy is suffering from the reckless attitude of this Government to the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>As if these increased burdens did not constitute a sufficient blow to agriculture the latest announcement from Brussels has deepened the gloom still further &mdash; an increase of 2.5 per cent in milk with the continuance of the super-levy and its quota implications, a freeze in beef prices and in the price of pigmeat, sheepmeat, sugar beet and a reduction of 6.3 per cent in cereal prices, almost incredible to Irish ears.</P>
    <P>The calf premium won originally with great difficulty by Fianna Fáil is to be eliminated.  The Minister for Agriculture said the other day that the rescue package is to be terminated.  All of those schemes were introduced by Fianna Fáil to help the most productive sector of this economy, the agricultural industry, which <Col N="1631" /> forms the very base of our economy and is responsible for upwards of 50 per cent of total exports when one considers its net import content which directly and indirectly is responsible for the employment 50 per cent of our workforce.</P>
    <P>One must ask what is the attitude of this Government to this important sector. Are we to see it deprived of funds, of any leadership by this Government and by the Minister for Agriculture?  Is there any light to be seen at the end of the tunnel, particularly for our small farmers so dependent on our land for a living? Speaking about circumstances in Brussels, at times one cannot but feel sorry for the Minister for Agriculture.  He has allowed circumstances develop which will bring no comfort to the farmer, his family or to the mass of our people dependent on agriculture and increased output from the land and from our food factories.</P>
    <P>Our industry with greatest potential is being crushed by this Government.  Have the pious hopes of <i>Building on Reality</i> been dumped overboard from the ship of State?  The national plan stated that the main emphasis on agricultural production would be in the cattle and beef sectors, which sectors received nothing but disincentives in the budget.  The saddest element of all of this is that we have the capacity substantially to increase beef output were our producers only given the right encouragement to expand.</P>
    <P>If remedial steps are not taken now it could prove to be too late in a few years time.  If European production continues to rise we could face a similar situation in the beef sector as we face now in the dairying sector.</P>
    <P>Before our agricultural sector and its development enters a no-end situation, with no leadership and no hope for the future, I hope this Government will realise the consequences of their approach.  I hope Government backbenchers representing rural areas, who must be receiving this message at meetings day in day out, will see that reason prevails in this Government with regard to their approach to the most productive sector of our economy.  I hope such backbenchers <Col N="1632" /> will ensure that there is leadership, guidance given with, above all, the necessary financial incentives before our agricultural industry reaches the brink of economic ruin.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Each year this House adopts the same procedure of discussing the budget just introduced, the vast majority of Members contributing not having participated in any way in its preparation. Speaking from these back benches I must confess I did not have very much input into its preparation.  However, I believe the wisdom and concern of those involved in its preparation is infinitely greater than that which could be provided by the Opposition.  Therefore I shall vote for the provisions of this budget, support the Government who introduced it and, taking into account all of the circumstances in which they found themselves, recognise that it was a rather clever piece of work.  I say that in all seriousness because it went a long way to balance the conflicting influences that affect Governments when they set out on this exercise.  Nevertheless, I shall not say I am completely happy with all of the provisions of this budget or that I believe it to be the absolute answer to our present economic needs, because I do not, or that there are not contained in it some adverse factors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most contributors seem to deal with the question of what the Government should do, contending that the Government should pay money here or there, that they should readjust their takings, with all the time the emphasis being placed on the fact that Government, through direct action, have within their capacity the resolution of the problems obtaining within our economy.  I do not believe that.  On the contrary, if the Government were to withdraw from certain of their activities then it might have the sort of effect many people think would come about through Government action only.  As the interference of Government in every aspect of our lives and affairs has increased over the years, with the proliferation of new laws, the employment of additional civil servants <Col N="1633" /> etc., it has become more and more difficult for the ordinary citizen to supervise their affairs, generate wealth for themselves and directly enjoy the benefits of their work.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people will tell the Government what they ought to do but, to some extent, I will concentrate on telling them what they should not do.  It is evident that real standards of living have dropped by 8 per cent to 10 per cent in the past seven years.  This happened not because we failed to produce economic growth, but for two reasons.  One is that we had a population increase and therefore we have to distribute the wealth we produce among a greater number of people.  Secondly, we borrowed so much money that we now have to deduct a certain sum from our GNP to pay it back. We must ensure that in our society a terrible imbalance is not created by the problem of unemployment.  In absolute terms the number of unemployed continues to increase.  The problem affects more and more families in every sector of our society.  We have not solved the problem and we cannot say in the short term that the problem will be solved.  We are all trying to suggest ways in which the problem can be solved.</P>
    <P>Various proposals have been put forward. The reduction in income tax will have a marginal effect.  It will increase the incentive to work.  Others are more expert on the question of taxation than I am.  It is a very popular subject in the press.  In the region I represent the readjustment in VAT rates is very acceptable to the traders.  It will reduce their paper work.  It will also restore the confidence of the traders and business people in the Border areas.  They are being given an opportunity to compete on an equal and a fair basis with their competitors on the other side of the Border.  They do not want any unfair advantage over their competitors in the Six County area.  A system of taxation should never have been allowed to develop which deprived them of their right to compete on an equal <Col N="1634" /> basis.  We are very grateful to the Minister for Finance for what he has done. Before we got relief in the form of reduced VAT we had lost a considerable amount of our competitiveness through the devaluation of sterling, but that is another story.</P>
    <P>The penetration of our markets by foreign industrialists seems to have stabilised. Some years ago Irish manufacturers supplied 80 per cent of the domestic market.  They now supply 60 per cent.  We are very grateful to our manufacturing sector for the manner in which they met the challenge of unemployment through increased exports.  This was done by recently established capital intensive industries which we attracted from abroad rather than by older Irish industries.</P>
    <P>There is a temptation for politicians and people in the media to suggest that we should impose tariffs.  This is almost a reflex reaction when considering the problem of competition from foreign industrialists.  People suggest that we should prevent them from selling into our markets.  Nothing could be more misguided. I am not absolutely sure but I think it was an editorial in <i>The Irish Times</i> which suggested that as a solution to the problem.  My friend and colleague, Deputy Yates, suggested that might be a short term solution.  The introduction of any sort of protection policy would not be short term.  It is a bit like smoking pot.  It becomes habit forming.  Most industrialised nations try to do this and perhaps they get away with it in the short term.</P>
    <P>It was estimated recently that because of the public procurement policy of the member states of the EC, the European taxpayer is forced to pay £40 billion in taxes.  In other words, if there is free competition the public procurement sector buy their goods more cheaply but the European taxpayer has less subsidisation. People who propose that we should not allow manufactured goods of foreign origin to come into our markets must realise that they are also proposing that we should pay a higher price for similar goods manufactured here, or that we <Col N="1635" /> should buy similar goods of a lower quality at the same price.  We have to recognise that we must provide viable employment on the basis of competition.</P>
    <P>It has become very popular recently to quote the EC as the source of policies which force us to compete.  Most people forget that for many years before we joined the EC we had concluded a free trade agreement with Britain.  Britain was a much more powerful industrial nation and had a more competitive economy than they have today.  Mr. Lemass was Taoiseach at the time that agreement was negotiated.  We recognised that there was no future for the Irish industry unless we created a manufacturing industrial sector which could compete with the best.  Equally we were prepared to offer our products in competition with them on their markets.</P>
    <P>In return for that free trade agreement with Britain we had not got the benefit of any common agricultural policy.  There was no intervention.  There were no guaranteed prices for our agricultural produce. There was no regional fund.  There was no social fund.  Yet we undertook to compete because we saw that as the only solution.  It is not fair and it is probably an oversight by most people to cite EC rules against the idea of protecting our industries through some type of protectionist measures, protection barriers or tariffs.</P>
    <P>We claim we have lost 50,000 jobs as a result of this competition since we joined the EEC.  That is not true.  We lost the jobs through free trade, a policy we accepted long before we joined the EEC. Jobs have been lost in the same sectors in Japan, in ship building and in textiles, which is a declining industry, as is footwear.  If we had maintained the textile industry we had in Ireland in those days and if we were still to employ the same numbers, we would have to pay very low wages or sell very dear goods. It is no argument against free trade to say we have lost those jobs to the industrial nations of Europe, because if we look at our balance of trade we will see we have favourable balances with every nation <Col N="1636" /> except the British with whom we had the original free trade agreement.  If free trade has been the cause of job losses we must remember that our trade balance with Britain in 1983 was £1,200 million.</P>
    <P>Of course we should look again and ask ourselves what has created the problems so seriously affecting the job prospects of our young people.  It has become extremely popular in the US to speak about their success in getting 20 million new jobs at a time when we were losing them.  Some of the facts behind this are not being looked at by most observers. The US, Japan and Austria have managed to maintain and increase employment since the oil crisis.  Indeed, they are the only three countries, with Switzerland, who succeeded in creating more jobs since the oil crisis which precipitated the economic recession.  In the US in the last ten years they have had the same economic growth rate as we had in the EC, but there they have had work sharing and they had less capital investment.  We produced more with fewer workers than they did in the US.</P>
    <P>Some years ago we decided national wage agreements were the thing.  It was thought to be in the interest of industrial peace that we would sit down at the beginning of a year and hammer out pay agreements.  More and more that permeated through the private employment and the services sectors.  Everybody expected a wage increase every year, people expected security in employment and we had legislation to that effect. People were to be compensated by pay-related benefits if they lost their jobs.  If their jobs made money they would get a good income, if they did not make money people got good incomes and if jobs did not exist those people still got money. That is part of what happened in the last ten or 15 years, and it caused a considerable part of our present difficulties.  We appreciate that we have larger families and consequently more young people coming on the labour market every year. Instead of telling our people that they would have improved standards of living we should have told them they would have to make the necessary sacrifices and <Col N="1637" /> investment to resolve the problems facing our young people.  We refused to do that in general election after general election and gave policies that would be more acceptable to the electorate.  There were promises that life would be made better and merrier for everybody regardless of who paid.</P>
    <P>Another problem is the size of our interest rates and this is probably militating more against the development of industry and agriculture and the service industry than any other factor that I can identify.  By comparison with our European competitors we have had interest rates of 16 per cent to 19 per cent.  Most of the people who pay that type of interest rate are not those embarking on the development of projects in manufacturing or services but those who need money in order to keep an existing project afloat. Generally, they are the people who are prepared to pay high rates because no experienced businessman who has carried out research and made projections can borrow money on the Irish market for investment.  The top 50 companies here last year had a return in the region of 7½ per cent on capital.  The average indigenous Irish manufacturing industry had a return of something in the region of 4 per cent and yet in order to get money to invest such people must pay between 15 and 19 per cent.  As long as such high rates continue to apply investment will not take place.  Manufacturing industrial investment will only take place if the promoters believe they will get sufficient and generous grant aid from the IDA and that the amount of money they will have to invest will be a small percentage of the capital required.  That is why costs are being pushed so high and why the cost to the IDA of investment in manufacturing industry is so high.</P>
    <P>At times one wonders whether the investment rate of £50,000 per job &mdash; some people calculate that on the basis of the final outturn in the employment that will be created that figure can be as high as £90,000 &mdash; can be justified. However, one thing that is certain is that an industry or project that is not grant aided cannot be got off the ground by a <Col N="1638" /> person who is expecting to get a return on the capital invested.  Why is it that our interest rates are so high?  I find it hard to understand that.  Admittedly our inflation rate is higher than in competitive economies.  We take great credit for having brought it down but it is still 4 per cent higher than the rate of our average European competitor last year.  We may take credit for having brought it down but we cannot be complacent about it because as long as it is higher than our trading competitors not only have we to carry the burden of disadvantages of the difference in the rates of inflation but we must also face the fact that it is getting worse all the time.  We have not solved the problem of our inflation rate and at the same time we must compete with countries like Holland, Germany, Luxembourg and Britain where interest rates are 7 or 8 per cent lower than ours.  In France and Belgium interest rates are between 4 and 5 per cent lower than ours. That means that industrialists in those countries can be satisfied with a lower return on their capital.</P>
    <P>The last thing a person with money should consider doing if he or she is interested in getting a return on it is to put it into manufacturing industry or agriculture. They will not get the sort of return by investing it in those industries that they would get if they deposited their money with a building society, a savings bank or put it on short term deposit with one of the commercial banks.  As long as that position remains we will have the people with money taking money from those who make an effort.  The conservative people who have saved, inherited wealth, or been fortunate can live at the expense of those who invest their money, the people of enterprise and those who have acquired the knowledge to manufacture. The latter must forever work for those who have the capital.  The power in the Irish economy is in the hands of those who have capital.  Such people can prey on those seeking to get involved in productive enterprises which create employment and wealth.  That has been brought about by the fact that the State is overspending.  It is leaving very little <Col N="1639" /> money available for the private sector and with competition in the market the price goes up.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that nothing can be done about this.  There are two solutions to the problem.  The first is that we borrow abroad but is it wise to borrow abroad?  Surely it is better to borrow abroad for investment in selected projects which will give a return on capital than for the Government to raise money on the home market thereby making it scarce.  That deprives the manufacturing and agricultural sectors of any possibility of investing and getting a reasonable return.  If we must spend on social welfare, education and other areas of public expenditure it is better that we borrow abroad than not make the investment.  At present we are preventing people from making an investment because of the interest rates that prevail.</P>
    <P>If we have a system of exchange control why do we allow interest rates to go up? Do they rise because financial institutions compete with each other for limited funds?  Part of the problem is that the financial institutions, and the Government, are competing with each other for limited funds on the Irish market.  If the Government imposed a limit &mdash; they have imposed a price control on many things &mdash; what would the result be?  Would there be a flight of foreign capital from the country?  I do not think so.  Under our system of exchange control we pretend that we can control the amount of money coming in and going out of the country and why is it not possible to impose the other control and make it possible to have money available at low rates of interest? As long as interest rates remain high Irish enterprise will be totally dependent on the handouts from the State, the IDA grants, subsidised training schemes and the other schemes the State is providing to stimulate the development of industrial development.</P>
    <P>We have created those problems through a policy of spending excessively on the public sector.  If we had the type of economy which allowed the labour market to work we would not have unemployment <Col N="1640" /> to the same extent that we have it today. We think we can insulate the labour market, the individuals who are looking for work, from the effects of supply and demand in that area.  Over the years we have sought to guarantee the levels of income regardless of the world economic position and of the number of people looking for work.  If we had a more flexible labour market policy labour would become cheaper and Irish industry would become more competitive.  Our exports would increase and more jobs would become available.  The problem would correct itself but we seek to correct all these things by Government interference which leads to a worse position. Nobody quarrels with the concern by all Governments for those without jobs and nobody questions the need to pay benefits but I question the wisdom and success of policies which seek to resolve by direct Government action all our problems and seek to manipulate down to the last nail in the economy everything we do.  It will not work because every interference at Government level creates another reaction.</P>
    <P>Every subsidy given to one sector is money taken from another sector.  Every pound provided to create a job in industry is a pound less spent in another area.  We never seem to take into account the social and economic consequences of the money we collect or, if we borrow, that we must collect money to repay the loan.</P>
    <P>What can we do about unemployment? We should work progressively towards a freer economy.  Every Member who proposes a grant, subsidy or incentive should be obliged to say where that money would be raised or what item should be cut so that this subsidy could be paid.  In the European Parliament if we propose an amendment to the budget we are required to write on the opposite page where we propose to find the money.  The sooner we introduce a system like that the better.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke a lot about agriculture and decried the failure of this budget to resolve the problems.  I acknowledge that this budget has not done very much to resolve the problems <Col N="1641" /> facing agriculture and I have already identified a very important reason, that is, interest rates.  Farmers can no longer afford to invest in the purchase of land, equipment, livestock or farmyard development at today's interest rates.  There can be no further development in agriculture until interest rates come back to a level at which it will be possible for farmers to repay their loans.  As I said, in so far as this Government had to borrow a little more this year than they borrowed last year, this budget will put the agricultural industry at a relative disadvantage but that is a minor consideration.  The future of our agricultural industry is less in the hands of the Government than it used to be.  That is not to say that this industry would be any safer or that farmers' incomes would by any higher if it were in the hands of the Government.  I would like assistance to be given to farmers who have invested in their farms to help them to survive.</P>
    <P>There is a misconception abroad that our farmers borrowed heavily to purchase land but I do not accept that that is true.  Our farmers borrowed to carry out developments in the more intensive sectors, such as dairying, pigs and intensive beef production.  As was pointed out in reports on the development of the EC just published, Irish farmers borrowed in the years when interest rates were about to increase &mdash; in 1977, 1978 and 1979 &mdash; when inflation was at its highest and when costs were increasing rapidly.  It is not true that Irish agriculture is over-borrowed. The most competitive agricultural industry in the Community is the Netherlands. The indebtedness of the agricultural industry in the Netherlands is 89 per cent compared with 4 per cent for Irish farmers, the lowest in the Community. Irish agriculture is not over-borrowed but because of our interest rates our leading producers are over-borrowed and the costs of their input have risen 12 times faster than they have in the Netherlands over the last seven years.  For all those reasons I agree with Deputy Noonan that it would have been desirable for some provision to have been made for this industry, but this is something we will <Col N="1642" /> have to pursue with the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>Looking at the picture as it stands, we cannot hold out the prospect of increased incomes for our farmers in the year ahead.  The Commission is making proposals that price adjustments will have a neutral effect.  Considering that last year was a favourable season, we can hardly expect to get any increased reduction this year.  If the present proposals were accepted by the Council of Ministers Irish agricultural incomes would drop by at least 3 per cent to 4 per cent in the coming year.  This is totally unacceptable considering that this would bring our farmers' incomes to 66 per cent of what they were in real terms in 1977.  We have an obligation in this House as well as in the Commission and the Council of Europe to consider very seriously the plight our agricultural industry will find itself in.</P>
    <P>It is not easy to identify how this problem can be resolved.  Deputy Noonan did not make one proposal as to how the position of our farmers could be improved.  He spoke about the lime subsidy, the calf subsidy and so on, but they all amount to a very small sum.  These schemes were not abolished by the Government but they ceased to exist because the European Economic Commission did not propose that these schemes should continue.  Until the Commission makes such a proposal, the Council of Ministers cannot adopt it and this Government cannot reintroduce these schemes.  Even if this Government were to reintroduce these schemes and to finance them fully, the sums involved would be marginal to the farmers' income.  The problem is much wider than that.  It is the problem of increased costs, the indebtedness of a small number of progressive farmers and the price of products which we are depending on the Community to fix.  Deputy Noonan seems to think that the Minister for Agriculture can get an increased milk quota for us.  I should like to remind the Deputy when he complains that milk production last year was pegged at 4.6 per cent that in the last year Fianna Fáil were in office we did not have any increase in milk <Col N="1643" /> production and nobody was holding us back at that stage.  Had our milk production increased that year by the amount it increased last year, we would be considerably better off today and the agricultural industry would have a guaranteed price for that amount of milk in the forseeable future.  We cannot and should not dismiss the problems of agriculture at European level as something dreamed up by the Commission and the Council to disadvantage Irish farmers.</P>
    <P>When things get bad we tend to look to the county council because they are the nearest administrative body.  If the county council cannot solve the problem, we go to the health board.  If that does not work, we send a deputation to the Dáil and if they cannot solve the problem we say somebody in Brussels will.  The solution is to demand that somebody in Brussels solve the problem.  It is very easy for the Irish politician to blame Brussels for many of our failures but successes are chalked up to the home politicians.</P>
    <P>More and more I hear Europe being blamed for the economic difficulties facing the country.  We have to look at this situation in the overall context.  The Central Bank estimated last year that we had £7,400 million net benefit from our involvement in the Community.  We paid in roughly £1,500 million.  We received £7,400 million, £300 million of which came from the Social Fund, £100 million from the Regional Fund and the rest from the agricultural schemes.  If Irish agricultural incomes were between £800 million and £1,000 million, you could say that half of that money came from the EC. What would Irish agricultural incomes have been like last year if we had to sell our milk and beef in world markets? When we boast about the deals we made in Libya, the beef we sold to Canada and the Middle East, or the dairy products we sold to Japan, we always neglect to state the amount of European subsidies involved in making such deals possible. The price which the Irish farmer gets is always mentioned but European export refunds are never mentioned.  If we were not a member of the EC, our agricultural <Col N="1644" /> incomes would be reduced to such an extent that there would be no profit in the production of any commodity which our climate is capable of producing.</P>
    <P>We have relied entirely on continuing demands for price increases around the table in Brussels as a solution to the problems of Irish agriculture.  As long as we rely entirely on price increases, those increases will make the strong stronger and richer and widen the gap between the large scale, more competitive producers of beef, particularly in Holland where farming is very efficient, and in Britain where farms are very large.  The gap between their incomes and those of the average Irish farmer will get wider and wider.  We will break the European budget 99 times over before we close the gap between Irish agricultural incomes and those of our competitors.</P>
    <P>Our problems cannot be solved in the way in which Deputy Noonan suggested, through our own national budgetary process. We should put more emphasis on structural aids which would involve raising a greater sum of money in our own budget for the matching of funds which we should try to negotiate from Brussels for farm development schemes, drainage of land, improvement of buildings, livestock and breeding schemes, educational facilities for farmers and for new and alternative land uses.</P>
    <P>We must also seriously consider the whole question of afforestation and the integration of a better tourist industry into agriculture.  We should mould our agricultural environment to accommodate an important element of tourism in the years ahead.  Through all these schemes we could attract money from the EC.  If you look at our takings of total agricultural spending last year, we got something like 3½ per cent.  In the constituency which I represent farmers got only 20 per cent of that money.  Nevertheless, we succeeded in getting 7 per cent from regional spending and 11 per cent from social spending.  One could say that if we negotiated all agricultural spending in favour of regional and social spending, Ireland would gain £1,000 million automatically. We should not ignore that <Col N="1645" /> aspect of our involvement in Europe and we should not resist automatically, as we always do, control of agricultural spending in favour of Regional and Social Funds.  I know that in these areas there will be a demand for the provision of matching funds which will have to be raised in our own budget and we regret that the money that comes to the Regional Fund not only fails to come to the regions in greatest need but that it is not spent on schemes genuinely designed to avail of that money, especially as increased taxation is raised in Ireland to match it so that the fund is spent as originally intended.</P>
    <P>With regard to social welfare, Deputy Yates correctly pointed out how the readjustments to the tax bands will make it less attractive for people to be unemployed for short periods.  Our social welfare schemes should be looked at.  I have been involved in local government for many years and I have seen the workings of the social welfare system.  The purpose of a social welfare system should be to prevent people who cannot get jobs or are unable to work, from suffering undue deprivation or hardship.  If we use the social welfare system to ensure that those who do not have work can enjoy a standard of living equal to that of the employed, it is expecting an awful lot of human nature to think that people will impose upon themselves the discipline of getting up every morning and striving to produce goods or services every day.  If it is as attractive to be unemployed as to be employed, people will probably chose the freedom to do what they want to do, even if it is non-productive.</P>
    <P>I favour a simplification of the system. There are far too many schemes in existence. There are people who retire from the public service with a pension; they may also have a contributory old age pension, have property or investments and carry on a business.  I do not think it is the duty of the State to support these people by taking money from them when they are employed to give them security in their old age.  Social Welfare schemes should be used solely for the purpose of protecting the weak and needy.  A person <Col N="1646" /> should have the right to decide whether he will provide for his old age.  People going into employment are forced, from the first day, to make a contribution towards the day when they may be unemployed or ill.  The employee may never live to enjoy those benefits.  He or she should be entitled to make arrangements with private insurance companies to provide for old age.  Taxation is one thing but compulsory contributions towards schemes is a deprivation of freedom and is unnecessary.  We should reduce the number of schemes.  We have widow's contributory and non-contributory, disability and disablement benefit schemes and one would need a computer to keep track of them all.  Schemes overlap one another, are complementary to one another and dovetail into each other.  We need a more straightforward way of helping people who are disadvantaged at any time.</P>
    <P>I remember a time when people in a county council office knew every applicant in the county.  I could ask for a file and would be told all about the case.  If one goes into a social welfare office today and does not have code numbers and so on it would take weeks to get a reply. Health boards should operate these schemes in each area.</P>
    <P>This was a very clever budget introduced by a Minister who knows that the people are not yet ready to make the kind of sacrifices which are required if we are to solve the problem of unemployment and repay our national debt in the short term rather than pass it on to the next generation.  The Minister did the best he could in the circumstances and has helped to lift the depression felt by citizens in the last few months.  Politicians have failed to get across the simple message that we must live within our means without at the same time giving the impression that there is no hope.</P>
    <P>Our foreign debt is £7,000 million and we produce something like three times that amount.  I do not think that repayment of a figure equivalent to one third of our total production in one year is a crushing or insurmountable figure.  We all agree that our foreign debt must be <Col N="1647" /> reduced and that we will not be able to solve our unemployment problem or create a competitive industrial sector if we increase our foreign debt.  What is frightening is that even though we are all agreed that the foreign debt must not be increased we do not seem to be able to stop increasing it.  If we settle down to making regular repayments, what will be involved is a small proportion of our GNP.  However, if we have futher borrowing the position will be aggravated for farmers and industrialists because interest rates will be pushed up and the problem will be left for resolution at another time.  There is no guarantee that we will not face another recession.  There is every possibility that the US dollar will start to lose its value in years to come.  This will cause problems for our manufacturing and agricultural sectors.</P>
    <P>I have spoken about the difficulties of agriculture.  There is only one way we can give the agricultural sector increased incomes this year.  I should like to hear suggestions from anyone who thinks it can be done without forcing the EC to borrow money to pay us, which they have no intention of doing.  The only possibility we have of improving the position of farmers this year is by devaluing our currency. In the last few weeks we have revalued our currency against the British currency.  We conduct 37 per cent of our trade with them.  Devaluation is justified when we consider our rate of inflation and that of our trading competitors.  It will make it a little more difficult to repay our foreign debt but if we devalue our currency by 5 per cent it would be a small price to pay for making our agriculture and industry more competitive and for helping to improve the balance of payments. Therein lies the only real prospect of improving the position for exporters, industrialists and those involved in agriculture in the coming year.</P>

      <P>The arithmetic that went to make up this budget was suspect from the beginning but it was blown sky high two days later when the unemployment figure for January was given as <Col N="1648" /> 234,000.  When we consider that the budget is based on an average unemployment figure for the year of 217,000 and that at the end of the first month that figure is wrong by 17,000, not taking into account the many closures that have been announced, one can see how far out the figures are for the various services that go to make up unemployment payments.</P>
      <P>There are many other figures that must be questioned closely.  The buoyancy figure has been given as £58 million, the highest ever introduced in a budget.  It is four times higher than the figure for 1984. A new figure has been introduced which the Taoiseach refused to explain this afternoon.  Expenditure savings on pay is £30 million but on &ldquo;others&rdquo; it is £28.6 million.  Are these further cuts in the health services, education, local authority areas or does it represent a raid on AnCO, cut from £41.25 million to £40 million, a raid on the Youth Employment Agency, the work experience programme or the Department of the Environment temporary employment schemes?  There is no extra money for education but are we facing a £7 million cut in education?</P>
      <P>There is a substantial figure of £50 million for departmental savings.  We must question that.  There is a figure of £28 million extra tax revenue from building societies.  Is that the tax revenue which has contributed to the threat by those societies to increase interest rates for mortgage repayments by 2 per cent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I said, the arithmetic of the budget was suspect at the beginning.  One week later it is incorrect.  VAT on footwear was introduced on the second attempt on a day when 350 jobs were lost in a long-established footwear factory in Dundalk.  The building industry was crucified.  Although already on its knees VAT was increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  Unless the Minister for Finance as a result of yesterday's and today's discussions with the Construction Industry Federation decides in his wisdom to do a U-turn, as he must in the interest of jobs and <Col N="1649" /> employment, then he has dealt the building industry a death blow from which it cannot recover.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Prevention of Terrorism Act in its provisions and in its implementation as clearly discriminatory against Irish citizens and being in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, and calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to seek the repeal of this legislation and to insist, in accordance with normal diplomatic practice elsewhere, that the Irish Embassy in London be immediately notified of any arrests of Irish citizens made under this Act.</P>
      <P>You may ask, as it is the basis of the Minister's amendment, whether Dáil Éireann is entitled to condemn a piece of British legislation.  The only reason Dáil Éireann is even discussing the issue is that it is legislation directed against Irish citizens travelling between here and Britain and at Irish citizens living in Britain and in Northern Ireland.  We in Ireland have a responsibility towards our citizens living in another country or jurisdiction. Governments everywhere see it as their duty to protest when their citizens suffer harassment, victimisation or discrimination in another country simply because of their nationality.  Dáil Éireann has every right to condemn legislation anywhere directed against Irish citizens.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must point out in passing that the British Government and Parliament have never felt inhibited about criticising any of our laws or even our Constitution. They have repeatedly condemned our laws on extradition and they have even asked us to remove sections of our Constitution which state that the national territory comprises the whole of Ireland. <Col N="1650" /> For both these reasons the Minister is not justified in seeking to prevent this House from condemning a piece of British legislation that discriminates against Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>Indeed, it is a matter of regret that the Minister and the Government whenever an issue of this kind comes up, while purporting to criticise abuses or, to use a phrase in the amendment &ldquo;possibilities of abuse&rdquo;, nonetheless tend to defend the basic principles behind repressive legislation and security practices.  In his amendment the Minister criticises possibilities of abuse, application and irregular practices. He does not condemn the Act itself. In this House last autumn the Minister fudged the supergrass issue.  He has fudged the plastic bullets issue, leaving the case against them go by default in a UN sub-committee in the summer of 1983.  Earlier this month he fudged the UDR issue and now he wants to go on fudging the Prevention of Terrorism Act. He is seeking to make sure that any criticism ventilated in this House is rendered harmless.  No wonder Mr. Hurd takes a benign view of the Minister's statements. They are always couched in a qualified way that does not actually require the British authorities to do anything.</P>
    <P>It is a wonder that the Minister, following his meeting yesterday, had the audacity to refer to his Clonmel speech of last November, one of the least convincing speeches of his entire career, in which he tried dishonestly to claim that the Irish people saw behind the Press conference of Mrs. Thatcher's &ldquo;real and unprecedented movement on the British side&rdquo; at the Chequers meeting.  Indeed, the people saw real and unprecedented movement in the wrong direction.  The Clonmel <i>Nationalist</i> called that speech &ldquo;a defence of the indefensible&rdquo; and totally inappropriate to a Chamber of Commerce meeting.  Yesterday the Minister was enthusing about the role Mrs. Thatcher had in mind for the Irish Government.  The spirit of deference is obviously alive and well.  No doubt the Minister was given the benefit of Mr. Hurd's advice on how best to reply to this debate, and no doubt we will hear all the <Col N="1651" /> worthless and meaningless assurances he has been given.</P>
    <P>It would seem that Anglo-Irish relations take precedence over the civil rights of Irish citizens.  The clear message that the British Government are receiving in relation to all these issues is that the Irish Government will go to any lengths to avoid attacking the root cause of Nationalist alienation while making a great fuss and show, principally for domestic consumption, about individual incidents. This sort of sham nationalism is absolutely transparent both to the British Government and to the Nationalist community in the North.</P>
    <P>Everyone in this House abhors violence in all its forms.  This is well known and it has been stated clearly in the report of the New Ireland Forum.  There can be no doubt in anybody's mind about this issue.  There are occasions when special legislation is required, but that legislation must nonetheless respect basic civil rights.  The British Prevention of Terrorism Act was hasty legislation rushed through in response to a particular atrocity. In the opinion of many people it was a political rather than a security response to the situation.  There has long been serious concern about the validity of some of the convictions arising from the Birmingham bombings, a matter which has been raised on a humanitarian basis by Cardinal Ó Fiaich and the Department of Foreign Affairs among others.</P>
    <P>The political atmosphere of the time was not conducive to cool, rational decisions about either real security needs or the protection of civil rights.  It was with some amusement that I heard the Minister say a few weeks ago &ldquo;I hope we never have to introduce such legislation whereby people can vanish from the streets for 48 hours&rdquo;.  Of course, the irony is that the Coalition, in which the Minister was a member of the Government at that time, brought in an exactly similar Bill in 1976, the Emergency Provisions Bill, which was in this respect a carbon copy of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and the Minister voted for it.  Fianna Fáil on return to Government in 1977, in which <Col N="1652" /> I was Minister for Justice, repealed that section.  We are discussing this motion in a somewhat similar atmosphere two months after the Brighton bombings which have been condemned clearly by all parties in this House.  There is no evidence that the Act which has been in force for ten years has prevented such acts of violence which we all deplore. Can anyone suggest seriously that there is any lack of legislation in Britain to deal with acts of violence or apprehending terrorists?</P>
    <P>The principal features of the Act are the power to exclude persons from Great Britain on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activity and to hold people for up to seven days for questioning without right of access to a solicitor or to one's family.  Further, there was a provision which made it an offence to possess information which may be of material assistance in preventing acts of terrorism or apprehending persons so involved and not to pass it on to the authorities.  This clause interferes seriously with the freedom of the Press and, I understand, has been repealed.</P>
    <P>By allowing the authorities to detain persons for up to seven days without trial, there is no safeguard against unlawful detention or against abusive interrogation practices.  Secondly, the Act permits detention for the purposes of questioning, and at ports and airports this can be done on a random basis without even any requirement to justify a reasonable suspicion of involvement in terrorism. The power of exclusion is entirely arbitrary and can be applied without any evidence or justification needing to be produced and there is no appeal.  The exclusion order, which is regarded as a breach of human rights and as contrary to the European Convention, is in effect a power of exile, more usually associated with totalitarian countries.</P>
    <P>We are not here primarily discussing the operation of the Act in Northern Ireland, but it is a part of what Dáil Éireann discussed last November in relation to the supergrass system.  It allows uncorroborated confessions, including <Col N="1653" /> the use of informers, to be used in evidence in one-judge courts.  Only a very small proportion of those arrested have been charged under the Act and an even smaller number have been found guilty. Of 5,683 people arrested between November 1974 and September 1983 only 2½ per cent, or in numbers 137, were charged and only 9 per cent of those charged were found guilty.  Not one person has been found guilty of murder and only four persons were found guilty of attempted murder or conspiracy to murder.  These statistics have been supplied by the Irish Information Partnership.  While some 70 people have been convicted of possessing firearms and explosives offences, nobody has suggested that such offences could not be prosecuted except for this Act.  It is important to note that 95 per cent were totally innocent.  In Northern Ireland the percentage is even lower.</P>
    <P>There can be little doubt that the Act is being used largely for purposes of questioning and of harassment.  Withholding information is in itself an offence under the Act.  I would remind Deputies that Members of this House and even a former Minister for Foreign Affairs have been held under the Act, which gives some idea of the indiscriminate use made of the Act.</P>
    <P>There was an attempt, in breach of the common travel area, to introduce a landing card requirement.  This card, issued to Irish citizens, states that it is issued under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, which can only mean that the authorities regard every person issued with one as a potential terrorist.  The information is computerised and means that a large section of the Irish population in Britain is on police files.  Deputy David Andrews publicly protested about this, and the practice has been curtailed.</P>
    <P>Reports have appeared in the newspapers of detainees being ill-treated in detention, and of being subjected to threats. Crew members of the B &amp; I have been picked out and detained several days in succession on a random basis. The former British Labour spokesman in Northern Ireland Mr. Clive Soley, MP, <Col N="1654" /> has said and I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of January 4, 1985:</P>
    <P>Perfectly law-abiding people have been dragged in under the Act, held for days without any contact with their families.... In my opinion this Act creates a serious problem of people's democratic rights.</P>
    <P>There has been a suggestion that some of the recent arrests, are politically motivated. The circumstances that a number of those arrested have a public profile, and indeed were campaigning against the Prevention of Terrorism Act and for a reopening of the cases of the Birmingham Six, is surely a cause of some disquiet. Even should the case against some of those arrested fail, they will have been out of circulation for some time.  It has been pointed out that political activists in the Irish community are most likely to be picked up.</P>
    <P>Our Embassy in London has been unjustly criticised for its role during the last month.  I am sure the Embassy does its best within the limits of Government policy.  The Embassy will do what it is told to do by the Government.  To the extent that there is any dissatisfaction with official reaction to these events, it should be directed at the Government.</P>
    <P>We have asked, and we ask again, that the Irish Embassy be informed immediately of all detentions under the Act, so that it can provide an effective consular service.  This is the routine practice in virtually every other country.  We believe also that detainees should be allowed access to solicitors and that their families be informed.  However, this is not enough.  The Act itself must be condemned straightaway.</P>
    <P>The Minister has been subjected to severe criticism for his manner of defending the Act in the last few weeks.  His remarks have been used gleefully to defend the Act by right wing Tory spokesmen, such as Peter Utley of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, who quoted the Minister's statement that the Act was not being used to harass the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1655" /> The secretary of the Irish Bishops Episcopal Commission also criticised the Minister. The <i>Irish News</i> severely criticised the Minister.  Indeed, I should like to quote from their editorial, as the <i>Irish News</i> is generally regarded as a very moderate voice of Nationalist opinion in the North. I quote:</P>
    <P>Another Minister talking nonsense can be found in the Republic where the man in charge of foreign affairs has explained his stance towards Britain's Prevention of Terrorism Act.</P>
    <P>This is the Act under which about 6,000 people have been arrested.  Only some 150 have ever been charged &mdash; that is less than two per cent.</P>
    <P>The Minister, Deputy Peter Barry, apparently, is satisfied the Act is now being used more responsibly.  He bases his satisfaction on the claim that the level of detentions under the PTA has dropped from 1,000 a year last decade to 100 a year now.  God help those 100 because the Republic's Minister for Foreign Affairs, with complacent attitude, certainly will not.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barry said he would &ldquo;stand up and defend&rdquo; any Irish people harassed under the PTA.  Deputy Barry, you should have stood up years ago.  Mr. Douglas Hurd, on the other hand, praised the Minister for his measured words. It is easy to see from the Government's amendment why.  The Minister's amendment to our motion expresses deep concern at the possibilities of abuse of some of the provisions and their application, but all that it actually deplores is denial of access to a solicitor and information to families.  It is obvious that the word in our motion that sticks in the Minister's gullet is the word &ldquo;condemn&rdquo;.  Have we now reached the stage where we are afraid to condemn what the British Government are doing to our citizens in Britain?</P>
    <P>If peace is to come to these islands, it is essential that pieces of legislation that only fuel a sense of grievance and of alienation must be repealed.  We should say this clearly and without hesitation to <Col N="1656" /> the British Government and parliament in the knowledge that there are many members of that parliament who would express themselves in even stronger terms than we would.  How can we expect British MPs to succeed in repealing legislation that impinges on the rights of Irish citizens if our Minister for Foreign Affairs indicates that he is now much happier with the Act?  Let us give a clear signal here tonight and give encouragement to the friends of Ireland in the British parliament and assist their efforts, instead of fudging our signals as the Government by their amendment wish us to do.</P>
    <P>Many in the Government parties carry their liberalism on their sleeves.  Many of them have expressed concern about the basic rights of oppressed peoples in far off countries.  They have no option but to support our motion.</P>
    <P>I wish to allow Deputy Liam Fitzgerald use the remainder of my time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L. Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>The Act we are calling on the Government to condemn is one that was introduced in 1974 in the wake of the Birmingham bombings, at a time when tensions in Britain were high and when there had been a number of fatalities and serious casualties.  It was a time when perhaps reasoning was not as sound as it might be ordinarily though there is never very much reasoning in Britain in the matter of Anglo-Irish affairs.  This has been the experience not only for some decades but for centuries. However, at that time of very high tensions in 1974 serious measures were introduced under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  The Act gave extremely wide ranging powers to the police in Britain to take on the Irish situation in that country.  In conjunction with other powers that were coming on stream in Northern Ireland then, under what was to be known as the Emergency Powers Act, the legislation was to break down the machinery of any kind of political resistance to a situation in Northern Ireland that was regarded as totally unacceptable, unreal, unworkable and most illogical.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is only fair to say that at the time of <Col N="1657" /> its introduction there could have been some justification for the British seriously believing that this kind of wide ranging legislation, giving widely extended powers, frightening powers in many respects because of the obvious implications for civil rights and for basic human rights in Britain, was necessary.</P>
    <P>If the House has regard to the fundamental elements of the Act it can appreciate more clearly what I am saying. Basically, the Act can be divided into three elements.  First, there is the right of the Home Secretary to proscribe certain organisations, an aspect that has been used widely but selectively in the case of members of the Irish community. Without going into great detail, a quick glance at the situation that pertains in Britain under the Prevention of Terrorism Act <i>vis-à-vis</i> that which obtains under the Emergency Powers Act in Northern Ireland seems to indicate a greater balance in Northern Ireland to the extent that Britain has ignored a number of organisations on the Protestant side in Northern Ireland, that would seem to me to be more deserving of prohibition than some of those on the national side that they have so willingly proscribed.  I do not attempt to justify violence but the selective manner in which certain sections of this Act are being applied gives a clear picture as to the way the Act is being directed against the nationalist people.  These exclusion orders have been used widely in rather dubious circumstances. There is a wide arbitrary dimension in this Act which gives rise to abuse and which has caused doubts as to how the Act is being applied.</P>
    <P>A basic element of this Act is where the Home Secretary has the right to deport those suspected of being involved in terrorist activities from Britain.  Another aspect that impinges on Irish people travelling to Britain and indeed on Irish people in Britain is the right of the police to arrest a person suspected of terrorism and to detain him for 48 hours on their own authority and for a further five days with the approval of the Home Secretary. This aspect is particularly worrying because of the arbitrary manner in which <Col N="1658" /> it is applied.  In addition police have the right, with the approval of the Home Secretary, to arrest suspects at a port or an airport and detain them for up to seven days.  When this legislation was introduced in the wake of the Birmingham bombings, many people felt its wide-ranging powers were needed but people have since seen the folly of that action.  British Labour MPs who were directly involved in the introduction of that legislation have now come out in opposition to it.  Other groups opposed to it include the National Council for Civil Liberties in Britain, the Irish in Britain representation groups and others and they are in the process of lobbying internationally to have this legislation repealed because of its damaging implications for the democratic and legal systems in Britain and for fundamental human civil liberties.  Despite the extensive powers given to the police under the Prevention of Terrorism Act it is questionable if these powers have been effective in minimising terrorism in Britain. Its effect has been to alienate Irish communities throughout Britain, Scotland and Wales.  This legislation is not having the desired effect.  In the British House of Commons in January 1984 during the renewal of this Act Mr. Clive Soley the spokesman for the Labour Party stated that this Act should be looked at thoroughly as to its effectiveness and desirability in the present situation.</P>
    <P>Between 29 November 1974 and the end of 1984 5,896 people were arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act, less than 2.5 per cent, that is 147 people were charged and less than 10 per cent of those charged were given a prison sentence. A number of those charged and sentenced under the Act are the subject of controversy due to the rather flimsy nature of the evidence presented when they were convicted.  Apart from a very small percentage all of those arrested were Irish.  Five thousand seven hunderd and seventy nine people were detained for periods ranging from a few hours to several days and then released without charge and without the right of redress.</P>
    <P>I have today received an outline of the <Col N="1659" /> conditions that obtain when individuals are arrested and brought into a police station under this Act.  On 21 January last two members of the B &amp; I staff were arrested.  They were taken off a ship in Liverpool at 11 a.m.  There was no consultation with the captain of the ship.  They were told that they would be back on the ship that evening.  First they were photographed and fingerprinted and then they were put into a cell for several hours without being questioned.  Then they were taken out and questioned repeatedly. They were not allowed to make a phone call and then a solicitor who arrived at the direction of the father of one of the men was not allowed to see them. They were returned to their cells after the initial period of questioning and left there for some time.  They were then repeatedly brought from their cells for questioning and on each occasion were accused of being liars.  They were not physically ill treated but were made to feel like criminals by the warders and the police.  These two gentlemen were not released until 6 o'clock the following evening despite assurances that they would have been released in time to catch the boat that evening from Liverpool.  If the Minister is really interested he will be able to obtain confirmation of that information.  It is only one of the cases out of many that could be highlighted.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be aware that the Greater London Council recently carried out a survey into the conditions that obtain within police stations when people are arrested and held for periods of between two and seven days under this Act.  The survey found that all of those arrested were denied access to a solicitor and that they had effectively disappeared. That is a frightening dimension reminiscent of the discussions we had on Northern Ireland.  Neither family nor friends were informed of their whereabouts or their detention.  On a number of occasions relatives heard of their arrest through the media or were themselves threatened with arrest on making inquiries. Some detainees complained of <Col N="1660" /> physical ill treatment, threatening behaviour and severe mental pressure.  Some required psychiatric assistance following release or lost their employment as a result of the arrest.  Others found that their families had been subjected to harassment or even assault by their neighbours, children were placed in care, families were broken up and at least one suicide was reported as being linked to detention under the Act.  These are serious details which I hope the Minister and his Department are investigating thoroughly.  We very much regretted and were embarrassed by the Birmingham bombings but the build-up in the incidence of arrests will give cause for concern to this Government.  I hope the Minister has taken every step to ensure that any abuse likely to occur will not occur if his intervention can prevent it.</P>
    <P>Many people have the view, as expressed earlier by my colleague, that the system operating there is one which is interested in gathering information.  The Labour spokesman on Northern Ireland, Clive Soley MP, said it was an act which should be referred to as the &ldquo;Collection of Information Act.&rdquo;  People travelling from here to Britain are presented, on landing, with a landing card.  Although Deputy Collins was of the opinion that the incidence of this has diminished, or perhaps almost disappeared because of protests by Deputy Andrews, I am informed by that Deputy's brother that the last time he landed in Britain he was presented with one of these cards.  Again, he refused to sign it.</P>
    <P>I shall go very briefly through the questions asked on this card, so that Members of the House can exercise their own judgment on the necessity or otherwise of this kind of information.  It asks that the surname, maiden name and christian name be completed in block letters and nationality, citizenship, date and place of birth, home address, address visited, purpose of visit, occupation, employer, date, signature.  In addition to completing this card, one is required, on disembarking, to provide proof of identity.  I must put it to the Minister and the House that this is the greatest insult that any member <Col N="1661" /> of the Irish community could have thrown at him or her on landing at a British port and is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I, for one, would not be prepared to sign or complete such a landing card.  As a peace loving citizen of this country, I object to it.  Not alone Members of this House but members of the European Parliament and a former Minister for Finance have been challenged to produce identity and to complete the details required on this landing card.  This obligation should be unacceptable to the Minister and should be condemned by him outright and unequivocally tonight in this House.  Because of the high incidence of regular travelling between this country and Britain, it cannot be maintained that a card requiring these details is necessary to maintain an adequate level of security in Britain.</P>
    <P>One matter about which a number of groups in Britain are concerned is the very dramatic and dangerous erosion of civil liberties.  Successive British Governments, not alone of our generation but of past generations, have gone out of their way to try to demonstrate to the world how glorious their democracy was, is and is likely to be.  The British Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, at times has rushed to the media to demonstrate her understanding of the reason for the blacks in South Africa resorting to violence because of frustration of their political ideology.  I am not saying that Mrs. Thatcher condones violence, but she was very quick on a number of occasions, when it suited her in terms of international popularity, to make statements to that effect through the media.  Yet, when it comes to the Irish situation there is nothing but bland and gross stubbornness and political blindness.  Time and time again, opportunities have been given to the British Prime Minister to understand the underlying political reasons for the degree of dissatisfaction with Britain translated into violence. While I do not seek to justify any form of violence, I hope the Minister has, during the course of his visit yesterday and discussion with the Foreign Secretary in Britain, unequivocally put his view that <Col N="1662" /> the political difficulties and expression of violence pertaining in Britain and Northern Ireland have a very serious Anglo-Irish dimension to them which can and must be resolved through political action.</P>
    <P>One of the very sad and frightening effects of the implementation of this Act in its provisions as it stands, is the alienation of the Irish communities in Britain. The British Home Secretary, Mr. Leon Brittan, MP, gave an assurance in the House of Commons on Tuesday, 22 January last, that he regarded the powers under the Act as &ldquo;extremely undesirable in principle, sadly necessary in practice and to be exercised only with the very greatest possible care&rdquo;.  He said that it was in that sense and that spirit that the powers were exercised and they were never exercised in any way for political purposes, contrary to suggestions which had been made in recent weeks.</P>
    <P>We know that the reality is far from that.  We know that the Irish communities in Britain, as well as Irish people travelling over to Britain, are being selected for arrest, detention and questioning on a random basis.  An appeal for the repeal of this Act was launched in the House of Commons on 22 January last.  The Irish in Britain Representation Group have been formed because of the build-up of frustration at the inaction of this Government and this Minister is not taking on the British Government and pointing out to them, very clearly and unequivocally, that this Act is excessive, wrong, illogical and will not serve the purpose which we are publicly told it is there to serve.  This Minister should have done that, but obviously has not, and this pressure group have now launched an international campaign to have the Act dismantled. I hoped that the Minister would support that, but I have already evidence through our Irish Embassy in London to suggest, that he has demonstrated his lack of concern &mdash; I can describe it in no other words &mdash; for the plight of these communities.  I am very dissatisfied, indeed, at his refusal to be more forthcoming and helpful and to show more concern and co-operation with this <Col N="1663" /> group who, after all, are his responsibility as our Foreign Minister.</P>
    <P>I shall go very quickly through a number of issues which this pressure group raised with our Embassy in London.  I must first endorse Deputy Collin's sentiments that our Embassy has sometimes come in for unfair criticism. Of course it has.  Our Embassy is the ventilator of the policy of the Government of the day.  Unfortunately, our Embassy sometimes has to take the stick for what turn out to be inadequate, unconcerned and unrealistic approaches to Anglo-Irish affairs.  I am extremely disappointed that an approach made by this group to the Embassy to make contact with our Minister on 5 July 1984 met with no results.  The group made the case for a number of structures to be established within the Embassy to enable the more adequate monitoring of the overall implementation of this Act.  I regard the response of the Government, via the Embassy, to these submissions and representations as a sad betrayal of the legitimate interests of this isolated group of communities in Britain.  They refused a public condemnation of the PTA and the Minister is refusing that here.  He is couching his response in terms of being political and diplomatic.  However, the day has gone when we can afford to do that.</P>
    <P>We must stand up and frankly and directly take on the British and tell them that we do not accept this Act because of the way it impinges on the Irish communities in Britain and on Irish citizens who travel to Britain.  These travellers have heretofore had the freedom to travel to their friends and relatives in Britain and have them return here.  The implementation of this Act is so discriminatory and selective that it is a cause of serious concern. Unless there is a very fundamental change of attitude in terms of its implementation and selectivity, we call for its withdrawal.  The Minister ignored the fact that almost 6,000 innocent Irish people have been detained under the Act since 1974.  He makes a rather grandiose and spurious statement, in my opinion, <Col N="1664" /> that diplomatic action on a case basis has more positive results than some of the methods suggested.</P>
    <P>When the Minister replies I hope he will give us details of the discussions he had yesterday with the British Foreign Secretary, indicating whether he brought up the matter of this Act with him.  He also made the point that he put a number of fundamental issues in relation to the Act to the British Government and that he got concessions thereon.  I should like the Minister to give the House details thereof.</P>

      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Dáil Éireann remains fully committed to combating the use of violence for political ends from whatever source, expresses deep concern at the possibilities of abuse inherent in some of the provisions of the British Prevention of Terrorism Act, and of their application in a discriminatory manner to Irish citizens, deplores in particular the regular practice of denying legal access to detainees and information to relatives for a period of 48 hours or longer, and strongly supports the efforts of the Government to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in Britain and Northern Ireland, as in other countries, at all times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>  I would hope that the Opposition, who have been very foolish in putting down this motion, would look at that amendment again and answer it.  Unfortunately the mover of the motion, Deputy G. Collins, has now left the House, as has Deputy Wilson.  Both those gentlemen were members of Governments, one as Minister for Foreign Affairs and previously as Minister for Justice and the other as Minister for Education and Minister for Transport during the time this Act was in operation.  Not once &mdash; I stress not once &mdash; did that Government or either of those gentlemen say one word <Col N="1665" /> in condemnation of the Act, and they should remember that.  Any former Minister who stands up on the Opposition side this evening or tomorrow evening I intend asking precisely what he did when he was a member of the Government to condemn this Act to the British Government, because they did nothing.  This is a bit of gross hypocrisy and, as I shall point out later, a playing into certain people's hands in putting down this motion this evening, totally irresponsible&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act came into force in November 1974.  The Act was introduced by the British Government as a temporary measure responding to the Birmingham bombings.  In the face of further terrorist violence in Britain, including the murder of Mr. Airey Neave, the bomb attacks at Hyde Park and at Harrods, and, most recently, the attempted assassination of the British Cabinet at Brighton, the Act has been renewed and has become a semi-permanent feature of British criminal legislation. It is important to note, therefore, that the terrorism of the Provisional IRA led to this Act and has kept this Act in force.  All Irish Governments since 1974 have recognised this fact, including the Governments of which these two former Ministers were members, that the Prevention of Terrorism Act arose from the security problems faced by the British authorities in the wake of terrorist violence connected for the most part with the Northern Ireland situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Successive Irish Governments &mdash; again Governments of which these two former Ministers, now departed from the House, were members &mdash; have therefore not condemned the Prevention of Terrorism Act outright.  There is not one word on record from Deputy G. Collins, Deputy Wilson, or any of the Fianna Fáil Governments, <Col N="1666" /> not one word of condemnation of this Act.  Therefore to come in here and talk as they did this evening is total hypocrisy. We have all recognised the right of the British Parliament and people and their regrettable need to determine what measures they should take to defend themselves against acts of terrorist violence on their own soil.  Indeed, we ourselves have legislation to counter the use of violence for political ends.</P>
    <P>It is the duty of all of us in this House, who are committed to the pursuit of progress through peaceful, democratic, political means, to disown and condemn those who attempt to further their own ends through violence.  Having myself met with many of the representatives of the Irish community in Britain &mdash; many of them, far more than Deputy L. Fitzgerald has met &mdash; I know that the Irish community there&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. L. Fitzgerald Mr. L. Fitzgerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not open my mouth when the Deputy spoke.  He might please afford me the same courtesy.  Having myself met with many of the representatives of the Irish community in Britain I know that the Irish community there is equally opposed to violence, and is similarly committed to the principles of peaceful political progress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This makes it all the more difficult for the Irish community to bear the anti-Irish feeling to which they have in the past been subjected as a result of the terrorist outrages perpetrated in Britain by so-called Irish nationalists.  I am deeply concerned about the position of the Irish community in Britain, exposed as it is on the front line of Anglo-Irish relations.  I realise too that the anti-terrorist legislation in Britain has cast its heavy shadow over members of the Irish community there.  But let us be quite clear who it is that puts the Irish community under this pressure, who it is that creates the violence and the bitterness &mdash; the Provisional IRA.  It is they who have maimed and destroyed, not merely human life, but <Col N="1667" /> also human relations, most particularly the relations between the Irish and their British neighbours.</P>
    <P>It is a tribute to the good sense of both the Irish and the British peoples that, following the Brighton outrage, a clear distinction was made between the vast majority of true, peace-loving Irish people, and that unrepresentative and tiny minority who besmirch the very name of Irishman.  I am sure that all the Irish in Britain, as well as all of us in this House &mdash; and I include Deputy L. Fitzgerald &mdash; who represent the people of Ireland, will join me in wishing that those responsible for the cynical and heartless carnage of the Brighton and Harrods bombings had been caught under the British anti-terrorist legislation. At the same time, while we recognise the right of a democratic society under attack to enact anti-terrorist legislation, we also have in relation to the PTA a clear and important duty to protect Irish citizens who may be adversely affected by the operation of the Act.  We, like our predecessors in Government since 1974 &mdash; and this is the record &mdash; have been fully conscious of this duty, and right, to ensure that the legislation as far as Irish citizens are concerned is applied in an equitable and sympathetic manner consistent with civil liberties and that abuses are avoided.</P>
    <P>In this task the Irish Embassy in London has a role to play: the Embassy has in the past ten years closely monitored the operation of the legislation both through the numerous individual cases in which Irish people have sought consular assistance and through the close contacts which the Embassy maintains with the Irish community in Britain.</P>
    <P>As a result we take action on two levels.  First, in relation to individual cases:  the Embassy regularly receives requests for information and help from families and friends of those detained under the PTA.  Among the most common requests are those for information about where the person is held, whether the detention is going to be extended, whether the person detained <Col N="1668" /> has access to a lawyer.  In all these cases an immediate approach is made to the British authorities seeking details of the detention and urging that the rights of the person concerned be respected.  In addition the Embassy also receives complaints from Irish citizens who feel they have been mistreated or abused under the Act.  These are pursued by the Embassy with the British authorities.  Deputies will appreciate that, since it is important to respect the right of detainees and their families to confidentiality, much of our activity in this area goes unpublicised.</P>
    <P>This has led in some recent cases to unwarranted criticism of the efforts of my Department on behalf of those detained. The reality is that details of much of the Embassy's work cannot and should not be disclosed.  I have already mentioned in public, as an example, that on one Sunday early in January an official at the Embassy in London spent 14 continuous hours dealing with PTA cases, involving repeated calls to the family involved, the British authorities and my Department in Dublin.  At midnight on New Year's Eve the Embassy were making representations to the British authorities about another case.  Deputies may wish to note that members of the Irish community in Britain, who are aware of the efforts of the Embassy staff in helping people detained under the PTA, have on several occasions recently expressed their appreciation for what we do.</P>
    <P>Though the need to preserve confidentiality prevents me from going into detail about our efforts in individual cases, I can, however, be more specific about the second level at which the Government deals with the PTA:  the formal approaches we make to the British authorities about the operation of the Act.  From our experience with the individual cases brought to our notice, and as a result of the concerns expressed to us by the Irish community in Britain, it has become apparent over the years that certain aspects of the Act and its operation have caused particular difficulties for Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>When problems are brought to our notice we raise these with the British <Col N="1669" /> authorities and seek a solution.  These contacts take place on a regular basis &mdash; the PTA is discussed on most occasions when I meet with British Ministers &mdash; but on two occasions in particular Irish Governments have made lengthy written submissions detailing our concern about the operation of the Act, based upon the representations we had received from Irish people affected by the legislation. The first occasion was in 1978, when Shackleton conducted a review of the operation of the Act.  The second occasion was in 1983, when Jellicoe further reviewed its operation.  Among the topics we raised in our submissions were the following: the numbers of innocent Irish people detained at points of entry and exit; the delays encountered while the identity of people was established; the importance of a sympathetic approach to the relatives and friends of those detained; the vital question of access to legal advice; the importance of notifying the Embassy when an Irish citizen is detained; aspects of the operation of the exclusion orders; the danger that the Act might be seen as harassing or intimidating the Irish community; the need to avoid discrimination against Irish citizens in matters such as the requirement to fill in landing cards; the need to avoid the use of the Act merely to gain information from those detained; difficulties encountered about the detention of minors; problems experienced by persons with names in Irish; the need to avoid publicity and respect individuals' right to privacy; the right of those detained to adequate treatment and conditions.</P>
    <P>As a result of our representations and those made by others concerned with the legislation and its effects, there have been significant changes in the provisions of the Act and its operation, which go some way to alleviating the difficulties encountered by Irish citizens.  First of all several of the petty difficulties which were regularly brought to the notice of the Embassy in the early seventies are now rarely the subject of complaint: the detention of children, the difficulties encountered by people with Irish names, or the lengthy <Col N="1670" /> delays while the identity of individuals was established.</P>
    <P>There have also been improvements following our representations about four matters of major importance.  First, a complaint which has been frequently brought to our notice, and which the Government have, in their turn, raised with the British authorities, is that the Act discriminates against Irish citizens. Statistics are not available to indicate what percentage of those detained under the Act were Irish citizens: the experience of the Embassy would suggest that a large number have been.  Furthermore, the concentration of police activity within Britain upon members of the Irish community has led to a belief within that community that the effect of the Act is discriminatory.</P>
    <P>There are two problems here: the Act itself, and the way in which it is implemented. With regard to the Act, I think that it is important that it should not be seen to be directed purely against Irish terrorism but against all terrorism, whether originating abroad or coming from within Britain.  Terrorist violence in Britain is not confined to violence related to Northern Ireland and it would be more appropriate in principle, as well as more reflective of the situation as it exists, that the Act should apply to all terrorist acts regardless of the nationality of the suspected perpetrators.  The new Act which came into force in March 1984 dealt for the first time with international terrorist violence as well as violence related to Northern Ireland.  I have welcomed this and have proposed to the British authorities that they should take one step further in the next review of the legislation and apply the Act to all acts of terrorism, whether international or domestic.</P>
    <P>Fears about unfair discrimination also arise from any insensitive, arbitrary or intimidatory application of the Act by the police forces charged with its enforcement. This is a particular problem in relation to police action within the Irish community in Britain.  We have stressed that the Act must be applied with discretion and respect for the reputation of <Col N="1671" /> persons within their local community. The number of complaints from the Irish community on this point has decreased substantially over the past two years.</P>
    <P>Problems have also arisen in relation to landing cards.  Some confusion has been caused because the use of landing cards is discretionary to local police forces. That is why passengers may be asked to fill in cards at some ports and airports and not others, or at certain periods and not others.  The British authorities have assured my Department recently that, whether or not all passengers on a particular flight or sailing are &ldquo;carded&rdquo;, there is no question of discrimination against Irish citizens since British passport holders are as likely to be asked to fill in landing cards as anyone else.</P>
    <P>The second major change in the Act relates to its operation.  There has in recent years been a marked improvement in the selectivity with which the Act has been used.  In both 1975 and 1976 over a thousand people were detained under the Act, and only 5 per cent of these charged with an offence.  In 1984 only 159 people &mdash; the lowest figure since the Act's introduction &mdash; were arrested under the PTA in connection with Irish terrorism, and 16 per cent of these were subsequently charged with an offence.  This represents progress on three issues which we have raised with the British authorities: fewer people are being detained &mdash; only a tiny proportion of those resident in Britain or who travel back and forth between Britain and Ireland; and more of those are being charged with an offence and found guilty, that is, fewer innocent people are being detained; and finally, as the reduction in the number of innocent people detained shows, there appears to be less use of the Act for the purpose of trawling for information.</P>
    <P>The third major change in the PTA has been in the system of exclusion orders. As an administrative rather than judicial process, exclusion has in the past created difficulties for Irish citizens.  Persons who had once been involved in terrorism but who had abandoned violence found that <Col N="1672" /> they could not appeal against the imposition of an exclusion order.  Some found themselves excluded from Britain, where they had lived for a number of years and where their families remained.  Following submissions made by the Irish Government and other interested parties, Shackleton and Jellicoe both recommended changes in the system, which have been accepted by the British authorities.  As a result orders are now limited to three years, cannot be used against persons normally resident in Britain, and the provisions for appeal against such orders have been improved.  The number of exclusion orders has dropped significantly from 49 in 1978 to only one last year.</P>
    <P>Finally, perhaps the most important issue about which the Irish Government have made representations has been that of access to solicitors and the right to inform someone that one has been detained. This, in the Government's view, is a basic right of people in detention.  To quote the words of my amendment &ldquo;we strongly deplore the regular practice of denying legal access to detainees and information to relatives for a period of 48 hours or longer&rdquo;.  I ask Dáil Éireann to support the Government in this view, which we have of course made clear without any possible room for doubt to the British Government.</P>
    <P>The Government, in their submission to Jellicoe, particularly stressed the right of Irish citizens in this regard.  Jellicoe's recommendation that those detained should have an absolute right to consult a solicitor and inform a member of their family or a friend of their detention was accepted by the British Home Secretary and incorporated in sections 56 and 58 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act, which will come into force in January 1986.  As a result those detained will have a right to consult a solicitor and to inform a friend or member of their family within 48 hours of their detention.</P>
    <P>This is progress and has been welcomed by all those who have sought to improve the operation of the Act as it affects Irish citizens.  But major difficulties still remain, and my Department will <Col N="1673" /> not cease in its efforts to alleviate these, and to deal with cases of harassment or unfair treatment.</P>
    <P>Two difficulties in particular have been raised again in recent contacts with the British authorities.  I, like several of my predecessors, have urged the British authorities to agree to notify the Embassy whenever an Irish citizen is detained under the PTA.  The British authorities have been reluctant to agree to this in all cases, pointing to the need in certain circumstances to withhold such information for fear of impeding their investigations. It may also be pointed out that the embassies of other nationals arrested under the PTA are not informed of their detention automatically.</P>
    <P>I can assure Deputies, however, that I have pressed this point with the British authorities, seeking to reach an agreement which will improve the situation for those families anxiously seeking to ascertain whether a member has been detained under the PTA.  I can now announce that, as a result of this pressure, the British authorities have agreed to a systematic improvement in the communication of information to the Irish Embassy regarding those detained under the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  This will greatly increase our capacity to respond to the queries of relatives in almost all cases within the first 48 hours. I will continue to press for the Irish Embassy to be informed automatically and without exception when an Irish citizen is detained under the Act.</P>
    <P>A second issue upon which I will continue to press the British authorities are the conditions under which those detained under the Act are held.  As was pointed out in our submissions to Shackleton and Jellicoe, the special nature of the PTA, and the fact that people can be detained for up to seven days and then released without charge, makes it particularly important that special care should be paid to the conditions of detention, such as diet, exercise and general comfort.  This point was accepted by both Shackleton and Jellicoe.  Complaints, however, have been received by the Irish <Col N="1674" /> authorities that their recommendations on this count have not always been followed. The Irish Embassy and my Department will continue to monitor such complaints very carefully, and protest vigorously when we have grounds for concern.</P>
    <P>I wish here to take the opportunity to encourage both individual Irish people and interested Irish groups or representatives in Britain and Ireland to communicate with the Irish Embassy in London or with the Department of Foreign Affairs in Dublin about any cases which come to their attention which involve abuses, or arbitrary or unsympathetic application of the legislation to Irish citizens.  It is specific information of this kind which has allowed us in the past both to intervene effectively in individual cases, and to bring to the attention of the British authorities problems which give rise to general concern.</P>
    <P>I have described the policy of successive Governments, policy which has been implemented by the Opposition when they were in power as well as ourselves. The motion put down by the Opposition seeks radically to change that policy.  I can understand the strong feelings prompted by reports of recent alleged abuses and I am fully aware that this legislation is, in the words of the British Home Secretary, &ldquo;draconian&rdquo;.  It is a matter of great concern to me, however, that the Dáil should recognise that it was a campaign of bombing and murder which led to this draconian legislation.</P>
    <P>We should also recognise that it is precisely the objective of those who engage in such violence to encourage repressive measures.  They recently confirmed this. They thereby hope to cause dissension between Irish and British people, and create an atmosphere in which their evil acts will be tolerated and even flourish, and so ensure that the aim of every Irish Government to achieve political progress on the issue of Northern Ireland will never be fulfilled.  I remind the House of what was said after the Brighton bombing. The IRA said it was by repressive legislation they would be assisted to go on to achieve their ambition to take over <Col N="1675" /> this country, North and South.  I hope the House will remember that.</P>
    <P>The motion put down by the Opposition is regrettable and I am sorry that they cannot support our amendment.  I ask them to think again.  A blanket condemnation of the Act ignores the violence which led to the legislation; it ignores the right of the British Parliament and people to defend themselves on their own soil against violence which has resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians and violence which has been aimed at the heart of democracy as we know it in these islands; it ignores the fact that Irish citizens in Britain have the right to participate in the political process there; have the right to join political parties, gain election to Parliament and openly campaign against this legislation; finally, a blanket condemnation ignores the efforts made by Irish Governments, including the Opposition when in power, to have changes made in the scope and the operation of the legislation, and ignores the positive results which have been achieved by successive Governments.</P>
    <P>In a recent issue, the principal newspaper of the Irish community in Britain, <i>The Irish Post</i>, featured a letters page which was headed &ldquo;Keeping the PTA in proportion&rdquo;.  Against the background of the terrorist violence in Britain and of the fact that the vast majority of the Irish who have gone to Britain have been fairly treated and have led satisfactory lives, one correspondent stated, and I quote,</P>
    <P>...Lets keep things in proportion.  Let's protest at the Act in a positive and accurately directed manner, rather than over-reacting by believing or trying to convey that the entire Irish community is under a state of siege.</P>
    <P>I think this is very good advice.  I think I have shown in my statement this evening that I am as concerned as anybody else about problems experienced by Irish people in Britain under the prevention of terrorism legislation and that I am fully determined to uphold the rights of Irish citizens in Britain and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1676" /> Recent public statements and media attention, however, may have given ordinary Irish people, who are completely innocent of any association with terrorist groups, the impression that it is dangerous for them to travel to Britain in current circumstances.  When this Act first came into force in 1974, the number of detentions was far greater than it is now.  More than 1,000 were detained in 1975 and over 1,000 were again detained in 1976.  In 1978, 622 people were detained, and only 19 charged with an offence. In response to the representations of successive Irish Governments and particularly to our efforts of the past two years, the number of arrests has been falling and, as I have stated, amounted to 159 in 1984.</P>
    <P>Therefore, I find it regrettable that the Opposition should choose this time to condemn the Act outright.  When the Opposition were in Government in 1978, when only 19 out of the 622 people arrested under the Act were charged, they carefully maintained the position of successive Irish Governments, and of this Government, in accepting that the passing of anti-terrorist legislation was a matter for the British Government and Parliament to decide, and that the main task of the Irish Government was to protect the rights of Irish citizens and ensure that they were not mistreated.  Yet now, when the Act itself has been amended substantially, and its operation has reached the level that far fewer people are detained, and, of these, a much higher proportion are actually charged, the Opposition are seeking to have it condemned outright.</P>
    <P>The Opposition's motion states that the prevention of terrorism legislation is in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights.  I think we should be very careful about making a judgment like that in this particular case.  I would simply note that aspects of the Act have already been tested before the European Human Rights institutions in the McVeigh case and that the legislation was found not to be in contravention of the relevant articles of the convention.  This decision was made by the Committee of</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1677" /> Ministers on 24 March 1982.  I understand that there are further cases, brought by individuals, at present before the Commission and of course I await the outcome of these cases with close interest.</P>
    <P>I have given a summary of the activities of this and previous Irish Governments on the PTA.  I would stress that I have not been able to mention all the issues which I have raised with the British authorities, but I have, I hope, dealt with the most important, and explained the seriousness with which the Government take their responsibility to help Irish citizens. I hope too that I have given those Deputies who criticise the Government some food for thought.  Negative criticism is easy: what we have sought to do in relation to this Act is to propose constructive ways in which the burden borne by innocent Irish citizens in the fight against terrorism in Britain can be lightened.  Let me repeat that if there are other points which Members of the Dáil or other responsible persons consider should be raised with the British authorities, whether in regard to the scope of the legislation, or in regard to its operation, I shall be very glad to consider doing so. I would hope that such concerns as exist would be raised during this debate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In practice it is a cliché of political action that when the argument is weak there is an indulgence in the <i>argumentum ad hominem.</i> Consequently, the Minister in starting his speech chose to take up a number of minutes attacking Deputy Gerry Collins and myself.  In fact, he spent more time making a personal attack on Deputy Collins and me than he did in dealing with the European Convention on Human Rights. In itself that is an indication of the priorities in the Minister's mind with regard to the Prevention of Terrorism Act.  It is with great pleasure that I support our motion:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Prevention of Terrorism Act in its provisions and in its implementation&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>more so in its implementation&mdash;<Col N="1678" /> as clearly discriminatory against Irish citizens and being in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights, and calls on the Government as a matter of urgency to seek the repeal of this legislation and to insist, in accordance with normal diplomatic practice elsewhere, that the Irish Embassy in London be immediately notified of any arrests of Irish citizens made under this Act.</P>
    <P>In making the personal attack on Deputy Gerry Collins and me the Minister coupled Deputy Liam Fitzgerald.  He vaunted and boasted that he had more contact with the Irish community than Deputy Fitzgerald and beat the drum about his acquaintance with them.  If boasting is in order from the Minister I should like to tell him that I spent some time in the United Kingdom.  I graduated from one of their universities and married a woman from the Anglo-Irish community in London.  I am closely in touch with the position there and with the sentiments of the people.  They are not the quiet bourgeois opinions that the Minister has put before the House tonight.  For that reason all the more should Dáil Éireann pay attention to our motion and pass it with a resounding majority.</P>
    <P>I am aware that there are Members of the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party who in their heart of hearts support the sentiments and the ideas we have put forward in our motion.  I should like to call the attention of the House to Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights which states:</P>
    <P>1.  Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person.</P>
    <P>No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law; (a) the lawful detention of a person after conviction by a competent court;</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the House to pay attention to the statistics in that regard.</P>
    <P>The article continues:</P>
    <P>(b)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person for non-compliance with the <Col N="1679" /> lawful order of a court or in order to secure the fulfilment of any obligation prescribed by law;</P>
    <P>Innocent citizens from here who travel to the UK by air or sea are not people who are detained for non-compliance of the lawful order of a court.  They are ordinary citizens going about their business.  They have incurred a certain odium in the community in which they live because they have been arrested without cause only to be released because no charges could be brought against them.  Trawling for information has been mentioned and I am convinced that there is a great deal of that.  I am convinced that the information is computerised and that Orwell's 1984 is in existence in so far as that little part of the national life in the UK is concerned. The article continues:</P>
    <P>(c)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person effected for the purpose of bringing him before the competent legal authority on reasonable suspicion of having committed an offence or when it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent his committing an offence or fleeing after having done so;</P>
    <P>I ask the House to consider ex-Deputy Richie Ryan, Deputy Niall Andrews and Deputy Michael O'Kenedy in this context. One has to have a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i> to show how the Act is operating against our citizens.</P>
    <P>Article 5 continues:</P>
    <P>(f)  the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition;</P>
    <P>The small number of people who have been charged and the even smaller number of those who have been convicted shows that the action of the UK under the PTA is not in accordance with the spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1680" /> Article 10 of the Convention states:</P>
    <P>(1)  Everyone has the right to freedom of expression.  This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers.</P>
    <P>  My contacts among the Irish community in the United Kingdom are convinced that anyone who holds strongly republican principles <i>vis-à-vis</i> this country absolutely unconnected with violence and pursuing their philosophy in accordance with ordinary political activity are hauled in under this Act, humiliated and deprived of their liberty for a short or long period just to satisfy the UK Government and trawl for information.</P>
    <P>Article 10 continues:</P>
    <P>This Article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.</P>
    <P>I should now like to call the House's attention to Article 14 which states:</P>
    <P>The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.</P>
    <P>I must stress that sophisticated people who understand the workings of the society in which they live in the UK are convinced that the holding of certain political opinions causes people to be dragged in under the PTA.  I am putting that before the House as something which I am sure the Minister and his officials know is true.</P>
    <P>During Question Time I mentioned the denial of a telephone facility to people arrested under the 48 hours detention permitted under the Act.  If the people who detain Irish citizens, or Anglo-Irish as the case may be, are acting in accordance <Col N="1681" /> with law why will they not make a telephone available to the citizens concerned so that they can get in touch with a legal adviser or some other person to inform them that they have been detained? What are they trying to hide if they are acting in accordance with law? The Minister referred to the Fianna Fáil Governments and their actions or lack of actions in the past but I should like to remind the House that the PTA was passed in the House of Commons at a time when the Coalition Government of 1973-77 was in office.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs was a member of that Government.  Legislation was put on the Statute Book in this part of the country at that time, with a seven days' detention, which pointed the way for the British Government.</P>
    <P>It is important that we do not allow anybody to tar us with any type of violence brush because of the motion before the House.  The motion before the House has been moved by a party that has condemned violence on all occasions.  I submit humbly to the House that, were it not for the fact that Fianna Fáil held that philosophy from 1926 on, the country would have had a serious violence problem.  Everybody knows how the Fianna Fáil Party was born and nurtured. The fact that we have the largest political party in the country with branches in every half parish had a consolidating effect on the country particularly as we adhered to that philosophy through thick and thin over the years.</P>
    <P>This legislation has been called draconian. Draco would turn in his grave because of the use that is made of this Prevention of Terrorism Act.  I intend to go through that quickly.  I have already mentioned the articles in the Convention on Human Rights which I think are relevant to this motion.</P>
    <P>Part I of the Act proscribes organisations. The United Kingdom Government have every right to take whatever steps, within reason, they wish to protect themselves.  Nobody in this House condones bombing in Brighton, Birmingham or anywhere else, although I would like to reiterate the statement on this side of <Col N="1682" /> the House that there are grave doubts about conviction in the case of the Birmingham bombing.  The organisations that are proscribed are interesting.  There are other terrorist organisations operating in what is called the United Kingdom which are not mentioned.  In a matter like this definitions are important. If terrorism is mentioned we are entitled to a definition of terrorism.</P>
    <P>I was in the Six Counties when the Westminster elections were on and I saw terrorism being perpetrated by the people who are mentioned as the enforcers of this law on teenagers around the town of Newry, Crossmaglen and south Armagh.  What is good for the goose is good for the gander.  We should be very careful that we know the definitions of terrorism.  Institutional terrorism is as reprehensible as individual terrorism and if the institutions of State are used for terrorist purposes they deserve the same condemnation as those who planted the bomb in Brighton.</P>
    <P>Part I section 2 reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  Any person who in a public place&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  wears any item of dress; or</P>
    <P>I am not joking, this is in the Act&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>(b)  wears, carries or displays any article, in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable apprehension that he is a member or supporter of a proscribed organisation, shall be guilty of an offence,...</P>
    <P>The one thing a person learns when he lives in Britain is how little people know, even people you think should know, about this country.  I think in many ways the media are to blame.  They have the most sycophantic popular media in the world. It reminds me of the story of Lord Halifax and Goebbels.  Lord Halifax charged Goebbels and said; &ldquo;Why can you not allow freedom of the Press?&rdquo;  The notorious Nazi Minister replied: &ldquo;If I had a Press like the one you have I would not have to censor it.&rdquo;  Somebody walking <Col N="1683" /> down the Strand or Oxford Street on St. Patrick's Day wearing the shamrock in his lapel is in grave danger under this Act which says that &ldquo;any person who in a public place wears any item of dress or wears, carries, or displays any article, in such a way or in such circumstances as to arouse reasonable apprehension...&rdquo;.  In an English bobby's mind the shamrock could be such an offensive emblem.  The <i>Irish Post</i> should be warned that if citizens are wearing large bunches of shamrock &mdash; and exiles tend to wear huge bunches of shamrock &mdash; they should have their solicitors' phone numbers at the ready on St. Patrick's Day.</P>
    <P>I want to deal now with exclusion orders which were covered well by Deputy Fitzgerald.  I have a photostat of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act, 1984, but I do not know if this is the amended Act.  From reading section 4 it appears that the British are very anxious that only people from Ireland should be covered in this legislation. Deputy Fitzgerald said he thinks there were some amendments and that the Act has been extended to other nationalities but the burden of the Act indicates that it was aimed specifically at Irish citizens. I do not know why English people are excluded.  It is not so long since we had a British terrorist here who held up a family, robbed a bank and was associating with certain members of the British aristocracy.  We all know the voyeuristic way British aristocrats on occasion like to consort with such people.</P>
    <P>A law which does not extend to everybody seems to be discriminatory.  If an exclusion order is in question, where do they exclude them to?  Let us take the example of Northern Ireland.  They claim that all citizens of the Six Counties are British citizens although many of them, as we all know, carry Irish passports. What is the legal significance of that?  We do not know but we do know that English jurists condemned a twisting of English law before in order to condemn William Joyce, but I do not know what a British citizen is in the context of Northern Ireland and if they are to be excluded by <Col N="1684" /> an exclusion order, where are they to be excluded from?  Will they be sent to an unknown country?  The Republic of Ireland is not mentioned, but it seems that in many provisions of this Act the finger is pointing towards the Irish Republic.</P>
    <P>One of the jokes of the Act is that people are entitled to a personal interview. I suppose this is a sop to the great system of democracy about which we read so much in the English context but frankly it is the kind of personal interview I would not like to have with the United Kingdom authorities if and when I was arrested.  A list of miscellaneous offences is also mentioned at Part III, section 10, which reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  If any person&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  solicits or invites any other person to give, lend or otherwise make available, whether for consideration or not, any money or other property...</P>
    <P>(3)  A person guilty of an offence under subsection (1) or (2) above shall be liable&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to a fine...</P>
    <P>(b)  on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to a fine, or both...</P>
    <P>(5)  The acts of terrorism to which this part of this Act applies are acts of terrorism connected with Northern Irish affairs.</P>
    <P>Section 11 raises hackles in every Irish circle and deals with information.  It reads:</P>
    <P>(1)  If a person who has information which he knows or believes might be of material assistance&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  in preventing the commission by any other person of an act of terrorism to which this Part of this Act applies; or</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1685" /> (b)  in securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for an offence involving the commission...</P>
    <P>It has been mentioned from this side of the House that information gathering is essential to the purpose of this Act and for that reason I am very suspicious of that section.  The framers of that Bill must not know anything of the Irish ethos if they think they can make it respectable by putting it into a British Act that an informer is in some way to be rewarded. Information is given in most countries which have not the kind of history we have.  An ordinary well meaning English citizen will help the forces of law and order to the full extent of his ability but in Ireland we have had a tradition which is contrary to that ethos and that is why, as well as the fact that it was a perversion of law and justice, we took such a strong line on the supergrass trials which have taken place in the Six Counties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank you for allowing me to raise this matter on behalf of the people of Ashbourne, the 60 families who will have 70 pupils eligible to attend and who have been enrolled in St. Mary's school for September 1985.  These families have been working with the Department since 1981 to provide a primary school on a particular site in Ashbourne for the ever-increasing population there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this school started, the first three classes were held in the library of another school, St. Declan's, in the same village. The following year, the Department provided five pre-fabs which were supposed to be new but, when they were erected on the site at Ashbourne, it was found they had been used four times.  Since then they have deteriorated even further.  The teachers are running round with buckets <Col N="1686" /> collecting the water seeping in and this is a terrible situation in this day and age. Four more pre-fabs were provided and last year the parish provided and paid for an additional two pre-fabs without any help from the Department.  That means that there is a nine-teacher school housed in pre-fabs.</P>
    <P>Next September, 70 pupils who have already enrolled in St. Mary's will have no accommodation.  They are being deprived of primary school education. There have been several deputations to the Office of Public Works and one to the Minister.  The Office of Public Works promised that design plans and tenders would be ready by October 1984 so that the school could commence building in December last year but this has not happened. The management have been informed that final tenders were to be accepted in the Department by today, 5 February 1985.  It would take six months to process these and building would not commence until 1986.  This is far from satisfactory and I want the Minister to make a decision tonight to ensure that, as the new school is designed in three separate blocks of four classrooms each, the Department will get tenders out to a builder.  The management have informed me that five different builders have said they will be ready to commence work in the middle of April 1985 and that four of the classrooms will be ready by September this year for the 70 students.  If this does not happen, the management of the school will have no option but to serve notice on a seven-teacher Irish school in Ashbourne to vacate three rooms in the old parochial school which they have been using for the last couple of years, a mile away from the existing number of pre-fabs at St. Mary's.  They do not want to take this action but they must facilitate the 70 students enrolled for next September. If the Minister takes action this can be avoided.</P>
    <P>Ashbourne has developed over the last ten years and there has been a very big influx of people.  There are now over 2,400 people on the live register in the area who are entitled to better facilities than they have.  The least we should be <Col N="1687" /> able to provide is proper educational facilities for our young people.  I hope that the Minister will take this opportunity to allay the fears in the minds and hearts of many parents in Ashbourne and that four more classrooms will be built. Even if the classrooms are unheated, they will provide heating themselves until the school is finished.  I cannot stress how serious and important this is and the Department, especially the Office of Public Works, have not kept their promise that this school would go to tender Last September or even earlier and that it would be built in 1985.  It would be a pity if the Irish school had to vacate their three rooms but, as I said, this is the only option the management of St. Mary's have if their demands are not met.  All the children should be educated together, instead of being switched around, starting off in the library of St. Declan's, then in pre-fabs and the parish having to provide two extra pre-fabs themselves.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank the Minister of State for taking this question.  I know there are problems in many areas but, if a positive effort is made in the next month or six weeks, building could commence on four of the new classrooms, which would mean the 70 pupils would have accommodation in the near future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Education (Mr. Creed)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following consideration of a report by the Department's buildings inspector in March 1982 on future enrolments and school provision in the Ashbourne area, where a 16 classroom national school was already established, my Department agreed in principle in May 1982 to the establishment of a second major national school for the area.  This new school was also to comprise 16 classrooms and it was proposed that the school be provided in two phases, the initial phase to comprise 12 classrooms and a second phase, comprising four classrooms, to be provided at a later date, if required.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The site offered for the project by the chairman was inspected as to its suitability by the Commissioners of Public Works <Col N="1688" /> and found to be acceptable.  With the agreement of the chairman, the commissioners were asked in May 1982 to prepare a sketch scheme for the project. Documentary evidence of title to the site of the proposed school was, as required under the rules for national schools, submitted by the chairman in May 1983, and this was cleared as satisfactory by the Chief State Solicitor in June 1983.  The sketch scheme had already been received from the commissioners on 6 May 1983 and examined and approved by my Department subject to certain minor modifications and accordingly my Department were in a position in August 1983 to write to the chairman giving their formal approval to a grant subject to the satisfactory outcome of negotiations with regard to the amount of the local contribution. This arrangement was in order to enable the chairman to arrange with the Commissioners of Public Works for the further necessary architectural planning of the project.</P>
    <P>Following protracted negotiations the amount of the local contribution towards the cost of the project was finally agreed with the chairman at the end of January 1984.  This enabled the Department to advise the Commissioners of Public Works on 27 January 1984 that the way was clear for the completion of the architectural planning process.  My Department were informed by the commissioners on 30 November 1984 that the working drawings and bills of quantities would be ready shortly and were asked for approval to invite tenders.  On 11 December 1984 my Department authorised the commissioners to proceed to the invitation of tenders.</P>
    <P>In the meantime, St. Mary's national school was established in September 1981 with an initial enrolment of 80 pupils. The pupils were housed in prefabricated accommodation on the site of St. Declan's school.  In June 1982 the Department agreed to the provision of five additional prefabricated classrooms together with toilet facilities and ancillary accommodation to house the growing enrolment of St. Mary's pending the erection of the new permanent school.  The <Col N="1689" /> Department have been informed by letter from the chairman of 31 January 1985 that two further classes are to be enrolled in September 1985 and that this will necessitate the provision of extra accommodation.  The chairman has sought written confirmation from the Department by 24 March 1985 that part of the new permanent school will be ready for occupation by September 1985, as his board's only acceptable solution to their accommodation problem.  My Department are not in a position at this stage to give such an assurance but are in consultation with the Commissioners of Public Works about the prospects of being able to meet the board's request. Meanwhile, the position regarding the proposed new school for St. Mary's is that tenders have been received by the commissioners and are at present under examination with a view to early placing of a contract.</P>
    <P>I might say at this stage that there is no basis for the Deputy's assumption that 70 children will be without accommodation in September 1985.  Even if it is not possible to meet the specific request of the school's board of management in this connection, there are other means of solving the problem.  I might add that it is a problem not unique to Ashbourne but is one which has been encountered in rapidly expanding urban centres and which has been overcome by reasonable co-operation and goodwill between the local school authorities and the Department. I have no reason to believe that should the problem arise in Ashbourne, it cannot be overcome in a similar spirit.</P>
    <P>I understand the Deputy's concern in relation to the overcrowding in Ashbourne. I would be very slow to allow part of a new school to be used by teachers and children when there are contractors and builders working on the site.  There would be danger to the children if some of the rooms had not been completed.  My Department are only too anxious to co-operate with the board of management to ensure that there is full accommodation for all the children.</P>
    <P>It is not in accordance with the facts <Col N="1690" /> to say that the board of management provided a number of prefabricated buildings without any help from or thanks to the Department of Education.  I am not too concerned about the thanks but the Department did help to provide the prefabricated buildings.  I ask the Deputy to inquire about this from the board of management.  It is not normal practice for me to give the details here.</P>
    <P>In relation to the all-Irish school in Ashbourne it would be a panic measure and it would be wrong for the board of management and the chairman to adopt that attitude.  If there was not an all-Irish school the 70 pupils attending the school would have to be accommodated in this school.  That point should be taken into consideration by the board of management. I hope they will not proceed with that kind of attitude.  There are many ways in which the overflow can be accommodated while waiting for the new school.  There could be a deferment of the enrolment of the infant class from September to December when it is possible that the school could be completed. I advise the board of management that if they co-operate with the Department no children will be left without accommodation.</P>
    <P>Sometimes the Department are blamed for things for which they are not responsible.  I should like to be able to say to the Deputy that a contractor will be appointed and that the work will commence on a certain day but I cannot give such an undertaking.  It depends on the examination of the bill of quantities and whether it is in accordance with the costs laid down by my Department.  We depend on the Office of Public Works to advise us in relation to cost.  It would then be necessary for the Department to sanction the appointment of a contractor to build a school.  That would depend on whether the contractor could provide a bond, how quickly he could do so and so on.</P>
    <P>We are aware of the urgency of this case and of the overcrowding that exists. <Col N="1691" /> I assure the Deputy that as far as the Department are concerned there will be no undue delay in providing a new school <Col N="1692" /> for the Ashbourne area.</P>

      <P>The only reliable estimates of migration flows are those for net migration between successive Censuses of Population.  The estimates for these periods are obtained by relating intercensal population changes to data for births and deaths in the same period.  In the April 1979 to April 1981 intencensal period, the estimate of net migration was some 5,000 outwards or 2,500 per annum.</P>
      <P>For periods since the 1981 Census only very tentative estimates of net migration can be made based on provisional population estimates.  Such provisional population estimates are compiled annually following detailed consideration of all available relevant indicators.  These estimates, however, and the implied net migration estimates derived therefrom are subject to revision when the results of a later Census of Population become available.</P>
      <P>The provisional mid-April 1984 population estimate is some 92,000 above the 1981 Census figure.  The excess of births over deaths in the same period was 110,000.  Thus for the three year period April 1981-April 1984 it is tentatively estimated that there was a net outward migration of some 18,000 or 6,000 per annum.</P>

      <P>I understand from the IDA that it has been advised by the company in question that because of substantial over-capacity in certain sections <Col N="1493" /> of its operations, it is considering the transfer to an associate company in Northern Ireland of a particular machine which has not been in regular use for some time.  It has been made clear to the company that, if it were to proceed with the transfer, as proposed, the question would arise of repayment to the IDA of the grant involved.  The over-capacity problem affecting the company is, I understand, due to severe trading difficulties and continuing losses experienced in recent years.  These difficulties have already led to a reduction in the workforce and, regrettably, further redundancies are to take effect from Friday next, 8 February 1985.  I understand the latter redundancies are not directly connected with the fate of the machine referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am informed that the total grants paid to the company by IDA amount to £569,209 (capital grants £554,783; training grants £14,421).</P>

      <P>Unemployment repayment claims are normally dealt with at four-weekly intervals. Accordingly, the taxpayer should submit a further claim for repayment any time after 6 February, if he is still unemployed, and it will be dealt with as quickly as possible.</P>

The claimant was subsequently paid unemployment benefit until she exhausted her entitlement having reached 312 days on 5 November 1984.</P>

      <P>There is no evidence that old age pensioners generally experience difficulty in obtaining payment in respect of their pension orders each Friday.  An Post, through its country-wide network <Col N="1538" /> of post offices, provides a very acceptable level of service to social welfare recipients which, it is considered, would not necessarily be provided by a cheque payment system.  Where a pensioner is unable to cash his pension orders personally arrangements can be made for the appointment of an agent for this purpose.</P>
      <P>The changeover to a system of complete payment by cheque would not necessarily, therefore, be to the advantage of social welfare beneficiaries.  However, the Department is undertaking a review of all its payment systems to ensure that in the context of the Department's computerisation programme it will be possible to avail as far as possible and where necessary of the most modern methods of payment.  Progress in this area will depend on the rate of development of computer facilities.</P>

      <P>The person concerned who applied for unemployment benefit from October 1984 was employed as a part time cleaner from May 1981 to June 1984 for less than 18 hours a week.  Her employer had been deducting contributions at the Class A rate in respect of this employment.  The relevant regulations relating to part time employment provide that, where such employment is for less than 18 hours a week and the person is not mainly dependent for her livelihood on the remuneration derived therefrom, the employment is insurable for occupational injury benefits only at the Class J rate.  Before the claim of the person concerned to unemployment benefit could be decided a formal decision on the correct rate of PRSI contribution applicable in her case was sought.  A deciding officer held that she was not mainly dependent on her earnings from her part time employment and decided that the employment was therefore insurable at the Class J rate of contribution which counts for occupational injury benefits only.</P>

      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 2 April 1984 but his claim was disallowed from 20 June 1984 on the grounds that his means exceeded the statutory limit.  He applied for unemployment benefit on 16 July 1984 but his entitlement could not be determined until inquiries had been made to establish that his employment <Col N="1542" /> during the period from 5 November 1983 to 22 November 1983 was insurable at a class of contribution which provided cover against unemployment.  The case was referred to a social welfare officer to make these inquiries.  He was not at home when the social welfare officer called at his house but arrangements have been made for the social welfare officer to call on him again this week so that the inquiries can be completed.  His unemployment benefit claim will be determined in the light of the outcome of these inquiries.</P>

      <P>It is proposed to take Questions Nos. 539, 540 and 541 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The statutory contribution conditions for qualification for retirement and old <Col N="1560" /> age contributory pension provide that the person must (i) have contributions paid at an appropriate rate in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance, and (ii) for retirement pension, have a yearly average of at least 24 contributions or, for old age contributory pension, have a yearly average of at least 20 contributions.  This average is calculated over the period from 5 January 1953, or year of entry into insurance, if later, to the end of the contribution year preceding the one in which pension age is reached.</P>
    <P>In calculating the yearly average a person having 20 years ordinary contributions since 5 January 1953 would in the normal course satisfy the qualifying conditions and would have an entitlement to pension from the Department although at a reduced rate.</P>
    <P>A special reduced rate of contribution providing cover for widow's and orphan's pensions, deserted wife's and occupational injury benefits only is payable in respect of employment in the public service generally, including CIE, where the employment is permanent and pensionable and there are adequate superannuation and sick pay arrangements. Supervisory grades in CIE come within these categories.  It is understood that the CIE grades involved are given credit for pre-promotion service for pension purposes in the company's own superannuation scheme.</P>
    <P>The question of pension entitlements is a matter which has been raised by a number of people in relation to various categories of insured persons including CIE supervisors and has been put to the Commission on Social Welfare who are carrying out a general review of all social welfare schemes.</P>

He is not entitled to payment of pay-related benefit as he had insufficient earnings in the 1982-83 year which governs his entitlement.</P>
      <P>The delay in issuing benefit was due to a combination of factors.  His claim was not received in the Department until 10 October 1984 but it was admitted from 28 August as he had been a patient in Mallow hospital.  However, payment could not be made at the outset because according to the Department's records he did not have enough qualifying contributions in the year governing his claim. This problem was resolved in December when the question of outstanding contributions was clarified.  Due to an administrative error the initial payments were not issued until 11 January 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was paid disability benefit from 5 September 1984 to 7 December 1984.  Payment was <Col N="1564" /> disallowed after that date following his examination by a medical referee who considered him to be capable of work.  He was subsequently certified fit to resume work on 7 January 1985 by his own doctor.  The claimant appealed against the disallowance of his benefit and in this connection a form on which to set out the grounds for his appeal has been sent to him.  When this is returned his case will be sent to an appeals officer for determination.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions, paid or credited, in the governing contribution year.  The person concerned did not satisfy the contribution condition during the contribution period 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983 which governed her entitlement to unemployment benefit from 7 November 1984 and her claim was accordingly disallowed.  Preentry credits, which are awarded to new entrants to insurance, were not awarded to her in respect of the 1982-83 year as she had originally entered insurance in 1968.  She appealed against the disallowance on 27 November 1984.  An appeals officer also decided that she did not have the relevant contributions, paid or credited, in the governing contribution year and disallowed her unemployment benefit claim.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was last insurably employed in the United <Col N="1565" /> Kingdom.  Under the EC regulations on social security the claim for sickness benefit is, therefore, the responsibility of the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastle-upon-Tyne. Accordingly, the claim and medical evidence were transferred to the UK authorities on 14 August 1984.  Subsequent medical certificates were transferred to the Department of Health and Social Security on 6 September 1984 and 14 September 1984.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Social Security have been contacted in the matter and have advised that the claimant is not entitled to sickness benefit as he does not fulfil the contribution conditions and that he was informed of the position on 30 November 1984.  However the UK authorities have also indicated that the claimant should continue to forward medical evidence of incapacity, if he remains incapable of work, as he will be awarded credited contributions which will be reckonable for retirement pension purposes.</P>
      <P>The person concerned has no Irish insurance record and is therefore not entitled to disability benefit.  However, if his means are insufficient to meet his needs he may be entitled to supplementary welfare allowance or a disabled person's maintenance allowance, both of which are subject to a means test.  In this regard he should contact his local community welfare officer.</P>

    <P>An application for a free telephone rental allowance from the person concerned was received on 10 December 1984.  To qualify for this allowance a pensioner must be living entirely alone or only with children under 15 years of age or with other people who are so incapacitated that they need constant care and attention and would therefore be unable to summon aid in an emergency.  The person concerned lives with his wife who is also a qualifying pensioner but the medical evidence furnished does not indicate that either of them would be unable <Col N="1567" /> to summon aid for the other in an emergency.
