    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if there has been a re-evaluation of the importance of the acquisition of Carton Estate, Maynooth, in the context of the recreational requirements of County Kildare following the projected population increase as outlined in the recently published ERDO report; if there has been any approach to the owners of Carton in recent times with a view to acquisition; if there has been a response from the owners; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I fully appreciate the historical and cultural significance of Carton House and demesne.  The contents of the recent ERDO report &ldquo;Eastern Region Settlement Strategy 2011&rdquo; have been noted in this context.  I have met with the owners.  However, the position in regard to Carton House and demesne is as outlined in my reply of 10 October last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to what the Minister of State has just said, can he <Col N="3" /> indicate at this stage how it might be possible to approach the owners with a proposal?  Has he considered that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>My primary consideration is the continued preservation of Carton House and demesne.  I have met quite a number of people who might be interested in co-operating in this project if the house and demesne came into public ownership at any stage.  Of course there is always the question of finance.  If Carton came on the market at the appropriate price, it might be possible to acquire it. This would be a matter for the Government so far as Exchequer financing is concerned.  There is other finance available. I have been meeting various organisations. As I understand from the owners, it is very much on the market at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister approached the local authority?  There is an awareness in the local authority of the significance of the ERDO report.  Since the publication of the report, has the Minister been in touch with the local authority to ascertain whether they might be interested in co-operating in the acquisition on a financial basis?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not met the local authority since the ERDO report was published.  Previously I met the Kildare county manager, the Dublin county manager and the Meath county manager.  I have also been in contact with Bord Fáilte and a number of other organisations all of whom have expressed considerable interest.  The basic point is that it is in private ownership.  It belongs to a number of business people who are seeking, naturally, their own price for it.  That type of price could not be met at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the property is in private ownership and that the objective is its preservation.  Would the Minister agree that it would be much easier to ensure the continued preservation of the estate if it were in public ownership?  In view of the implications in the ERDO <Col N="4" /> report, would the Minister agree that the acquisition has a much broader implication in the context of the provision of recreational facilities for the much larger population which is projected in the report?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think anyone would dispute the value of a major area like that.  There are 1,100 acres in all included in the demesne.  Its integrity has been preserved since its establishment.  I would love to see it in public ownership but there are financial constraints.  We are keeping in contact with the situation on an ongoing basis and seeking to put together some sort of a package so that we will be there when it actually comes on the market.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I have taken the view rather firmly that when a reply is by way of written statement we do not have supplementaries on it.  I ask the Deputy to accept that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a serious imbalance between imports and exports of processed wool.  There is an urgent need for measures to be taken by the Minister for Agriculture to rectify that matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will bear with the Chair for a moment. He has just shown why supplementaries are not in order on a statistical question. The Minister of State at the Taoiseach's Department gives statistics but he has nothing to do with policy.  As the Deputy rightly said, his other questions would be directed to the Minister for Agriculture. He can put down a question to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he will urgently examine the appeal made by a person (details supplied) in County Kildare against the disallowance of his claim for unemployment benefit.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison) Séamus Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that he did not satisfy the condition of being available for work.  He had indicated to his local office that he had left his employment for the purpose of starting up his own business.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance of his claim on 15 March 1985.  Arrangements are being made to have his appeal dealt with by an appeals officer at the earliest opportunity.  His entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>My understanding is that the business the person concerned was about to set up did not materialise.  Consequently, is there a possibility of re-evaluating his claim?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The claimant will be given the opportunity of a re-evaluation when the appeal is heard.  Arrangements will be made to have the appeal heard by an appeals officer at the earliest opportunity possible.  The claimant should then put to the officer all the arguments in support of his case.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare when a contributory widow's pension will be granted to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry in view of the fact that her husband was in receipt of disability benefit up to the time of his death.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of widow's contributory pension is that there must have been at least 156 contribution weeks of insurable employment, for which the appropriate contributions were paid, between the date of entry into insurance and the date the husband died or reached pension age.  According to the records of the Department this condition is not satisfied on the insurance record of this claimant or of her late husband.  On the available information, therefore, the <Col N="7" /> person concerned is not qualified for receipt of the contributory pension. Before making a formal decision on the claim, however, details of the available records in respect of herself and her late husband have been sent to her and she has been asked for any relevant information she may have on the gaps in the insurance as recorded.  Her claim will be considered in the light of her reply to this letter.</P>
      <P>In the meantime she was awarded a widow's non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £19.05, with effect from 4 January 1985.  This is the rate payable to a widow under 66 years of age with one qualified child and whose weekly means exceed £36 but do not exceed £38.  Her means, derived from a two-thirds intestacy interest in a holding of land, were assessed at £37.58 per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare in relation to over-payments of social welfare benefits, the reason in some instances the amounts agreed on for deductions per week are not adhered to by his Department; and the number of people involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>6.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of recipients of social welfare payments from whom repayments have been demanded; and the reason his Department have demanded increased payments and-or deductions each week from recipients of social welfare payments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My Department decide on the appropriate level of recovery by way of deductions from payments in cases where there has been an overpayment.  Regard is had to the size of the over-payment, the rate at which the claimant is being paid benefit and the general circumstances of the particular situation.  In any case where a claimant feels that such deductions are causing undue hardship it is open to him or her to apply to have the rate of deduction reduced and my Department will <Col N="8" /> consider all such applications on their merits.</P>
    <P>If in any case a rate of deduction has been set by the Department and this is not implemented or is subsequently altered the reason may lie in a change of circumstances coming to light.  If the Deputy has such a case in mind my Department will be happy to look into it on hearing from him.</P>
    <P>There are no readily available statistics of the kind referred to by the Deputy but the number of cases would be relatively small.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister detail the types of payment in respect of which the number of cases are relatively few?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred in his question to social welfare payments and I take that to include all forms of social welfare payments.  There are no readily available statistics of the kind the Deputy refers to but the number of cases involved are relatively few.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is only a small number of cases involved why can the Minister not tell me how many people are having money deducted from their social welfare payments?  I was in contact with the Department concerning the case of an old age pensioner whose pension had been reduced to £10.  I was told that the deduction was increased because only amounts of even numbers can be deducted by the Department computer. If this is the case it is resulting in moneys being deducted from old age pensioners particularly.  In such cases would the Minister ensure that there is more leniency? He will appreciate the difficulty of a person who is trying to live on £10 per week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is regrettable that the Deputy was not more specific in his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a separate question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy furnishes <Col N="9" /> specific details of the case he has in mind, we will be in a position to give him an accurate answer but the matter of deciding on the amounts of over-payments is one that relates to the circumstances of the individual concerned and of how the over-payment arose.  For example, there are two different ways in which over-payments can arise.  Some arise through no fault of the claimant.  Others arise because of some degree of negligence, sometimes innocent negligence, while in other cases a claimant can be deliberately deceptive in furnishing information to the Department.  These may subsequently give rise to over-payment.  There is no hard and fast answer to the question.  My reply must be very general because the Deputy's question was general but I suggest that he either table a specific question or write to me on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I have written already to the Minister about one applicant but I shall write again if that will be of help.  I was informed by the Department that there are a number of people in the same position and I was wondering why a computer was preventing people from receiving moneys that the Department had agreed previously to pay them.  Surely a computer should not be the cause of making life difficult for people living on small social welfare payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason disability benefit has been refused to a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary as he suffers from an occupational disease knows as pneumoconiosis and has been certified as suffering from this by a consultant physician of high authority; when his appeal will be held; when the decision of this appeal will be made known; and if retrospective payments will be made to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 25 June 1984 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable <Col N="10" /> of work.  He appealed against the disallowance and he was examined on 23 October 1984 by a different medical referee who also considered him to be capable of work.</P>
      <P>His case was referred to an appeals officer who decided that the claimant was not incapable of work during the period 25 June 1984 to 12 March 1985 the date of the latest medical certificate before him at that time &mdash; and was not entitled to be paid disability benefit for that period. The claimant was notified accordingly on 22 April 1985.  The claimant was awarded a disablement pension of 20 per cent for life from 9 April 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister's medical references, is it not incomprehensible that we should be asked to believe that the opinion of a medical referee, irrespective of what may be his qualifications, would be more acceptable than the word of a senior professor of medicine in one of our largest hospitals?  I refer to the person who has certified that the man concerned is incapable of work as a result of pneumoconiosis which he contracted while working in coalmines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The appeal of this claimant has been heard and decided upon.  As I pointed out, he was examined by the medical referees of the Department who expressed the opinion that he was capable of working.  It should also be noted that following an examination by a specialist on 27 September, 1982 the extent of his disablement resulting from the disease was assessed at 20 per cent for life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Apropos</i> that report received from the specialist stating that this gentleman suffered from a 20 per cent disability as a result of an occupational disease, is it not true that it was also stated within that report that this man suffered from pneumoconosis, bronchial asthma and chronic bronchitis which may have been due to and caused by the pneumoconosis?  If so, his primary medical condition would have to be <Col N="11" /> regarded as resulting from his occupation as a coalminer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not with me the report of the specialist concerned.  The result of that report is what we are concerned about.  That showed the extent of the man's disablement as being assessed as 20 per cent.  If what the Deputy states was included in the report &mdash; and I do not know whether it was &mdash; then that was taken into consideration in reaching the 20 per cent disablement decision.  All the factors would have been taken into consideration.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>First, is it customary for the Department to seek the services of an outside specialist in evaluating cases such as this?  If so, was this done in this case and if not, why not?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As stated, on the question of the disablement pension, the man was examined by a specialist.  In the case of the appeal with regard to his disability benefit, he was not examined by a specialist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister consider reviewing the case and having an outside specialist reassess it in the light of the opinion given by the consultant specialist?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question but that aspect can be looked at to see if the circumstances of the case justifies that action.  As the Deputy is aware, the system is extremely cumber-some and because of a great many appeals it is a very slow process at the moment.  If it were done in this case, that could not be taken as a precedent for every case turned down on appeal to be heard by a specialist.  That would cause an enormous backlog of appeals which would be endless.  In the particular case made by the Deputy today, I can look into the circumstances to see if they warrant that kind of action.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason the claim of persons (details supplied) in County Kilkenny for a non-contributory old age pension has been disallowed; and the reason the transfer of their holdings to their two daughters is not accepted for old age pension purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided by an appeals officer that the persons concerned are not entitled to any old age pension on the grounds that their means exceed the statutory limit.  The assessment of their means, consisting of half the weekly value of capital and the net income from the letting of a holding exceeds the statutory limit for entitlement to pension.</P>
      <P>The transfer of the holding to their two daughters is not acceptable for pension purposes because the daughters concerned are married and are not resident on the holding and the claimants concerned are considered to be still in beneficial occupation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>No doubt the Minister is aware that the whole trend and policy of the Department of Agriculture to increase land mobility is to encourage the transfer of holdings from parents to their children.  In this case the parents, in all good faith, carried out that transfer but have been deprived now of the benefits of the old age pension.  Would the Minister not agree that this is discriminatory against the daughters of the family?  There are only two daughters involved and no children.  Would the Minister condemn the two daughters to spinsterhood before their parents would qualify for the non-contributory old age pension?</P>

      <P>The circumstances of this case are that the holding is a 66 acre acre farm.  The land is considered to be good, and has an overall valuation of £40.50. The holding was transferred by deed dated 17 April 1984 to the applicants' two daughters.  The transfer was not accepted for old age pension purposes as the daughters were not living on the holding. They are both married, one living in Templemore, County Tipperary, and the other in County Clare.  The social welfare officer is satisfied that the claimants are still in beneficial occupation of the holding. The appeals officer's decision was final and conclusive, except in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.  It is open to the claimants to reapply if their circumstances deteriorate.  I should point out to the Deputy that from July 1985, because of the changes in the social welfare limits for pension qualification, a slight reduction in their capital would enable them to qualify for the minimum pension.</P>

In the case of persons who are required to submit medical evidence of incapacity at monthly intervals, payment is issued on a regular weekly basis in advance of certification.

      <P>In the case of the recent Easter holiday period, all persons on the monthly certification system &mdash; about half of the total of those receiving disability benefit &mdash; were paid the payment which would normally be received on Tuesday, 9 April, on the previous Tuesday, 2 April, instead.  In the case of all other claimants every effort was made to ensure that payments were issued on all medical certificates received in respect of qualified claims by Thrusday, 4 April.

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided by an appeals officer that the person concerned is not entitled to an old age pension on the grounds that he does not fulfil the statutory conditions as to means.  The assessment of his means, consisting of the weekly value of capital and a holding, exceed the statutory limit for entitlement to pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>In this instance the farmer has transferred his land to his nephew for health reasons and the nephew works the farm.  He has off-farm employment but he returns at night to work the farm. <Col N="19" /> I cannot understand why the farmer's application for an old age pension has been disallowed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The holding has been transferred to the nephew but this has not been accepted for old age pension purposes because the nephew is employed in a computer firm and only visits the holding at weekends.  The social welfare officer is satisfied that the claimant is still in beneficial occupation of the holding.  On 22 November 1984 a deciding officer decided he was not entitled to an old age non-contributory pension as his means exceeded the limit of £44 for entitlement to pension.  The claimant lodged an appeal against the decision on 29 November 1984 stating he had signed over his land to his nephew and that he himself was unable to work the holding as he suffered from arthritis.  The matter was referred to an appeals officer on 6 December 1984 who decided on 21 December not to allow a pension as the claimant's means exceeded the limit.  If he wishes to have his entitlement reinvestigated it is open to him to notify the Department to that effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanGriffin" hpid="Mr. Griffin Mr. Griffin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Griffin</NameTxt>
      <P>The claimant made another application but this was turned down.  The farmer has no means.

Would the Minister consider directing the appeals officer to grant the old age pension to this farmer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have no power to direct a social welfare officer or an appeals officer to do anything of that kind.  As I stated, if the claimant wishes to have his entitlement re-investigated, it is open to him to notify the Department.  The claim will then be re-investigated and the circumstances will be considered again.  The kernel of the matter is that the social welfare officers, who have the statutory power to make the decision in this matter, did not accept for old age pension purposes the <Col N="20" /> transfer of the land because of the fulltime occupation of the nephew and the fact that he visited the holding only at weekends.  There is also the factor that the claimant is still in beneficial occupation of the holding, is still living on the holding.</P>

    <P>Proposals for improving the efficiency of agricultural structures were agreed to <Col N="22" /> by the Council of Ministers at their meeting on 11-12 March and entered into force on 1 April 1985.  The main provisions are:</P>
    <P>(i)  Aid for investments of up to 60,000 ECU per man work unit and 120,000 ECU per holding in any six year period for fulltime farmers earning less than a reference level of income who take out improvement plans for improving the economic situation of their holdings and undertake to keep simplified accounts.</P>
    <P>(ii)  Special aids for young farmers &mdash; under 40 years of age, comprising: (a) installation aid, consisting of a single premium of up to 7,500 ECU and an interest rate subsidy on loans to cover the costs arising from the first installation; (b) additional investment aid, provided the young farmer submits an improvement plan within five years of being installed on a holding for the first time.  The granting of these aids would be subject to the possession of specified occupational skills and to certain other requirements.</P>
    <P>(iii)  Aid for keeping accounts, launching aids for mutual assistance groups, relief services groups and management services groups.</P>
    <P>(iv)  Aids for private afforestation.</P>
    <P>(v)  Aids for training courses for farmers, farm workers, leaders and managers of co-operatives and producer groups and special courses to enable young farmers to qualify for the special aids earmarked for them.</P>
    <P>(vi)  National aids for farming in environmentally sensitive areas.</P>
    <P>(vii)  Headage payments in disadvantaged areas largely as at present, except that headage payments may be made for up to 20 dairy cows as against ten in the past.  Payment may also be made in respect of equine animals.  Where a farmer in receipt of headage payments afforests all or part of his land the area could continue to be taken into account for headage payments for a period of 15 years.</P>
    <P>The major changes under the new measure relate to on-farm investment. <Col N="23" /> At present Community aid is available only to development farmers following a plan to achieve the comparable income within the period of the plan.  Under the new system, the comparable income would no longer be a target figure; instead any fulltime farmer with an income below a reference level and having acceptable vocational skills, who submits a farm plan designed to improve or stabilise his income could qualify for Community aid.  This means that Community assisted investment aid will now be available to a wider band of farmers. It should be noted that the on-farm investment aid is mandatory on member states whereas most of the other measures are optional.</P>
    <P>By and large, the new regulation is a considerable improvement on the previous directive.  A new scheme to implement the regulation is being drawn up by my Department at present and it is intended to have it operational by 1 October next.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I am most concerned at the unilateral decision by the Canadian Government to limit beef imports from the EC and I have had the matter pursued actively with the <Col N="27" /> EC Commission.  In such cases the Commission negotiates for the Community in close consultation with the member states whose exports have been affected.  In the present instance these are Ireland and Denmark.  I also raised the matter at the Council of Agriculture Ministers and I left the Commission in no doubt as to the importance of this trade to us and as to the need for an urgent and equitable solution.</P>
    <P>Negotiations between the Commission and the Canadian authorities about the whole question of beef exports to Canada, including existing contracts, are in progress.  No settlement has yet emerged and I would prefer not to comment further while negotiations are in progress.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has.  The results speak for themselves.  The increase was not as sustained as I hoped but admittedly it put on as much as 5p a pound.  While there was a depressed period a couple of weeks ago the situation has again improved considerably. It is very much due to the amount of meat taken in under the APS scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he will introduce a bonding scheme to protect farmers who deliver livestock to meat plants; if he will ensure that the creditors of Clover Meats Ltd. will be paid in full under the <Col N="28" /> scheme; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the particular circumstances of the livestock trade a bonding system could be open to serious abuse. Moreover, it would involve additional cost for the meat industry, which would be reflected in the prices paid to producers. If, however, farming organisations have specific suggestions to put forward in regard to protecting sellers of livestock, I will have them examined although it is doubtful if a bonding scheme would really be appropriate for the livestock trade.</P>
      <P>So far as the creditors of Clover Meats Ltd. are concerned I regret that there are no funds at my disposal from which assistance could be provided.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have examined the question of a bonding scheme in great detail and the consensus is that it is not such a good idea.  It would tend to protect the inefficient operators in the meat industry and it would also be of fairly considerable cost to the farmer.  In relation to Clover Meats, we certainly do not want to see a recurrence of that type of collapse.  Certain moves are afoot, but I do not want to say too much here in case I cause ripples among the groups in consultation.  However, I am encouraged by the nature of the discussions which are taking place.  I do not want to raise hopes unduly, but people are working very hard and I have indicated that I will give every assistance towards resolving the problem.</P>

Surely the Minister is aware that bonding schemes have operated successfully, for instance, for tour operators.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 18, to delete &ldquo;£5,300&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£5,500&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These amendments relate to exemptions from the income tax code and a proposal to extend the exemption for married couples to £5,500 which is the equivalent of £105 per week and for a single individual <Col N="200" /> to £2,750 or the equivalent of £52.50 per week.  Let me say, in introducing this amendment, some introductory words about the burden of income tax that we propose certain people who are particularly poorly off be exempted from.  I want to relate my comments in the first instance to remarks made by the Minister yesterday in connection with the growth of income tax and the growth of the interest payments on our foreign debt which is swallowing up almost all of the income tax being paid in.  The Minister said yesterday that since 1979 foreign interest payments by the Exchequer have increased more than sevenfold and interest payments on the national debt now absorb almost all of the receipts from income tax.  Therefore, in all of the debates we are going to have here we will have to face the reality that the burden of income taxation that we have been discussing for some days here now is a direct consequence of the huge increase in foreign debt, as the Minister puts it, since 1979 especially.  That we all share this burden is one thing, but the categories we are particularly concerned about here are in a very special situation. I propose, and I think the House will agree, that these people should not be made to pay for the huge increase in the foreign debt that the Minister especially has been responsible for.</P>
    <P>I would like to outline how the growth of income tax has followed the growth of foreign debt under the biggest borrower of them all, the Minister at present in the House, who is not just a big spender but the biggest we have ever experienced in this nation, and others have been put on the record of this House from time to time.  In 1984 an amount of 36p in every £ of total revenue in this nation went to service the interest on foreign debt.  That figure is likely to increase to at least 40p in every £ this year, and that is a direct consequence of the huge growth in the foreign debt under this Minister.  As a consequence of his disastrous decisions and particularly his splurge on foreign borrowing, we are coming back to this House today, tomorrow and all this week and we are going to impose levels of <Col N="201" /> income tax burden on the people, particularly the lower paid, which by any standards are crippling and certainly should not be imposed on married couples who earn less than £105 per week.</P>
    <P>Let me illustrate again for the record just how much this has grown under this Minister.  When he came to office in 1982, the total foreign debt was less than £7 billion.  Since this Minister came to office in a little over two years it has grown now to almost £10.5 billion.  It has increased by almost £3.5 billion or 50 per cent under this notionally disciplined Minister who is regulating the public finances.  The increase in that couple of years is more than the accumulated foreign debt was when I happened to be Minister for Finance in 1980, a little over four years ago, at £3.217 billion.  Now it has increased by at least £3.5 billion under this Minister. Because it has so increased, on his statement yesterday evening the burden of income tax has to increase to the extent that 36p in every £ of total revenue&mdash;not just income tax&mdash;plus total service charges of all kinds is going to service the increase in this debt for which this Minister has been directly responsible.  Over the years up to 1980 the figure had accumulated to £3.217 billion and the Minister, who has prided himself on getting everything in order and in bringing down borrowing, has in that couple of years seen it increase by almost £3.5 billion.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that we see the corresponding huge increase in income tax to even begin to cope with the huge increase in the debt under this Minister. In one year alone, 1984, this Minister raised something short of £2 million gross in foreign debt &mdash; £1.969 million &mdash; an astronomical figure by comparison with any previous borrowing by any previous Minister.  He has that to his eternal credit and no matter how long we are fortunate enough to be still in control of our own affairs &mdash; and some of his colleagues are casting doubt on that these days&mdash; no future Minister for Finance could possibly boast of such a record.</P>
    <P>The total national debt at the end of 1982 was £12.8 billion.  At the end of 1984 it was £18.5 billion, an increase of almost <Col N="202" /> £6 billion or 50 per cent, and at this moment it is not less than £19.5 billion. At the end of this year, if we are lucky, it will be less than £21 billion.  That growth which took place over a few years is costing the taxpayers very dearly.  This is borrowing run wild.  The biggest borrower of all has presented himself as the person who, for the first time, is prepared to regulate, control and discipline borrowing and to make us face reality.  The document, <i>Building on Reality,</i> apparently is based on the very shaky foundation that we are going to get our financial affairs in order.  With that kind of borrowing pattern leading to an increased tax burden, the chances of us even beginning to get our affairs in order under this Government are clearly becoming more remote every day.</P>
    <P>Last year, as a consequence not just of the extent of the borrowing but the nature of the borrowing, putting all our eggs in the dollar basket, our taxpayers found themselves faced with an extra £375 million because of exchange rate fluctuations. The Minister may say that was true if we paid at the end of the year, and we did not have to, but, at the end of the year, because of exchange rate fluctuations the increase in the interest payments on our foreign debt, particularly in the dollar, was £375 million, almost twice the extra amount of income tax the Minister proposes to raise this year.  All these factors put this debate on income tax and income tax exemptions into context because until such time as this Government can begin to gain some control over their borrowing programme, particularly their foreign borrowing which has been of record and disastrous proportions, then the reality is, as the Minister acknowledged last night, that since 1979 &mdash; I do not know why he picked 1979, he could have picked a later year but I think he wanted to lump in another few years because borrowing in a big way began in 1983&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am about to conclude. My concern is that if the Minister is capable of making two totally false statements simply to give the impression that he is controlling public finances, then I begin to wonder about the worth of statements made in this House.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla put down an amendment which is exactly the same as ours.  I hope we will receive support from the House on these amendments.  I am speaking particularly of the Labour Party.  It is time this nonsense stopped. They can go to Cork, make statements and commitments and give the impression that they have a separate soul, which survives, but they absent themselves from a debate of this kind which is so crucial to the interests of the lower paid, and they will be absent because not one member of the Labour Party will come into this House to argue for an increase. In Cork they speak in tongues which are different from the Minister for Finance when expressing their concern for the lower paid, but what will they do when we call the vote?  They will vote like sheep to reduce the level of exemptions for the lower paid.  It is time this farce stopped. It is time there was an end to the nonsense of differing statements made by different Ministers, all proving that they are alive and well, and appealing to their flock. Commentators can say that only the Minister, myself, Deputy Mac Giolla and another Fianna Fáil colleague are present in this House now.  There are no Labour members here.  Let us see from what they are absenting themselves.</P>
      <P>The Minister proposes to exempt a married couple who have the princely income of £5,300 gross, marginally over £100 a week.  We are proposing to increase the exemption limit of £105 for a married couple or £52.50 per week for a single person.  Surely that is not asking too much.  We have been very measured in our amendments and have avoided the temptation to make proposals such as the Minister's colleagues made when they were on this side of the House while I was Minister for Finance.  We are concentrating particularly on the lower paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="206" /> A few figures will demonstrate the increase in the income tax burden since this Minister took office.  A married couple earning only £105 per week and a single person earning only £52.50 should at least be exempt from any increase.  In 1980 total income tax was just over £1 billion.  That was the year I sat in the Minister's seat.  Under the proposals now being made, total income tax will be more than doubled at £2,131 million.  That is a direct consequence of the huge growth in debt which is sweeping up that huge increase.  When this Minister came into office the yield from income tax stood at £1.459 million and the figure now proposed is £2.131 million, a huge increase by any standards.  Income tax has increased as a proportion of GNP from 11.5 per cent to an amount marginally short of 14 per cent.  That tells the story of how this Government are delivering on their promise to reduce the burden of income tax on the PAYE sector, as they indicated in their fictitious document, Joint Programme for Government. Documents come freely from this Government &mdash; statements, <i>Building on Reality,</i> national corporations and so on. The record is very different.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the enormous growth in the burden of taxation is that there is resistence in terms of receipts because the numbers at work are diminishing and because the level of taxation is acting as a disincentive.  It is patently obvious to people on very low salaries that they could probably be better off not working since they would qualify for a medical card and for a reduction in differential rent on a local authority house. They might be better off working a three-day week on one of the new Government schemes.  A married man realises that if he earns more than £105 he has to pay tax and that he might be better off not working.  That is the kind of disincentive we are offering.</P>
    <P>Ten years ago in Ireland personal tax as a percentage of total tax income was the second lowest in the EC.  It was then of the order of 22.5 per cent, while in the UK it was 33.4 per cent, in Germany 31.8 per cent, in Belgium 29.4 per cent, the <Col N="207" /> Netherlands 27.6 per cent, Luxembourg 26.1 per cent and Denmark, always very high, 57.6 per cent.  We were at the bottom of the scale in terms of tax on personal income as a percentage of total tax revenue.  Under this Government we are second from the top &mdash; Denmark is still in top position at about 51.9 per cent. We are a very comfortable second at something short of 30 per cent.  Is it any wonder that we find ourselves at a disadvantage in terms of our competitors, that we are not benefiting from market opportunities, that those who come here one day go away another day?  Is it any wonder that the Minister has to introduce this rather strange notion about incentives for foreign companies to invest here when tax levels are so very much higher here than anywhere else?</P>
    <P>In 1980 the average tax payment under the PAYE system was £1,130.  By the end of 1983 that figure had increased to £1,875, an increase of over 40 per cent on the 1980 figure.  At the end of 1984 the average figure was almost £2,100 and one can only project that by the end of this year the average payment for the PAYE worker will be about £2,300.  We seem to be determined to stay right at the top in terms of our PAYE tax imposition. The Government ignore the impact on the incentive to work and the crushing impact on morale.  It is also frightening investment out of the country.  All these figures follow the huge borrowing splurge by this Government.  It follows as night follows day.  Even then we are only covering a percentage of it.  We will never catch up.  No matter how much tax we impose it will not be adequate to cope with the increased burden of debt.  It is not as if borrowings were being used for productive purposes.  The money is being used to service interest payments on loans made two and three years ago.  It is being used particularly to service the current debt.  I will ask the Minister to give a figure for this and it will probably be in the region of £6 million gross.  In net terms we will have to reduce about 35 per cent of that gross figure.</P>
    <P>In view of the inequity in having in the <Col N="208" /> tax net people at the level of income I have referred to and the impact that has on their attitudes, there is a very good case for increasing the exemption limit. Perhaps it will cost £4 million or £5 million, but there would be a greater justification for spending that sum on those people than there is for spending such an amount on public relations consultants attached to the Government.  The Taoiseach has only to talk to Senator Kennedy and it is big news&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Government would be doing the public a service if they got rid of all their PR consultants &mdash; their officials in the Department are there to do the job in any case &mdash; which is costing the taxpayer about £4 million per annum as is obvious from all the propaganda emanating every day from some Minister or another and sometimes even disagreeing with one another.  If we spent that money on the less well off section of the community we might get back to where we were four years ago.  That section should get some little breathing space from the heaviest tax burden &mdash; Denmark excepted &mdash; of any country in Europe.  However, Denmark provide services for the less well off of a kind to which we cannot aspire.  They can see that if they pay higher rates of tax there should be an order of social justice which is absent here.  I will be speaking later on about the other issues such as tax bands, income levies and so on.  I am asking the Minister, who is responsible for the huge growth in our debt which, in turn, is responsible for the huge growth in tax, to shift the burden even slightly on the lower paid.  I hope he has it in his heart to respond to them, if not to me.</P>

      <P>These amendments are put down basically to increase the exemption limits by 10 per cent for tax purposes.  The Minister is giving an increase of approximately 6 per cent in exemption limits to the lower paid worker; but for a number of years, due to the non-indexation of taxation, the lower paid workers have become increasingly burdened by taxation.  Ten years ago only 3 per cent were paying above the standard rate of taxation, but that figure has now reached 40 per cent.  Over the past few years low paid workers, who should not be paying tax, have been brought into the tax net by virtue of the increase in inflation.  While there was an apparent increase in their wages, due to inflation there was no actual increase and they were brought into the tax net, which they should not be in.  We are endeavouring to redress that here and, although there are all sorts of projections with regard to a lower inflation rate this year, similar projections in other years were not attained.  We are asking that last year's inflation rate of 10 per cent should be the exemption rate here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The level of tax on personal incomes has been accepted as enormous by everybody, and the Government admitted this in <i>Building on Reality.</i> They recognised this by saying that there was a very high level of taxation and that the Government guaranteed that there would be no increase in taxation.  They really meant that there would be no increase in the overall level of taxation.  They did not mean that some people's tax would not be increased and others reduced and they did not intend to broaden the taxation system.  The statement made by the Government was simply an attempt to reassure those on PAYE, who are already overburdened by tax, that they would have no further taxation imposed on them.  However, they did not give any assurance that other areas which had not been previously taxed would not come into the net.  Since that assurance was given by the Minister he has disclosed a new system of taxation, particularly in regard to the levy imposed on Bord Telecom. This had already been done in the <Col N="210" /> case of the ESB.  The Minister dipped his hand into their till, which meant that the ESB had to increase their prices to consumers.  Of course, that was not regarded as tax, although it was money going to the Exchequer.</P>

      <P>They are a method of imposing taxation because the consumer has to pay for them and the money goes to the Exchequer.  The purpose of taxation is to provide money for the Exchequer.  I am simply pointing out that, despite the assurances that there would be no increase in taxation, the Minister has used a device whereby the consumer has to pay more in order to provide more money for the Exchequer. In our amendments we are trying to give some small relief to the PAYE sector, particularly to the lower paid income earners. In a later amendment we are calling for a higher rate of taxation, 70 per cent. Higher income earners will pay for this and money would not be taken from the Exchequer.  We are endeavouring to give relief to people on the bottom of the scale and increase taxation from those earning over £20,000 a year or in the case of married couples £40,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We put down a similar amendment last year but it was not accepted by the Minister.  People in the lower income bracket face great difficulty trying to make ends meet and pay mortgages.  It is incumbent on the Minister to give some further relief to them to ensure that they will have some stability and security. They face further difficulty each year as prices rise and so on.  It is a real struggle <Col N="211" /> for them to live.  I do not know if the Minister is aware of that.</P>
    <P>The take from income tax, as Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out, has increased at an enormous rate over the last three or four years.  This year will be no different from any other year despite the assurances given in <i>Building on Reality.</i> It will be seen that the take from income tax will have increased considerably on the take for last year.  This is at a time when there is a great outcry from the public service about the Minister for the Public Service's hamfisted effort to cut back the numbers employed in the Civil Service. The one in three embargo is having an extraordinary effect on the efforts of the Revenue Commissioners and in other parts of the public service to bring in the revenue due to the Government.  When revenue is not taken in the Minister for Finance must increase taxation the following year to make up for the loss.</P>
    <P>Figures were given last year under various headings showing the amount of tax estimated to be ultimately payable and the actual amount paid.  The unpaid amount under each heading showed there was an enormous sum outstanding.  The 1983-84 figures were not available for many of the items.  Examples are: income tax excluding PAYE, £120 million outstanding for 1983-84, £65 million outstanding for 1982-83, £21 million outstanding for 1981-82, £12 million outstanding for 1980-81.  In the case of corporation tax there was £190 million outstanding for 1983-84, £65 million for 1982-83 and £11 million for 1981-82.  In the case of capital gains tax, VAT and capital acquisitions tax the sums outstanding ran into hundreds of millions of pounds.  In all his shouting about efficiency, management and new technology can the Minister for the Public Service indicate any efficient manager in the private sector who would endeavour to reduce staff in that hamfisted way?  Surely he would retain the most efficient staff and those who are most productive and reduce staff in inefficient areas.  The Minister obviously has no conception of the effects of his action on the public <Col N="212" /> service, on the revenue due to the Government, on the taxpayer, on productivity and investment, job creation and in fact on everything.  The series of amendments are to deal with the issue of reasonable exemption limits for those on low incomes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendments which are the subject of debate are emotive issues.  Deputies on the opposite side have pointed out that the PAYE sector have carried an enormous burden for some time.  It started with the expensive splurge which was engaged in in 1977. The economic policy pursued by the then Government was to extend the public service without any real control.  The Minister should be heartened to hear Deputy Mac Giolla admit at long last that public service cuts are necessary.  A few moments ago he advocated that selective cuts should be made.  I am sure Fianna Fáil intend to make cuts.  By putting down the amendment Deputy O'Kennedy is saying that there are areas where the Government might make a saving. Implied in that is that there will be public service cuts.</P>
      <P>As the record shows, the Department of Finance decided to engage in cuts in July 1982 when Deputy Haughey was Taoiseach.  There were substantial cuts in the health service and the public were so shocked that they rejected Fianna Fáil at the 1982 election.  I agree with Deputies O'Kennedy and Mac Giolla that the basic income tax limits should be maintained. I also agree that the burden on the less well off is great.  However, the Minister has to take the whole of society into account when deciding on what to do. Modest targets were set in <i>Building on Reality.</i> Is it not an achievement to be able to pay the huge numbers of unemployed weekly without a revolution?</P>

      <P>I do not believe that Deputies O'Kennedy or Mac Giolla want cuts in social welfare.  They put down this amendment about income tax exemption limits knowing that it would cost the Exchequer a substantial amount of money.  When the Minister puts this package together he is stuck with what he said in <i>Building on Reality.</i> He said there would be no increase in personal taxation.  The public service will get an increase of approximately 6 per cent in 1985.  We should be most concerned about the private sector where their capacity to bear the burden of taxation is limited.  Their earnings improved by more than 6 per cent in general.  I sympathise with the Deputies who are making a plea for an increase in income tax exemption limits.  This must be tempered with a realisation of the facts.  They must say where the cuts are to be made.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the distribution of our taxation between different groups and rates is concerned, the total number of people exempted from taxation by this budget will be about 10,500.  The total number of people who will avail of marginal relief after the provisions of this budget are taken into account, will be about 36,900. Prior to the budget some 47.1 per cent of taxpayers were paying tax at the higher rates.  After the budget 40.3 per cent of taxpayers will be paying tax at the higher rates.  That is a reply to one of the points raised by Deputy Mac Giolla.  We are actually reducing the proportion of taxpayers who are paying tax at the higher rates.  With the system as we now have it, 4.3 per cent of taxpayers will be on marginal relief; 55.4 per cent will be <Col N="214" /> paying tax at 35 per cent; 24 per cent will be paying tax at 48 per cent; and 16.3 per cent will be paying tax at 60 per cent.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Comparing taxes on personal income with gross domestic product, that is, total taxes on personal income as a proportion of gross domestic product, of 22 OECD countries in 1982 we ranked ninth with a proportion of 11.8 per cent.  The OECD average for that year was 12 per cent, so ours was a little below the average.  The EC average for that year was 11.53 per cent, so we were a shade above the EC average.  We were ranked ninth out of 22.  If we then compare taxes on personal income with total taxation, of the same 22 countries for the same year, 1982, we ranked eleventh. Personal income in Ireland that year accounted for 29.83 per cent of total taxation. The OECD average was 32.65 per cent, so we were noticeably lower than the OECD average.  The EC average was 27.95 per cent, so we were somewhat higher than the EC average.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To compare taxes on income and profits, for which I have figures for 1983, that is, a combination of income tax, corporation tax and capital gains tax, comparing that total with total GDP and expressing that total as a percentage of total GDP, of 16 OECD countries on which I have information for 1983, Ireland ranked eighth.  Comparing taxes on income and profits as I have defined them with total taxation, out of 15 countries <Col N="215" /> we ranked eleventh in 1983.  On any one of those four comparisons for 1982 and 1983, we did not do all that badly in terms of our comparison with the scale of other countries.</P>
    <P>That is not the total picture as Deputy O'Kennedy ought to know by now.  We have to relate the position to our relative income per head which Deputy O'Kennedy does not do.  I am not sure that he really knows quite which point he wants to make.  On the earlier points he was making, if we compare the cost of servicing debt with total tax revenue, in 1980 debt servicing costs amounted to 30.2 per cent of total tax revenue.  In 1982, a year in which Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues were in Government although Deputy O'Kennedy was rather higher up on the benches, the figure was 36.4 per cent.  In 1984, the figure was 32.1 per cent which represents, in the terms Deputy O'Kennedy was using, an improvement compared with either 1980 or 1982, years in respect of which he seems to express some passing relative satisfaction.</P>
    <P>I might add that the only occasion I can find in the past 15 years when the cost of servicing the national debt equalled the net receipt of income tax was 1982, again a year in which perhaps Deputy O'Kennedy did not have a great deal of influence over what the Government were doing although his party colleagues were in Government.  Deputy O'Kennedy made more than passing references to various aspects of foreign debt and the financing of foreign debt payments, increases in foreign debt and so on.  I do not intend to go into all of those questions in detail because I know you would not permit me to do so, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Once again Deputy O'Kennedy has shown what I can only describe as the most incomprehensible refusal to make even the slightest attempt to find out just what is going on in international financial markets.  If Deputy O'Kennedy can find some place where he can finance our total borrowing <Col N="216" /> programme by borrowing in pesetas, or escudos, or drachmas, or any other currency that is in a lower position on the kind of scale he and I know about, than the punt &mdash; and there are many of them &mdash; I will be very happy to hear his advice because I doubt that any one of those countries would dare to engage in lending on the kind of scale that would get them into international markets.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues must realise that we cannot talk in isolation or in total abstraction of what is happening in relation to our foreign borrowing programme or even our domestic borrowing programme but that is what the Deputy has been doing for the past year or so.  However, his credibility in financial circles had declined to vanishing point.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy wishes to control borrowing, especially foreign borrowing, but I intend reminding him about that during the course of this year because it makes him uncomfortable to be reminded of something he said before particularly when he begins to espouse the cause of controlling borrowing or expenditure.  The Deputy is fine on principles and generalities but he is nowhere so far as detail is concerned.  I have never heard him offer any specific system or series of proposals that would bring about the kind of control he talks of.  The kind of control I operate and which the Deputy appears to find inadequate, seems to annoy him intensely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 1 proposes increases in the general exemption limits, <Col N="217" /> an increase of £300 to £5,300 in the general exemption limit for married couples, and increase of £150 for single persons and a series of related increases in the age exemption limits.  But considering only the general exemption limits, the increases and the associated marginal relief are estimated to cost about £2.8 million this year or about £4.7 million in a full year.  These changes will benefit some 7,200 taxpayers.  The total cost of all the increases by way of the general exemption limit and the age exemption limit will be £3.7 million in 1985 and £6.3 million in a full year.  As I said earlier, these will be of benefit to 10,500 taxpayers with 36,900 more benefiting from marginal relief.</P>
      <P>The amendments proposed would give rise to an additional cost to the Exchequer of £2.4 million in 1985 and £4 million in a full year.  I would remind the House that the total budget changes in income tax this year, taking account of the personal allowances, the exemption limits, the changes in the structure of the system itself, the continuation of the PRSI allowance and the continuation of the various other allowances provided for in this Bill will reduce tax revenue by £113.8 million in total or £189.8 million in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly there is no dispute in the House on the general principle and desirability of increasing both the ordinary exemption limits and the age exemption limits.  Where there is room for discussion is in relation to the amount of increase in each year.</P>
      <P>We have considered very carefully what the distribution of total income tax take will be for different groups of taxpayers during this year.  There was a limited amount of tax revenue to redistribute to the taxpayer and we have made a judgment as to the most equitable and fairest way of redistributing that amount. The increases in exemption limits proposed in the Bill appear to us, in that context, to be the fairest allocation we can make of those changes.  By the standards of recent years and given what has been happening in terms of inflation, the increase in the exemption limits are fairly generous.  For that reason I cannot accept the amendments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When I proposed the increase in the exemption limits &mdash; and my figure is exactly the same as that proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla &mdash; I was prepared to contemplate that the gross cost might be of the order of £5 million which would reduce to a figure in the <Col N="219" /> region of £3 million net.  The Minister has indicated now that the gross cost in 1985 would be £2.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, but I shall return in a moment to the matter of some of the other strange ways the Minister has of presenting increases as reductions and of presenting reductions as increases. The gross extra cost this year for exempting married couples and in this instance we are talking about young married couples, on income tax of about £105 per week gross, would be £2.8 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>Deputy Carey has asked correctly where the saving is to be made in the event of the proposal being accepted.

      <P>Let me come to another reality.  If the Minister continues somehow to live in the total confusion that he is actually decreasing the level of income tax, I have to leave him in his own abysmal ignorance.  Mind you, it is less than it would have been had he not <Col N="222" /> done something else, had he not increased the figure to 70 per cent.  If he reduces the tax exemption level, of course the figure is less.  It is less than it might have been had he done something more outrageous.  I grant him that right now.  He can never argue that case with me again.  Income tax is £240 million or thereabouts more than last year.  That is a fact.</P>

      <P>We then come to the Minister's selective misrepresentation.  I said earlier that I was concerned at statements which he was making in the House and as to how one could rely on them, having regard to the fact that he was capable yesterday of making statements which were outrageously untrue in fact in every sense.

It was back, in 1977, to £545 million &mdash; a year that Deputy Carey seems to be fairly infatuated with.  There was an increase of £350 million between 1975 and 1979.

      <P>I just want to put on the record that the Minister acknowledged that in 1980 30.2 per cent of total revenue was going towards servicing the foreign debt.  My authority that that has increased to 36.5 per cent is none other than the Minister himself, in a reply given in this House on 20 February 1984.  He said that total tax revenue as defined for budgetary purposes had grown from 26.7 per cent of GNP to an estimated 36.5 per cent of GNP in 1984.  Those are the Minister's own figures.  How can he by some sleight of hand try to reduce that to a figure of 32 per cent?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The facts are there, in a reply which he himself gave.  Total tax as a percentage of GNP has been growing enormously under this Minister, as has total foreign borrowing.  Before yielding to Deputy Mac Giolla who has a keen interest in this &mdash; as anyone must have &mdash; I must say that when the Minister starts to quote that we are halfway in the OECD countries league, he should confine himself to EC countries.  In the OECD league about which he is talking, Switzerland, Sweden, Finland, Japan, Austria and Norway are above us in terms of tax.  However, the Minister does not know, which leads him to put us halfway in that league, that in each of those cases the growth in their economy in the last few years has been enormous.  They have used their tax &mdash; or imposition, if you like &mdash; to fuel very considerable economic growth and to cut back on unemployment to a point where it hardly exists.  It is significant that in the OECD countries who are above us in terms of tax, whether it be Switzerland, Finland, Norway, Austria, Sweden and, of course, Japan, the level of unemployment is so much lower than here that they cannot be compared. For that reason, I confined my analysis to the EC countries, as we are a <Col N="226" /> member of the Community.  I said that in that context we have had the unenviable distinction for some time of being the second highest in terms of income tax &mdash; after Denmark &mdash; when in former years we were the lowest.  For the past few years we have steadily risen in the scale, and although we are second only to Denmark we cannot claim we are providing anything like the same kind of social services as the Danes.  We pay more income tax than Britain, Italy, the Netherlands and so on.  Let us not talk about the OECD but let us talk about the EC of which we are a member.</P>
      <P>I have demonstrated this to the Minister more than once but he does not seem capable of understanding and that is a pity.  If the rest of us are not capable of understanding that is only a personal matter; but this Minister is responsible for the nation's finances in terms of regulating our borrowing, which he is increasing at an enormous rate.  He is responsible for regulating our taxation, which he is increasing at an enormous rate, and the same applies with regard to unemployment. Thus, when the Minister misunderstands the position, it becomes very serious.  If Deputy Mac Giolla, Deputy Reynolds or I misunderstand the situation with regard to borrowing that is something personal to each of us, but it is a serious matter when the Minister misunderstands it.  When I speak of a borrowing strategy, the Minister keeps asking me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I agree with the Chair.  What I have to say will take about 20 seconds.  The Minister asked me to enlighten him and I propose to do that. I never said to the Minister he should borrow in pesetas, escudos or drachmas. I know they are not available on the international currency market.  I have advised the Minister in the past two years that we should have a mix of currencies in our borrowing portfolio.  I said we should have the Swiss franc which we had in former years, but the Minister moved away from that currency.  In my opinion we should have the Deutschemark, which was a considerable element in our borrowing; but, again, the Minister moved away from this currency.  Similarly the guilder was a considerable element in our borrowing portfolio, but the Minister moved from that currency.  I have also said we should use the Japanese yen.  We had all of these currencies in a blend in our borrowing portfolio.  I never suggested that the Minister should borrow in pesetas, escudos or drachmas and I would certainly not advise him to go chasing after these currencies.</P>

      <P>As a consequence of this borrowing splurge, of these disastrous borrowing decisions and the growth in borrowing, we find now we cannot even afford to relieve the burden on the less well off by approximately £1.8 million out of a total of more than £900 million.  We cannot afford to exempt from tax people such as married couples who have the princely sum of £105 per week.  The Minister cannot do that.  He can spend three times as much on public relations but he cannot spend it on the poor.  I am prepared to let that be the record if that is the case.  If the public <Col N="228" /> relations of this Government is more important than relieving the poor, so be it.  The Government have the numbers. The Labour Party will vote with them. They will not be here to listen to the arguments but they will vote with the Government.  They will parade their consciences in Cork and elsewhere but they will come here and vote against this humane amendment that would cost nothing.  They will win the vote but they will not win the argument.  They could not do that in the face of the facts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Kennedy. The points he has made have outlined our position clearly.  The general exemption limit is proposed to be increased from £2,500 to £2,650, an increase of less than 6 per cent.  So far as a single person over 65 is concerned, the increase is just in excess of 7 per cent.</P>
      <P>Regardless of the figures the Minister may quote, the reality is that if inflation for the period for which the exemption limit remains in force exceeds those figures, the exemption limit will be reduced in real terms.  Our amendment proposes to increase the amount the Minister is prepared to give by £100. From that point of view the amendment is most responsible.  It will not cost the Government a great deal of money and will just about maintain the real value of the exemptions in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to put a point to the Minister which I hope he will reply to specifically when he is answering.  As the Minister is aware, a system of marginal relief operates in relation to those exemption levels to take account of the fact that a person might be slightly above the exemption limit.  In the past 12 months it has been my experience that in many cases the tax office seem either unaware of that marginal relief or unwilling to operate it. I have come across dozens of cases where I concluded a person was entitled to marginal relief because they were slightly over the exemption limit but the tax office did not operate that relief.  When I contacted the tax office, ultimately they gave the marginal relief; but if I had not intervened for those people they would not <Col N="229" /> have their statutory entitlement.  I realise it is difficult to find words to cover every situation.  I do not know if it is possible for the Minister to bring in some provision here that would set out the levels of income up to which marginal relief would apply in each case but if that is possible I ask the Minister to give the matter some consideration.</P>

The Chair considers it his business to have the Bill debated in a reasonable way and as fully as possible, but if we are to spend as long on even the first few amendments as we have on this we will not make much progress.  In the end dozens of amendments and sections will not be reached.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>As long as the Deputies are aware of the time consideration and as long as they keep the debate within the confines of a Committee Stage debate, the Chair will not intervene. However, I will not allow a long debate on borrowing and so on, which is clearly a Second Stage debate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am as concerned as Deputy O'Kennedy is with blending and carry it out to the maximum extent possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputy O'Dea has pointed out, the increases in the exemption limits provided for here are around 6 per cent to 7 per cent.  The period during which those specific exemption limits will be in force will be in 1985-86 tax year.  The expected <Col N="230" /> rate of inflation for the calendar year 1985 is a little under 6 per cent.  I would expect that the rate of inflation for the following year would be lower again.  Therefore, the changes in the exemption limits themselves are somewhat bigger than the expected rate of inflation over the period to which they will apply.  From that point of view we have at least maintained, if not somewhat increased, the value of the exemption limits in real terms.  We have somewhat increased the value of the exemption limits in real terms.</P>
    <P>As far as the operation of marginal relief is concerned, I can understand the Deputy's concern about this.  It is a situation that is difficult to forecast for any given taxpayer in any given year.  That is the difficulty we encounter in the PAYE system generally.  As the Deputy knows &mdash; unless one has complete reporting of income, year by year &mdash; it can be rather difficult to apply the system to give the result, with full accuracy, over the period of the year.</P>
    <P>For example, in the case of a single person who is not taxed under PAYE, who has a total income of £2,700 and is under 65 years of age we can see the operation of marginal relief which, in his case, would be £250.  But, to respond to what Deputy O'Dea asked, the point I want to come to is that for that person, single, not taxed under PAYE and who is under 65 years of age marginal relief for him would expire when his total income reached £3,700.  But, for another taxpayer with the same gross income but with different allowances, for different reasons, the figure at which his marginal relief would expire could well be different. That is what I intended to convey when I said it is difficult to forecast just where and to what extent marginal relief will apply or indeed for an individual taxpayer whether, in a given year, he will continue to be entitled to marginal relief for the whole period of that year.  The same kind of reasoning applies <i>mutatis mutandis</i> for married taxpayers who are taxed under PAYE.  I would suspect that it is really in cases like that that the difficulties referred to by Deputy O'Dea arise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="231" /> Certainly there is no unwillingness on the part of the Revenue authorities to operate the marginal relief system but, in some cases, there may be a difficulty in determining in advance that a specific case is one to which marginal relief would apply.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been listening upstairs to the debate.  In regard to these exemption limits generally there is not the knowledge among old age pensioners or people who are entitled to claim them that they are so entitled.  If they are to be increased or adjusted, or with regard to any of the amendments being made, I would ask that steps be taken to ensure that taxpayers are made aware that they are entitled to these exemptions.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but the exemption limit does not relate to old age pensioners only; it is an income related matter.  The older one is the higher is the income level.  For example, a person who is not an old age pensioner can have an exemption but, if that person becomes an old age pensioner, then that exemption is <Col N="232" /> increased.  I am dealing with the area of exemptions generally whether in the case of old age pensioners or others and this amendment is as applicable as any other.</P>
      <P>Having worked as a tax practitioner many people have come to me with tax queries.  The area in which I get most change from the inspector of taxes is in that of exemptions and marginal relief simply because people are not aware that they are entitled to this exemption and that, if they go over the exemption limit, rather than going right back to their ordinary allowances, they are then entitled to marginal relief.  I should like greater highlighting of this fact, not just for old age pensioners but for everybody. There are non-old age pensioners, married and single, who can benefit from the exemption and marginal relief levels. They simply do not know that these are available, which is a terrible indictment of the system.  I have written to the inspector of taxes on several occasions pointing out that people were entitled to marginal relief.  In this case the inspector of taxes is not at fault, he is allowing exemptions and marginal relief where these are brought to his attention.  Rather is it a matter of the taxpayer not being aware of his entitlements.  It should be highlighted in, say, post offices, places where old age pensioners congregate, perhaps even in senior citizens' clubs, health boards and so on, that they are entitled to this, and that if they do not get the exemption they are entitled to the marginal relief.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In comparison with other taxpayers old age pensioners do not fare all that badly. But there are taxpayers outside the old age pensioner category who can also benefit from exemption and marginal relief and they also are not aware of that fact.  People tend to view the exemption as an allowance and it is not an allowance. For example, if one has £10 over the exemption limit one loses the exemption entirely and one goes back on ordinary allowances, with the exception that there is a marginal relief applicable.  Often this appears on a tax free allowance certificate as an overpayment for the year in question because apparently there is no other <Col N="233" /> way the computer can deal with it.  It is not an overpayment; it is marginal relief. Perhaps the Minister could have a leaflet issued on this which could be distributed to old people and also made available in post offices, health boards and so on by way of explanation to people generally. I have already written on behalf of half a dozen people who have come to me since the beginning of this tax year.  There must be hundreds more walking about who are entitled to this marginal relief who simply are not applying for it.  I would ask the Minister to take steps to ensure that adequate publicity is given to this so that people can apply and benefit therefrom.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to be associated with the appeal for greater publicity to be given to exemptions, especially marginal relief.  Indeed I compliment Deputy O'Dea on having brought forward this aspect, in stark contrast to the economic debate being conducted by Deputy O'Kennedy earlier and, as the Ceann Comhairle pointed out, which was not relevant to the amendment before the House.</P>
      <P>I too have found, especially among semi-State employees, that they are not aware of this marginal relief.  In particular people in charge of pension trusts seem to ignore it, causing great strain on elderly people especially at this time of the year. Perhaps the Minister would request the Revenue Commissioners to review the publicity they give these aspects of taxation law.</P>

      <P>Since specific points have been raised by Deputies Mitchell, Carey and O'Dea, I will comment on the operation of the system.  As far as the direct assessment cases are concerned we now have a redesigned computer programme <Col N="234" /> for dealing with direct assessments which will enable us to show marginal relief separately in future.  In any case where it applies it will be given automatically in direct assessment cases.  The same applies to the exemptions generally where given. The exemption is applied automatically where there is a projection that the taxpayer's income will be below the exemption limit.  As far as marginal relief is concerned, that is a bit more difficult because that is something that has to be judged in retrospect when the total level of income that was subject to tax is known so that one can calculate the amount of marginal relief.  However, within the constraints imposed by that difficulty, and taking account of the improvements that we were able to make in relation to direct assessment, which is only a small part of the problem, I will try to take on more of the points made by Deputies about improving the level of public knowledge of the exemptions and the levels as they apply.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, line 22, to delete &ldquo;£6,000&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£6,160&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that these amendments be taken together because they are all on the exemption limits.  The purpose of amendment No. 3 and the other amendments is <Col N="239" /> to achieve 10 per cent on the exemption limit that existed rather than the roughly 6 per cent exemption limit by which the Minister has increased it, the £6,160 being the 10 per cent adjustment.  We could probably have levelled it up and £6,200 would be acceptable to us.  The purpose in attempting to increase all these exemption limits is to remove the burden from the people who can least afford to pay these taxes.  The general effect of the budget the Minister has brought in is to increase the burden on the lower end and reduce it on the top of the scale.  Those who come out best from this budget are those on the highest incomes.  Our purpose in these amendments is to endeavour to redress that balance and to give some element of security to people who have paid their taxes over the years, all their lives, and who at this stage should have a reduced level of taxation which is generally recognised by Ministers for Finance to some extent, but insufficient recognition of this is given.  This amendment is a relatively small effort to redress the balance in favour of such people and to give increased exemption limits there.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give us an idea of what the cost of adopting these amendments would be, allowing that the original proposal we made for exemptions at the lower age level is defeated?  What would it cost to implement the amendments in the name of Deputy Mac Giolla which are almost the same as those in my name?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy is asking for the separate cost of implementing the amendments we are now looking at, of the series proposed by Deputy Mac Giolla and the series proposed by us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The separate cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The extra cost over and above what is proposed in the Bill of the proposals in amendments Nos. 3, 7, 13 and 17 would be about £600,000 in 1985 <Col N="240" /> and £1 million in a full year.  The extra cost of the proposals in the amendments proposed by Deputy O'Kennedy, Nos. 4, 8, 14 and 18 would be about £0.75 million in 1985 and £1.25 million in a full year.  I would make the point that the increases that are provided for in the Bill are in all cases between 6 per cent and 7 per cent. As I said earlier, given the declining path that inflation is now following, I am happy to say, we expect that inflation over the period to which those increases in the exemption limits would apply will be somewhat less than that, so that in making the increases proposed in the Bill we will have increased these exemption limits by more than the expected rate of inflation over that period.  As I have said, like every other Member of the House, I am anxious to ensure that those for whom these age exemption limits are intended in particular would get the maximum possible relief.  The provisions in the Bill within the tax expenditures that we have available to us strike a balance between the different requirements of the different groups who are covered by the changes proposed in the Bill, much as I proposals that are in the Bill, much as I would like to go further than that.  Of course, these are not the only cases in which I would like to go further in relation to taxation, but we have fixed a total amount that is available for redistribution and the proportions of that available to different groups.</P>

      <P>Amendment Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20.  Is that by agreement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Having regard to the minimal cost I imagine that Deputy Mac Giolla would support my proposal which is for an extra £40 over and above what he asks for a married couple.  We are both working on a 10 per cent increase over the exemption limits, so if we go on the basis of the figures that the Minister has given we are talking of a gross cost this year in respect of the age exemptions between 65 and 75 of £0.75 million, the net cost being something of the order of £500,000.  I had hoped it would be not only possible but desirable to show the people in this age group that they are not going to be asked to fill in tax forms which worry them because the anxiety, tension and unnecessary bother generated for them and for the tax staff, when one takes into account the minimal amounts of tax they will have to pay, is not worth the candle.  We made this measured proposal to extend the extension limits from £3,000 to £3,100 in respect of a single person between 65 and 75 years and from £6,000 to £6,200 in respect of a married couple between those ages.  The revenue involved is of such little significance that I appeal to the Minister to accept these proposals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it were seen that, despite the burden of tax which we all have to share, we have a particular care for the old and that where possible &mdash; and there will not be too many affected because they are small in number &mdash; we are going to ease the burden on these people, we would be doing a very good job in terms of the reaction we would get from the public. In these very difficult times we would be demonstrating that, despite the problems the rest of us have to face, we are trying to ease the burden on our senior citizens. <Col N="242" /> A few pounds extra to people of that age means an awful lot.  They do not spend very much on themselves.  If they have a few extra pounds to give their grandchildren this can give them a feeling of independence, importance and a feeling that people will look to them.  We need to promote that kind of social awareness. Obviously many of these people will be putting by some money for what they regard as their final obligation &mdash; their burial costs.</P>
    <P>I hope these amendments will be adopted by the Minister.  They will not cost very much but will have a major effect on the people involved.  We must all be concerned about the security of old people in their homes.  These extra few pounds might encourage them to put their money in the bank.  This would be very desirable and would show them that we are encouraging them to save but in a safe place where they might make a few more pounds.  Little things change public attitudes.  It is the small things which show that we are not all that selfish after all.  We all fall into one group or other &mdash; tax evaders, tax avoiders, politicians, the media, and Church and so on, and there seems to be a determination to engage in condemnation of the different groups. Hardly anyone escapes this criticism but can we not turn this round by showing that we care for these people?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will accept these amendments which will cost very little &mdash; £500,000 this year and £750,000 in a full year.  If he accepts them he will be doing a great job.  In his reply perhaps he would tell me how many people are involved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O'Kennedy that it is desirable not only that we show that there is some care for the people in question but that we act accordingly.  I would be much more open to Deputy O'Kennedy's argument if nothing were proposed in this Bill to deal with that problem but there is a provision which has its place, smaller than many of us would wish, in the scheme of changes we are making in the tax system this year. Deputy O'Kennedy is not arguing for something that is not in the Bill; he is <Col N="243" /> arguing for something that is a little different from what is in the Bill.  It is not the case that we have not made any provision, because we have.  It has been weighted and tailored as much as we can make it in favour of the people who are most concerned within the framework of the tax changes in the Bill.</P>
      <P>The provisions in the Bill in relation to the age exemption limits would exempt 3,300 people altogether.  The general exemption limits would exempt a further 7,200.  I would like to make a brief comment on another point Deputy O'Kennedy raised on security and encouraging older people to put money in more secure places.  There is a provision elsewhere in this Bill designed to help them do that, but it is not something which would be directly affected by this section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I must press the Minister to adopt this change.  We are dealing with a very small number of people and a very small amount of money.  These people are not capable of dealing with tax forms.  The cost to the Revenue would be minimal.  This is something we owe to people.  They do not have any idea how to fill in these forms and must seek the assistance of their local TD.  If the Minister adopted this amendment he might find us very forthcoming on other issues.  This small change would mean so much to these people.  It is nonsense that people at this level should have to fill in tax forms when they are over 75 years of age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I support that view. There is a growing acceptance of the need to do more for our senior citizens.  People are anxious to help elderly people living in their area.  One person approached me recently who, after 45 years working, considered that he had a very good pension. He receives £78 into his hand every week.  He is in a home &mdash; not a very expensive one &mdash; where he has to pay £70 and he is left with £8 to buy some tobacco or a present now and again for his grandchildren. He has nothing.  Now he has the worry of these tax forms and he does not know what he is supposed to claim. People cannot understand why having paid taxes for 45 or 50 years and contributed towards a pension they should now be taxed on that pension.  It is difficult to give a satisfactory explanation.  How does one explain that a man finishes up with a few pounds to spend although he worked all his life for what he regarded as an excellent pension?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="245" /> The exemption of these people would cost a very small sum and the impact on the Minister's figures would be minimal.  There are other areas where small adjustments could be made to cater for this change.  Everybody would agree that these are the first people who should be looked after.  These amendments are relatively small adjustments which would mean a lot to a few thousand people and the Minister should reconsider his figures to see if any further exemption could be given.  The exemption of any individual would be a good deed by the Minister which would be rejoiced in by everybody.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am proposing that the exemption rate for a married couple aged between 65 and 75 years should be increased to £6,000 and for a married couple aged over 75 years it would be £7,000.  Deputies will recognise that those levels of income are not found on a very wide scale among people of that age in our society and many people have considerably less.  I have made my position clear.  I have a great deal of sympathy with what Deputies Mac Giolla and O'Kennedy are proposing but we made a certain number of decisions last January on the distribution of tax reductions between different groups in society.  I must stick to that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking about married couples who will benefit from the Minister's exemption at about £113 gross. My proposal would raise that figure to £117 gross.  I should like to propose something considerably higher but there is a point at which one must acknowledge <Col N="246" /> that even for the older people one cannot increase the exemption greatly beyond the exemptions that apply to the lower paid who are not in the aged category. The increase we are proposing involves only £4 per week.  The Minister is right in saying that many old people have much less than £113 or £117 per week.  Former semi-State employees may have a contributory pension in addition to a pension from Bord na Móna or the Sugar Company and the two together bring them into the tax net.  This causes all sorts of confusion and tension and these people cannot understand why they are being taxed.  I regret that the Minister cannot see his way to adopting these amendments. Young people would respond because we would be seen as sharing the concern they have about old people.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 22:</P>
      <P>In page 7, in the Table, Part I, Column (2), opposite &ldquo;The next £2,800&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;48 per cent&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;45 per cent.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Here we are proposing the most limited possible adjustment to the general tax tables which the Minister introduced. What we are proposing is that the first level of application of the higher rate of tax would be 45 per cent instead of 48 per cent.  It is obvious from the amendments we have been dealing with that our approach to the Bill is a very measured and responsible one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not looking for huge changes in the taxation system.  We acknowledge that the changes introduced were, belatedly, welcome.  We have called for these changes since the Minister first introduced the top rate of tax at 65 per cent <Col N="250" /> which was a penal disincentive to the managerial and executive personnel we need so badly.  Belatedly, the Minister saw the light and, as in the case of the VAT bands, he reduced the top level of taxation to the level at which it had been before he increased it.  Even a belated conversion is welcome but it cannot be attributed to any great degree of commitment to general tax reform.</P>
    <P>I heard the Minister say on occasion that the reduction of the top tax band this year and the simplification of the bands is in line with the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  It is not. At the time the commission produced their first report they were speaking in terms of a tax band of 60 per cent.  They recognised that the increase to 65 per cent was totally at odds with the general direction of their proposal and equally clearly it could be seen that the level of taxation was having a very damaging effect on our economic development.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned the growth of taxation and have given figures in global terms over the last few years and as percentage of GNP.  I do not propose to repeat those.  Many people are entering the higher tax bands as a consequence of the tax adjustments which were made. They would have been in the lower tax bands previously.  We got rid of the 25 per cent tax band last year.  As a result of getting rid of the top and bottom tax bands we have shoved more people into the higher tax bands as they are described in Part I of the Table I am proposing to amend.  The 35 per cent is the standard rate and the higher rates are 48 per cent and 60 per cent.  It is very obvious that our tax levels generally in the higher bands are having a major impact on the whole investment climate.  Later on we will be dealing with the Minister's attempt, which I have to say at this stage by way of preface to what we will say later in greater detail is ineffective, to encourage foreign multinationals to invest in Government securities.</P>

      <P>The Minister can consult anyone in the business world and, unless they are telling the Minister a different story from the one they are telling me &mdash; either the Minister does no understand the message or he is getting a different message &mdash; he will find that all the major finance houses are saying it will not work.  The Minister is introducing it because our tax levels in the higher bands are disincentives to the key personnel in these companies &mdash; not that they are our only concern; far from it &mdash; the key management personnel in marketing, research, development and accounting procedures of these very sophisticated companies.  Given an option between locating in Spain, Portugal, Puerto Rico and locating in Ireland with our tax rates, in many cases they are encouraging the multinationals to be more mobile outside of this country.  They come in and take the benefit of our tax breaks.  They then move out because they find that the personal taxation level is far too high.</P>
      <P>The measure we are proposing here, I have to admit, is almost a token gesture to all the people in the higher bands that it will not be a sin to earn money above the levels of the standard rate of taxation. Our standard rate in many cases equates with the higher rates in other countries. We are still way above the United Kingdom where they do not come into the 60 per cent band until they reach a figure of something in the order of £46,000 Irish equivalent.  They are in that band here when they have something over £12,500. We are trying to make that adjustment in the centre of the band at the beginning of the higher tax band.  Apart from the impact it would have, it would be seen as a signal that we are becoming a little more enlightened and have seen the consequences of our high level of taxation &mdash; fewer jobs and lower tax yields.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first quarter returns show a reduced yield from income tax and show the figures running behind what is necessary to meet the Minister's target of income tax for the full year of £2,131 million, which is a very sizeable sum.  The indications are that we will not reach that figure because we will get less revenue <Col N="252" /> yield from higher tax levels.  We have seen this pattern from this Government in a whole range of areas from VAT to excise duty.  We will demonstrate that that is proved beyond yea or nay.  That is one of the reasons why we feel this marginal adjustment would be seen as a signal.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to indicate to us what this adjustment would cost.  If my calculation is correct, we are talking about something in the order of £18 million out of a total tax imposition of £2,131 million.  The Minister may say it will be more.  To demonstrate that we are prepared to make an adjustment in the interests of creating a climate for investment and work, we should do that.  For some time I have been making the case that, to encourage our own senior executives in our own domestic companies, we should have particular provisions for marketing executives.  Every report coming through demonstrates that our marketing effort is deplorably weak and that we are not penetrating the markets.  It is not a question of blaming CTT.  We are not making an impact.</P>
    <P>Marketing personnel who have to spend so much time out of the country have no incentive to come back when they are taxed on the same base as everyone else.  Even with the dropping of the 65 per cent these levels are way above those which apply elsewhere.  They know that if they move to Britain, Belgium, France, Germany &mdash; not Sweden or Switzerland where they would do better in terms of income &mdash; or Japan which the Minister likes to quote in his OECD survey, much less the United States, they will do better for themselves.  The trouble is they are doing that.  We are losing revenue and, more important, we are losing the key personnel we need to launch our industry into the next decade and the next century.  That should appeal to the Minister in making a marginal adjustment.  That, plus the reduction of the 65 per cent to 60 per cent, would be seen as a clear demonstration that the Government have changed their minds. That change of mind is badly needed and long overdue.  I should like the Minister <Col N="253" /> to tell me whether my figure of £18 million is correct.  If the figure is of such a small order having regard to our total tax, I will have to press the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>

      <P>This section gives effect to the new rates of tax announced in the budget.  The Deputy opposite seems to take the view that there is no move towards tax reform involved in this because it does not conform precisely with what was proposed in the first report of the Commission on Taxation.  The Deputy has not had an opportunity to spend much time with me at various public meetings although we had an opportunity once or twice to talk about tax reform.  I am sure he is aware that one of the main difficulties I find with the proposal made in the first report of the Commission on Taxation is that the single rate of income tax proposed by the Commission would have to apply to all income.  It would have to be in the region of 35 per cent and that change would constitute a very serious blow for many of our lower income taxpayers.  I am not saying I would object in principle to the system proposed by the Commission on Taxation.  Far from it.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On taxable income.  Given the number of reliefs and exemptions the commission proposed should be taken out of the system, a single rate of 35 per cent, on the basis proposed by the commission, would represent a very substantial increase in the tax level at 35 per cent given the present reliefs and exemptions.  I am not putting that forward as an argument against the principle of what the commission proposed, but as an argument against applying holus bolus <Col N="254" /> this year what the commission proposed. Its effects would be very regressive and damaging for quite a large number of lower paid people.  But I must insist that it is not an argument against the principle of the proposal for which there is a great deal to be said.  The argument is against making that change now.  However, a move such as the one we have taken here to reduce the number of rates is a move in the direction that was pointed out by the Commission on Taxation.  I should hope that in future years there would be opportunities to make further moves. This year we are talking about what is possible within the present budgetary context.  There is no doubt that what is contained in this Bill demonstrates amply that the Government are prepared to make adjustments in our tax system and are prepared to do so in a balanced way, in a way that would have the maximum possible effect having regard to the amount of leeway at our disposal to make such adjustments.</P>
      <P>Despite all I have heard from Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues in the past couple of years about taxation, if one eliminates the possibility of implementing immediately the proposals contained in the first report of the Commission on Taxation, one realises that they have said nothing else.  I have produced a proposal to rationalise the income tax system, a proposal that is streets ahead of anything put forward by the Opposition and the Opposition have not put forward anything practical in an immediate sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provisions of the Bill bring us to a system in which our rates of income tax are 35, 48 and 60 per cent.  The 35 per cent band is being widened by £500 for single persons and by £1,000 for married couples.  That represents a very substantial move in the direction of tax rationalisation.  The change in the rates and bands, together with the increases in the main personal allowances, will cost about £54 million in 1985 and £90 million in a full year and they will be of benefit to 818,600 taxpayers.  That represents a fairly substantial change in our tax system.  It is a major modification of the system.  Regarding the effects of the <Col N="255" /> changes on the various categories of taxpayer, I repeat what I said earlier, that is, that we will go from a situation where, pre the budget provisions, 47 per cent of taxpayers would have been in the higher rate bands to a situation where, post budget, 40.3 per cent of taxpayers will be paying tax at the higher rates.  This means that 10,500 people will be removed from tax liability as a result of the new exemption limits, that 4,600 will be removed from tax liability as a result of the new personal allowances while the renewal of the PRSI allowance which was provided for in the Bill will remove 10,500 people from liability.  In addition, 15,400 people will move downwards from liability and one of the rates in the system to a position in which they will qualify for marginal relief.  From a marginal rate of 65 per cent, 60,000 people will move to a rate of 60 per cent while 80,000 people will move from a marginal rate of 55 per cent to a rate of 48 per cent and 65,000 will move from liability at a marginal rate of 45 per cent to a rate of 35 per cent. Therefore, a total of 205,000 taxpayers will find their marginal rates reduced.</P>
    <P>The 481,000 people who will remain liable at the same marginal rate will be in the marginal relief category.  The breakdown of that is that 55,000 people will remain at marginal relief of 60 per cent.  The number remaining in the 35 per cent band will be 410,000 and the 16,000 people who have qualified already for marginal relief will continue to benefit from that situation.  Therefore, for 481,000 people the marginal rate will remain unchanged or else they will remain on marginal relief.</P>
    <P>The marginal rate in respect of 124,000 people will increase from 45 to 48 per cent while for 25,000 people the marginal rate will increase from 55 to 60 per cent. Before Deputy O'Kennedy begins rubbing his hands in glee and saying that this is a dreadful extra imposition on those people, I should point out that&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I find no cause for glee either in our taxation system or in the Minister's approach to it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;at the same time all of those people will be experiencing an overall reduction in their tax liability as a result of the increases in personal allowances.  A bigger portion of their income will be taxable at the lower rates as a result of the widening of the bands. In any language, that represents a fairly substantial change in the income tax system.</P>
      <P>I turn now to the amendment tabled by Deputy O'Kennedy.  The purpose of the amendment is to reduce the 48 per cent rate to 45 per cent.  That is an ambition that I would share.  Everyone would be happy to pay less tax.  However, the effect of Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment would be to reduce tax revenue by an estimated £15.4 million in 1985 and by about £25.7 million in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said earlier, the proposals for restructuring the rate bands together with the increases in personal allowances will cost just more than £54 million in 1985 and just more than £90 million in a full year.  That represents the limit within the present budgetary constraints and this is what we must come back to at every stage in the discussion. We must have regard to the limit of the changes we can make in tax revenue this year.  What we have done has been, first, to assess the amount of leeway we have for making changes in the system and then to use the elbow room we have in the most constructive way possible in terms of bringing about changes in the system.  We have made provision for increases in personal allowances and have put a great deal of the weight of what it is possible to do this year on the reorganisation of the system.  I notice that Deputy O'Kennedy again repeated his fears that the first quarter returns seem to indicate certain trends &mdash; I have already told the House my view about the first quarter returns and what may be read from them. Frankly, within the budgetary constraints that face us this year, I continue to take the view that I have no reason to be other <Col N="257" /> than confident that our budget figures will remain on target.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>None of the spurious interpretations that Deputy O'Kennedy may engage in will change my mind about that.  To do him justice, he knows perfectly well that one cannot project for the whole year on the basis of first quarter returns.  It is clear that, given the budgetary constraints under which we have to work this year &mdash; as in other years &mdash; the maximum amount of latitude that we had for changes in the structure of the system has been used for constructing the changes provided for in this Bill.  For that reason, I cannot accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me first deal with the general reaction of the Minister, who claims that this is a move in the direction wished by the Commission on Taxation. If the Minister has been responsible, since the first report of the Commission on Taxation, for increasing the tax bands beyond the point at which they then were, up to 65 per cent rates and otherwise, will he now claim credit for moving in the right direction simply by correcting some at least of his own mistakes?  That is clearly a spurious claim which cannot be allowed to stand on the record.  When he assumed responsibility the tax rates were lower than they are now, or at least of the same order.  Because he reduces those levels he is claiming that he is following the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  That is a dismissive claim in respect of the work of that commission who have made much broader recommendations than the actions of the Minister have measured up to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, on many occasions the Minister has made confident claims &mdash; some might say with the confidence of the expert &mdash; which, in the event, have been proved to be false.  With regard to a whole range of matters &mdash; borrowing, levels of unemployment and general taxation, these were not realised.  I can bring <Col N="258" /> the Minister back over the record for the last two years.  With regard to any of the major indicators in the economy the calm, confident assertions of the Minister were not realised.  He says calmly that he is confident that the level of taxation on income at the end of the year will be on target and the deficit will not increase, when the reality is that even on one score the level of unemployment is running away ahead of the confident assertions of the Minister made a few months ago when the <i>Building on Reality</i> document was published.  No matter what miracle or magic one tries to engage in or hope for, it will not be possible to adhere to the targets in that plan in terms of deficit and tax when there are a higher number of unemployed.  Deputy Carey gave us a new proclamation from Fine Gael today when he said it was marvellous that they were able to pay social benefit to the increasing number of unemployed and still avoid a revolution.  If that is to be the achievement of the Government, I shall grant it to them.  The fact is that the diminishing number at work trying to cope with the increasing burden of social welfare payments is the reason the Minister cannot bring back the 48 per cent band to where it was before his Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the spurious claim in terms of the levels of income tax, that 205,000 people would have their rates reduced and 481,000 would have unchanged taxation or marginal relief and that there is only a tiny group of 124,000, between 45 and 48 per cent, who will have a marginal increase.  The facts demonstrate something very different.  First, let us consider the total tax take.  The total income tax take this year will be not less than £165 million more than last year. In simple percentage terms over last year, that represents over 8 per cent increase. That fact emerges from the Minister's budget table.  We are told that we are protecting inflation by the Government, by this Minister and every Minister from time to time, at a very optimistic 6 per cent in the course of the year.  Without going into all the gobbledygook about marginal reductions at this level and <Col N="259" /> other reductions at that level, between this group and that group, the clear fact emerges that if there is an 8 per cent increase in total income tax against a projected inflation of 6 per cent, clearly the burden of income tax in 1985 will be heavier all round by at least 2 per cent.</P>

      <P>I shall put some of the facts to the Minister, as he does not come to grips with or understand these realities.  If I am not too clear, that is bad enough, but it is only personal.  If Deputy De Rossa gets it wrong, that also is a personal matter.</P>

      <P>However, if the Minister gets it wrong &mdash; and he has got it so wrong so often, despite all his confident and calm assertions &mdash; everyone suffers. People are becoming very conscious of the fact that despite the calm, confident assertions of the Minister they are suffering because of his outrageous miscalculation in the last couple of years.</P>
      <P>Another factor of which the Minister does not want to take account is that we have growing unemployment and a diminishing labour force paying the same amount of tax &mdash; in fact not the same, 2 per cent more.  That would show anybody that that means increased levels of taxation. Over the course of the next few days in this debate we shall present some of the cases of increased taxation to the Minister, but if he meets the people who have increased tax claims he will find that for all his claims of marginal or significant reductions, the bulk of people, particularly in the sector about which we are talking now, will be paying significantly more tax than last year.  The Minister must know that, otherwise he is ignoring reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are those at the top, who were paying 65 per cent and are back to 60 per cent and who will be paying less, but in <Col N="260" /> the middle bands the vast bulk of the people will be paying more this year.  The increased PRSI, and the levies, supposedly temporary, also have to be considered. What were first supposed to be temporary measures have now become permanent.  I might draw the Minister's attention to the report of the Commision on Taxation which stated that all these deductions from gross salary &mdash; income tax, PRSI, levies and other charges of that nature &mdash; should be treated in one fashion, as income tax deductions.  Far from moving in that direction the Minister maintains what we were told was to be a temporary income levy for no particular purpose except to boost revenue.</P>
    <P>That income levy will add to the general burden of taxation.  Incidentally, that is not included in the figures that I have given.  I am only talking about income tax. The income tax levy yields an extra £77 million this year.  Add that to the £2,131 million and we are talking of a figure of the order of £2,200 million in total taxation.  What we are proposing here is simply to get back to where we were before this Finance Bill in respect of the 45 per cent tax band.  We shall have the opportunity of giving the Minister many more arguments which I hope will enlighten him a little and get him to move from his intransigent position.  £15.4 million gross is equivalent to £10 million net, out of the total tax of £2,131 million.  If the Minister cannot see fit to make an adjustment of that nature he will never be enlightened.  We will have to live with the reality that he sees his role simply as regulating and controlling tax revenue, of sealing off loopholes and having no awareness of the need to create a climate for renewed activity in the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the <Col N="261" /> Government to rationalise and co-ordinate the multiplicity of different schemes of youth training and employment by the different Government Departments and agencies in order to concentrate on the provision of permanent sustainable employment for the greatest possible number of our young people.</P>
    <P>My reason for putting down this motion is not primarily to attack the Minister for Labour but to put forward constructive suggestions that are in his own interest to make a major achievement in the area of youth training and employment.  In addition, we believe this motion reflects the thinking of the workforce, the people involved in the various agencies and those who are on the lists for training schemes. Rather than being destructive or critical, we think that the debate on this motion will strengthen the Minister's hand in implementing fairly radical proposals.</P>
    <P>I wish to state that I am not in any way critical of any of the semi-State bodies involved.  Here we are talking mainly about the National Manpower Service which is under the aegis of the Department of Labour, of AnCO, CERT, the Youth Employment Agency and the various bodies that have been set up in the past 20 years.  Despite all the changes in that time the last White Paper on manpower was published in 1965 when Seán Lemass was Taoiseach.  Incidentally, that White Paper was about two-and-a-half pages in length.  Perhaps we should go back to the days when White Papers were short and snappy and to the point, rather then the huge monologues issued by various Governments and which are filed away in libraries in Government Departments and in semi-State bodies with nothing happening in connection with them.</P>
    <P>In the 1965 White Paper, Seán Lemass set out clearly what was needed to deal with the new jobs that would then become available.  At that time we needed training agencies and manpower authorities so that it would be easier for employers to get employees when they were needed.  Members of the House will <Col N="262" /> appreciate how ridiculous that concept is today.  We have 234,000 registered unemployed, but 14,000 are not on the register because of their parents' circumstances, probably about 30,000 have emigrated and approximately 20,000 people are on various courses.  Probably there are at least 300,000 unemployed at present.</P>
    <P>We ask the Minister as a matter of urgency to bring in a new manpower policy, to standardise existing agencies and to create sustainable jobs for our young people.  We understand that at least 60,000 young people come on the register each year and that the opportunities are not easy to find.  Money from the European Social Employment Scheme is helping us to fund the various schemes but it will not provide jobs that have any kind of future.  The Minister need not be embarrassed because what has been happening in this regard is not his fault but the point must be made that during the years numerous schemes and bright ideas have been put before each Minister and they have accumulated to a considerable extent.  We have work experience programmes, enterprise allowance schemes, employment incentive schemes, teamwork schemes, community youth training programmes, community enterprise programmes, youth self-employment programmes, young scientists and technological employment schemes, marketplace schemes, national co-operative farm relief services, environmental work schemes, various-schemes involving the Departments of Education and the Environment, external training division schemes, enterprise programmes schemes, business programme schemes, career development programmes, equal opportunity programmes, link programmes, comtec programmes, enterprise product development programmes, programmes dealing with starting one's business, youth enterprise programmes and many more. All of these are schemes or courses introduced by people at different times, sometimes to get a Minister off the hook, to try to keep the young unemployed at bay or to create peace among the workforce. However, the end result is that hundreds <Col N="263" /> of millions of pounds of taxpayers' money have been spent with few jobs obtained.</P>
    <P>I have a good relationship with the semi-State bodies.  They are all courteous to me as an Opposition spokesman.  I realise they can say that so many people did certain courses and were successful. The fact is that in the three years of the Government's plan there will be an increase of only 20,000 jobs.  It is proposed to accommodate about 8,000 people on pre-retirement courses but many of the jobs envisaged by the Government in their plan will never materialise.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that the social employment scheme will give 10,000 jobs but that scheme has not got off the ground.  There are reasons for that: perhaps they are with regard to the trade unions or in respect of the manpower aspect but, for one reason or another, only a handful of jobs have materialised. This scheme was announced in October, it was launched in February but now in summer the jobs have not been provided.</P>
    <P>The annual report of AnCO with regard to apprentices sets out the major difficulties with regard to the various schemes.  Team work is only another name for another scheme.  The Youth Employment Agency are passing themselves out with new schemes, nice reports and glossy documents but very few jobs. If all the people on training courses were taken off those courses and registered as unemployed, I realise the impact that would have on the Government and the little benefit that would be to the community. In the training centres there are 11,740 people in various community, youth and workshop schemes.  CERT have almost 2,000 people and the YEA several thousand people on courses.</P>
    <P>I notice that the Minister's amendment contends that further improvements are necessary.  We contend that rather is there needed a radical overhaul of the system with the abolition of the present structures which have outlived their usefulness. There is no room within the present structure for seven or eight different organisations.  We do not need an <Col N="264" /> AnCO, Manpower, Youth Employment Agency, with grants being given to the IMI, the IPA, all of whom go their separate ways in competition with one another.  I might give one example of that type of competition.  There was the link programme established in 1982 by AnCO, if not replaced, then superseded by COMTEC, one of the courses mentioned in the national plan.</P>
    <P>I notice from my reading of <i>Focus</i> magazines that pilot schemes will be established in Laois, Offaly and parts of Sligo, the areas in which AnCO have just completed schemes under that link programme.  That amounts to massive duplication.  I accept, appreciate and welcome the schemes in Tallaght, Donaghmede, Cork, Monaghan and Waterford.  Because there is so much money involved in these schemes, because of competition at board and management level their functions are duplicated.  No matter how one defines it the link scheme amounts to the same thing as COMTEC.  If a major course has been conducted under the link programme in a given area then what is COMTEC doing in the same area?  I do not ask the Minister to defend that decision because he did not take it, but who-ever did should be asked to answer for it because it constitutes wastage of money. All of my colleagues interested in this debate, all members of the parliamentary party, will be able to cite similar examples of duplication of these schemes and their failure.  They are conducted in the interests of the people who conduct them rather than those who should benefit from them.</P>
    <P>I welcome anything that assists training and affords people an opportunity to work, but I am totally against the multiplicity of organisations obtaining.  We recently set out our views, stating that we felt it was necessary for the Minister for Labour to take control of the overall position. We recommended that there be one semi-State body, one agency or manpower authority to take over the functions of all of these organisations, with one board, the present agencies <Col N="265" /> forming part of that body so that policy decisions would be formed at one level.</P>
    <P>I have heard rumours that the Minister, in his various discussion documents furnished to various agencies, is recommending perhaps a piecemeal amalgamation. I do not believe that would be satisfactory.  I do not think four chief executive officers are necessary to deal with the same problem.  We do not need people sitting at board or committee level in various organisations around this city and country dealing with the same problem. Rather there should be people with the necessary expertise on the one board dealing with the overall question.  One single manpower authority linked to the Minister's Department would give the Minister the necessary control in order to ensure that the money we vote for the Department of Labour is properly utilised.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of the ordinary citizen Manpower is totally disorganised. They send out standard type letters and, when people call into them, they can render no service.  Only recently did they receive money from the Youth Employment Agency to computerise their operations. We want to see people on the live register entitled to services and schemes, to be able to acquire training where necessary, and that that be done in a practical, uniform way.  At present a person wishing to undergo a course who goes into a Manpower office is not met with a great degree of courtesy because the workforce are too busy.  If people wish to register for various courses they must go to CERT offices at one end of town, then to the Youth Employment Agency and, even within that agency, they may have to go to various other bodies.  The Minister need not nod his head.  I have tried it myself and they did not recognise me.  I will tell the Minister how discourteous is the treatment meted out to people and, if necessary, I will name the officials concerned.  I checked it out in detail following numerous complaints from constitutents.  I would ask the Minister not to defend them.  When one goes into the Manpower office forms <Col N="266" /> are filled in which effectively mean nothing. They just do not have the necessary resources at their disposal and they are not computerised.  If one wishes to undergo an AnCo course one must then go off to register with AnCo.  There is no co-ordinated approach.  As high as is employment generally there are now plenty of schemes obtaining in Europe and across the water whereby one computerised system can take on or deal with 250,000 unemployed people with their full records.  If I or anybody else walks into a Manpower office we should be interviewed in a courteous way, in proper surroundings, being given all the details of the courses we want to undergo.  If there is no solution other than going to the unemployment office then it should be sited nearby.  Parallel with that, a person should be placed on the register for, say, AnCO or CERT courses, the enterprise allowance scheme or whatever schemes in which one may be interested. Straight away they should be furnished with the necessary documentation rather than go through the present long process in order to reach a stage of being declared unemployed and placed on the lists of the various agencies.</P>
    <P>The simplest way of co-ordinating all of this is through one major outside computerised agency within the system and under the aegis of the Minister's Department. I was amused to note the first attempt, the letter issued to all unemployed people stating that if one was still unemployed and did not fill in this form, one's name would be removed from the register, which amounts to a gross insult. Anybody unemployed would just take off or go crazy if he had not already gone that way.  It demonstrates the lack of feeling and vision of the people who run that organisation.  I have spoken to Mr. Hannan and his staff and I understand the pressures to which they are subjected. That is why I believe the present system cannot be improved, that it must be scrapped and restarted.</P>
    <P>These organisations have outlived their usefulness and the position has now reverted to that of a manpower policy as obtained in 1965.  It should be clearly set <Col N="267" /> out for the ordinary unemployed person what they can do, that they register with an organisation or, if they must go on the dole, then they must or, if they wish to undergo a course, they are automatically registered for it so that they know exactly where they stand.  Last year I understand that AnCo had approximately 70,000 people who applied for training courses, many of whom did not know for what they were applying.  They were merely furnished with all the various colourful brochures and forms emanating from the various PR companies who tell young people what they should or should not not do.  This should all be explained by one well paid official with the necessary expertise initially, that, for example, the guarantee system means one thing, team work means another, AnCo training schemes something else, cutting out all of the red tape, annoyance and frustration, driving all unemployed, but particularly young people who perhaps do not understand the system so well, crazy.  The Minister could take that action speedily with trade union support.  Certainly taxpayers and the unemployed would welcome such action.</P>
    <P>On the positive side, if the system was properly computerised, the present organisations being abolished and forced to recommence, a number of schemes that would afford real jobs would then come to the fore.  It is being contended worldwide, but particularly in the United States, that jobs are arising now in small industries or organisations.  For example, over 60 per cent of the last 30 million jobs created in the United States have been in industries with fewer than 20 people. There is too much money going into big industries here, too much interest being shown in high technology, too much money being invested in order to prop up the large semi-State organisations, to attract the multinationals, with little or nothing being done for the small business or industry.  Any manpower authority can do certain things only, can participate in the creation of jobs but cannot solve the overall unemployment position.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Members of this <Col N="268" /> House will agree that <i>Building on Reality</i> set out to do four things in relation to employment.  It set out to ensure that a climate for employment creation was fostered through various policies including tax incentives.  That has not been done.  It set out to reduce the legal and institutional regulations that hamper employment creation.  It was to tackle the need for greater efficiency in the public service and it was to introduce special measures for school leavers and the long term unemployed.  A streamlined manpower authority with the IDA, CTT and other organisations working under the one umbrella would be better able to help young people.  At the moment the services are fragmented and the IDA and CTT run away from helping the small businessman and the person who has just been made redundant but who could use 30 years experience in building up a small industry.  While I do not ask the Minister to provide 200,000 jobs I would ask him to provide a streamlined manpower authority. There should be training schemes which would help to create jobs.  We should not have schemes to teach girls to type, for instance, when they have learned how to type the previous year at school.  A girl will not get a job at that. These people should be encouraged to work in a low paying small company which is trying to get off the ground. Liffey Trust, a private concern receiving assistance from the Department of Labour, have shown how this could be successful.  Its success in the long term, for a number of reasons, is questionable, but it has shown the success of the idea of setting up a co-operative involving five or six people.  In such a scheme people will not be working in a course which ends in June but will be working to create employment and a future for themselves. The money should go into that sort of scheme.</P>
    <P>I supported the social employment scheme giving £70 for 2½ days work a week and will continue to support it until we get something else.  However, at the end of the day, that will not create one additional job.  It is a bit like the environmental scheme that we started in 1977 <Col N="269" /> and which was opposed by the then Opposition.</P>
    <P>It annoys me that high technology industry can come in here at a cost of £80,000 per job, and their system might be out of date before the company has got off the ground.  These are capital intensive companies and they might never deliver the numbers of jobs promised. At the same time people who were made redundant, with years of experience and the ability and initiative to set up their own companies, are being refused help by organisations which are supposed to be geared to help such people.  If the banks, the IDA, CTT or anyone else are asked to vouch for their credibility and to provide £20,000 to get them off the ground, they will send enough letters to plaster the walls of this House saying that the proposed scheme is slightly outside of their guidelines.  When it comes to one big company all the regulations are set aside, Ministers drop everything because this is an opportunity to bring a new industry which might some day provide 1,000 jobs.  When a big American firm finds the world market collapsing and they need to close down a subsidiary they close down the business in Mayo, Limerick or wherever, leaving the people high and dry.  If this money were invested in the small companies, as is done in America, it would create more jobs in the long term.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister seriously to consider our motion.  Because of the system in the House the Minister probably feels he must oppose it.  The Minister should call in these agencies and should establish one streamlined organisation answerable to the Department of Labour and to the people.  Three years ago when I spoke on the Youth Employment Agency Bill I said it was just another organisation and the answer to that was that the Youth Employment Agency needed a Bill so that it could handle the levy.</P>

      <P>All the organisations set up to handle employment were very <Col N="270" /> handy for appointing boards of directors, and everybody might have appointed boards, but there should be just one big board with about 50 people who might do some work.</P>
      <P>The national plan tells us that in the next three years there will be 20,000 jobs approved while over £200 million has been spent on schemes of one kind or another.  It is a sad joke.  During this debate the Minister will hear a number of examples illustrating why this scheme is inoperable and illustrating that the present Manpower service is of no use to the unemployed.  We should go back to the drawing board and set up one body working with the Department of Labour and representative of the present organisations to deal effectively with every case and eliminate duplication.  The Government should act quickly in the interests of the 80,000 people under 25 and the other 150,000 people who are unemployed. The Government should do something to stop emigration, to help young people and to give people a future. People are disillusioned with the system, but the system can be radically changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to support the motion proposed by Deputy Ahern.  He touched on the basis of our argument when he referred to duplication and the confusion about the multiplicity of schemes for youth training and employment.  I should like to give the Minister an example of how the various schemes are operating and the difficulties people experience when trying to get assistance under them.  A farmer in my constituency sought assistance to set his two sons up in a horticultural business. As a good farmer he was able to supply the necessary raw material but he found if frustrating being sent from National Manpower to the YEA.  Those people were told that they did not qualify for the enterprise allowance scheme.  In fact, the only assistance they got was from the county development team.  That organisation was in a position to give them a small amount of help.  In many counties organisations like county development teams help out such applicants.  We <Col N="271" /> should be helping people to develop our natural resources, particularly at a time when there is such a high level of importing of horticultural produce.</P>
      <P>While the many agencies involved are doing a good job it is my belief that they are confused.  There is a problem of who does what and a fear that funding will be diverted from one to another.  They feel threatened by other agencies.  It is time that we had an integrated policy administered by one central agency.  I should like to refer to the vocational training and preparation course run by second level schools.  Under that scheme students are literally being paid to go to school.  They are paid £30 per month for ten months. It is pocket money paid to them to go to school.  One teacher told me that 40 of his students were taking part in that course.  He told me that if the administrator of the course was paid £12,000 he would have been able to do something worthwhile for the students.  The Minister is aware that schools do not have electricians or painters on their staff but an administrator of such a course could be given permission to bring in such specialists to give lectures on their work to the students.  It should be possible also to bring in people with a specialised knowledge of horticulture.  Instead of giving £30 per week pocket money to students the Minister should consider giving permission to the administrator to organise the course in a flexible way to suit the needs of students in the area.  Problems arise also because the conditions state that there must be 20 students for the course.  Another problem arises where there is a mixed class because it is not possible to have the same course for all students.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We regret that the social employment scheme did not get off the ground.  When it was introduced last October we were told that local authorities, health boards and tourism organisations would be able to get involved but my information is that only one local authority have had a scheme sanctioned.  Most local authorities have submitted schemes to National Manpower but that is as far as they have <Col N="272" /> gone.  I should like to compliment the Minister on the way he tried to promote the scheme and I should like to express my regret at not being able to attend the conference he held in Galway.  Galway County Council submitted two lists of schemes to National Manpower but because &ldquo;difficulties&rdquo; with unions not one scheme has got off the ground.  We do not know if any scheme will be approved in time to come.  It is sad, having waited so long, that the schemes have not been sorted out.</P>
    <P>The youth employment scheme which has been in operation for some time has run into a lot of difficulty because of the question of insurance.  It is about time that the Department provided block insurance cover for employers involved in those programmes.  I have tabled a question to the Minister about the matter and I understand he is examining the possibility of introducing such insurance cover.  In his contribution I hope the Minister will tell the House if the insurance problem can be overcome.  Very high quotations have been given to committees anxious to get work done under this scheme.  In fact, I read in last week's issue of the <i>Connaught Tribune</i> of an ambitious committee who are not able to get a quotation although a broker sought quotations from five companies for the first stage of a scheme at Monivera, Athenry.  I understand that the Department are examining the matter.</P>
    <P>The money collected under the youth employment levy should be put to better use.  The fact that £84 million was collected in 1984 is an indication of the colossal sum that is available.  Local authorities are starved of funds.  I am not making that statement because local elections are pending, but we are all aware of how many local authorities are short of money.  Some of the money I have referred to should be diverted to local authorities to help carry them carry out work on county roads which are in a dreadful state.  The money received from the Department is earmarked for arterial roads and national primary and secondary roads.</P>
    <P>I wonder why some of the money is <Col N="273" /> not devoted to drainage schemes.  Such schemes have been held up in the west since 1982.  It appears that the Minister for Agriculture is not able to get money from the EC for such training schemes. It is worth noting that the only part of the country where a drainage scheme is not in operation is the west.  Money collected under the levy should be used for that purpose.  We want permanent jobs for our young people.  I must point out that many projects in the west have been suspended.  In my constituency a peat briquette factory remains half built.  If that project was completed there would be many permanent sustainable jobs. While that factory remains unfinished we have confusion about various schemes and a lot of duplication.  I hope the Minister will rationalise those schemes.</P>

The tone in which they opened up this debate and their frankness and knowledge of the subject underlines a commitment that is shared on both sides of the House.  Deputy Ahern was talking about something that clearly he knows something about which goes back beyond a number of different administrations.  I welcome the positive way in which this debate has started.  Let me, in the same mood, try to respond.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been clear to me since coming into the Department and to some people before that that we had a need to rationalise and co-ordinate matters in the manpower area for a couple of reasons.  When <Col N="274" /> the manpower White Paper was published in 1965&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have taken notes.  I want to deal with the question of the White Paper first of all.  It is about 20 years since we had one White Paper on manpower policy.  This year we will have a White Paper on manpower policy, as Deputy Ahern knows.  The framework within which that White Paper has to operate has changed totally, virtually 180º.  In 1965 we were anticipating industrialisation and a shortage of certain industrial skills and it was a question of gearing up in anticipation of jobs that we hoped would be attracted into the economy and which in many cases were so attracted. To use the phrase of a specialist, we had a demand-led problem.  Today, for reasons that are self-evident and known to all Deputies on all sides of the House, the situation has changed totally.  We have a rapidly growing labour force and large numbers of skilled personnel already.  It is a question of fine-tuning the skills that they have and targeting them into areas that will provide employment.  Therefore, it is a supply-led problem rather than a demand-led problem.  Over the 20 years we have been largely successful on manpower policy in our industrial and economic growth, and I say this in tribute to previous office holders in different administrations.  Whatever other constraints there have been on employment and industrial development, they have not come from lack of a skilled or trained workforce.  To that extent we should pay tribute to the people who helped to bring that situation about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation now is quite different from what it was then and, therefore, the White Paper on manpower policy, which <Col N="275" /> will follow the kind of format and brevity referred to by Deputy Ahern, will be a series of proposals and decisions with an appendix of argument outlining why we arrived at those decisions; in essence it will be a series of decisions.  Before the end of this year this House will have an opportunity to debate that.  In the meantime there is a clear need to improve the delivery of the various schemes that exist at present.  Because there are a large number of schemes and because some of those schemes appear to be and in some cases are doing similar if not parallel types of work, it does not mean automatically that that duplication is wasteful or that it is really duplication.  It is possible to have different schemes at different times doing similar things for different reasons.</P>
    <P>There are two problems essentially. The first is ensuring that the transition from school to work is made as efficient and as effective as possible to ensure that the maximum number, if not 100 per cent, of young people leaving school get an offer of a job.  The statistics in this area based on labour force surveys and surveys of young school leavers are much more optimistic and beneficial to the community at large than people realise. As public representatives we know that the general perception is, &ldquo;What is the point of studying for the leaving certificate when there are no jobs out there?&rdquo;. The statistics, which I can make available to Members of the House, show that 69 per cent of young people leaving school get a job within 12 months.  They may not get the job they want or, more to the point, that their parents would like them to have, but they get a job.  In many respects the level of take-up for young people leaving the educational system is better now than it has been for some years.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, since it is his area of responsibility, will be able to give more information to the House when he speaks on this area.  The one thing that is coming through in all of the surveys and all the evidence both practically on the ground and from scientific surveys is that <Col N="276" /> the lower the level of end education a person has coming out of the system the lower his prospects are of getting a job. Therefore, there is a problem in ensuring that the transition from school to work is properly looked after and that young people who come out with poor or no educational qualifications are, firstly identified, secondly, assessed and, thirdly, brought into a training system that will in some cases perhaps make good components in their education that for whatever reason they were not able to get in school.  As working politicians we are familiar with this complex area.</P>
    <P>When I was appointed Minister for Labour just over 15 months ago, simultaneously the Minister of State at the Department of Labour was given the additional responsibility as Minister of State at the Department of Education of producing a co-ordination report.  I am pleased to say that that has been completed and in his contribution he will outline many of the findings contained within it.  Allegations which brought about that appointment, some of them in very outrageous terms and not in the manner that we heard this evening, were claims that there was massive waste and massive duplication.  After the detailed work, the meetings of the various committees and the reports, very little quantifiable evidence of such duplication and waste emerged, and it was not for the want of looking.  The reality as we found it, based on the interviews and so on, was different from this perception that existed.  However, it found the absolute need for a change in the way the system works, and that will come and we will be bringing it about.  I will leave the rest of the outline of that part to the Minister of State and he will add it to whatever else he wants to say.</P>
    <P>The second problems relate to, &ldquo;Why so many schemes?&rdquo; It is because there are different funding arrangements for schemes catering for the under 25s and those catering for the over 25s.  Funding comes in the main from the European Social Fund, so schemes must be targeted in order to qualify for the ESF.  I hesitate now, because I want to be sure that there <Col N="277" /> is nobody in the Distinguished Visitors' Gallery, before I say that this country is the best in the EC at maximising the take to which we would be entitled out of the ESF.  The people opposite will be aware of that.  This year we will get 13 per cent of the ESF largely because schemes have been designed and tailored in such a way as to maximise their eligibility for grant aid assistance from the ESF.  That is in part a contributing fact to the number of schemes, but the under and over 25 is a critical component.  The whole question of eligibility for qualification for aid from the ESF is complex and requires a great deal of attention, which fortunately we have been able to give, at official and administrative level in the Department of Labour, and I compliment them on the way in which they have been able to increase from 11 per cent last year to 13 per cent this year.</P>
    <P>The third reason why there are different schemes is that we have the perception of a youth employment problem and in response to that the Fianna Fáil Government in 1977 established the work experience programme and the employment incentive scheme which we kept on and revised and amended in some ways in the light of experience.  We then set up the Youth Employment Agency.  While youth employment is still a problem at an unacceptably high level, it is now being turned around.  We have the highest percentage of young people in the labour force in any EC country and we have the lowest level of unemployment for young people, despite the fact that our level of unemployment overall is the highest in the EC.  That did not come about by accident.  There have been a series of interventions.  They are not on the live register.  They are in training programmes, in placement, and many of them get jobs as a result.  That investment, through the youth employment levy, the YEA and all other related bodies, has paid off to the effect that we can measure it relative to other countries in that it has been successful.  We have a long road to travel because we still have an unacceptably high level of youth unemployment.  I do not want to give the impression to the <Col N="278" /> House that we have solved that problem because we have not, but to a certain extent we have got on top of it and we are dealing with it better now than we were three or four years ago.</P>
    <P>The centre of gravity of employment, as distinct from the transition from school to work, has shifted not just in this country but in all the other EC member states to that category known as the long term unemployed, that is somebody who has been unemployed for more than a year. Three years ago in Europe just under six million were unemployed; today there are just under 14 million unemployed and over one-third of them have been unemployed for more than a year.  We have had to design schemes to meet their needs because by definition the long term unemployed are people in their twenties or older and have different kinds of needs and respond to different kinds of work. That is another reason why we have these schemes.</P>
    <P>This is an area of considerable concern. This was one of the reasons why we introduced the social employment scheme &mdash; which was specifically designed for the over 25s.  It was announced in October as part of the national plan, was due to come into effect from 1 January and Deputies are correct when they say that we have been slow in getting it off the ground. This has particularly perturbed us in the Department and we are now moving out of some of the problems that arose.  For example, one of the problems was insurance for voluntary bodies trying to get public liability and employment cover for ten, 15 or 20 extra people they might take on.  This fact emerged when we were trying to find out why the take-up was so slow.  We are dealing with this problem very much along the lines Deputy Kitt suggested, because this is the sensible way to do it &mdash; lump all your purchasing power in the marketplace, buy insurance at a discount rate, apply it across the board and the legal responsibilities of the sponsor employer voluntary organisation are met in an efficient way.  That is what we are doing on that front.</P>
    <P>I was most interested in a point raised <Col N="279" /> by Deputy Ahern because we are working on this, and that is the contact the unemployed or the young person has with the various agencies trying to help him. We can sit with our documents, schemes and know all about them, because that is our job, but from the point of view of the young person or the parent of a young person, there seems to be a wide range of different schemes run by different bodies and different groups.  We recognise that, having set up the Youth Employment Agency.  The National Manpower Service are being modernised and computerised. Many of the points raised by the Opposition we have anticipated by over nine months.  The difficulty in getting computerisation into an organisation like the National Manpower Service is that at present they are put to the pin of their collar to deliver a service in terms of placement and at the same time trying to computerise a register of approximately 250,000 people.  In many cases that register is not up to date because people who apply to NMS and get a job do not necessarily come back and tell them they got that job.  This means that NMS can write to ten or 20 people some of whom may have a job and they may not bother to reply.  I am pleased to say that one of the first things I did when coming into office as Minister for Labour was to appoint a director to the National Manpower Service and we are changing and improving that area.</P>
    <P>I would like to pay tribute to the work the NMS have done to date, while in no way recognising the validity of much of what Deputy Ahern said.  For example, the employment enterprise allowance scheme enables somebody who has been unemployed for 13 weeks or more to get assistance for 52 weeks at the rate of either £30 or £50, depending on marital status, to set up business on his own. There are now 5,400 people on that scheme and the drop-out rate &mdash; the number of people who have gone back on unemployment assistance after 52 weeks &mdash; is, from memory, of the order of 700.  The sustained success rate looks <Col N="280" /> pretty high.  The rate of uptake by comparison with the United Kingdom is much higher as a percentage of the labour force.  There are more people here prepared to set up in business than appears to be the case in the United Kingdom.  That scheme has been run very efficiently at local level by the NMS, the placement officers, because in all cases it has involved sitting down with people, talking and counselling them and providing them with assistance to set up a business of their own.</P>
    <P>As regards the work experience programme, in 1982 there were 8,500 people involved and last year there were 12,000.  Figures are published in the first annual report of the Department of Labour and I will not take up the time of the House by reading them into the record.</P>
    <P>The thrust of this motion is one which in principle we welcome and accept but what we are trying to say in our amendment is that we are not starting from scratch because we have anticipated some of Fianna Fáil's proposals and have taken some action.  I would be happier if we had taken more action or if the pace had not been so slow.  I am looking at three office holders on the Fianna Fáil Front Bench and they will accept that things do not move as fast as we would like.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the validity of the Opposition's task.  It is their job to ensure that we move faster than we have been moving and I accept that and welcome this debate.  But what is the solution?  I worry about the suggested solution. Maybe this debate should take place in relation to the context of the White Paper.  Let us have an opening run at it now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think I have dealt with most of the points Deputy Ahern raised, but the final point he made dealt with restructuring the various manpower agencies and the idea of one big organisation.  That looks neat and tidy on paper and would satisfy <Col N="281" /> myself, Fianna Fáil and the bureaucrats, but the delivery of an integrated service at local level would not necessarily automatically come about as a result of a single organisation.  I am not convinced by his argument.  I have no hang-up one way or the other as to which is the best system.  One large bureaucratic monster might be the most effective way of doing it, but I have my reservations.  A series of groups might be the way to do it, if you can get them to work closely together.  I would hate to think either side of this House could get into an agony of debate over the structural model to deliver this kind of integrated service and we should pragmatically look at the best components we can put together at any one time, run them for a number of months, for a year or two and then, if they do not function, feel free to make a change. To some extent we are hung-up, and I include myself in this, in trying to solve problems by setting up structures and saying we need another new body or authority to do this or that.  I do not think that is necessarily the answer.  As Deputy Ahern said, we have gone through a process of internal discussion and debate on a White Paper in the Department, part of which addresses itself to institutional and structural arrangements.  There has been a great deal of internal debate on this matter and there is no clear consensus as to which way it should be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>What is vitally important is that the Department of Labour get back control.  The Department of Labour have lost control over the other agencies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the intervention. Whatever might have been the case in the past, I would assert that the Department of Labour are very much in control now, certainly by reference to other times.  The role of the Department of Labour is to deliver on policy, to work out in advance what is required and then to instruct executive agencies to deliver. We should not be tied up in administrative work and field work for which we are neither equipped nor responsible.  The Department of the Environment contract <Col N="282" /> out the delivery of services to local authorities; the Department of Health contract out the delivery of services to the health boards.  The delivery is with the authority and the policy is with the Department.  It is my intention to re-establish that form of model for the Department of Labour.  Otherwise we would have to change the entire nature of the Department because officials who have expertise in the area of policy and management get bogged down in administrative and fieldwork delays and simply do not have time to take their heads up from the desks to see what problems are coming up over the ditch.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>We agree fully with the Minister on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome that support. We will be moving in that direction.  On that basis we might find that it would be more effective to have all these different schemes administered from a High Street shop.  Whether that is the NMS office in one town or the employment exchange in another does not matter.  A person would know that all the required information would be available in that shop.  It is the difference between going to a super-market &mdash; if I can refer to a trade that is in my family &mdash; and going to one shop after another.  All services would be available under one roof.  We have made a considerable move in that direction.  We have integrated and co-ordinated the design of the teamwork programme for under 25s with the design of the social employment scheme, which involves the direct provision of employment by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A second area is concerned with enabling people to obtain work experience. There is also the employment incentive scheme.  We have tightened up the regulations governing the operation of that scheme because there were some abuses.  We had to take the trade-off between perhaps losing places because it would not be as attractive any more to employers while on the other hand ensuring that young people were not being exploited with taxpayers' money.  I think <Col N="283" /> we have the balance right but we are only as good as our information.  I would invite Deputies on all sides to contact us if they come across examples of exploitation and abuse.  We responded before on the basis of information.</P>
    <P>The third area relates to training.  It gives me some pleasure to say that AnCO are a superb organisation in terms of skill and ability.  During Ireland's Presidency I was president of the Council of EC Social Affairs Ministers and I had more than normal contact with the Commission and the Council.  It emerged quite clearly and decidedly that AnCO were held in high regard in terms of their professionalism and knowledge.  They who know more about the fieldwork dimension of training than the Department of Labour have advised us that in some areas there is a need for a variety of different programmes.  It is simplistic to say that the programmes should be simplified and brought down in number to four or five.  It is not that simple.  There are certain disadvantaged groups who by virtue of their circumstances will not get jobs unless they reach a certain level of training.  They need a special kind of targeted training to make up for difficulties they may have had in the past.  That relates to children from the inner city as distinct from travellers and the people who live in rural Ireland.  It is not possible to have a centrally designed programme which addresses the different needs of those people in the same way.  There is no reason why diversity cannot be integrated and easily understood by potential beneficiaries of the programmes.  It can be computerised and administered in a way that avoids the necessity for people to go from one office to another.</P>
    <P>The Opposition, in putting down this motion, have given the House a timely opportunity to debate a matter which is of such enormous concern to the institution of democracy in this House that if we do not begin to move very fast and solve, in a meaningful and rational way the problem of employment, then it will not be a question of this side of the House <Col N="284" /> losing and the other side winning.  The real risk is that the entire House will lose.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">

      <P>We share democratic traditions which are not very old and which are at risk on occasion from a small but growing minority of people who would use this situation and exploit the plight of people who through no fault of their own are without jobs.</P>
      <P>The White Paper will be published before the end of this year and I will welcome the debate on its decisions.  It will be a series of decisions backed up by reasons.  In the meantime the modernisation and computerisation of the National Manpower Service is going ahead.  If this debate has done anything it has reinforced on this side of the House the need for speed and urgency on that front.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be done as quickly as possible by whatever route.  There probably is not an adult in this country who is not either the parent, relative or neighbour of a child studying for examinations. There is worry about the uncertainty of the transition from school to work.  The Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham, will address himself to that matter tomorrow.  We are in the process of producing a rationalised presentation of all the various measures so that we can enable people to understand them.</P>
      <P>I thank the Opposition for enabling the House to have this debate.  I welcome the tone of the motion and the spirit in which contributions were made.  I hope I have replied in a similar vein.  We will respond to the points which have been so constructively made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I note with satisfaction that there seems to be an acceptance by the <Col N="285" /> Minister of the terms of our motion.  I hope that the indications on the subject matter of our motion will receive attention in the shortest possible time as he agrees should be done.</P>
      <P>My colleague listed an almost endless number of schemes and groups of people who are doing the best they can under their terms of reference to help people. I have no gripe with AnCO, CERT, the Youth Employment Agency, IMI courses, the IPA, environmental and education schemes.  However, in the case of the enterprise allowance scheme, we are applying the rules too rigidly in some cases.  Consideration should be given to bending the rule where it is an essential requirement to have 13 weeks' consecutive unemployment benefit to qualify for an enterprise scheme.  That is discouraging to people who wish to work.  I hope the Minister of State will at least give some consideration to those who are enterprising enough to start their own business and who wish to avail of the scheme.  They should not be hit with a sledge hammer when a toffee hammer would do.  If I mentioned the schemes available, it would take all the time allocated to name them.</P>
      <P>Training and retraining for various skills is desirable and necessary in view of the changes which we are experiencing technologically but training and taking part in courses which do not have sustainable employment at the end achieve little or nothing.  Unfortunately, this is the problem with many of the schemes and what little is achieved seems to be of a temporary nature which seems to satisfy the Government as it does not give a true picture of the numbers of people unemployed.  All these schemes are costing the country many millions of pounds but they are making very little difference in terms of employment.  That is why we put down this motion and I should like the Minister to accept its merit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that the fault is not with the people involved in the various schemes who are doing this training and retraining for young and not so young people who have lost their jobs.  The responsibility for providing incentive and <Col N="286" /> encouragement to provide sustainable jobs must come from Government policies and from good leadership.  If the Government had recognised the realities of the situation in industry and had responded by creating an environment more conducive to the needs of the industrial and commercial life of the nation, unemployment would not have reached its present dreadful level.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied also that there are funds available which could be diverted to productive and job creating investment for economically viable projects.  We must raise our sights and encourage that sort of investment.  That confidence can only come from the Government, prodded by the Opposition.  Between December 1979 and December 1984 the manufacturing industries lost 39,100 jobs according to CSO figures.  We could conservatively add more job losses in the servicing and support industries which gives a fair indication of the position.  Since 1981, the jobs lost average over 7,000 per year in the manufacturing industry.  Allowing for all those involved in training and youth employment schemes in the last year we are reliably informed that it amounts to about 20,000 people at any given time.  Nevertheless, we have an increase of 2,561 people under 25 registered as unemployed in one year.  We must also remember the many who are not registered &mdash; this has already been mentioned &mdash; for various reasons.  We must also take into account the scourge of emigration; it is estimated that 30,000 people are leaving every year.</P>
    <P>Much has been said recently about the social employment scheme and a policy statement issued in December 1982 by the Youth Employment Agency said that programmes for young people based only on concepts of temporary employment should be replaced by an approach which addresses itself to young persons' employment problems.  That is a very definite statement made in December 1982 and yet the &mdash; I do not know whether to call it the famous or the infamous &mdash; national plan continues to promote the concept of temporary employment in its social employment scheme &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The setting up of COMTEC is another temporary measure which fails to tackle the problem.  The social employment scheme, initiated in the Government plan in October 1984 and launched in February 1985 allowed for a sum of £29 million in 1985 to accommodate 10,000 persons in the scheme for each year of the plan.  Recently, the Minister conducted a public relations exercise in my constituency to sell this scheme to a wide variety of people.  This was the sixth or seventh area in which this public relations exercise, complete with slides and documentation, was launched and in response to a question from the floor, the Minister said that unemployment is on a level not experienced before and that some scheme had to be devised to combat it.  The number working in this scheme at present is minimal although applications are in the region of 3,500 to 4,000.</P>
      <P>We are half way through the year and very near to eight months since it was first mooted.  These figures must indicate that an appraisal of the situation and the remedy suggested in our motion must be undertaken immediately.  I am glad that the Minister accepted that we cannot allow this intolerable situation to continue unabated.  About £200 million has been spent on all the various schemes.  It is safe to say that the money collected from the 1 per cent youth employment levy is not being used for the purpose for which it was intended, that is, to create sustainable jobs for young people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all aware that the cost of employing people today is militating against the creation of jobs.  Short term schemes are of no use in the long term. We must create sustainable jobs.  There are various reasons why the cost of employing people militates against the creation of jobs.  In the first instance, the tax to the Government is 12.2 per cent. Unacceptable also is the cost, when one can get a quotation, of employers liability insurance.  We are all aware that there are a number of firms going out of business <Col N="288" /> because employers cannot get this insurance.</P>
    <P>A blanket scheme is being prepared to enable this scheme to continue but what about employers who wish to employ people but cannot do so because of the prohibitive cost?  Our efforts have been too piecemeal over the last few years.  It has been estimated that 20,000 new jobs are required every year to maintain the present level of unemployment.  What about the 230,000 who are registered as unemployed?  Many of them may never have a sustainable job.</P>
    <P>The high cost of unemployment is reflected in the cost of employing people, the cost of service, energy, insurance, transport and PRSI.  Until we come to grips with the policies which are being pursued unemployment will remain at its present high level.  Those are not my words.  We are told in the Government's plan that at the end of the planned period the number of people who will be out of work will be 226,000.  I do not accept that figure.  It will be far higher.  One month after the publication of the plan the figure was out by 13,000.  The Minister may be trying to plough a lone furrow in trying to combat unemployment.  We will always co-operate.  Our function in Opposition is to prod the Government into action.  Unemployment is the most serious problem facing our country and we will not tolerate all the side issues being brought in.  What we want is employment for our young people and not what was promised to them in a recent amendment.</P>

      <P>I speak in support of the motion and thank my colleague for giving me some of his time.  We cannot divorce youth unemployment from the general crisis in the economy.  That crisis has been brought about by a lack of confidence. Until confidence is restored and people have been encouraged to invest we will not solve this problem.  The Government should devote their abilities and make a greater effort to solve this crisis.  They are failing to do that.  That is why there are such problems with the <Col N="289" /> various schemes and why they are trying to develop and encourage new schemes.</P>
      <P>I wish to praise a body who have been in operation for some time, namely, AnCO.  They have done a great job and have been successful even in difficult times.  They have a trainee scheme which is second to none.  I was glad to hear the Minister praise it when he was president of the EC Council of Ministers in the social area this year.</P>
      <P>Community youth employment projects have been very successful in rural areas.  Many community halls have been built and there are now many first class facilities in rural areas as a result of these projects.  These have given the people a new independence.  They have a place where they can hold meetings, play games and so on and that is very important for rural areas.  We have many great houses and castles.  This is an area where youth employment schemes could be utilised. As we know, many of these great buildings are falling down but they could be restored and our heritage preserved for future generations.</P>
      <P>The Youth Employment Agency are another body who were set up and there was great competition between them and AnCO.  That was not in anyone's best interest.  This motion is trying to tidy up that area.</P>
      <P>In many rural areas entire families are unemployed.  We must overcome that problem.  It is demeaning.  One scheme, which is a mickey mouse one, is the farm job scheme.  We are losing our great skills in agriculture.  There should be more concrete schemes for employment at farm level.  I would like to see better co-operation with the Farm Apprenticeship Board who were set up a number of years ago. They have done very good work. Recently I read an article in the paper written by Labhras Ó Murchú.  He dealt with the skill of tinsmith which has been lost in rural areas.  We should preserve the skills we had in the past.</P>
      <P>In <i>Focus</i>, issue No. 10, May 1985, there was an article entitled &ldquo;Youth Year Roadshow is on the road.&rdquo; It is an insult to our youth.  The article states:</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for giving me an opportunity to speak about this matter here tonight even though I had to ask your permission on four different occasions.  This is a very important topic.  I am particularly concerned about Top Quality Products, Gorey, who were, and still are to a degree, in the mushroom production business.  They also manufacture compost for sale and distribution to their own production units.  The mushroom industry is one of the real success stories on the agricultural and horticultural scene.  There is a growing market for mushrooms.  There is a highly organised marketing strategy in the industry.  The horticultural industry should take cognisance of that fact.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Top Quality Products were told they could increase their production by at least 50 per cent and still receive the top price. A receiver has now been appointed and the operation is being wound down.  This will result in the loss of 147 jobs for people working for the company in <Col N="291" /> Gorey.  Twenty-four satellite growers, almost all farmers, use the industry to support their ailing income.  Last year the satellite growers earned £1 million which was a tremendous boost to their own incomes and a massive input into the local economy.  Those 24 satellite growers employ 100 people, and hauliers and others are also involved, bringing the total workforce to 260 people.  Top Quality Products purchased £120,000 worth of straw for the manufacture of compost last year.  The company pay £17,000 per week in wages to their workers</P>
    <P>The closure of Top Quality Products will devastate Gorey town and area, already reeling from the effects of the closure of the leather factory, G. L. Murphys, Realta Quilt Ltd., Noritake Arklow and job losses at NET in Arklow putting 1,100 people on the dole queue in the Gorey area where there is an unemployment rate of 21 per cent, 4 per cent above the national average.  The latest threat will put the figure at close to 30 per cent or one in every three workers. This is a national scandal particularly in view of the fact that the company can be saved with a little commonsense and a little goodwill.  Commonsense is not very common around this Cabinet table and goodwill is non-existent.  The company can and must be saved.  The book balancing codology we heard so much about will not be accepted any more.  It has proved to be an unmitigated disaster.  This was shown clearly in a survey carried out recently.</P>
    <P>We talk about job losses and we talk about home spun industries using native materials.  This is an excellent example of such an industry, but apparently it carries no weight with the Government.  The Government are a Cabinet of undertakers. They are burying industries and they are generating their own trade by killing them off.  Top Quality Products, Gorey, have been in existence for 12 years.  Religiously they kept up their PAYE and other statutory payments.  Two years ago they first felt the pinch.  Foir Teoranta moved in to help.  Now Foir Teoranta, a semi-State body, have called in a receiver <Col N="292" /> even though Top Quality Products were close to achieving viability.  It seems Top Quality Products had problems with a professional employee who apparently was not in good health.  As a result business suffered.  Recently another professional was appointed and the results were immediate and encouraging.  Since January the company were producing 45 tonnes of mushrooms a week which was sufficient to enable them to regain viability. Business was improving.  Why was the plug pulled on the people of Gorey? Why did the Government instruct Fóir Teoranta to increase the dole queue in Gorey by 260 people and to reduce the earning capacity of the area by in excess of £2 million per year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Government prevent the farmers of the area from achieving viability?  Why did they <Col N="293" /> cause the degradation and misery of unemployment to so many?  With a little commonsense and goodwill the day could have been saved.  It is not yet too late. Top Quality Products have a market for a further 10,000 tonnes of mushrooms.</P>
      <P>The company's fortunes changed at the beginning of the year.  Since then they have been improving gradually and the graph is improving steadily.  There was an improvement in morale and it was generally accepted that Top Quality Products were recovering.  Because of their quality the mushrooms were sought eagerly in the market place.  Arrangements were being made for changes in the company.  More modern techniques were being considered.  Suddenly and without warning the receiver knocked on the door.  When a company have turned the corner, particularly with State help, does it not make good sense to allow them to continue to operate?  Viability was in sight and the plug was pulled.  That is typical of the Government.  They never take into account the consequential unemployment or what that unemployment might cost the State in statutory payments.</P>
      <P>The questions I ask tonight and the questions I want answered tonight are: why was the plug pulled at this time? Do the Government agree that with a minimum of help and patience this firm can be saved?  Do the Government believe that the company can grow, saving jobs and preventing the inevitable misery and social evils which will result from closure?  It is time for honesty and straight talk.  Let us have some of that tonight.  Let us have the answers to the problems of Gorey.  The Minister should not try to divert us into other areas.  It must be obvious to everyone that the Government have failed miserably to halt the growing trend of unemployment &mdash; one of their greatest promises before the last election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year 30,000 people emigrated and 30,000 young people were added to the dole queue.  Together with the 230,000 people already registered as unemployed, this must be a clear demonstration that the Government are on the <Col N="294" /> wrong track.  Ignoring the problem will solve nothing.  The problem will not go away.  Decisive policies and decisive leadership are necessary and the courage to face up to the problem is required.  Running away from the problem is the main reason for the low level of confidence in the Government and in the economy.</P>
    <P>Last Friday the Minister for Finance was visiting County Wexford.  His itinerary included a stop at Gorey.  He was to go on to Wexford for a Fine Gael Party supper dance.  All involved in Top Quality Products were pleased that the Minister was coming to Gorey.  The local town commissioners, the excellent traders association and the trade union movement had backed an effort on the part of local politicians, some of them from the Fine Gael Party, to encourage a meeting with relevant Ministers.  The various groups said they would be prepared to travel to Dublin at any time for this purpose. I am sure that a request for a meeting of these groups was made also to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and I am asking him to tell us why he did not meet those people because no such meeting materialised. Are you telling me that your three colleagues in Wexford&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Dukes was coming to Gorey but Gorey was rocked because the Minister who has the cure for all our ills refused to meet anyone connected with Top Quality Products. However, he visited Ansil Limited which is a vibrant industry.  Also, he met with Fine Gael Party faithful while refusing to <Col N="295" /> meet those in Gorey who had problems. The Minister opposite may snake his head as much as he wishes but his colleague passed through Gorey as castor oil passes through a cat.  He spent three hours talking to people there but for some reason he was afraid to face the problem of Top Quality Products.  On the previous Wednesday the traders of Gorey had sent a telegram requesting a meeting with the Minister but they received no reply. Deputy Dukes says he has no say in the matter now that a receiver has been sent in but as Minister for Finance he has responsibility for Fóir Teoranta.  Deputy Dukes sent in the receiver.</P>

      <P>I do not know whether he deserves that full title but he has responsibility for Fóir Teoranta.  He ignored Gorey because of his fear of facing the people concerned.  Top Quality Products can survive and grow but they need £50,000 to buy one new machine and that machine would guarantee viability.  For the sake of everyone concerned I am asking the Minister to count in human terms and misery the cost of the closure of this factory.  The Minister must have regard to the positive side.  Top Quality Products must be saved.  The future of Gorey rests in the Minister's hands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Byrne for allowing me to use some of his time during this debate.  The recent appointment of a receiver to Top Quality Products has caused grave concern to the people of the Gorey area, an area devastated already by high unemployment. There are about 1,100 people, or 21 per cent of the workforce, unemployed in that area.  In the past year the increase in the unemployment level has been staggering but during the past decade, for example, the level of unemployment in the area has increased by a whopping 487 per cent.  This is an intolerable situation and one which no Government or Minister can justify.  No other town in Ireland <Col N="296" /> has suffered such a dramatic increase in unemployment in such a short period.</P>
      <P>During all this time there has been closure after closure of what were once thriving industries such as the leather factory, the infamous new IDA factory in respect of which so much was promised and so little delivered, G. L. Murphy and so on.  Other factors that added to Gorey's problems in terms of employment were the Arklow Mines situation, the huge redundancies at NET and Noritake. In addition there has been a serious decline in the agricultural sector, affecting jobs in the services area.  All these factors have devastated Gorey as a market town.  At a time of high unemployment, industrial development is always the priority but in this context, too, Gorey has fared poorly.  Only 3½ per cent of the population of Gorey are employed in manufacturing industry. That is less than half the national average but the final straw for the people of the area has been the appointment of a receiver to Top Quality Products, a develoment that has sent shock waves through the town.  This firm have been directly employing 147 people while indirectly, by way of the satellite growers, have been employing about 150 people on either a full or part time basis.  Those employees are mainly women, many of whom are the breadwinners in their homes because of the lack of employment opportunities for their husbands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The firm have afforded an opportunity to young girls to find employment in their own area and that is a very important aspect in a rural area such as the Gorey area.  The mushroom industry is vital to many people in Wexford but in the past five or six years there have been dramatic developments in that industry throughout Wexford.  There are many farmers and others who depend for a living on the industry.  Admittedly, Top Quality Products have had difficulties but my information is that they have turned the corner and are now in a viable position.  The appointment of a receiver heralds the threat of further job losses in Gorey. There is big money for the receiver but there is no concern for the jobs of the <Col N="297" /> people involved.  As one who has been involved actively in trying to keep afloat companies that were in difficulty, my experience has been that receivers are paid a lot of money for working very short hours.  In most cases the companies concerned close.</P>
    <P>The spending power of the wage earners at Top Quality Products is vital to the business people of the town of Gorey but if the company should close shopkeepers and others in the Gorey area will have no alternative but to reduce their workforce.  I was amazed that the Minister for Finance should refuse to meet representatives from Top Quality Products during his visit to Gorey on Friday last.  That was an insult not only to the workers of the company but also to the people of the area generally and particularly to the unemployed.  The Minister's refusal in this matter has brought angry reaction not only from the workers concerned but from public representatives and from supporters of the Minister's party.  I trust that the Minister who is present this evening will indicate some hope that this company will be able to return to full production.  The unemployment problems in Wexford in the past two to three years have been much greater than the national average in this respect.  The people of Wexford have had enough of this high unemployment.  They have had enough so far as the inaction of the Government in relation to the unemployment problem is concerned.</P>
    <P>Minister after Minister has visited County Wexford on business, but nobody seems to know for what purpose.  They are certainly not affording any hope to the unemployed of Wexford.  The three Fine Gael Deputies representing that county have been a disaster.  They failed to recognise the needs of that county and turned their backs on the people.  The people of Wexford will, in turn, turn their backs on those Deputies in the next general election and one of those TDs will certainly not be returned to Dáil Éireann. It is imperative that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism should designate Wexford as a priority <Col N="298" /> area in relation to unemployment.  Questions have been put down in the House and there have been calls every three to four months for the designation of Wexford as a priority area with regard to unemployment, but the Minister has ignored these calls.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to look seriously at the unemployment problems of Wexford generally and of Gorey.  Gorey has been devastated by high unemployment and has had a more dramatic increase in unemployment than any other town over the past ten years.</P>

As Deputy Browne obviously knows, because he did not repeat that foolish allegation, the Government did not, and no Government do, give directions to Fóir Teoranta in matters of this kind.  Fóir Teoranta were established by this House as an independent arm to make commercial judgments in this area.</P>

There was no interference by the Minister in directing Fóir Teoranta in regard to what action they should take or not take in this matter.  Indeed, if the Minister were to intervene in such cases one might as well abolish Fóir Teoranta and have the entire operation run from the Department of Finance.  That is not the intention of this House.  Deputy Byrne should not try to put about false-hoods about the situation as far as industrial rescue is concerned.  It serves nobody's purpose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There has always been a perception that the threatened or actual appointment of a receiver sounded the death knell of a company.  Of course, this is not the case.  There have been many instances of companies continuing to trade while in receivership and subsequently, having been reconstructed, being sold off to continue on a commercially sound basis with the problems which initially led to receivership having been eliminated by the receiver.  That, of course, is the aim in this case.  It is the aim of the receiver, since his appointment on 19 April to continue to trade with the expressed policy of selling the company as a going concern.  I understand that already, since the receiver has been appointed &mdash; and Fóir Teoranta may well have been justified in making this decision &mdash; that many of the problems of the company that existed prior to the appointment of the receiver have been sorted out.  I understand that the arrangements with the contract growers are also working well and that management and unions are co-operating fully to ensure the long term success of the company.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I also understand that the receiver is preparing a prospectus of the company and that both the Industrial Development Authority and Fóir Teoranta are contacting companies in an effort to generate interest in a takeover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the company for sale at the moment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the receiver <Col N="301" /> was appointed on 19 April.  A prospectus has been prepared with a view to a sale being made.  Obviously, the information has to be put into a prospectus before there is a realistic prospect of a sale taking place.  However, I can assure the House that it is the Government's intention, in so far as they can, through all the agencies that report to various Ministers, to ensure that this company are sold off so that they can operate on a successful basis.</P>
      <P>In response to Deputy Byrne, who claimed correctly that there was a good market for the product, I must say that, unfortunately, markets are not enough in some cases.  One must be able to produce the product at a price which is significantly less than the selling price.  The problem in the case of Top Quality Products was that production costs were simply too high prior to the appointment of the receiver.</P>

      <P>It is with a view to getting these matters in order that the receiver is making the present arrangements. I know that Deputy Byrne has been trying to raise this matter for some time.  He may have been more apprehensive about the situation at the time the <Col N="302" /> receiver was appointed than he is now, when he sees that the receiver is not closing down the company, as he seemed to fear and suggested in some of his comments. In fact, the receiver is continuing to trade with a view, having solved the problems, to selling off the company as a going concern.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <P>Of course, there is no guarantee that the receiver will succeed, any more than there is a guarantee that any company anywhere in the country will continue to trade successfully indefinitely. However, the intention is to remove the fundamental problems which existed so that the company can be sold off as a going concern.  That is all I have to say.</P>

    <P Just="Center">National Planning Board</P>
    <P>1.  The National Planning Board was established by the Government in March 1983.</P>
    <P>2.  The objectives of the Board were:</P>
    <P>(a)  reporting to the Government through the task force of Ministers on how to maximise output and employment in competitive conditions, and</P>
    <P>(b)  examining, at the request of the task force, specific issues within these terms of reference.</P>
    <P>In particular, the National Planning Board was requested to:</P>
    <P>(a)  review the potentialities and weaknesses of the productive sectors; assess their likely future contribution to output and employment on the basis of present policies, and recommend what policy changes may be needed to maximise this contribution;</P>
    <P>(b)  examine and recommend the means by which public works, essential to the provision of infrastructure for productive development, might be undertaken and financed at minimum net cost to the Exchequer as compared with the cost of unemployment compensation, and</P>
    <P>(c)  examine measures by which the needs of social equity and of securing an efficient use of public resources can best be reconciled.</P>
    <P>Through these activities, and through such other work as the Board may consider necessary for the purpose, the Board were requested to prepare for the task force a draft medium-term programme for the economy within the framework of which short-term economic planning would proceed.</P>

      <P>Regulation No. (EC) 1820/80, which governs the western package electrification scheme, is very strict with regard to eligibility.  Article 4 of the regulation provides that only applicants who are dependent principally on agriculture for their income are eligible for assistance under this scheme.  On the basis of the information provided in his application form, the person concerned does not fulfil the requirement of Article 4.  However, electricity supply can be extended to the premises by the ESB under normal terms, details of which are available at the local ESB office.</P>

According to this examination, no diplomats accredited in France applied for Irish visas in 1984; 94 diplomatic persons accredited in Britain (including spouses of diplomats) applied. Of these, 75 worked in embassies, the ambassadors of which were also accredited to Ireland or such accreditation was being arranged.  The examination did not reveal any case in which a visa was refused.</P>

      <P>There is currently no visa requirements between Ireland and South Africa.  The question of introducing such a requirement is a matter for the Minister for Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="47" /> In general, international practice is that such visa arrangements are reciprocal. It is to be expected therefore that were Ireland to introduce a visa requirement South Africa would do likewise. My Department have been studying the implications of a change in policy given this likelihood.  This would affect not only Irish nationals living in South Africa and retaining Irish passports but also Irish nationals visiting or travelling in transit through South Africa, including our aid workers in Lesotho.</P>
    <P>Once the assessment has been made of the implications of changing the present policy, I shall be in a position to make a recommendation on the matter.</P>

      <P>In 1978 the Government, on behalf of certain Border counties, including County Donegal, lodged a global compensation claim with the British authorities in respect of damage to public property caused by the cratering of roads and bridges along the Border.  Certain additions to these claims have been lodged since then.  The total amount claimed in respect of County Donegal currently stands at £111,060.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The response of the British authorities was that cratered roads and bridges along the Border would be made good when the security situation permitted.  The British position remains unchanged.  The position of the Government on closed Border roads, on which I have made repeated representations to the British Government, is that they cause inconvenience <Col N="50" /> and hardship to local residents and should be reopened.</P>
    <P>Compensation for damage to private property resulting from the cratering of Border roads and bridges has been paid by county councils along the Border and has been recouped to these councils by the Exchequer.  The Donegal County Council has paid £1,245 plus costs in respect of claims made by three residents and this amount has been recouped to the council.  A global compensation claim in respect of private property along the Border was agreed and paid to the Exchequer by the British authorities in 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>On 26 March 1985, the Council of Industry Ministers gave its assent to the European Commission's proposal to extend the deadline for payment of operating aids to the steel industry by one year to 31 December 1985 and to allow member states to notify the Commission of proposals for additional operating aids.  The Council also re-affirmed the requirement that all State aids to the Community steel industry be terminated by 31 December 1985.  The Commission subsequently adopted a Decision(1) amending the expiry dates for the notification, authorisation and payment of operating aids to the steel industry.  Under this Decision additional aid may be authorised by the Commission only for carrying out financial restructuring to reduce debt service charges to the level borne by undertakings that were profitable in 1984 or for covering costs occasioned by capacity reductions.  The Commission will not authorise additional aid for a steel undertaking in excess of that which would reduce debt service charges of the undetaking to below 4-5 per cent of sales turnover.</P>
      <P>Officials in my Department are at present examining the implications of the Commission Decision insofar as Irish Steel Limited is concerned.</P>

An amended certificate, which will show an increase in the figure of tax free allowances over that granted for 1984-85, will be issued to the taxpayer as soon as possible.</P>
      <P>The inspector has no record of having received from the taxpayer a certificate of interest paid to the amount referred to by the Deputy.  The agents acting in the case were requested by the inspector on 15 January 1985 (and again in February 1985) to supply certain details concerning the taxpayer's borrowings to enable his entitlement to relief in respect of loan interest to be determined but they have not responded.

An exemption certificate has now been issued to the taxpayer and, when it is operated by the payer of his pension, all the tax which has been deducted from the pension since 6 April 1985, will be refunded to the taxpayer.

      <P>The use of mobile mass X-ray units was discontinued in May 1977.  I have no plans to re-introduce them.  The service was discontinued for the following reasons:</P>
      <P>(a)  there is no need for a mobile X-ray service in Dublin as the area is adequately provided with static X-ray units in Charles Street and Dún Laoghaire;</P>
      <P>(b)  in addition there is a very good X-ray service in the country now through county and regional hospitals which was not the case when MMR was established;</P>
      <P>(c)  the number of cases of respiratory tuberculosis discovered by MMR in recent years was only a small proportion of all cases of this form of tuberculosis e.g. 5 per cent in 1973, 3.4 per cent in 1974 and 1.7 per cent in 1975. Most cases are discovered by doctors who refer patients to static units for X-ray;</P>
      <P>(d)  the finance needed to replace the units which had become unusable, would be considerable i.e. new X-ray equipment and vans;</P>
      <P>(e)  the World Health Organisation had recommended &ldquo;that the policy of indiscriminate TB case finding by MMR should now be abandoned&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(f)  the programme managers of community care in the health boards did not consider MMR a useful or economic service.</P>

The reason for the delay in processing the application was due to the absence of a proper set of farm accounts to enable the health board to carry out a means test.

      <P>The person concerned was awarded a widow's non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £6.50 with effect from 8 March 1985.  This is the rate of pension payable to a widow under 66 years with no qualified children who has weekly means exceeding £38 but not exceeding £40.  Her means, derived from a farm holding, were assessed at £38.46 a week.</P>
      <P>She appealed against this decision on 26 April 1985 and the claim was referred to the local social welfare officer to review the assessment of means in the case in the light of the statement submitted by the widow in support of her appeal. When a report is received her claim will be referred to an appeals officer for determination and she will be notified of the outcome.  The claimant's late husband had been in receipt of old age non-contributory pension at the maximum rate (based on his means, last assessed in 1975) which included an increase in respect of his wife and this pension was paid to her for six weeks after his death, on 19 January 1985, in place of widow's pension.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit on 18 February 1985 in respect of an incapacity which he attributed to an occupational accident on 15 February.  Pending the completion of investigations arising from the accident he was awarded disability benefit on an interim basis at £88.35 from 20 February 1985 and pay-related benefit at £33.68 from 9 March 1985.</P>
      <P>Following confirmation of details of the accident, injury benefit was awarded from 16 February, the first day of incapacity, at the rate of £102.35 a week.  The adjusted rate of pay-related benefit payable was £30.94 being the maximum amount payable to the limit of 75 per cent of his reckonable weekly earnings in the governing 1983-84 tax year.  Benefit over and above the benefit already paid on an interim basis to 1 May 1985, after which he was certified fit to resume work, has been issued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The qualifying conditions for the receipt of a contributory old age pension require a person:</P>
      <P>(i)  to have entered into insurance before reaching the prescribed age, 57 in the case of the person concerned;</P>
      <P>(ii)  to have qualifying contributions paid in respect of not less than 156 weeks of insurable employment since his entry into insurance; and</P>
      <P>(iii)  to have a yearly average of not less than 20 qualifying contributions paid or credited from 5 January 1953 or from the year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.</P>
      <P>The person concerned will reach age 66, the qualifying age for contributory old age pension, in June 1987.  He was insured at the modified rate of social insurance contribution payable in respect of permanent and pensionable public servants from 1947 to February 1979.  This rate does not include cover for contributory old age pension or retirement pension. From March 1979 to mid-April 1982 Class K contributions, which do not include any social welfare insurance element, were paid in respect of him.  Contributions at a rate qualifying for contributory old age pension were paid in respect of him for the first time from mid-April 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since contributions which included <Col N="107" /> cover for contributory old age pension were first paid in respect of him after he reached age 57, his yearly average of qualifying contributions will fall to be calculated over the period from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1987, the end of the contribution year before he will reach age 66.  Even if he has the maximum possible number of qualifying contributions from mid-April 1982 to 5 April 1987 he can only have a maximum total of 258 such contributions, equal to a yearly average of only seven.  He will not, therefore, qualify for a contributory old age pension at age 66.</P>
    <P>Neither will he qualify for retirement pension at age 65.  Entry into insurance at a qualifying rate before reaching age 55 is a requirement for this latter pension.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was in receipt of disability benefit from 4 September 1984 to 23 October 1984.  She claimed unemployment benefit for the period 1 November 1984 to 28 December 1984 but her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment.  She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her case on 7 February 1985.  Her claim has been allowed by an appeals officer and arrangements have been made to pay all arrears of unemployment benefit due this week less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance due for recoupment to the health board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Her entitlement to unemployment benefit exhausted on 28 December 1984 when she received 390 days of unemployment benefit in the period of interruption of employment applicable to her claim. She has no requalifying contributions paid and will not requalify for unemployment benefit until she resumes insurable <Col N="108" /> employment for at least 13 weeks with contributions paid at the appropriate class.</P>
    <P>She made a claim to unemployment assistance on 4 January 1985 and her case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of her means.  The social welfare officer has called at her home address on a couple of occasions and requested her to furnish details of how she disposed of her capital.  To-date she has not done so.</P>
    <P>The social welfare officer will call on her again shortly after which her case will be submitted to a deciding officer.  Her means will then be assessed and her entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined accordingly.</P>

Arrangements are being made to have their appeals heard orally at the earliest opportunity and their entitlement to unemployment benefit for the period 13 March 1985 to 23 April 1985 will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.  Unemployment benefit was allowed at the appropriate rate of £37.25 weekly in respect of both claimants from 24 April 1985 and weekly payments will continue to be made to them as they become due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of old age pensioners, when an application for pension is made, their full entitlements are examined and if it is found that the applicant is living alone, the allowance is put into payment when pension is being awarded. If a pensioner applies late for a pension, the pension and any increases such as the living alone allowance, are paid from the date of receipt of the claim.  This is in accordance with the relevant legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a pensioner is not living alone at the date of application, but subsequently finds himself living alone it is open to him to apply for the increase which is payable in such cases.  The increases are normally paid from the date of receipt of the application which is consistent with the manner in which claims to pension are <Col N="125" /> dealt with generally.  In certain cases, however, such as where the husband has died, retrospective payment of the living alone allowance is made for a period not exceeding three months or from the date of death of the spouse whichever is the later.  All cases are dealt with on their own merits.  If the Deputy has any specific case in mind he should send the details to the Department and the matter will be examined.</P>

      <P>The appeal of the person concerned against the decision which awarded her a widow's non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £11.30 has been disallowed.  An appeals officer confirmed that her weekly means, derived from a British pension, are in the range exceeding £34 but not exceeding £36 and £11.30 is the appropriate rate for a widow with such means who has no qualified children and is over 66 and under 80 years of age.</P>

In the event, it was possible to arrange for some classes to continue at Cork prison without interruption and those classes which were interrupted are expected to be resumed shortly both in Cork and Arbour Hill. The reason they cannot be resumed immediately is that some additional prefab accommodation will be required at Cork prison and some alterations will be necessary to other facilities at Arbour Hill prison.  This work will be completed as quickly as possible.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The opening of the three new stations resulted in the redeployment of Garda manpower in Cork city with a view to making the best use of resources and improving the policing arrangements for all areas in the city.  Two of the stations, i.e. Gurranebraher and Mayfield, were replacement stations for the old stations <Col N="167" /> at Shandon and St. Luke's respectively and in fact the current strength at each of these stations represents a net increase of eight in the number of members who were transferred from the old stations last year.  The current strength at Blackrock station, which is an extra station catering for part of the area formerly served from Union Quay station, consists of ten members redeployed from within the Cork City South Garda District and two members assigned there from stations outside the Cork city area.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the current strength at the stations in question represents the maximum strength that can be assigned there at present, having regard to other demands on Garda services, but the assignment of extra gardaí to the area will be kept under review by the Garda authorities.</P>

Might I again point out to the Deputy that repeating questions on a weekly basis is absorbing resources which could be better used in the direct administration of schemes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if, due to the increasing number of young people emigrating to England, it is his intention to give extra finance during 1985 to the Irish Centres in England to meet their rising costs.</P>

      <P>In the last two years the Government have increased substantially the grants for emigrant advisory services from £38,000 in 1983 to £68,000 in 1984 and £104,000 in 1985, an increase of £66,000 (+ 174 per cent) in this period.</P>
      <P>In June 1984 I appointed a committee, DION, with particular responsibility to advise on emigrant welfare services and to make recommendations on the provision of financial assistance towards the employment of professional workers dealing with the welfare problems of Irish emigrants in Britain.  DION is chaired by the Labour Attaché to the Irish Embassy in London and includes in its membership representatives of Irish organisations in Britain.  It replaces the Committee on Welfare Services Abroad (COWSA) which had operated since 1969 but which was largely Irish based.</P>

    <P>In relation to the inference that the number of young people emigrating to Britain is increasing, there are no precise figures available to support or contradict such a contention.  I understand that the CSO estimate that total net emigration in the period April 1981 to April 1984 is an average of 6,000 a year and that net <Col N="190" /> emigration in the year to April 1984 was less than in the year to April 1983.  For further details I would refer the Deputy to previous Dáil Debates on 4 December 1984, 22 January, 23 January and 19 February 1985 when the Taoiseach answered questions relating to emigration statistics. I also replied to a question on emigration on 23 January 1985.</P>
