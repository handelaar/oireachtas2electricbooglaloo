    <Title>Health (Family Planning) (Amendment) Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night I referred to Deputy McGahon and the harassment to which he had been subjected and I said that the chairman of his constituency was responsible.  I have been informed since then that it was not the chairman but other party activists at constituency level who were responsible, and I would like that correction to be recorded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I made a plea also that the Minister would indicate whether he intends to introduce legislation relating to the 1979 Act that would give the women of Ireland the protection they need against the risks inherent in the pills and devices they are using already.  I hope that we will not hear anything further from those Deputies who claim to be concerned about the wellbeing of women and their demands for a fully comprehensive Bill, unless they are prepared to seek the safety of the women whom they are inviting to use these devices.  The Bill now before the House provides access to contraception by law for single people and will be the <Col N="243" /> most revolutionary measure on the social plane since independence.  No matter what age limit is provided it will mark a break with the ethos of almost the entire known history of this country.  It will have the doubtful distinction of being the first legislation since the penal days to be enacted in this land that is contrary to the law of God.  The section in the Bill which is causing me most concern is that which provides for the sale of contraceptives, spermicides and sheaths to persons over the age of 18 years.  One may ask if this is a redefinition of the family.  If it is not, then it has nothing to do with the family and should not hide behind that term.  It should be called by its proper name, a condoms availability amendment or legislation for moral decline, because those terms would more accurately describe what is inherent in this amendment. If the proposal is not for the family, then the purpose must be to prevent pregnancy from acts of adultery and fornication, and one must ask why any Government should want to do that.</P>
    <P>On the claim made about demand for condoms and the legitimisation of it because of the number of condoms supposed to be imported into this country each year &mdash; one source has said 50 million and another 30 million &mdash; our total population is about four million.  Being generous and allowing that half of those people would be involved in the use of condoms, the mind boggles at what is suggested here.  I do not accept that we are hearing the truth in this.  I ask the Minister if he can produce in this House the VAT or excise returns on those imports.  I believe that a gross of condoms are bought wholesale for £12.83 and sold retail for £27.84.  There is big money being made there somewhere, and if the quantities indicated are being imported, that would be worth investigating so that we might know who is making all this money and whether the people concerned are paying their due taxes on the profits.</P>
    <P>This Bill which purports to make contraceptives available to people over 18 cannot be policed.  We cannot police the <Col N="244" /> alcohol laws in that regard.  Only this morning I had a letter from a concerned mother in County Kildare who is a publican and she writes that to suggest that anyone could police the proposed legislation is a nonsense.  I had a letter from another mother outlining the difficulty of determining the age of young girls.  She tells me that she has four daughters, that one who is 20 looks like a 13 year old while another who is 13 looks like a 20 year old and has a problem in defending her right to travel at half fare on buses. How, then, does the Minister propose to police that aspect of the legislation?</P>
    <P>It is known that the family planning clinics are using slot machines for the provision of condoms.  A slot machine does not ask questions.  One merely inserts the amount of money required and the goods are provided.  Another aspect that Deputy Tunney pointed out is that even if young males of 18 years would be in a position to obtain contraceptives on a legitimate basis, the likelihood is that their partners would be younger.  Thereforce it would be impossible to police such legislation.</P>
    <P>There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the making available of these devices has a very damaging effect on the health of young people and on the nation in general.  In this respect I should make the House aware of the concern of many doctors though we know there are some, such as the Doctor Rynnes and the Doctor Leahys.  Doctor Rynne in an interview with John Bowman on 7 February said publicly that he had no intention of keeping this law.  He is Chairman of the Irish Family Planning Association. He said he intended to break the law because it was his opinion that these devices should be made available without any reference to an age limit, but here we are invited to change a law which is supposed to be a bad law while some people are claiming that the proposed law will be equally disregarded.  Members of the medical profession say they are extremely concerned at recent proposals to make contraceptives freely available <Col N="245" /> by law to young single people.  They continue, and I quote from a letter, dated 23 October 1984, from that body.</P>
    <P>It is our understanding that a majority of people in the State oppose such measures.  (I.M.S. Poll August 1984).</P>
    <P>We would regard the implementaction of these proposals as injurious to the physical and mental health of our youth with all its attendant social implications. If these proposals become law the inevitable consequences will be increased promiscuity, with an upsurge in venereal diseases (syphilis, gonorrhoea, herpes and chlamydia) and carcinoma of the cervix as experienced in this and other countries.  The accepted high failure rate of contraceptives when used by teenagers must lead to increased teenage pregnancies and abortion.</P>
    <P>We would like to emphasise that the setting up of an age limit for contraceptive practice is devoid of any scientific or sociological basis.</P>
    <P>Furthermore legalising something which is productive of so much proven pathological and sociological <i>sequelae</i> is to us both reprehensible and horrific. </P>
    <P>The letter is signed by 17 doctors, each of whom is expert in this field.  To disregard that kind of advice is to fly in the face of reason.  Many others, too, have commented on what has happened everywhere that free availability of contraceptives has been introduced.  I do not know how many Deputies here had the opportunity of seeing a film last week on ITV in which was portrayed the level of depravity to which the young people of England have sunk.  Little girls of nine and ten are being used in some instances for all kinds of obscenities.  All of this is contingent on the free for all kind of society that has emanated from allowing these kinds of contraceptive devices to be made available where they cannot be policed.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that where we here are working overtime to introduce problems that others are trying to rid themselves of, a Catholic MP, Mr. William Cash, Conservative MP for Stafford, <Col N="246" /> tabled an early day motion in the House of Commons drawing attention to the link between the issues of the Warnock Report, Mrs. Gillick's case and AIDS. He called on Mr. Norman Fowler and Mr. Kenneth Clark to promote a campaign through the Health Education Council warning of the danger to health in the current trends of sexual promiscuity. Mr. Cash said that the prime justification for the Warnock proposals is to cure infertility, but he asked how many people realise that infertility often is the direct consequence of abortion or sexual disease and that abortion, sexual diseases and cancer are surely the consequence of widespread and early sexual promiscuity, often before the age of 16. Mr. Cash went on to say that in every case of abortion in an unmarried mother there is a significant risk of subsequent infertility and, where it is accompanied by sexual disease, the risk of AIDS or one of the other sexually transmitted diseases.  He said it is now established that AIDS can be transmitted between heterosexuals as well as between homosexuals and that doctors fear we may be in the incubation period of a massive outbreak of AIDS for which there is only a limited chance of survival. Mr. Cash said that the Royal College of Nursing predicted recently a potential one million cases of AIDS within the next six years.  He stressed that the problem is urgent, not exclusively on moral grounds, but also on social and ethical grounds and on the basis of common sense.</P>
    <P>Despite the concern expressed by so many as to what people in Northern Ireland think of us, is it not ludicrous for us to be heading down the road that people in other places are trying to move away from?  Much has been said about our young people, about their right to make decisions for themselves and if they so wish to become involved in sexual activity. It is important to draw the attention of the House to the result of the National Youth Policy Committee in which is outlined the results of a survey the committee conducted among young people between 15 and 20.  When asked the question, &ldquo;whose view do you take most cognisance of&rdquo;.  88 per cent answered that <Col N="247" /> they heeded their parents most, 63 per cent indicated that they paid most attention to their clergy, while only 18 per cent said they took heed of what their politicians said.  In reply to a further question, &ldquo;who do you think understands you best&rdquo;, 84 per cent said their parents understood them best, 64 per cent their pastors and a mere 13 per cent their elected representatives.  That is very significant. Here we have a Bill which is totally at variance with the wishes of the parents and their children.  We have the audacity to presume that we know better than they what is good for them.</P>
    <P>Dr. Verling, venereologist for the Eastern Health Board, says that the VD clinics at the moment cannot cope with their pressure of work.  They are seeing 360 cases per week and are totally understaffed. If all this extra activity takes place, who will look after the people who will become infected, particularly at the time when the Minister for Health has had to remove their medical cards from the very young people to whom he now wishes to give condoms?  That is another problem to be confronted.  If they do become diseased, will they have the money to have themselves seen to?  I doubt it very much, with the present degree of unemployment and the rising university fees.</P>
    <P>We have heard much about the effects on Northern Ireland of all that is going on here and have been advised that while they have had access to contraceptives they have not been turned into a very permissive society.  There is an interesting letter to the editor in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 15 February last from Father Denis Faul.  He must have heard the claims that were being made about how little Northern Ireland had been affected. Nobody in this country doubts the sincerity and genuine commitment of this priest, both as a peacemaker and a concerned pastor.  His letter states:</P>
    <P>In your editorial of February 8th you state that &ldquo;no one claims that in matters of sexual <i>mores,</i> they (the people of the North) have become debauched <Col N="248" /> or depraved&rdquo;.  I do claim it and have repeatedly claimed it.</P>
    <P>Debauchery and depravity are relative terms.  What is debauchery and depravity to a Carmelite nun may not be debauchery and depravity to the staff of <i>The Irish Times.</i> But all can recognise a steady decline in sexual morals expressed in corruption of the young and the breakdown of marriage; the graph of decline grows steeper over the decades until the hollow globe of a society without values cracks and breaks into chaos and barbarism. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that it be on the record of this House for those who will look back on what has been said in this debate.  This man deserves to be mentioned.  His letter continues:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many factors contribute to this; violence and discrimination in society may be powerful forces in wrecking normal decent life.  So too can divorce and abortion in lessening respect for sacred and irreplaceable values.  Contraception is one such force.  Prescinding from the fact the teaching authority of the Catholic Church forbids it, one can study its social effects, and the people of the Republic must ask: do they want these items with their corrupting effect and the enormous expense of dealing with the consequences of disease and <Col N="249" /> mental breakdown and the care of parentless children?</P>
    <P>In the North there are children of 12 and 13 years of age using contraceptives because they are available; the truth of the extent of the corruption is buried in the records of hospitals, doctors' surgeries, priests' and ministers' ears and lawyers' offices.  One notes a rapidly increasing decline since 1979-1980, not only in practice but in the lack of respect for areas of life and conduct formerly held sacred.  The media, especially TV and videos, have played a part in this.</P>
    <P>Things may well be as bad in the South.  But, remember, the situation never reaches rock bottom while we do not think wrong.  We may do wrong because we are all weak creatures of passion.  But when the wrongdoing becomes rightdoing because it is sanctified into State legislation at the taxpayers' expense, that is the penultimate corruption (the ultimate is when churchmen approve of contraception, abortion, divorce, etc).</P>
    <P>Thirty years ago an old priest of great learning and holiness, who served 65 years in the diocese of Armagh, said to me: &ldquo;If the Irish ever lose the Faith, it will be through the corruption of their sexual morals&rdquo;.  It is sad to watch his words coming true. </P>
    <P>I think that says all that has to be said about the effects of this liberal attitude to making contraceptives available to young people.</P>
    <P>I am opposing this legislation on social, health and financial grounds.  I do not know if the Minister and his Department took the trouble, before presenting this Bill, to carry out any kind of investigation as to the effects upon the health of our young people and the social effects with single parent families and the heartbreak of young people destroying themselves with disease before they have a chance to get a start in life at all.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, who will pay for this? That is the question that the Minister for Health must answer in this House.  He knows that he has had to make dramatic <Col N="250" /> cuts in the services for which he is already responsible.  Everybody knows that the health boards are under such pressure that they are having to close down wards and send people home who should be kept in hospital &mdash; I could go on about this.  This is all because the finance is not there to keep paying the bill.  Has the Minister done any cost analysis on the contraceptive services which have been made available to the health boards over the past two years?  What is that costing the taxpayer?</P>
    <P>In Britain at the moment the contraceptive services are costing the taxpayer £67 million per annum.  They have a population of roughly 58 million to 59 million, so one can immediately see that we are into an area here which needs to be examined.  We must be told where the money is supposed to come from. Frankly, I cannot see the PAYE taxpayers being willing to put their hands in their pockets to pay for what Deputy De Rossa believes to be a right of people over 18 years of age and younger.  I doubt very much that they will be prepared to do that.  We all know that they are overburdened at the moment.</P>
    <P>I now address myself to the sources from whence I believe this great demand for making these contraceptives available is coming.  It is certainly not coming from the people in this House.  It is not coming from the parents of the children, the people who elected us.  The only one who has put constant pressure on the House to introduce this legislation is the Minister for Health.  I would be inclined to believe that the Minister really wants this and considers it to be a necessary service, if he were not associated with an organisation which has a vested interest in promoting it.  I do not know if anybody in this House knows very much about that same organisation.  It was founded by a woman, named Margaret Sanger who was a Margaret Higgins of Irish immigrant parent extraction &mdash; who was born in New York in 1879.  She rejected the judo-christian tradition of morality and family life.  She said that the marriage bed is the most depraving influence in the <Col N="251" /> social order and she advocated sexual freedom for all, provided procreation was avoided.  So strongly did she feel that women have the right to decide on all these things that she was the first to openly advocate the right for abortion. In her <i>Credo for Women's Rights,</i> 1914 she included the right to be an unmarried mother, the right to create and the right to destroy.  Writing a little later she claimed that no one could doubt that abortion is justifiable.  Her greatest hatred was directed towards the millions of poor who should never have been born according to her, and whose very existence threatened the well being of society and its more intelligent and better endowed members.  The most merciful thing a large family does to one of its infant members is to kill it, she wrote in <i>&ldquo;Women and the New Race.&rdquo;</i> Her greatest wrath was reserved for the Catholic Church, which she said encouraged the reckless breeding habits of slum-dwellers.</P>

      <P>The date is 14 January, 1976.  Mr. Patrick Cosgrave, describing this organisation, said that it was one of the most savagely damaging lobbies a society has ever had to confront.  The Irish Family Planning Organisation became a full member of International Planned Parenthood, which was the organisation set up by Mrs. Sanger in 1975.  The annual general meeting of this organisation here was held in Clare in 1977.  I am concerned that our Minister for Health should be a member of an organisation with that sort of background. It is the only identifiable source putting pressure on this House to introduce a Bill which will have disastrous effects for our young people.  This organisation have had disastrous effects wherever they have gone.  They are anti-life, anti-love and anti-family.  They have no tolerance of purity, chastity or honesty. They consider those virtues to be old that and not to be bothered with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the items that make up the programme for the Irish Family Planning Organisation are quoted in a document called <i>Response</i> which is published by Concerned Parents.  Their Headquarters are in Great Britain and they now have a wing in Dublin.  They say that the Family Planning Organisation agree that every non-Governmental organisation should not use the absence of law or the existence of an unfavourable law as an excuse for inaction, action outside the law and violation of the law as part of the process of stimulating change.  We all know that both the Minister, the Chairman of the Family Planning Organisation, Dr. Rynne and Dr. Leahy, also a member of that organisation, have abided by that <i>diktat.</i> In order to bring about the situation in which we are now they saw fit to break the law.  Can anybody honestly suggest that they believe in introducing a Bill that has very little chance of being policed?  An organisation with that kind of background and attitude could not be trusted to police it or to care whether or not young people got condoms.  They <Col N="253" /> have already told us that they do not intend to keep this law, so why are we trying to change one bad law for another? I would be grateful for an answer to that question.</P>
    <P>I appeal to my colleagues to see this for what it is.  It is not being done in the interests of the young people and I will not be convinced that it is.  I ask my colleagues to listen to the people who elected them and reject this Bill.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the tyranny that exists in this House at the moment relating to the voting procedure on this matter.  I have already put it to the Taoiseach at our Parliamentary Party meeting that he allow us a free vote.  I know that that is asking a lot since Deputy Haughey, the Leader of the Opposition, might not be prepared to allow a free vote.  I am asking Deputy Haughey, as a reasonable man, to be big enough to allow his party to vote in accordance with their consciences.  I know that there are some Fianna Fáil Members who hold an opposite view to me but they should be allowed to vote in accordance with their consciences. Deputy Haughey would be doing the Irish nation a great favour if they could preserve some kind of maturity in this House.  I would live with the result of this vote if I thought it was a genuine reflection of the views of the elected representatives. However, the way things are shaping up now I am not convinced that that is what we will end up with.  I make a plea to the Taoiseach, and the Leader of the Opposition, to come together between now and the time scheduled for the division this evening and decide not to impose on the Irish people a piece of legislation they do not want.  If at the end of the day after people have been allowed to express their honestly held views, they come up with an answer they think best for our people, I believe it would be accepted; but our people will not have much respect for the House if we go through this charade that is being played out.  I appeal to the two people concerned to get together and bring forward a decision that will reflect the genuine concern of Members.</P>

      <P>Before the Chair calls on the next speaker he would like to remind the House that the House made an order this morning, without dissent, under which the Minister for Health must be called at 8.10 p.m. this evening to conclude and under which the debate must conclude at 8.30 p.m.  Since the proceedings began this morning approximately 25 Members have intimated to the Chair their wish to contribute to the debate.  It is obvious that many of those speakers, quite a number of whom may have special reasons for wanting to contribute, will not get an opportunity of doing so.

It has been pulled from the bottom drawer at a time when the Government are experiencing serious difficulties with the economy <i>vis-à-vis</i> their performance as administrators.  There was no plan to introduce the Bill.  It has come like a bolt out of the blue.  Its introduction smells of sinister motives.  When the Fine Gael and Labour parties went before the electorate part of their hurried plan of conception was that there would be a review of the 1979 Act but, as yet, we have not heard of any review of that Act.  The Bill before us proposes to make contraceptive devices available to single teenagers.  It is incumbent on the person charged with the responsibility in this area, the Minister for Health, to make us aware of any review conducted by him or his Department.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the responsibility of the Minister under the 1979 Act. According to that Act the Minister shall:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) secure the orderly organisation of family planning services, and (b) provide a comprehensive natural family planning service, that is to say a comprehensive service for the provision of information, instruction, advice and consultation in relation to <Col N="255" /> methods of family planning that do not involve the use of contraceptives. </P>
    <P>Will the Minister illustrate the efforts he has made since he took office to promote natural family planning methods as is incumbent on him?  Will he tell the House the amount of money he has made available to the organisations involved in promoting natural family planning?  It is my view that he has shunned his responsibility in this regard and made very little money available to them.  I understand that he did not make any money available in 1984.</P>

      <P>I resent that remark. The Minister's speech contained nothing more than a plethora of unsubstantiated figures and statistics that do not have any basis and were totally erroneous as far as the presentation of the Bill is concerned. It is irresponsible of the Minister to foist them on Members without presenting official documentation and reports to substantiate his case.  The Minister said the changes were limited to two matters, but I disagree with that.  He ignored the concept of the family unit and instead proposes to make contraceptives available to 18 year old single persons.  His proposal is that they be made available without the necessity to obtain a prescription from a doctor or through an agent or servant making available a family planning service.  They represent three new departures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a number of occasions the Minister referred to the provision of a comprehensive family planning service for those who require it.  He said that the Irish Medical Association sought this measure.  Did the IMA request that contraceptives be made available for single teenagers or bona fide couples?  I presumed that changes requested would have involved those needing family planning.  I cannot visualise single teenagers needing such services. The Minister has told us that when he took office he initiated a detailed review of the operation of the 1979 Act. He said that the review showed conclusively that 30 million condoms had been imported between 1980 and 1985 and they were sold in only a quarter of our chemist shops.  Will the Minister break <Col N="257" /> that figure down?  Was he referring to packages or were the figures exaggerated to suit the promotion of the Bill?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is closer to 40 million.  I have excluded those imported in luggage.  The data is available from importers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should not direct questions at the Minister because that encourages answers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had many vague generalisations but the report referred to has not been placed in the Dáil Library.  Why?  Because it did not contain suitable ammunition for the promotion of this Bill.  If the system of both availability and distribution fails, does that justify a revision of the law? This is a ridiculous Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the Minister's private departmental review he was convinced, and then convinced the Government, that these changes were necessary.  Of course, this was part of the hurried conception of this callous Coalition, part of whose pre-Government plan was to bring about this liberalised, permissive, pluralist legislation supposedly for the common good and for the promotion of advanced socialist thinking &mdash; some socialist reformers whose hearts bleed continuously for the less well off sectors of our community. Throughout his speech and in the Bill itself the Minister consistently casts a slur on medical doctors.  All doctors are not willing or are in a position to provide a full family planning service.  Why?  What justification has the Minister for a statement like that?  Surely in modern times all professional people need to update information and to seek retraining? Surely a statement such as that is an admission that the Minister, as Minister for Health, failed in his duty to provide ample opportunity for medical practitioners to update their skills and expand the store of information needed in modern times?  I believe that professional people, whether they be legal, educational, medical or otherwise, must discharge their duties in a proper ethical <Col N="258" /> manner and, if the law or laws place a further onus on them or on this discharge of their duties, then so be it.  This discharge of duties surely is the price paid for the professional privileges the ordinary person expects and for which they pay ultimately at all times.</P>
    <P>The proposals of this Bill are in conflict with some of our existing laws, in particular with section 2 of the Criminal (Amendment) Act, 1935, which forbids unlawful carnal knowledge of a female under 17 and which shows clearly the age of consent to be 17 and over.  How does the Minister reconcile these legal constraints with his proposals to make contraceptive devices available ad lib to all and sundry?  As a result of the passage of this Bill the availability of condoms will make consent totally impractical, irrelevant and will lead to many more difficulties for young people.  Under the Indecent Advertising Act, 1889, the advertising of VD clinics and many other advertisements are banned.  If the widespread ad lib sale of condoms has been illegal before the passage of this Bill, how can the advertisement of these devices in magazines and newspapers produced, printed and published in this country be legal?  Where is the influence of the Advertising Standards Commission? What has the Minister done to discharge his legal duties as the Minister responsible for health in this area?</P>
    <P>The Minister has used many statistics, as have many people promoting this Bill, over the last few weeks and days.  I should like now to refer to some statistics.  On 12 February an opinion poll in this country disclosed that 41 per cent of people were in favour of the free availability of contraceptives. But there has been no mention whatsoever of the remaining 59 per cent who were satisfied with the law as it stands.  It appears to me that it is felt that 41 per cent of the people should be legislated for and that their opinion should be taken as that which suits the majority.  An IMS poll taken in December 1983, and another in August 1984, showed clearly that 62 per cent of our people were satisfied with our present <Col N="259" /> laws on contraception.  That proves conclusively that the majority of our people are satisfied with the law as it stands and vindicates the 59 per cent still satisfied on 12 February 1985.  Therefore this Bill is unnecessary.</P>
    <P>In countries where there is free availability of contraceptive devices there are numerous medical and human problems encountered.  These are the effects of the liberalised availability of these devices. For example, in Denmark 41 per cent of pregnancies end in abortion.  In the United Kingdom up to 20 per cent of all babies born are illegitimate.  Again in the United Kingdom there are more people attending venereal disease clinics than there are women attending ante-natal clinics and the cost of these services to the British Exchequer is enormous.  I should like to quote what it has cost our health services in 1984.  A reply given to a parliamentary question I addressed to the Minister himself on 11 December last showed that the total cost of the health services in this country last year was £2,231.68 million.  If we are to pass this Bill we must ask what escalation of costs will there be as a result of the difficulties that will be encountered by so many people, particularly the young?  In a disintegrating economy in a small country we cannot afford such costs.  Therefore it is totally unrealistic and impractical to impose the provisions of this Bill on our people, and particularly our youth, at this time.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill will lead to pressure for divorce as a result of marital breakdown.  This has been proven conclusively. I should like to quote now from a statistical abstract from the United States Department of Commerce in 1978 which showed that in 1910 in the US there were 83,000 divorces against 948,000 marriages. In 1950 there were 385,000 divorces against 1,667,000 marriages.  In 1977 there were 1,090,000 divorces against 2,176,000 marriages; the ratio was approximately 50 per cent in 1977 and still rising &mdash; that in a country which has free availability of contraceptives.  This is <Col N="260" /> what is being proposed under the provisons of this Bill.  Major efforts are being made now by the Reagan administration to control the situation in America.  A special committee has been established there recently to endeavour to curtail and control the availability of contraceptives, bringing about natural stability to the people of the United States.</P>
    <P>I should like to quote also from a letter in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 15 February 1985 &mdash; an 18 year old girl from County Cavan writing in that paper.  She had this to say:</P>
    <P>As an 18 year old girl and a member of the age group that is supposed to be demanding contraceptives I wish to state that I do not want contraceptives nor do any of my friends.  I wish the Government would put more time and resources into straightening out the financial and job situations in this country instead of trying to damage our lives, our health and our welfare. </P>
    <P>I represent a constituency in the west where that is the theme of young people.</P>
    <P>We have given much time to this Bill over the past week.  At a time when there are close on 250,000 people out of work, when drugs and their attendant problems are rampant throughout the country, I believe the Minister would be better employed devoting more time to trying to alleviate the drugs situation, directing his efforts and those of his colleagues in Government to endeavour to alleviate the misery of so many young people desperately and despairingly seeking jobs.</P>
    <P>I said earlier that I believed there were sinister motives behind this Bill.  Other speakers have referred to the fact that in <i>The Irish Press</i> of 17 April 1984 the Minister for Health admitted to membership of the Irish Family Planning Association which is the Irish arm of the International Planned Parenthood Feberation, the world's foremost promoter and provider of abortion as a legitimate form of family planning.  In this Bill the Minister proposes to create an opportunity for family planning clinics and services not within the ambit or control of the Department of Health to make available <Col N="261" /> and to sell contraceptive devices.  Last year the Minister opened an illegal family planning clinic in his own constituency&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Very well.  The Minister said that consent was given to open this family planning service in his own constituency.  If that is so and if the Minister issued a document, licence or certificate so that this service could be made available, then I accept that situation. <Col N="262" /> However, I am not satisfied with the law as it stands which permits that situation, and that is the point I wish to be made. How can we prove conclusively that contraceptives will not be sold to people under 18 years of age?  That is the whole weakness in the Bill: if we make contraceptives available in a system which is not under the direct control of the Department of Health, medical doctors and pharmaceutical chemists, professionally trained people whose duty it is to be involved in this area, we are opening the floodgates whereby these family planning clinics will becomes the agents for abortion and to make it available.  We are changing our whole stance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the direction in which this country should be going.</P>
      <P>This legislation is ill timed and unnecessary.  It has been proven conclusively that the majority of the people are not in favour of it.  I reject this Bill because it will increase the rate of marital breakdown, the incidence of veneral disease and illegitimacy and, above all, it will have a detrimental effect on the sexual behaviour of young single people who would not be concerned with or need family planning.  That is why I oppose the Bill and I appeal to my colleagues on all sides of the House who have expressed reservations about it to reject it in the interests of the common good.</P>

      <P>I shall endeavour to be as brief as possible because I should like to hear contributions from Members of Fianna Fáil which might be more enlightened and civilised than the speech to which I have just listened.</P>
      <P>I have been present for most of the debate so far and I commend the Minister's speech in introducing the Bill when he said:</P>
      <P>Above all we in this male dominated House must show particular concern about the impact of our laws on all women. </P>
      <P>Later in his speech he quoted remarks made by Deputy Eileen Desmond on the 1979 Act as follows:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are still a very parternalistic society.  We think that adults must have their minds made up for them and their morals decided for them on a matter like this.  We decide that the personal <Col N="264" /> decisions of women, the people who are most concerned should be disregarded. </P>
    <P>In 1985, having the honour and privilege to be part of this Chamber &mdash; a doubtful honour at times considering what I have had to listen to &mdash; I realise that nothing has changed for women inside this Chamber but a lot has changed for women outside, thank God.</P>
    <P>There have been repeated allegations made here that there is no demand for family planning clinics, advice, education and access to contraceptives.  I do not want to take up the time of the House by quoting and giving statistics, but in view of some of the figures given by Deputy Treacy I will give the results of a survey carried out by Irish Market Surveys Limited. They prepared a document for the Health Education Bureau entitled <i>Public Attitudes Towards Family Planning.</i> The date is March 1984 and I quote from page 27 paragraph 5.1:</P>
    <P>5.1 Satisfaction with the Present Laws relating to the Sale of Contraceptives.</P>
    <P>Over twice as many Irish adults are dissatisfied with the present legal situation regarding the sale of contraceptives, as are satisfied with the <i>status quo.</i> Just over one-quarter of the total adult population have no firm view on the current legal situation. </P>
    <P>On page 31 it states:</P>
    <P>5.4 Preceived Government Role in the Provision of Family Planning Clinics.</P>
    <P>There is overwhelming approval of the idea of the Government setting up family planning clinics, amongst the 18-50 year old population represented in the survey.  Fully nine out of every ten respondents were in favour of the notion of the Government setting up specific family planning clinics as part of Health Board Clinics throughout the country.  Only 4 per cent opposed the idea, while a residual 7 per cent had no clear opinion one way or the other. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="265" /> 5.5 Age Constraints on the Availability of Contraceptives.  At this point in the questionnaire, alternative propositions were put to people as to whether:</P>
    <P>Contraceptives should be available to people over a certain age, whether they are married or single, or alternatively.</P>
    <P>whether contraceptives should be available to married people only.</P>
    <P>Respondents were asked which view came closest to their own.  Seven out of ten people identified themselves in favour of the general availability of contraceptives, with an age constraint. One-quarter of the total sample favoured the concept of contraceptives being available only to married couples. </P>
    <P>Yet we are told in the House there is no demand for them.  It has also been alleged that this is a Machiavellian attempt by the Minister for Health, out of some weird and malicious motivation, or of the Labour Party to foist this on the innocent and sinless people of Fine Gael who want no part of it.  At the Fine Gael Ard Fheis year after year large majorities called for an amendment of the Act.  In 1984 they deplored &mdash; that was the spirit of the motion &mdash; the fact that it had not been amended.  Two of the executive levels within Fine Gael, the national council and national executive, have endorsed, in one case with the large majority and in the other unanimously, what the Government are doing &mdash; and yet we are told there is no demand for it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Treacy accused the Minister of not providing money or facilities for doctors to be brought up to date on family planning.  For years doctors have had an opportunity to update their training on family planning but surveys have shown that not only did many doctors not want to update their training but that they did not want to participate in initial training because their consciences would not allow them to do so.  The fact that Deputy Treacy should go so far as to attribute the free availability of contraceptives to the rise in divorce figures in America and <Col N="266" /> elsewhere verges on the ridiculous when the social factors are so complex and significant in other areas.  From the many submissions the Committee on Marriage Breakdown have received from people in holy Ireland &mdash; I am glad Deputy Flynn is here because he spoke with great compassion about them &mdash; it will be realised that there are other factors leading to divorce and marriage breakdown other than the availability of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I am moved by the concern shown by Deputy Treacy with regard to indecent advertising and the terrible fear that contraceptive devices, God save us all, might actually appear in magazines when I think of the exploitation, indecency and obscenity of advertising with regard to women's bodies.</P>

      <P>It is all part of the hypocrisy we witness any time we talk about sexual matters in this Chamber.</P>
      <P>We can no longer escape from reality. People who look for their civil rights, particularly women, often have to repair to the High Court, Supreme Court or European Court.  The McGee case recognised the right of couples to have access to contraceptives and to exercise their conscience on that.  It took us years to catch up with the position.  An inadequate Bill was brought in to try to please all the people all the time.  It was a laugh and a farce, not only here but internationally. In the meantime the social realities caught up with us without our having the honesty or compassion to do anything about them.  There are unmarried mothers.  I will not take up the time of the House reminding Deputies how some of them and their babies have been treated.  When introducing the Bill the Minister said:</P>
      <P>A study of 100 unmarried mothers who delivered their babies in St. James Hospital&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>They were lucky: they actually delivered them in a hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash;in 1980 found that while 64 per <Col N="267" /> cent were having sex on a regular basis only 18 per cent regularly used any form of contraceptives. </P>
    <P>The Minister then went on to say, honestly and logically, that it was not the use of contraceptives and the influence of sex education which brought about this situation but rather &ldquo;...I submit, the virtual absence of both&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We have grave social problems and we have sexual problems.  We have the same urges as every other human being regardless of where they are born or brought up, but we also have an incredible cloak of hypocrisy and repression which does not allow us to develop fully or take personal responsibility for our sexuality. Until that is changed we will still continue to have problems and pain and will ignore what we do to women and children in society.  This debate has shown that we have not grown up one whit since the last painful debate we had involving sexuality.</P>
    <P>What we see in the Bill is a concentration on 18 year olds and on teenagers who indulge in sex at 13, 14 and 15 years. On the other hand, we hold we are an upright, moral and religious country.  It has even been suggested by some speakers here that we have something that is spiritually uplifting and morally right, that could be a torch and a candle in pagan Europe.</P>
    <P>If our moral integrity is such, if parent and pastoral guidance is listened to by 84 per cent and 64 per cent of people as Deputy Glenn stated was the case according to a recent poll, how can we as adults and parents stand up in this House and indict our whole young population as a crowed of Gadarene swine throwing themselves off the cliffs of sexuality into depravity and venereal disease?  It does not tie up.  However, it shows we do not really trust our religious values to hold, we do not trust parents to pass on the right standards and the children to listen to and to uphold them.  It shows we do not believe we should give the right to adults of 18 years to choose and make their own responsible decisions.  That is <Col N="268" /> one of the most serious points of the debate.</P>
    <P>All anyone can do, be they pastor, parent or teacher, is to imbue in young people the right set of values and morals and give them the space to develop and to make in maturity their own choices and decisions based on those values. From what we have heard consistently in this Chamber it seems we do not believe we have done a good job and we do not believe our young people have moral values.  In this Bill we are dealing with only one form of contraceptives, namely, condoms.</P>
    <P>What are we saying to our young people?  I will tell the House what I am hearing from them.  They are insulted, they feel totally misunderstood and, even more, they reject the politicians in this House.  In the survey Deputy Glenn mentioned this morning, it was stated that only 13 per cent of young people would turn to a politician for advice.  I will make two points on that.  Even fewer young people will turn to a politician for any advice because we are so out of touch with the young.  I have heard trotted out by elderly, mostly male, politicians that because even the 13 per cent of young people did not ask them for condoms or contraceptives there was no demand for them.  These politicians tell us that if there was such a demand they would know about it.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an attempt to bring more legality to a situation and to an Act that should never have been introduced in the way it was introduced.  In this country we have a tendency to break the law rather than to make the law.  We go ahead with the attitude &ldquo;nudge, nudge&rdquo; and &ldquo;wink, wink&rdquo;, with the late hours drinking without inquiring fully regarding the age of young people who are drinking.  We have a totally ambivalent attitude to the law.  We do not mind if it is broken so long as it does not make waves, as long as it does not threaten our seats or lose us votes.  We are the legislators, and we have had the honour and privilege of the electorate putting us here to make sure that laws are made and are kept.  We have an entire Opposition on the opposite side <Col N="269" /> whose leader said last July on a radio programme that he fully recognised that there were grave discrepancies in the law, that it needed amending because it had not implemented what it set out to do. This has affected many couples, particularly women.  The existing legislation never did what it was supposed to do, namely, to give contraceptive advice, to ensure availability and education, as well as medical treatment and scanning for people who needed it.  It appalls me that rural TDs whose areas are the most affected by this deprivation and discrimination are the very people who stand up here and say there is no demand for contraceptives.</P>
    <P>To add to further disillusionment, depression and disappointment regarding this small measure but which represents a significant marker for all of us, we had to consider the attitude of a politician who spoke bravely and seriously in 1979 on the Family Planning Bill at that time. He is not only a politician but he is also a doctor.  People argue that all family planning should still be left in the hands of doctors.  That Deputy has already said that contraception is a human right, that the Act discriminates against women and was a Mickey Mouse measure so far as youth were concerned.  Yet, as far as I know that doctor and that politician is going to vote against this Bill, although I wish he would do otherwise.</P>
    <P>We worry about our young people and we wring our hands about the slippery slope they will be on so far as sexual matters are concerned, but by our example we undermine not only their sense of values regarding sexual mores but we also undermine in a much more terrifying way their trust and belief in the democratic system and in legislators bringing in laws for the common good.  Probably we will pay a very high price for that.</P>
    <P>This is a small Bill, but we have to make one of the most important decisions we have ever made.  There is a bottom line, and those of us who have worked hard to get into this House and who are committed to reforming legislation had better think about it.  If this small, much needed and not very radical measure is <Col N="270" /> not passed by this House I and other politicians will have to wonder what we are doing with our time and with the money of the nation in being in a Chamber where we claim to be legislators but where the hierarchy outside make decisions about legislation.  That hierarchy does not include, and has no intention of ever including, the full participation or decision-making of women, yet in remarkably strong terms it makes grave moral decisions and gives directions on behalf of women.  I repeat, I respect the right of bishops and spokespeople for any Church to speak out on behalf of their beliefs but I expect legislators in this House to take their role and responsibility seriously, to realise that there are boundaries beyond which we cannot go.</P>
    <P>Unless this Bill is upheld and passed many politicians in this House will wonder if this is the bottom line, whether democracy can go hang, whether elections mean nothing because the voting and the legislative reform or non-reform comes from another body in another House.  It is serious, and I rely on the fact that legislators in this House appreciate the role and responsibility they have been given and they will not sell out on them. If they do so they will have sold out not alone on our present but on the future of the famous youth we are so concerned about.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances I should express my thanks to you, Sir, for calling me, because I see many of my colleagues around the House who are anxious to speak and are not allowed to speak because of this innovation of the list which is apparently handed to the Chair.  I notice that those of a certain point of view are far down on this list, and I congratulate Deputy Flynn on his good fortune on being on the top of it, which, I am sure, is sheer coincidence.</P>
      <P>One must approach this debate from two aspects.  The first is that of the Bill itself and what it contains, provides and will do or not do <i>vis-á-vis</i> existing law and practice.  Secondly, one must approach it in the overall context in which the general debate has taken place not just in the House ten days or so since this Bill was published.  I emphasise the fact that I regard the second of those situations as by far the more important, because that is the kernel of where the decision must be made in regard to this Bill.  The Bill was never very important but it has largely become irrelevant now because issues much greater have raised their heads in relation to far deeper matters than the mere availability of condoms to 18 year olds and over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Noel Treacy speaking this morning.  Much of what he said was similar to what quite a number of other Deputies who have spoken in this debate have said, that they have <Col N="273" /> taken the view that as things stand the availability of contraceptives, particularly condoms, in this country is only very limited and that this Bill will change the whole situation radically, that we stand at the crossroads, we are going down the slippery slope to degeneracy and all the rest of it.  Do some Deputies and people outside the House think that because the law says something, therefore that is the way things are?</P>
    <P>What are the facts in relation to condoms, which are the type of contraceptive that seems to be most generally discussed in this debate?  In the last four years 30 million of them were imported here and they are being used at the moment at the rate of nine million a year with no legal supervision whatever because the 1979 Act is not now being enforced.  Not alone are they distributed, on the face of it, not in accordance with the present law, from family planning clinics, they are distributed from places that do not claim in any way to be family planning clinics.  I instance the ordinary shops in UCD and TCD and probably UCC, UCG, Limerick and so on.  I do not know the situation there but I inquired about it in UCD and TCD and in each case there in an ordinary grocery shop a large stock of contraceptives is available for anybody who wants them.  Nobody is asked whether he or she is married or what age he or she is.  Many of the students in UCD are under 18, they are 16 and 17.  It is open to anyone in those circumstances to buy anything he wants without let or hindrance.</P>
    <P>That is the present situation.  Is it opening the floodgates to try to regularise that?  I do not think so, but a feature of our national hypocrisy is that if the law on the Statute Book says that things should be one way, it does not matter if things on the ground are different.  As long as the law looks all right we cod ourselves into thinking that something that we do not approve of is not happening. Would it not be more sensible to be realistic and look at what is going on around us and realise that, no matter how strongly we might be opposed in principle or in conscience to contraceptives, we <Col N="274" /> would be better to have a law that will be enforced rather than the present situation?</P>
    <P>The enforcement of the law is important to the background of this Bill, and I have certain suspicions about it.  A case was heard in Dún Laoghaire District Court on 18 September 1984 and was reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 19 September 1984.  A prosecution was brought by the Garda against a family planning clinic in Dún Laoghaire.  The clinic was represented by Mr. Adrian Hardiman, B. L., who made the point early in the case that the two gardaí who had come into the clinic and who apparently had purchased contraceptives without a medical prescription did not have the authorisation of the Minister for Health which, in accordance with section 96 of the Health Act, 1947, should be given, with the consent of the Minister for Justice.  That was argued between the defendants' barrister and the State's barrister.  The district justice concluded that the point was valid and that under the 1947 Act, which is the enforcing part of the 1979 Family Planning Act, that authorisation was necessary, and since it had not been shown to be provided, the case was dismissed. So far as I know there was no appeal.  I am entitled to ask the Minister for Health why he did not give the authorisation or why, if it was overlooked in error, it was not given the following week to enable the same or some other gardaí to visit the premises if they considered that necessary.  Was this an interference with the due process of the enforcement of the existing law?</P>
    <P>It seems to me strange that none of the various bodies who are so vocal about the evils of condoms did not apply to the High Court for an order of <i>mandamus</i> against the Minister to compel him to authorise officers to visit these clinics.  Instead they were allowed to continue to operate widely and openly.  They probably served a good purpose up to a point in the present situation, but I have one strong reservation.  If the Bill is put through Second Stage I should like to see it amended to take account of this point, that is, that the clinics would be supervised <Col N="275" /> very strenuously from the point of view of trying to ensure in so far as possible &mdash; and the law is often semi-powerless in these matters &mdash; that these clinics are not used as referral agencies for abortion, for encouraging or facilitating in any way the sending of girls to England for abortions.  The figures in respect of Irish girls who had abortions in Britain in 1983 are horrific.  More than 3,700 gave Irish addresses and we do not know how many thousands more travelled to Britain for that purpose but did not give Irish addresses for fear that they would not be facilitated or for some other reason. This is the most horrendous aspect of this whole area.  That is why I am calling for some provision to ensure that there is no such facility.  I consider abortion to be so horrific as to bear no comparison whatever with what we are talking about now, which in that context is of minor importance.</P>
    <P>It puts in perspective the whole question of what we are debating today to realise that at present the availability of contraceptives is probably far wider and less supervised than will be the case if the Bill is passed.  For that reason I find it very difficult in conscience to put forward any opposition to the Bill.  Deputies who would reflect on that aspect, which is undeniable, might see it in that way, too.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to say any more about the details of the matter.  They are not of great importance.  I wish to move on to something that is more important.  There are certain fundamental matters which far transcend the details of this Bill and which are of grave importance to democracy on this island.  I cannot ignore the principle that is involved.</P>
    <P>Difficulties have arisen since the publication of the Bill.  In the past ten days or so the most extraordinary and unprecedented extra-parliamentary pressure has been brought to bear on many Members of the House.  This is not merely ordinary lobbying.  It is far more significant.  I regret to have to say that it borders at times almost on the sinister. We have witnessed the public and the private agonies of so many Members of <Col N="276" /> the House who are being asked not to make decisions on this Bill in their own calm and collected judgment but to make them as a result of emotional and at times overwhelming moral pressure.  This must constrain their freedom in certain respects.</P>
    <P>Article 6 of the Constitution provides that:</P>
    <P> 1.  All powers of Government, legislative, executive and judicial, derive, under God, from the people, whose right it is to designate the rulers of the State and, in final appeal, to decide all questions of national policy, according to the requirements of the common good.</P>
    <P>2.  These powers of government are exercisable only by and on the authority of the organs of State established by this Constitution.  </P>
    <P>The essence of this debate is whether this House agrees with that Article and whether it is prepared to stand firm on it. Article 6 is not often quoted because its provisions are taken for granted, but it cannot be taken for granted today because we must declare whether the people are sovereign.</P>
    <P>In many respects this debate can be regarded as a sort of watershed in Irish politics.  It will have a considerable influence on the whole political institutional, democratic future, not just of these Twenty-six counties but of the whole island.  We must approach the subject very seriously and bearing that in mind.  It is right to ask ourselves now what would be the reaction and the effect of this Bill being defeated this evening.  I am not interested in the reaction or the effect so far as contraception is concerned because that is no longer relevant.  If the Bill is defeated there are two elements on this island who will rejoice to high heaven.  They are the Unionists in Northern Ireland and the extremist Roman Catholics in the Republic.</P>

      <P>They are a curious alliance, but they are bound together by the <Col N="277" /> vested interest each of them has in the perpetuation of partition.  Neither wishes to know the other.  Their wish is to keep this island divided.  Most of us here realise that the imposition of partition on this island was a grevious wrong, but its deliberate continuation is equally a grevious wrong.  No one who wishes that this island, this race and this nation be united again should try to have that division copper fastened.  It does not matter what any of us might like to say to ourselves about what might be the effects of the availability of condoms or anything else, what really matters and what will matter in ten, 20 or 30 years' time is whether the elected representatives of the Irish people decided they wished to underwrite, at least mentally, the concept of partition.</P>
      <P>Most of us in the House fervently want to see a 32-county republic on this island. I am not as optimistic as I used to be about that &mdash; I think the day is further away than it might otherwise be because of the events of the last ten or 15 years. I am certain of one thing in relation to partition: we will never see a 32-county republic on this island until first of all we have here a 26-county republic in the part we have jurisdiction over today which is really a republic, practising real republican traditions.  Otherwise, we can forget about the possibility of ever succeeding in persuading our fellow Irishmen in the North to join us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Republican&rdquo; is perhaps the most abused word in Ireland today.  In practice what does it mean?  The newspapers do not have to explain it because there is an immediate preconceived notion of what it is.  It consists principally of anglophobia.  Mentally, at least, it is an aggressive attitude towards those who do not agree with our views on what the future of this island should be.  It consists of turning a blind eye to violence, seeing no immorality, often, in the most awful violence, seeing immorality only in one area, the area with which this Bill deals. Often it is displayed by letting off steam in the 15 minutes before closing time with some rousing ballad that makes one vaguely feel good and gets one clapped <Col N="278" /> on the back by people who are stupid enough to think that sort of flag waving is the way to make progress in this island &mdash; to go back into your own trenches rather than try to reach out to people whom we need to reach.</P>
    <P>One of the most distressing aspects of this debate, inside and outside the House, particularly outside, has been the lack of trust in young people.  Young people can hardly be blamed if they look at this House and its Members with a certain cynicism, because they see here a certain hypocrisy.  I have had plenty of experience of young people and plenty of experience of many Members of this House, and if I were to place my trust anywhere today, before God I would place it in the young people.  I would not abuse them or defame them, by implication at least, in the way in which they have been defamed as people who are incapable of making any kind of sound judgment unless it is legislated for them. Even the exercise of their own private consciences must be something that must be legislated for.  I have said before that I cannot accept that concept, though I have seen a reverend bishop saying that we can legislate for private morality.  I beg to take issue with him.</P>
    <P>Technically, of course, he is right.  I can think of at least two countries in the world where private morality is legislated for.  One is Iran and the other is Pakistan. Private morality is enforced by public flogging every day in Teheran and other cities in Iran.  It takes place in Pakistan where they are having an election in three weeks and where every political party has been dissolved except the Government party.  One aspect of enforcement of private morality in these countries is the stoning to death of adultresses.  I do not know what happens to adulterers, but adultresses get stoned to death.</P>
    <P>In a democratic republic people should not think in terms of having laws other than those that allow citizens to make their own free choice in so far as these private matters are concerned.  That is what I believe a republic should do.  It should take account of the reasonable <Col N="279" /> views of all groups, including all minorities, because if we do not take into account the rights of minorities here, can we complain if they are not taken into account in the other part of this island, or anywhere else?  The rights of minorities are not taken into account in Iran; the Bahai are murdered at the rate of dozens a week because they will not subscribe to the diktat of Islam.  I do not say that will happen here but it is the kind of slippery slope we are on.</P>
    <P>The tragedy is that so far as morality, public or private, is concerned the only aspect of it that agitates us is sexual morality or things that have to do with it. Could any other issue get things so worked up here as something like this? Do we not need to remind ourselves that God gave Moses nine other Commandments and the other nine are numbered one through five and seven through ten, as the Americans say.</P>
    <P>This kind of issue has arisen many times in history and in many other countries. One of the places in which it was best tackled and described was in a speech made in the University of Notre Dame in Indiana on 13 September 1984 by the New York Governor, Mario M. Cuomo.  It was entitled &ldquo;Religious Belief and Public Morality: A Catholic Governor's Perspective&rdquo; I will give a few brief quotations from an account of it contained in a magazine called <i>America</i>, dated 29 September 1984, published by Jesuits in the United States and Canada. The magazine comments:</P>
    <P>Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's speech at the University of Notre Dame is an American Catholic classic.  It deserves the widest possible distribution and the deepest possible study. </P>
    <P>That speech dealt in depth with all these issues and made it very clear where the duty of a Catholic legislator lies.  I should like to quote the entire speech but it is 7,000 words long.  I will give two brief quotations:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="280" /> The Catholic public official lives the political truth most Catholics through most of American history have accepted and insisted on: the truth that to assure our freedom we must allow others the same freedom, even if occasionally it produces conduct by them which for us would be sinful.</P>
    <P>The preservation of this freedom, the Governor argues, must be &ldquo;a pervasive and dominant concern&rdquo; in the complex interplay of forces and considerations that go into the making of our laws and policies. </P>
    <P>Let me quote the end of his speech where he expresses an aspect of Roman Catholicism that we do not often hear in this country.  It is, nonetheless, I am sure, as much part of the doctrine of the universal Church as any of the things that are said here.  He finishes by saying:</P>
    <P>Catholics must practice the teachings of Christ...not just by trying to make laws for others to live by, but by living the laws already written for us by God.</P>
    <P>We can be fully Catholic; clearly, proudly, totally at ease with ourselves, a people in the world, transforming it, a light to this nation.  Appealing to the best in our people, not the worst. Persuading not coercing.  Leading people to truth by love and still, all the while, respecting and enjoying our unique pluralistic democracy.  And we can do it even as politicians. </P>
    <P>That is the end of the quotation and the end of his speech.  The comment immediately following it by Father Charles M. Whelan, SJ, Professor in Fordham University and associate editor of this magazine, is:</P>
    <P>Governor Cuomo richly deserved the standing ovation he received at the end of his speech.  It was a magnificent address, a milestone in the history of the American Church. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="281" /> If he were to deliver that address in this country in the last ten days, I know the answer he would get, from most of the public pronouncements which have been made.  I believe that the truth lies in the kind of attitude that that man takes and in the way that he recognises how any Roman Catholic legislator or governor must operate in a pluralist society.  Does the House notice the way he talks proudly about pluralism?  It is a bad word here. You are supposed to be ashamed of wanting to see a pluralist society in this country. You are supposed not to want that, but to want one which is dominated by one form of thinking only.  There are Unionists in the North who want the same.  While both of us are that way, we can assure ourselves that never the twain shall meet.</P>
    <P>We had last year the Forum report and a tremendous amount was put into it by many Members of this House over an 11 month period of sustained work.  It contains a certain spirit of reconciliation, of openness, a recognition of what needs to be done to show the people in Northern Ireland that they need not fear here for what they call their civil and religious liberties.  If this House acts in a particular way this evening, can you ever persuade those people now other than that the Forum report means nothing, that it was a bag of wind, or a lot of words?  Is the spirit of it as well as apparently, at times, the letter of it to be cast aside?</P>
    <P>I am concerned not just about the Unionists in Northern Ireland.  I am concerned also about the position in the context of this debate of the Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland, and I know something about them.  I married one of them 20 years ago on this very day, 20 February 1965, and I know a lot of them.  I cannot accept, going on the statements that were so freely made inside and outside this House, that in any country or jurisdiction where there was availability of contraceptives on the lines suggested in this Bill the people would immediately become degenerate.  They are not degenerate in Northern Ireland and they have had for very many years <Col N="282" /> full access to any form of contraception they wanted at any time and at any age, in any marital condition.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to read in last Saturday's <i>Irish Times</i> an article by Ed Moloney on how in April 1974 Paddy Devlin, who was then the Minister for Health and Social Services in the power-sharing Executive, extended the then situation where there was free availability of contraceptives to anyone who went to a clinic, a doctor, a chemist and so on and paid for them.  He brought them in on the national health services. They were free to everyone irrespective of age.  There was no lower age limit, no marital condition.  It was introduced in April 1974 and a press release was put out. As the article makes clear, there were two responses.  One was a letter from Fr. Denis Faul who wrote to Paddy Devlin saying he did not agree with this and the other was from the Catholic Young Men's Society who also wrote to him saying they did not agree with it.  Not one other word was spoken in Northern Ireland at that time in relation to something which is way beyond anything which is proposed here.  Why is it that if something is all right in County Armagh, half of that is an abomination in County Louth?  Is that logical, or is there some deeper explanation for it?</P>
    <P>I think that there must be some deeper explanation for it, because it is not logical. Why should the suggested standards for individual Roman Catholics be so different a few miles apart?  I cannot follow it.  As an indication of the fact that the statements made about the appalling effect of what is suggested here are wrong &mdash; or, indeed, what is the present position here, because that is actually worse than what is suggested in the Bill &mdash; there is the living proof of the strength of Northern Ireland's Catholics to stand up for themselves and make their own decisions and not to be regarded as people who were so weak that they need public legislation in order to keep them from sin.</P>
    <P>I mentioned Paddy Devlin there and we should ask ourselves in this House now: &ldquo;How do I think the SDLP feel <Col N="283" /> about this debate?  What does it make of their position?&rdquo;.  They are acutely embarrassed about what is happening.  They do not, as a matter of policy, make public statements about events that are politically controversial in the South because they have always tried to keep an even hand in this respect, and I respect them for that.  They are acutely embarrassed at what is happening and they know that all they put into the Forum and their belief in it is made a mockery of by the context of this scenario that we are in today.</P>
    <P>Now, if this Bill is passed it will, like another Bill fought here in this House for months on end, as I forecast at that time, be very rapidly forgotten.  That Bill is probably unknown to most Members of this House.  The debate went on, day after day, for four months in the early part of 1971.  It was the Prohibition of Forcible Entry Bill and there was a seven hour speech against it by Deputy Conor Cruise O'Brien who forecast the most woeful events happening in Ireland if the Bill were passed.  On the last day of the last Stage, on the last line, I said in the Seanad, on 21 August 1971 &ldquo;In 12 months this Bill will never be talked about.&rdquo;  That is true, and equally if this Bill passes it will never be talked about, because it will not come up to the present situation on the ground in this country.</P>
    <P>However, if it does not pass the consequences of it could go on for decades.  I took the opportunity over the last weekend to read some of the chapters in J. H. Whyte's book on <i>Church and State in Modern Ireland.</i> To read, perhaps in full for the first time myself, the whole mother and child controversy of 1951, as it was called, is unbelievable.  It is incredible that Members of this House and of the Government of the day could be as cravan and supine as they were, as we look back on them now.  It shows how much the atmosphere has changed.  Then one has to ask oneself &ldquo;Has the atmosphere changed?&rdquo;.  Because when the chips are down is it going to be any different?</P>
    <P>It was interesting to read the so-called mother and child scheme.  There were ten provisions for women in it relating to <Col N="284" /> ante-natal and post-natal care and care of the children when they were born.  One of the provisions was for free dental treatment for pregnant women.  The most tremendous objection was taken to that at that time.  I recall only a couple of weeks ago, the Minister for Finance reading that out here in the budget speech and there was a howl of laughter all round the House.  How could anyone seriously object to something like that? How could anyone seriously object to anything in it, as one looks back on it now?  Look at the effect it has had on this island.  We have to bear in mind that this is 1985, and whatever excuses one could make for people in 1951, those excuses are not valid today for us.</P>
    <P>This whole matter affects me personally and politically.  I have thought about it and agonised about it.  Quite a number of Deputies have been subjected to a particular type of pressure, but I am possibly unique in that I have been subjected to two enormous pressures, the more general type and a particular political one.  They are both like flood tides &mdash; neither of them is easy to resist and it is probably more than twice as hard to resist the two of them.  But it comes down to certain fundamentals.  One has to take into account everything that has been said but one must also act in accordance with one's conscience, not on contraceptives, which is irrelevant now, but on the bigger and deeper issues that I have talked about today.</P>
    <P>I cannot avoid acting, in my present situation, where I do not have the protection of the Whip, other than in the way I feel, giving some practical recognition at least to the kind of pressures and the entreaties of my friends for my own good, which I greatly appreciate.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by quoting from a letter in <i>The Irish Times</i> of 16 February, signed by Fr. Dominic Johnson OSB, a monk of Glenstal Abbey where he says</P>
    <P>With respect to Mr. O'Malley, he might reflect with profit on the life of St. Thomas More, who put his conscience before politics and lost his life for doing so. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="285" /> The politics of this would be very easy. The politics would be, to be one of the lads, the safest way in Ireland.  But I do not believe that the interests of this State, or our Constitution and of this Republic, would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this.  There is a choice of a kind that can only be answered by saying that I stand by the Republic and accordingly I will not oppose this Bill.</P>

      <P>In the last week the only breath of fresh air on the religious side came from Dean Victor Griffin when he said that he did not think that the passing of this Bill would make one iota of a difference to our morals and that the Bill should have been passed through this House by agreement.  The only breath of fresh air on the political side has come from Deputy O'Malley in the speech he just made, and I congratulate him on his courage and perspicacity.</P>
      <P>Last week in very turbulent conditions we listened to hour after hour of invective poured out by some Members of the House and directed in many cases to Members of my party.  I was concerned that Members speaking for the Bill would not have an opportunity to express their views because of the volume of speeches from those who felt that they had right, God, Church and voters on their side. Those contributors showed little charity in their contributions not to mention their understanding of the measures proposed in this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Members of the House are being afflicted with political opportunism and with conscience.  It is interesting to note the party methods of dealing with opportunism and conscience.  It would seem that conscience on this side of the House is purer than the conscience on the far side, because on the far side conscience seems to have been solved by the Whip. It is obvious that on that side political <Col N="286" /> opportunism is coming into play in a big way.  I had no intention of referring to that except for the fact that I had to listen yesterday and last week to speeches castigating the Government for introducing this Bill, for the matter in which they introduced it and for its contents.  It has to be said, and taken up in the House, that a lot of hypocrisy was demonstrated here in the last few days.  A lot of insincerity and opportunism was displayed.  I regret that the Opposition are behaving in this way.  They should have taken the good advice offered by the Dean who said that the Bill could have been discussed between the two parties or the two leaders and nodded through.</P>
    <P>Two weeks ago, after completing ten hours research, I sat in the Chamber all day waiting for an opportunity to contribute on the largest Estimate going through the House &mdash; it amounted to £731 million &mdash; but I did not get an opportunity to speak because it was put through so fast. Some people say that there is not any demand for the legislation and that they should get on with other things, but we could have been getting on with other things if we had a responsible approach to this.  It is particularly cynical coming from the Opposition, given that their leader, whom I would describe as a man of the world, demonstrated his awareness and attitude to youth, life and the eighties in an interview in the <i>Hot Press</i>&mdash; an interview I enjoyed.  I thought Deputy Haughey was being very natural and normal in that interview; but, given he said that to his dying day he would regret having missed out on the free society, one must say that one presumes he would have been an active member of that society.  Being a responsible person and an active members of that society I presume he would have taken precautions and would probably have used the contraceptives mentioned in the Bill.  That man is now leading his party to oppose the Bill and that can be for no other reason but for political opportunism.  That is the same party that only a few weeks ago introduced a motion in the House on the supergrass system in the North in the interests of the people in the North of <Col N="287" /> Ireland.  They also introduced a motion dealing with the Prevention of Terrorism Act in Britain.  Last year they took a particular stand in regard to the referendum and now they are opposing the amendment of the 1979 Act.</P>
    <P>When the House debated the motion on supergrass trials I wondered how the people of Northern Ireland could think seriously about the intentions of the House or the people down here towards them when this form of cynicism operates from time to time.  It would seem that the people of Ireland &mdash; I do not think it is true &mdash; from the concerted campaigns being carried on in recent weeks applaud this type of politics.  It appears that they would support politicians who oppose the legislation before us and oppose the other measures I mentioned earlier.  If that is how those people feel, they should vote the Opposition back into Government. If that is the way Irish people feel, that is what they deserve and should get; and the rest of us should think carefully about the future of the country.  I listened to, but did not believe, Deputy Glenn talking about a concerted campaign of intimidation.  She mentioned two or three phone calls, but that should be compared with the campaign in the recent referendum and what took place in recent weeks.  One should ask: who got the phone calls, who got the letters and where was the pressure applied?  If Deputy Glenn asked those questions she would realise who was intimidated.  Nobody will believe that her side, or those who put forward the point of view she agrees with, were.</P>
    <P>Some Members have proudly stated in the Chamber and at meetings of Oireachtas committees that they have gone outside for advice and instruction from a source.  They have said that some times the source was a single one and on other occasions it was a representative source. Those Members have told us that on the basis of that advice they voted in a certain way in Parliament.  That was done in connection with the recent referendum and is being followed in regard to the Bill. <Col N="288" /> For the benefit of the electorate I should like to put on record the serious position in that they are electing Members who do not represent them in their constituencies. If in an average constituency of 100,000 people elected Members take instructions from one source, they are not democrats and do not represent their constituents in a proper manner.  At election time people should consider carefully whom they are putting forward and ask themselves if those people will represent them properly.  If people cannot stand on their own two feet and think for themselves, they are in Parliament under false pretences.  In the last two weeks I have listened to a lot of hysteria.  I respect the opposing views and when people contact me I ask for their views but I do not think I got more than two.  To the best of my recollection those views were expressed by a particular leaning and the argument did not stand up when one considered the measure dispassionately and without prejudice.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of self-righteousness against the measure and Members. It is easy to point towards Heaven and talk about moral principles, about standing by those moral principles, and that there was a higher authority watching as to how we react.  I am beginning to think cynically that the eye is more on the voter than on the clouds as far as some of those people are concerned.  Some Members think they have a monopoly of grace and wisdom.  They leave me with the impression that, if they were called to meet their Maker tomorrow morning, they would expect to be met by at least a choir of angels.  It is because of the happenings in the last two weeks and what occurred in the debate on the referendum that I think that that may not be the case and that there is some hope for those who hold different views.  I am beginning to think that sinners like myself have a chance.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of concentration in recent weeks on Christian conscience or this trait called Christianity that we hear about so often.  I thought it was a grave mistake that the Archbishop of Dublin should have spoken so early on <Col N="289" /> this issue and in the manner he did.  The bishops could have been more effective had they not been domineering and hysterical.  That prompts me to ask if Christianity as practised in this society works, particularly having examined what went on in recent weeks.  I am not sure that it works in this society.  I do not think those who preach it succeed when trying to practise it.  It does not seem to work.  Perhaps the fabric out of which it is woven is unable to absorb the life and times of the late 20th century.  Perhaps other religions would work.  For example, Hinduism might work but I am not too sure about Christianity.  I might mention to those members who think they have right on their side, in reference to Christianity, that Christ came to heal sinners, not the righteous.  We might remember also the biblical tax collector who climbed the sycamore tree to take a look at him, who supped with him that evening and was criticised for doing so, as an example of the kind of person whom he was out to help.  We can remember also the woman taken in adultery when he invited someone from the crowd to cast the first stone, but nobody in the Holy Land cast a stone. That is not the case in Ireland.  Stones were cast in here last week, they were cast last year and they are cast constantly. I would say to those people: they ought to be very careful that the pearly gates are not slammed shut in their faces when they pour out this kind of righteousness at other Members and try to influence a parliament in the way they are going about it.</P>
    <P>I might cite as an example of an important element of this Bill and people whom it will affect more severely than it will most others when I would have to mention women and unmarried mothers and the wrong end of the stick they receive in this country.  I attended a clinic last week at which there were 14 people, six of whom were unmarried mothers.  Two of them had more than one child, none of them had a place to live, two of them were squatting, all of them were undernourished, including the babies.  We must ask ourselves: does anybody care about <Col N="290" /> those people who, in many cases, are the victims of the denial of this form of contraception because there is an argument to be made in that respect?  There is an area not far from that clinic of approximately half a square mile where there are 300 unmarried mothers, most of whom have no place to live.  Our society does not look after or care for them very well.  I attended meetings last year attended by a pressure group in the referendum campaign, who were most annoyed at the fact that unmarried mothers were being accommodated in houses.  I was incensed to hear a Member say in this House yesterday that these condoms will be used by 18 year old men and upwards to seduce 13, 14, 15 and 16 year old girls.  Perhaps that Member does not realise that, if that did happen, it would constitute a criminal offence and that £67 million are not to be provided so that young men can satisfy their desires on the young women of Ireland.  We are not providing condoms for criminals.</P>
    <P>I hope I am not misquoting Deputy John Kelly when I say that he said that because the abortion referendum had become a part of our Constitution there was then an argument to be advanced &mdash; in order to avoid abortions and unwanted pregnancies &mdash; for the provision of this type of contraception.  There is another argument which poses the question: which is the greater sin, to be having sexual intercourse or having unwanted pregnancies, unwanted children, children who will not be cared for in this society, children who are not cared for under the law and who will suffer much hardship?</P>
    <P>Last April when it was announced that Archbishop Dermot Ryan was to go to Rome, was resigning his archbishopric in Dublin, he gave an interview on an Addendum programme on RTE radio, a programme I often listen to.  In the course of that interview he was asked questions in this area of conscience and contraception. I hope I am quoting him correctly when I say that he replied that people tended to come to him and to priests looking for answers to everything, that <Col N="291" /> they always wanted to know what to do in this or that situation.  He said that people should think for themselves, consulting their own consciences, making up their own minds.  Less than a year later we have another archbishop coming out with the opposite point of view and yet another bishop in the country telling us that we must obey the dictates of his church.  In an interview given by Dean Victor Griffin on Sunday last he said he did not think that the passage of this Bill would make one iota of difference to the morals of this country, that he thought that in the best interests of the country the Bill should have been agreed and nodded through the House.</P>
    <P>In response to the cry of the Knights of last week, that contraceptives would now be distributed freely to the youth of Ireland and &ldquo;God save Ireland&rdquo; I might say that, as a returned emigrant, if this is the atmosphere to which I returned to rear my family and the retort to God to save Ireland I would reply, let us pull the plug.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a most unfortunate debate in many respects.  Despite what has been said by some eloquent speakers it is well to remember that what we are being asked to do <i>vis-à-vis</i> this Bill is simply to vote on making available contraceptives for teenagers.  While individuals can make grandiose statements on political issues, such as the labyrinthine variations on republicanism at certain times, that is not the issue here today.</P>
      <P>I find somewhat disturbing the extraordinary level of intolerance evident in the contributions of some of the Members.  I would hope that I would not add to the difficulties some people have at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our opposition is both reasoned and reasonable.  We reiterate our opposition to the question of demand because opinion polls have been used by the Minister in promoting his point of view in his introductory remarks.  It must be reiterated that those opinion polls show a clear majority against this type of Bill and that the only poll in favour was the one quoted <Col N="292" /> by the Minister himself which was not available for scrutiny.</P>
    <P>There were no prior consultations with interested bodies.  If we are all so concerned about the democratic process surely there is an onus on those introducing legislation to have such consultation with interested people and bodies.  There has been much talk about political strong arm tactics against Government Deputies. I would suggest to the House that the Minister invited that type of thing in his introductory remarks.  There is no doubt but that there have been considerable pressures &mdash; in fact the word blackmail was used &mdash; on certain crucial Fine Gael and Labour Deputies.  These pressures have been relentless and unprecedented. However, it is well to remember that the Minister set the standard in this regard in his opening speech when he came into the House armed with a suitcase &mdash; that does not happen too often in Leinster House &mdash; in an intimidatory fashion to those who might dare to oppose, indicating that the famous bag might be opened and gems introduced into the debate as a means of forcing the issue one way or the other.  It is not the first time that tactic was used but it certainly does not intimidate some of us from making our point of view.</P>
    <P>The medical and health effects have been ignored by the Minister.  The effects on youth have also been ignored although the evidence points to a much more permissive society being created if contraceptives are made freely available.  This is not a Church-State confrontation.  The bishops are entitled to their point of view and they simply stated their objectives on moral grounds.  It was not just their entitlement, but their moral and Christian duty to do so and any divisiveness in this area is of the Government's own making in introducing legislation without consultation for purely ideological reasons.  To say it was to satisfy the joint programme is a very lame excuse because that programme has been discarded long since and we are all witnesses to its dismemberment in the House.  The crisis which exists in the Minister's area of <Col N="293" /> responsibility in the health service is ample evidence of the Government's abandonment of their stated policies.</P>
    <P>There is increased cynicism which is being deliberately fostered by the Government's preoccupation in pursuance of their ideological minority issues for political purposes.  Our economic life is being throttled to death while one of the Coalition partners is hellbent on satisfying its narrow ideological base, irrespective of the divisions it creates in the community.  The aim of the Government should be to harness the potential of the community, to restore confidence and not to set community leaders, religious and political, at each other's throats.</P>
    <P>Can the Bill achieve what it sets out to do?  It is very doubtful.  The long term public perception of Government attitudes to sexual relationships and moral issues is very important.  By passing the Bill, there is a clear implication that officialdom recognises and gives respectability to the widespread use of contraceptives by all and sundry.  The standard of behaviour in sexual matters is a matter for legitimate concern by a responsible Government and it must be conceded that if this Bill is introduced, it will help in the short term to adjust the attitudes of young people to the acceptance of the use of contraceptives as not just fashionable but advisable, permissible and proper.  The inevitable result will be permissiveness with all its attendant difficulties for individuals, families and the State.</P>
    <P>All the churches are opposed to moral decline.  The emphasis in achieving the aim differs but any stance is no less worthy of support.  Church leaders are not just entitled to make their position clear, they have a duty to preach according to their religious principles.  It is well to remember that there are two points of view being expressed by two different church leaderships and resentment has been expressed to the Roman Catholic point of view as it has been expressed. There are many who might feel equal resentment to the views of the Church of Ireland leadership but they have shown <Col N="294" /> their Christianity by remaining silent. Those who are so vehement in finding fault with the views genuinely expressed should reflect on the democratic right of all, lay or clerical.  Despite what some would-be progressives would have you think, there are many who are still not ashamed to call themselves Christians, and Roman Catholics for that matter.</P>
    <P>One basic question must be addressed in this debate.  Is it always proper and wise to regularise and legalise practices when they are in common use by certain groups of individuals?  We do it here regularly but it must be obvious that there are occasions when considerations other than political expediency have to be considered. Social issues, particularly those with a high moral content, fall into the category where politics and politicians must move slowly and carefully after extensive consultations with interested groups and never in advance of widespread public demand.  Even with all those ingredients being in order, the further dimension of the effect and possible effect on public morality and the common good has to be considered.  Has anybody stated conclusively that the changes now proposed will have a beneficial effect on society generally?</P>
    <P>The weight of experience and international statistics prove conclusively that harmful effects would follow such changes.  Why then is the Bill being introduced? Did the Fine Gael TDs ask for it or were they consulted?  Did Labour TDs ask for this legislation or were they consulted? Let us face it &mdash; a few wanted it for some so-called socialist, ideological reason.  It is being forced down the neck of the population, the majority of whom see the move as uninvited pressure to introduce legislation for party political reasons and to do the fashionable thing irrespective of the consequences.  The new political concept seems to be to keep in step.  Just because a practice becomes fashionable in certain quarters does not mean that it should be given the respectability of law.  If one applied that criterion to other areas of social behaviour, a chaotic situation would arise.  We have <Col N="295" /> evidence of that in the Acts relating to the sale of alcohol and in regard to traffic in drugs.  If something is intrinsically wrong, all the laws passed all over the world will not lessen the wrong or the responsibility of concerned legislators to make their objections public.</P>
    <P>The Minister is trying to have his way in this legislation but his ego trip is misdirected. The extent of public disquiet in the manner in which he is already discharging his ministerial duties is alarming. He does not have the confidence of the electorate in that area or in this matter. The health services are being dismantled under his direction and the old and needy are improverished by his actions.  They do not have a vociferous lobby and cannot organise a public demonstration of anger but there is a cry for mercy from every constituency to stop this relentless pursuit by the Minister and the Government in destroying living standards.  Now, to top off this insensitivity to the demands and rights of the people, the Minister seeks to alienate the goodwill of the majority of the electorate.  He is causing division between parliamentarians and dissension between Church and State.  It is not in the best long term interests of the country to seek the widening of divisions at this time and, if ever the country needed all its citizens of every denomination and persuasion pulling together, it must surely be now.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt but that the Minister was uneasy when he delivered his Second Stage speech, which was unusual for him. The way he referred to his bag on so many occasions was intimidatory as if certain moral blackmail could be exerted by referring to the bag.  It was as if that bag was to be the source of the dirty tricks that would be necessary to implement this legislation.  The Taoiseach's demeanour while the Minister was delivering his speech showed a disenchantment with the content of it.  It was divisive and seemed to invite a certain type of debate. I wonder does the Taoiseach recognise that the price of Government is too high if he has to subject himself and his party <Col N="296" /> to the demands of the Labour Party in this area?  Is he aware of what Deputies on all sides are saying &mdash; they dislike this action and the way this legislation was introduced?  Feelings have been trampled on and traditional values have been subordinated to the dictate of one party in Government.</P>
    <P>Many people have referred to speeches made by others in the past.  Many have already been quoted.  In 1974 Deputy Cooney stated that he had no doubt that the vast majority in the country were in favour of the law restricting the sale of contraceptives to married people.  He also stated that he did not accept there was any such right because that implied a right to fornicate and &ldquo;in my opinion there is no such natural right&rdquo;.  Those were the words of the present Minister for Defence: strong sentiments expressed and sincerely held.  The fashionable length of a lady's skirt or width of a gent's trousers might change but the right for young unmarried teenagers to fornicate is still unnatural and wrong.</P>
    <P>We have been asked to legislate for a family planning solution which would be more in line with modern permissive cultures. Medical and sociological publications all warn of the results of liberal sexual permissive societies.  They stated unequivocally the rising rate of venereal disease and cancer of the cervix among teenage girls.  This was referred to in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 15 November 1984 in an article written by Dr. John Kelly.  In his speech the Minister said: &ldquo;I must be guided by grave health considerations including the avoidance of unwanted pregnancies&rdquo;.  The Minister seems to be of the opinion that this legislation will solve the problem of unwanted pregnancies. Despite sex education programmes and readily available contraceptives, the number of teenage pregnancies and abortions has soared in other countries.  Condoms have been proved to be notoriously ineffective when used by teenagers.  The Minister, by his action, is forcing young people into an environment which will make it impossible for them to uphold the values we know to be truly human. <Col N="297" /> Once you accept the contraceptive ethic you must accept that it attacks the family structure.  A contraceptive society requires abortion as a fail safe.  A pro-life policy, which had recent expression in election terms, cannot be neutral on contraceptives. Abortion and contraception are distinct but they are related.  From experience, supported by statistical evidence, the reality is that a contraceptive society is an anti-life society.</P>
    <P>We must question the bona fides of some organisations which are operating here and the parent bodies to which they are affiliated, in particular, the Irish Family Planning Association and its membership of the International Planned Parenthood Federation which was founded in 1952.  It is one of the world's foremost promoters of contraceptives and abortion.  The stated aim of that organisation is full freedom of sexual expression without regard to age or marital status.  One of the recent publications of that organisation advocates that teenagers aged 10 years and upwards should have full access to contraceptives, abortion and sexual education without parental control.  There is disquiet that the Minister is a full member of that organisation and that his Department support their aims which are totally at variance with the stated constitutional law voted on by the people.  Is the Minister saying that he subscribes to the guidelines of that international organisation?  That federation says that family planning associations should not see unfavourable law as an excuse for inaction.  Action outside the law is part of the process of stimulating change according to their guidelines.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;the law is an ass in this matter.  If the use of condoms was to prevent venereal disease &mdash; it is suggested that condoms will be a panacea for all our ills &mdash; and cancer of the cervix, why are the levels of venereal disease and cervical cancer rocketing in the UK?  If the claims made for condoms could be substantiated many more people would be availing of them but the opposite is the case.  Only two million people out of 22 million men and women aged between 14 and 49 years use them regularly in the UK.  That statistic was given in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>, October 1984.  Falling sales of condoms clearly reflect the disenchantment of the UK population with them.  Instead of achieving the aims which the Minister attributes to their use, the opposite is the case.  Perhaps this is one reason why a major British firm manufacturing condoms in their October report mentioned Ireland as a target customer for their wares.  The potential of the inexperienced Irish market must indeed be attractive to some manufacturers who witness declining sales in their home countries but the customer should know the real statistics before rushing headlong to accept the Minister's act of faith in condoms and their effectiveness.</P>
      <P>The July 1984 monitor of the Office of Population Census and Surveys shows that illegitimate conceptions were 214,300 out of a total of 752,200 conceptions which is 28 per cent.  The overall illegitimate birth rate rose from 17.5 per cent per 1,000 in 1975 to 21.2 per cent per 1,000 in 1980.  The statistics for that jurisdiction also show that in girls aged between 15 and 19 years the illegitimate birth rate rose from 14.5 per cent per 1,000 to 17.3 per cent per 1,000 in the same period.  These figures apply to the UK jurisdiction where contraception and sex education are freely available at all ages.</P>

      <P>The document to which the Deputy is referring was submitted to my office in mid-July 1983.  It was subsequently circulated to all relevant Government Departments for their observations.  The consensus was that current constraints on the level of public expenditure precluded the introduction on a statutory basis of a percentage scheme for arts in architecture.</P>
      <P>I am happy to note that in recent years a considerable amount of decorative art has been included in private developments and in undertakings by State companies. It has also been the practice for some years for the Office of Public Works to set aside for the exhibition of work by Irish artists a portion of the cost of major new buildings.  This has been set at 1 per cent of the cost of such buildings subject to an upper limit of £12,000 for art work. I can assure the Deputy that I will have the feasibility of the proposal examined again as soon as I think that it is appropriate to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the Association of Artists in Ireland argue that this is the standard reply that is given in good times <Col N="300" /> and in bad times and that what they are looking for is not a fixed amount but a percentage amount, 1 per cent being the amount concerned?  Since it applies to the Office of Public Works, could it not equally apply to private enterprise?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Regrettably I never have the opportunity of answering such a question in good times.  There is no difficulty in principle and that would be agreed by all, but a difficulty arises in connection with the amount of money available. There are urgent requests for funds and it is not possible in the present constrained situation to meet all requests.  I am sure the same argument would be voiced by the private sector.  We are very keen to see this introduced and I have considered what the legislation might be like for the introduction of this scheme.  However, it is all a question of timing.  It is very important that we get the timing right so that when it is introduced it will be accepted all around, as it is agreed in principle.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister of State acknowledge that so far as one, and probably the most important sector of building is concerned, namely, public buildings, there is no need for legislation and that the purposes in respect of which Deputy Mitchell has addressed his question could be achieved quite simply by administrative action as was done satisfactorily and successfully recently in the case of Beaumont hospital?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as the public buildings are concerned they are under the aegis of the Office of Public Works who are the people responsible in this area. They are operating a scheme of 1 per cent of the total cost with an upper limit of £12,000.  There is a general desire that there should be provision to make the scheme mandatory if conditions were suitable&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State aware that the Association of Artists in Ireland are pursuing this matter as a means of stimulating and expanding visual awareness and also as an opportunity for Irish artists to display their skills? Will he commend the 1 per cent scheme on the basis that it gives the artists an opportunity to display their art and for citizens to enjoy it?  Will the Minister of State say when the report he has compiled will be made public and circulated to Members of the House?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any question of making it public or circulating it to Members of the House.  If we think the time is right for legislation and if funds are available we will introduce it. There is legislation of this nature in a number of continental countries and it is <Col N="302" /> functioning well.  With regard to a spinoff for the Association of Artists in Ireland, that is true and there will also be a spin-off in the purchase of works.  There is no disagreement in principle on the matter but it is just that we have not the funds at the moment.</P>

      <P>I suggest that the Minister of State is putting the cart before the horse.  He seemed to say that as soon as the money was available the legislation would be introduced.  There is no reason why legislation should not be introduced now and, if necessary, suspended until such time as funds are available.  That would be the right way to proceed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach in view of the fact that the arts in Ireland are severely under-funded, if he has proposals to further assist bodies promoting art and the arts generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the arts in Ireland are under-funded.  As the House is aware, the Arts Council is the main channel for Government financial assistance to the arts.  While the 1985 allocation of £5.5 million to the Arts Council may seem inadequate compared with the needs of the arts, it should be pointed out that to have provided for any increase for the council at a time of severe pruning in the Estimates of public expenditure was not an insignificant achievement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past year there have been other <Col N="303" /> substantial developments for the arts generally including: the reduction of VAT on theatre and live performances estimated to be worth £1 million for the first year of the reduction&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a joke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not a joke.  A sum of £1 million is involved.  The developments include the allocation of another £0.9 million for culture and the arts in the Funds of Suitors Act; the inclusion of tax relief for gifts to approved bodies in the arts in section 32 of the Finance Act, 1984 and the recent budgetary provision of £120,000 in connection with European Music Year.</P>
      <P>As for the coming year, Deputies will be aware that the rate of value added tax on artists' materials and musical instruments, on picture framing and on sales of works of art in galleries, will be reduced with effect from 1 March from 35 per cent to 23 per cent.  Further assistance to bodies promoting art and the arts generally will be available in the coming months and years ahead.  In the first instance, the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham, will be available as a major cultural centre for artistic and cultural events.  It is envisaged that part of the proceeds of the proposed national lottery will be used for the benefit of arts and culture.  This development could have a very significant result, depending on the success of a lottery. On a wider front I am happy to say that I succeeded in getting my fellow EC Ministers of Culture to pass a resolution during our recent Presidency of the EC, urging the use of the European Social Fund for artistic and cultural workers.</P>
      <P>I think that the Deputy will agree that the various measures which I have outlined will go a considerable way to augmenting the level of public funding for the arts in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the underfunding, how would the Minister of State envisage the promotion of the greater appreciation of the arts in, say, Crumlin where I have the pleasure of opening <Col N="304" /> their art exhibition annually?  Also, what sort of percentage of the national lottery does he envisage will be available for art and has he any idea of what that will mean in money terms?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I can go into details about what is envisaged to promote the arts in every part of the country, notwithstanding the importance of Crumlin.  One area in which we hope to make an advance is the location of art centres in the suburban areas of Dublin and throughout the country.  We have not decided on the percentage of the lottery that might be going for the arts but I will push myself and I have no doubt that I will have the support of the House to get a very considerable slice of it.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State like to indicate to the House what kind of funds he and his fellow Ministers for culture envisage as being available from the European Social Fund?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The European Social Fund would operate through various schemes in order to help out artists, so there is a very large fund there.  It is a question of seeking to encourage larger sections of that fund that now exists being channelled through for the purpose.  We found a great deal of goodwill on this and the various Ministers involved, the Minister for Labour in our case, were very sympathetic towards this line.  We had this resolution adopted and we hope it will have a beneficial effect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>No, there are no funds specifically for the arts.  There is a specific area, very badly funded, within the President's Department dealing with culture <Col N="305" /> and the arts, but the British and the Danes object to expanding the EC to cover the arts and culture areas and that is very difficult to overcome.  Therefore, they are reluctant to allow any increased funding.  That is why we during our Presidency directed our attempts to getting more funds from the existing Social Fund to which there could be no objection.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two questions.  One is in regard to the recent budget changes in VAT on theatres.  Does the Minister of State accept the arguments of those involved in running theatres that they will lose by the recent changes in the budget whereby they will be denied the refund of VAT which they pay on purchases in connection with the promotion of their theatrical work, due to zero rating for the theatrical companies?</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State mentioned in his reply that £1 million benefit to the theatre arises from the change in VAT.  My second question is, does the Minister of State consider the work of Comhaltas Ceoltóiri Éireann to be severely underfunded, and what action do his Government intend to take to ensure that CCE maintain their very important work in promoting the Irish language and Irish culture?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="306" />
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>The latter is a separate question, and if the Deputy puts it down I will be delighted to answer it in detail in so far as I have responsibility in that area.  Our funding is done through the Arts Council, who are a statutory independent body, and I have no power over where the funds go.  Regarding the Deputy's earlier question, I have details from the Abbey Theatre which show that they would lose out by the exemption from VAT as distinct from zero rating from VAT.  I have similar figures from the Gate Theatre.  It depends largely on the extent to which capital undertakings, cost of scenery and so on are being undertaken by the theatre.  I am concerned about this and I am in contact with the theatres about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised at the Minister's answer regarding CCE especially in view of the term of the question and of the answers he has been giving to the House on VAT.  Surely it is misleading of the Minister of State to say to the House that theatres would benefit to the extent of £1 million arising from the recent VAT changes when he admits that he has already received representations from the Abbey Theatre.  I have received very strong representations from the Druid Theatre in Galway who state categorically that they will lose substantially by reason of the budget changes in VAT. It is clear evidence again of major changes being implemented by the Government without taking into consideration the effects of the implementation of these changes.  These are very detrimental to the theatre, as happened in the case of VAT changes in the construction and other areas&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Apart from being offensive to the House, would the Minister of State like to indicate if his Department have any plans whatsoever with regard to the Cork-Wales connection?  Would he tell the House whether he has had representations from Cork indicating that the offer of £500,000 subsidy for that service was too little and too late to try in 1985 to have this service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I have had representations to have the £500,000 which the Government offered as a subsidy for this year to be provided for 1986.  When the Government decided to provide a grant of £500,000 towards a Cork-Swansea service during 1985 it was in recognition of the year that is in it, the 800th anniversary of the granting of the charter to Cork city.  It was made clear that there would be no repeat, and there will be no repeat. We cannot retain a situation where ferry services are being subsidised by the State especially in existing financial circumstances. Even if they were better it would be unwarranted expenditure of public funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Minister is concerned about the proper celebration of the 800th anniversary of <Col N="309" /> Cork city, would he not put it to the Government that they should increase the subsidy for 1985 and, even though it is very late now, let the people in Cork know that he wants to have a service in 1985?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was approached about this in November of last year and I got a favourable decision from the Government as quickly as possible, in a matter of weeks.  People were informed of that as soon as possible.  It is all right for political opponents to say that it is too little and too late and in opposition to promise that they will restore the service. That is exactly the sort of comment that has this country in the mess it is in.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State serious in his statement here today that he has no proposals to encourage the restoration of a ferry service between the south-west of this country and Great Britain?  Is he serious when he gives a curt reply in view of the need as outlined to him by many delegations from the city for this service?  Even at this stage would the Government give favourable consideration to the south-west and encourage the provision of a service between Ringaskiddy and Great Britain?  Either of two semi-State companies could operate the service, the B &amp; I or the ICL.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will know that when I was approached for a subsidy for this service for this year, one of the factors put to me was that the subsidy would be a once off allocation, that there was no expectation that the service would be subsidised in the future.  I was told that the proposition was commercially viable but that it needed time to get off the ground.  The application was for a grant.  The Government acceded to that request.  We said that in the circumstances we would make the grant available, but unfortunately the organisers were unable to produce the rest of the package, that was, to provide a ship and <Col N="310" /> funding for the company.  Therefore, the Government could not be blamed.  We played our part and I am sorry that it has not worked.  The Deputy asked whether I would encourage the setting up of a service or if I was saying that I would not act on those lines.  I assure him that I would be prepared to give every help, apart from giving cash, to the setting up of a service on the route.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has acknowledged the importance of this 800th anniversary year for Cork city and the enormous potential there is in exploiting the opportunities offered by this historic occasion.  He has indicated that in this year the Government are prepared to make available £500,000 for a ferry service from Cork.  My view is that there will be a ferry service between Cork and Great Britain in 1986, regardless of whether the Government wish that to be the case, but perhaps we could concentrate for now on the year 1985.  As the Government have decided to make the £500,000 available and since there is one organisation who even at this late stage could provide a ferry service an organisation who have the sales ability and all the necessary backup and management apparatus required, would the Minister not request the Minister responsible to direct that body, the B &amp; I, to provide a ferry service from Cork this summer? The opinion of a number of people who know the score is that if the B &amp; I provide a service, the sum of £500,000 or a sum very near to that would suffice for the provision of the service this summer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition may not be aware that in 1983 the Government provided £500,000 for the provision of a service by the B &amp; I but that the loss on the service for that summer was in excess of £700,000.  The Deputy may not be aware of what I said about the precariousness of the B &amp; I finances.  The board of that company have a full time job in maintaining present business and in retaining their people in <Col N="311" /> employment.  I have no intention of forcing the board to do anything that would conflict with their commercial judgment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has said that the loss on the service in 1983 was £700,000, but would he not agree that it is practically impossible to identify the losses on the Cork-Swansea route as distinct from losses on the Rosslare run? Would he not agree that the board of B &amp; I will say it is extremely difficult to identify the exact losses on services out of Cork and the exact loss on the other service?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have an estimate of the number of unlicensed sets but I am of the opinion that there is a great deal of evasion.  There is enough evidence to support that opinion.  There are two types of evasion &mdash; first, the evasion whereby people do not pay any licence fee and, secondly, where people pay only fees for black and white television when they ought to be paying the <Col N="313" /> fee for colour.  I am considering this position with a view to deciding whether it is worth phasing out the black and white television licence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the allocation of funds to An Post for the collection of the licence fee is inadequate?  What happens is that there is the occasional campaign lasting for two to three weeks.  The public are aware of how those campaigns operate.  They are not effective and should be modernised to ensure that everyone owning a set pays a licence.  It is totally unfair in so far as the 720,934 licensees are concerned that perhaps a figure in the region of 200,000 sets remain unlicensed.  I am giving that estimate and the Minister cannot contradict it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey  Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>and <b>Mr. Haughey</b> asked the Minister for Communications if he will, following a decision of An Bord Pleanála to reject the planning application for LPG Storage in Dublin Bay, reject the harbour works application lodged in 1979 and initiate a programme of planning policy for the future of Dublin Bay and its surroundings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dublin Port and Docks Board applied in 1979 for a harbour works order to reclaim an area of about 94 acres of foreshore opposite the Clontarf seafront for port development. Of this, an area of about seven acres was the requirement in respect of the LPG storage project.  In view of the fact that the Port and Docks Board's application for a harbour works order was made as far back as 1979, I am asking the board to review its requirements in the light of developments in the meantime, including <Col N="315" /> the recent decision of An Bord Pleanála in relation to the LPG project.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the question of planning policy for the future of Dublin Bay and its surroundings is a matter for the planning authority and for the Minister for the Environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister recall a similar question being asked over 12 months ago?  At that time he was unable to make any specific undertaking regarding the harbour works order, on the grounds that the planning application was pending.  As that planning application has been rejected and is now out of the way, and the Minister's own party gave a commitment in 1982 that that harbour works order would not be allowed, is the Minister now in a position to say that he will follow that line at this stage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>If I remember correctly, the previous question related directly to the LPG cavern project.  I know that all the Deputies from the constituency were concerned about it.  That question is now out of the way because of the decision of An Bord Pleanála not to permit it.  As I have said, I have now asked the board to review their application in the light of that decision and of the passage of time since 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not prepared to reject that application which has been on hands since 1979?  The onus would then fall back on the Dublin Port and Docks Board to decide if they wish to make a new application.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It amounts to the same thing.  I have not made a decision on the 1979 application.  I have asked the board to reconsider it.  When it comes before me, I shall consider it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering this matter, whether it is to do with the abortive gas cavern appeal or not, would the Minister bear in mind that the amount of sea space which is available to the people on the north side of Dublin, particularly <Col N="316" /> in the Fairview-Clontarf area, is by nature limited and that sea space is of enormous importance to the environment and, indeed, to the health of the people in that area?  Would he be prepared now to give an undertaking that no further harbour works areas will be made which will in any way encroach on that very valuable and important amenity for the people of the north side of this city?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that I could make such a blanket commitment. I acknowledge the concern of the people in the area about the nature of any future works.  Indeed, I recognise the concern of all the Deputies for that constituency. I had indicated previously that, before any decision is made in relation to any future harbour works, I shall consult immediately with local community associations and so forth and with local Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I remind the Minister &mdash; he may not be aware of it &mdash; that there was an occasion in the past, many years ago, when a harbour works order was made without any of us being aware that an application for it had been made?  We in this House may not always be in a position to be as vigilant as we should be in regard to this matter.  Would the Minister once and for all put the matter at an end and remove any risk that this valuable environmental amenity be interfered with?  Would he lay it down as a matter of policy that no applications for future works orders for that particularly valuable piece of sea will be entertained in his Department?</P>
      <P>I want to stress on the Minister the importance of that directive principle by him.  With the best will in the world and no matter how vigilant any of us may be &mdash; Deputies or councillors &mdash; there is always the possibility that, through inadvertence or oversight on our part, very serious long term damage could be done to that part of our system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall bear in mind and consider what the Deputy has said. I acknowledge the very deep concern <Col N="317" /> about the environment and the general surroundings.  I would like to consider the proposal which he has made.  However, I do not wish to make such a blanket commitment as the Deputy appears to suggest.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Referring to the second part of the Minister's reply, that planning is a responsibility of the Department of the Environment, may I ask him if he envisages the possibility of divided responsibility between his own Department and that of Environment on such issues as the movement of substances, whereas Environment would be taking responsiblity for storage and general planning?  Does he envisage that that division could lead to a less than orderly planning?  Would he consider instituting some procedure whereby the two Departments would get their heads together to ensure proper planning of the bay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see that there is any problem.  As the Deputy will be aware, my role is confined to granting foreshore licences or harbour works orders.  Before that, I must consult with the planning people and with the Department of Fisheries and the marine surveyor in my Department.  There are sufficient checks and balances in the system to ensure that nothing is rushed, to say the least of it, and that a proper decision is taken.</P>

This must continue to be the position if the Government are to retain complete freedom of action at all times to deal with the major problems which they face in the commercial State body area.  However, in view of the special circumstances which obtain in the case of Irish Shipping Limited, I am prepared to give the following information to the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The board of Irish Shipping Limited put forward two options for consideration by the Government:</P>
      <P> (i)  the immediate winding up of the company; or</P>
      <P>(ii)  an attempt at a final renegotiation with the foreign shipowners with Government support.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board expressed the view that, before proceeding to wind up the company, a final renegotiation attempt should be made.  The board were only prepared to contemplate this renegotiation attempt first, if the Government agreed in advance to financial commitments (including the cost of a possible <Col N="319" /> settlement with the foreign interests concerned) of £74.5 million; and secondly, if the desired result could not be achieved within the financial limit specified (and this the board felt was a very real possibility) the winding up of ISL would have to immediately follow.</P>
    <P>The board of ISL were clearly pessimistic about the outcome of their renegotiation proposal.  The Government, having carefully considered all options, made their decision.  In the light of proposals made by the foreign interests concerned to the liquidator since he was appointed, it is clear to me that renegotiation of the charters on the basis of the cost figures envisaged by the board of ISL in their report to me could not possibly have succeeded. This more than vindicated the judgment of the Government.</P>

      <P>Could the Minister confirm that the recommendation to the Minister from the board was a unanimous one, which would have included the chairman newly appointed to the company? Two options were put to the Minister. One was unanimously recommended to him and that was the one he chose to turn down.  Could he confirm that that actually is the situation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister comment on information available to the Joint Committee on State-sponsored Bodies that a unanimous proposal from both the chairman and the board was put to the Minister that the company could have been kept in business for under £30 million, and that on receiving that advice the Minister still decided to liquidate the company?  What additional advice had the Minister beyond the unanimous recommendation of the board and its chairman which led to the situation?  It is quite clear that a figure of under £30 million as suggested by the board could <Col N="320" /> have gone a long way towards restructuring the company so that it could operate on the basis of having two or three ships.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the figures quoted are accurate.  Deputy Brennan has twice used the figure of £30 million, but he means an additional £30 million over the cost of the liquidation. The minimum price suggested by the board, including the cost of settlement with the shipowners, was £47½ million. We rejected that after careful consideration. Even Deputy Brennan will appreciate that once we made an offer we would have acknowledged a liability, which we were determined not to accept, and if we offered £74 million it would only have been a matter of negotiation upwards from that.  Under bankruptcy law, between the appointment of a provisional liquidator and until he is made official three or four weeks later, there is more than enough time for creditors to seek a scheme of arrangement from the liquidator.  In this case an attempt of sorts was made by some of the shipowners but the settlements they were seeking were too high.  That more than vindicated the decision of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I put it to the Minister that that is what should have been done. The cost of closing Irish Shipping, according to the Minister's reply, will be somewhere between £45 million and £60 million, and for an additional under £30 million the company could have been kept in existence with a smaller fleet. Did the Minister seriously consider that option even though the board may have been pessimistic?</P>

      <P>I assure the Deputy that every possible angle of this was considered carefully.  There were renegotiations at the beginning of 1984 on the basis that if they did not succeed the company would have to go into liquidation. They renegotiated a deal which at that stage it was hoped would keep the company going in 1985.  In a matter of months it was clear that the assumptions that underpinned that renegotiation were not being realised and that the position was deteriorating rapidly and could not continue.  It was not realistic for the board to come again on the same basis to renegotiate further.  Our judgment was made in the knowledge that, if the shipowners were prepared to renegotiate and to offer a sufficient reduction in the tramp shipping rates, they could do so between the appointment of the provisional liquidator and the official liquidator.  They did not do so; they came up with an offer which would have cost substantially more than the company or the board of directors suggested.  The outturn of those discussions between the liquidators and the shipowners more than vindicated the Government's decision in the matter.</P>

      <P>In the Minister's speech announcing the liquidation of Irish Shipping the Minister gave the House a figure of £38 million as being an early termination clause.  The value of that ship is probably about £18 million and I make that an exposure by the State of £20 million, not £38 million.</P>

      <P>This is where an understanding of the figures is very important.  The <i>Irish Spruce</i> was in any event being paid for three-quarters by the State, one-quarter by my Department and half by the Department of Industry because of an arrangement that was made by the Government for the building of the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> It was in effect a shipyard subsidy.  In any event, three-quarters of the price is being paid by the State and that would account for the £38 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 and 13 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="324" /> No licence has yet been issued for provision of a cable television service in Clonmel.  Suir Nore Relays Ltd., Thurles, have, however, been informed that it is proposed to grant them a licence subject to certain stipulated conditions being fulfilled.</P>
    <P>The proposals received as a result of the public invitation were assessed from both technical and financial aspects.  The proposals by the local firm in Clonmel were regarded as less satisfactory than those submitted by Suir Nore Relays Ltd., being technically deficient and the installation and annual rental charges being higher.</P>
    <P>The installation charge quoted by Suir Nore Relays Ltd. is £60 and the annual rental £73.80.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, if these conditions are satisfied Suir Nore Relays Limited will be awarded the licence.  Is it the general policy of the Department to ensure monopolism in regard to the granting of such licences, because the company concerned have already been awarded licences for Kilkenny, Thurles, Cashel and Tipperary town but they have not commenced work on a cable television system in those towns?  Is the Minister aware of the experience of the company in regard to the provision of cable television systems and the method of trunk cabling they intend providing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the Deputy's question about monopolism my reply is, &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  All things being equal I would prefer to give the franchise to local contractors, but in this case four applications for the licences were received and two of them did not get beyond the first stage.  The other two were considered but the local application was found to be technically deficient and dearer.  Really, I did not have any choice.  Since the letter of intent to Suir Nore Relays was issued I received a deputation, led by Deputy Seán Treacy and the Mayor of Clonmel. As a result of those representations I am reviewing the matter to see if a change of mind would be warranted or if we can do anything to ensure the speedy cabling <Col N="325" /> of Clonmel.  I am very conscious of the fact that delays have occurred in cabling contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanByrne" hpid="Mr. S. Byrne Mr. S. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that the Minister gracefully received a deputation from the area some weeks ago and I should like to know if he will give serious consideration to awarding the contract to the Clonmel company.  Local people would be employed and the control of the installation of the system would be Clonmel based.  I have no doubt that the local company would instal a reliable system without any undue delay.  As has been pointed out, the other firm have a number of other contracts but have not commenced work.  The revenue involved in the cabling system would remain in Clonmel if the local company was granted the licence.  The Minister should bear in mind the representations of local Members, the mayor and members of Clonmel Corporation and award the licence to the Clonmel firm.  In fairness it should be said that they are a well known concern and are capable of providing an excellent service for the local people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I note what the Deputy has said but I do not think anybody would thank me if after granting a licence the service turned out to be technically deficient, as my technical advisers have informed me about this case.  Deputies will be aware that problems exist in some towns where people who were granted the franchise introduced a system that was below technical standards.  There are ongoing problems in regard to signals in those towns.  If that happened in the case of Clonmel I do not think I would be well thought of.</P>

      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for his sensitivity in respect of the deputation he received which was led by the Mayor of Clonmel and representing the wishes of all the people of the town.  Will the Minister afford the Clonmel company an opportunity of meeting his officials so that they may defend themselves against the accusation made against them in regard to their ability to perform this job?  I should be grateful if <Col N="326" /> the Minister would arrange for his officials to meet the Clonmel company at an early date so that they can clarify various aspects of the contract and thereby enable the company to maintain their good name and integrity in this area.  Will the Minister have regard to the wishes of the people of Clonmel who will be paying for the service?  Will the Minister have regard to the nature of the goodwill which operates in such a delicate area?  Will the Minister ensure that the Clonmel company are involved to some extent in the provision of cable television in their own town?  The local company would provide badly needed employment compared to a company that has contracts for the provision of cable television in many towns in the south east but, according to all the evidence, has failed to do any worthwhile work.</P>

      <P>I should like to make it clear that there is no doubt about the integrity of the company concerned. What is in question is the technical information they supplied to the Department. That was found to be deficient.  I am sure they are an excellent company and I am conscious of the unanimity of local repersentatives in regard to this.  I told the deputation that I am examining the matter, and I will be in touch with those involved as soon as possible.</P>

He should note that in 1983 this licence was granted to a company from Dungarvan who threw up the invitation.  The scheme would have been beneficial to the <Col N="327" /> people of the town.

It was found that there was a slight vapour leak from the leading car. Gardaí cordoned off the area and rail services were halted until the area was declared safe by the fire brigade.

      <P>Before calling on Deputy Flynn to resume I might remind Deputies again that under an order of the House made this morning, without dissent, this debate must conclude by calling the Minister for Health at 8.10 p.m.  There are somewhat in excess of 30 Deputies offering to speak. In the Chair's opinion some of those Deputies, for one reason or another, have what I think would be a special entitlement to make a contribution. Unless Deputies make their speeches short &mdash; and I cannot compel them to do so &mdash; it will not be possible for anything like all the Deputies who wish to speak to have an opportunity of doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not propose to take much longer anyway.</P>
      <P>Before the suspension of business I was saying that there was an element of bitterness in the debate that one might have hoped would not have been so prevalent. It appears that there has been quite a concerted effort on the part of certain individuals and groups to render the debate more divisive than it should have been and somehow to represent the debate as some gigantic struggle between the Church and State.  I cannot accept that, because all sides of the House have indicated, both inside and outside it, that the bishops, that the leaders of the Church communities in the country, had every right, entitlement &mdash; in fact, a duty &mdash; to indicate what their stand on the Bill should be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I can see the church or churches do not seem to be having the tremendous effect on either side of the House that has been portrayed outside the House.  As far as I understand, and as far as I am personally concerned, Deputies have not been contacted by members of the hierarchy or Church leaders of any particular denomination. It appears to me that Members are going about their proper business, taking their stand and will vote in accordance with the principles as they see them affecting themselves.  I believe this question of a Church/State divide is a trumped-up <Col N="358" /> charge which does not stand up to close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>We hear also ominous statements of fierce foreboding about the relationships that might exist between the Republic and the North of Ireland if certain things are done in this House.  I am of the view &mdash; and I should like to think others share that view &mdash; that it is not reasonable nor would it be profitable in our interests ever to pass measures here simply to placate the attitudes or opinions of another section of the community whatever part of the island they live in.  I would like to think I would have greater respect for our separated brethren or the Unionist population in this country, that they would have greater regard for views fervently held and expressed by whatever group down here, rather than simply saying: &ldquo;If you do this it might have a beneficial effect&rdquo;.  We have seen that tested before and it was found to be faulty.  I believe it will be found to be faulty in this regard as well.</P>
    <P>Some speakers advocating the widespread use of contraceptives show an extraordinary level of intolerance to those whose views, sincerely held, are against the Bill as it is being promoted here.  I regard it as quite extraordinary that those who are promoting and preaching one side of the business to us, both inside and outside this House, are showing this intolerance of the sincerely held views of others who do not see the provisions of this Bill as being in the best interests of our people at large.  Somehow one is being portrayed both inside and outside the House &mdash; and in most intemperate language &mdash; as being a freak, old fashioned, out of touch or not in step if one does not come into line with new fangled ideas being promoted through principles enunciated in jurisdictions that have in the recent past begun to show that perhaps their long held views on the matter concerning abortion, enthanasia, divorce and indeed contraception are changing, and changing quite quickly in those jurisdictions.</P>
    <P>There will be no winners here this evening: mark my words on that.  We had one display of what I might describe as <Col N="359" /> minor triumphalism this morning after the contribution of one Member.  I should hate to think that after the vote has been taken this evening we would see a continuation of bitterness, that an atmosphere of recrimination would take over that would have a detrimental effect on all relationships inside and outside the House.</P>
    <P>I was making the point before the suspension of business that, as far as I was concerned, a contraceptive society did require abortion as a fail-safe and that, if we were going to have obtaining a widespread liberal situation in so far as contraceptives were concerned, we would also have to place ourselves in the position of providing abortion as a back-up to that service.  I do not think it is possible for us to be neutral on contraception. Any society that has widespread contraceptives available is an anti-life society and it would be in contravention of the stated aims of our Constitution.</P>
    <P>I might cite some examples from statistics readily available from the nearest jurisdiction to us concerning the increased incidence of veneral disease and cancer of the cervix, despite the fact that that jurisdiction has quite a widespread educated and contraceptive society.  I was making particular reference to reports from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, I was stating that some 28 per cent of all conceptions in the United Kingdom were illegitimate last year, and that these figures applied to a jurisdiction where contraception and sex education are freely available to all ages without parental control.</P>
    <P>While not wishing to reduce the debate to a question of shillings and pence, it is as well to bear in mind that one parent families cost the United Kingdom last year £1 billion &mdash; this from the <i>Hansard Report</i>&mdash; unmarried mothers head up 20 per cent of all one parent families and their illegitimate births cost the United Kingdom Exchequer in excess of £200 million last year.  Therefore the failure rate &mdash; this is the point I am making, the failure rate in so far as the widespread use of condoms is concerned &mdash; can certainly <Col N="360" /> prove to be a very expensive failure rate so far as the Exchequer is concerned.  If the contraceptive ethic is to be foisted on us let us at least recognise what the supporters of that kind of society promise for us.  The Director of the International Planned Parenthood Federation, Dr. Malcolm Pott, speaking at Cambridge, stated publicly that as people turn to contraceptives there will be a rise, not a fall, in the abortion rate, that therefore doctors, when contraception fails &mdash; which it does &mdash; should be able and willing to provide an after-sales service with back-up abortion services.  The callousness of that little gem deserves some contemplation by those who wish to have a widespread contraceptive service available in this country.  Dr. Tietze of the Rockefeller Population Council and Planned Parenthood, stated that the safest regimen of control for the unmarried and for married child spacers is the use of the traditional methods of contraception, namely, condoms, backed up by abortion.  Dr. Alan Guttmacher, the late president of Planned Parenthood, said that the logical inclusion of sterilisation and abortion will be integral components of a modern fertility control service.  The Brooks Advisory Centre, Edinburgh, stated in 1981 that there is overwhelming evidence that, contrary to what you might expect, the availability of contraceptives leads to an increase in the abortion rate.</P>
    <P>These are the views of supporters of widespread contraception being made available to all and sundry, irrespective of parental or State control.  These are not the views of rabid anti-abortion, anti-contraception fanatics, they represent the fundamental principles on which family planning perspectives are based and to which the Irish organisation affiliated to that group subscribes.</P>
    <P>Will contraception have a detrimental effect on the level of venereal disease?  I suggest that it will, and statistics back up my statement.  Why is it that the free availability of condoms or contraceptives in other jurisdictions has not reduced the level of venereal diseases?  Let us take the figures as they apply to England alone in so far as venereal diseases and sexually <Col N="361" /> transmitted diseases are concerned.  In 1975 the incidence of venereal diseases reached a figure of 363,551 and in 1983 it rose to a figure of 547,437.  This applies to a jurisdiction where contraceptives are not just available but widely promoted by the health services.  The incontrovertible evidence is that the widespread availability of contraceptives had done nothing to stop the escalation of illegitimate births and abortions.</P>
    <P>Denmark has one of the most so-called sexually liberated jurisdictions and permissive societies in Europe, and the illegitimate birth rate has gone right through the roof.  The incidence of such births was 7.8 per cent in 1960, 11 per cent in 1970 and 36 per cent in 1981. Availability has not promoted sexual responsibility elsewhere, and does anyone suggest that it will be any different here?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I have stated the views of an international organisation which a particular family planning association is affiliated to and I have put on record what their most eminent promoters state to be the case.  An extract from their own international newsletter states that abortion on request is a logical concomitant of contraception on demand.  The Government are attempting to introduce contraceptives on demand and it is logical to expect that, if that is the case, it must be a very short road until such time as we have the back-up service of abortion as a rescue net for those who are caught out, because of the fact that it has been stated conclusively by statisticians who are not attached to this jurisdiction that contraceptives are not a sure thing in every case and that the failure rate has been escalating to such a degree that there is disenchantment with condoms as a means of preventing conception.</P>

      <P>If the contraceptive ethic is to be accepted, we will have to introduce the rescue net of abortion to back it up in accordance with the guidelines laid down by the international organisations of which the Irish Family Planning Association is a member, namely, that there will be a rise in the abortion rate as long as people turn to contraceptives.  We are against that.  We do not think there <Col N="363" /> is a demand for the Bill at present, and there is no statistical evidence to back-up the Minister&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If the Minister is basing his legislation on an opinion poll that was not available for scrutiny here in the House and if we have reached the stage in Irish political life that legislation will be introduced as a result of the latest opinion poll, then the Government would have run their race long ago, because all the opinion polls in the last six months said that they were gone already.  If that was applied across the board, we would not be here talking this rubbish.  Remember one thing: the demand is not there. While it might not be possible to legislate for people to be more moral it is possible to legislate for them to be less moral. That is the difficulty we have.  This is not good legislation.  It will have a bad and lasting effect on the common good.</P>

      <P>In the context of this Bill we have heard numerous references to the request for a free vote but we have not heard any reference to the possibility of having a secret vote on this measure. If there was a secret vote there would be no more than 20 or 30 people who would <Col N="364" /> oppose this legislation.  The overwhelming majority of Deputies know in their hearts that this legislation is right.</P>
      <P>There has been constant reference to the suggestion that there was no demand for it.  I am not clear if that means there was no demand for the legislation or for non-medical contraceptives.  If it is intended to mean there is no demand for non-medical contraceptives there are statistics which show clearly that 10 million of these devices are used every year. That would give the lie to any suggestion that there is no demand for them.  There are 10 million demands for contraceptives in this country year in and year out. I do not know what more formal demand there could be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>The intent of the legislation is to do no more and no less than to give legislative honesty to the prevailing situation.  The present position is that these devices are available and are being used but in most cases it is a criminal <Col N="365" /> offence to use them.  Where are the prosecutions to enforce the law in this regard?  Have there been 10 million prosecutions, 5 million, ten or five?  Is it that we will allow the law to be brought into widespread disrepute and will allow it to be abused?  What kind of sham and hypocrisy would that be?</P>
      <P>Reference was made to the fact that this legislation will destroy the fabric of society.  If society has a fabric at present it is no more than a very thin one behind which the scene is that 10 million devices are required and used every year.  We would preserve the honesty of our country if we called a spade a spade and gave legislative authenticity to the present position.  The legislation will not increase the use or importation of condoms or any other non-medical contraceptives. Deputy Flynn asked if the Bill could achieve what it set out to do.  I say it can.  If it gives legislative honesty to the situation we have, it will have done what it set out to do in large measure.  At present there is widespread abuse of the law, and that is accepted by prosecutors in every town and county.  We cannot allow that to continue.</P>
      <P>The question of no demand is one canard which has been introduced into the debate.  Another one is, to whom will the devices be available?  There is a thread running through the debate of &ldquo;children will use them&rdquo;.  &ldquo;Teenagers&rdquo; is a word chosen with great care.  Let us be quite clear about it.  In the Bill their use is limited to adults aged 18 and over.  A few weeks ago this House unanimously decided that a person is an adult at 18 years of age.  It is only to adults in the legally accepted sense that this Bill applies.  Adults should have the right to choose without State interference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another popular term used in the debate is the expression &ldquo;morality&rdquo;.  Bald and pontifical statements have been made inside and outside the House such as it is wrong to use contraceptives and that they will lead us down the slippery slope to paganism.  Such statements have been bandied about and put forward as though they had a gospel truth about <Col N="366" /> them and as if because they are pronounced in a strong voice, in a definitive way with the wave of an arm that they must be correct.  That is taken as sufficient evidence of their truth.  There is no basis in fact for these statements.  As statements they are entitled to no more credence than the writings of the Emperor Justinian, a very learned man and the author of a fine legal treatise which was no doubt widely accepted at the time that homosexuality was the cause of earthquakes.  These grandiose statements we hear are entitled to no more credence than that one.</P>
    <P>Morality is not a constant accepted thing.  The morality of everyone north and south is not on a par.  Everyone's morality is different.  In the UK they used to say it varies according to the length of the Chancellor's foot.  It varies from time to time, place to place and person to person.  Different groups have different moralities.  There is no one morality; everyone has their own.  Why should the morality of one group be given the sanction of the criminal law?  That takes us out of the realm of what should be done, what is a good, right and humane thing to do and puts it into the field of the criminal law.  One suggestion as to why it is right to import that morality into the criminal law is that it is the rule of a particular religion.</P>
    <P>The law does not require each of its citizens to adhere to the faith of any one particular religion.  That is a fact.  There was a time in Spain in the days of the Inquisition when it was different, but in Ireland today the law does not require its citizens to adhere to any one faith.  If that is so, how then can it be that the law would require all citizens to adhere to the moral teachings of a particular faith? That could not be and it should not be. It is not a criminal offence for adults to have sexual relations with each other. That is a fact.  There may be many who think it should be an offence, there may be those who think that the commission of adultery should be a criminal offence, but it is not.  It is not an offence, and it is not an offence for adults to have sexual <Col N="367" /> relations with each other.  Therefore, as the law does not deem it necessary to have that as an offence, why should it then come along and dictate the manner in which those sexual relationships take place or what facilities should be available to the many who consider it perfectly in order to act as they do?</P>
    <P>I accept that the implications of this Bill are at variance with the morality of the majority religion.  That has been enunciated by the bishops, and it is an undeniable fact.  However, the question is, what should be the motive for people to conform to that morality?  I think the motive should be that people will observe that morality if they wish because of their upbringing, the teaching of their parents, instructors and religious leaders and the result of advice and even exhortation, and that following on all of that they will decide of their own free will to exercise the voluntary restraint that is involved.</P>
    <P>I pose this question: where is the moral value if the adherence to this morality is the result not of voluntary restraint but of coercion?  The idea of conforming to morality surely means a person has a choice.  They may do good in the eyes of that morality or evil; if they do good they will be rewarded and if they do evil they will be punished.  They have a choice. Where is the reward if compliance with that morality is the result not of an exercise in free choice but of an exercise in coercion?  In simple terms I put it this way: in my opinion and in the opinion of the majority in the country there is a realm of private morality which, to put it bluntly, is not the business of the law.  It is the business of the private individual and, in my view, it is immoral in itself to use the criminal law system for the purpose of enforcing morality.</P>
    <P>I have heard it asked why are we wasting our time in the Dáil discussing and debating this when there are so many more important matters to deal with such as the economy, unemployment and so on.  It is true those are very important matters, but the implication behind that assertion is that talk here in the Dáil will solve our unemployment and economic <Col N="368" /> problems.  If all it required to solve those problems was talk in the Dáil they would long since have been fully resolved.  It requires more than talk here to solve those problems.  It requires a different approach to our economy, it requires a radical change in the voting patterns of the Irish people which have not been indicated so far.</P>
    <P>This Bill is an exercise in honesty.  It is not going to change anything so far as practice is concerned but it will take away some of the hypocrisy and give us some honesty.  It will accept and recognise a situation that exists, it will put thousands of people into the position of being lawabiding citizens instead of criminals in their private lives.  The Bill is a firm and modest measure and it has my full and unquivering support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much opposed to the Bill for a number of reasons. First, there is no public demand for contraceptives. One of the main reasons the Bill was introduced by the Government at this time was to divert the minds of the people from the recent disastrous budget. It would be far more in keeping with the business of this House to continue with the budget debate and to try to improve the economy.</P>
      <P>This is bad legislation for a number of reasons.  Any measure that cannot be implemented properly is bad, and in my view it will be impossible to implement this legislation because it will not be possible for the State to ensure that contraceptives will be used only by people over 18 years.  I intend to give a few examples of how it will happen that young teenagers will use contraceptives if this Bill becomes law.  This measure will put young teenage girls in particular under severe pressure.  It is a well known fact that generally teenage boys have a friendship with girls a few years younger and there will be situations where boys of 18 to 20 years who are single will have relationships with girls of 16 or 17 years. These young teenage girls will be under severe pressure if the Bill becomes law.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even if the greatest care is taken to implement the provisions of the Bill and <Col N="369" /> to ensure that it is not abused, it will be very difficult to make sure that only persons over 18 years will have access to contraceptives.  I have been approached by a number of parents who are concerned about what is likely to happen in certain instances when young people go on weekends as has been common practice in recent years.  There is a danger that people over 18 who will be able to get contraceptives in chemist shops and in the outlets suggested by the Minister could pass them on to younger people who may be with them on a holiday weekend. This will put the younger teenage girls under pressure.  I will say later what effect this undue pressure will have on youth in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>If this legislation is passed its provisions will within a very short time become the accepted moral and social practice here, and that will not be good for the country or for the people, particularly the young people.  The Minister and the Deputies who spoke in favour of the Bill indicated that the practice of using contraceptives and condoms is widespread already throughout the country.  I do not accept that it is as widespread as has been indicated. Government speakers have said that we are merely legalising the present position.  If something is getting out of hand or if there is danger of something getting out of hand in any area, you do not just rush in and legislate and legalise it.  If that line of argument by the Minister and Government speakers is carried to its logical conclusion we could say that because larceny and petty theft are getting out of hand because persons with very little means of support must resort to petty theft and larceny to eke out an existence for themselves, we should legislate for that also.  The Minister should not legislate to legalise a situation just because it may be getting out of control.  A Bill providing a code of behaviour would be far more acceptable.</P>
    <P>Parents should be encouraged to take an interest in educating their children, particularly teenage families, in matters related to sexual behaviour.  Teachers should be encouraged to do the same in school whenever the opportunity arises. <Col N="370" /> We must bear in mind the fact that school education is an extension of home education, generally speaking.  I would go so far as to say that more Christian doctrine should be taught in our primary and post primary schools.  No matter what the religious beliefs may be, Christian doctrine should be taught in our schools to a far greater extent than it is.  Christian doctrine is being taught in primary and post primary schools to a lesser extent than previously.</P>
    <P>I am opposed to this Bill because matters far more important to the nation should be discussed with urgency now, and here I am reflecting the views of people I have spoken to in my constituency. The Government should be more concerned at the moment with job creation, industrial policy, the state of the horticultural and agricultural industries and improving the situation within the health boards which arises from the health cuts.  The Government should be concerned about providing more money for local authorities to improve roads and other services for the people in rural areas.</P>
    <P>Letters in the newspapers say that the 1979 Family Planning Act was &ldquo;an Irish solution to an Irish problem&rdquo;.  I see nothing wrong with that.  Why can we not have an Irish solution to an Irish problem? Why must we look abroad over our shoulders from time to time to find out how to cope with problems in this country? I cannot see why we cannot in a mature manner determine our future, our children's future, and the future of the country, having due regard for our own standards and not for an alien code of standards or behaviour.</P>
    <P>Reference was made in this debate and outside this House to the fact that persons speaking against this Bill have not regard for the feelings of Protestants, Unionists and persons holding other than Catholic beliefs and outlook.  As far as I am aware, all the churches and their members want a high moral code throughout society. Churches, organisations and people professing other than Roman Catholic beliefs are concerned about the implications which this Bill if passed could have for <Col N="371" /> the youth.  Also I am opposed to the Bill because it is well known in medical circles and proven to be true that condoms are only 70 per cent safe.  This being so, the use of condoms as proposed by the Minister in the Bill will result in more unwanted pregnancies and a greater demand for abortion, a situation which very few in this House would wish to see arising.  I have it on the best medical advice that condoms are only 70 per cent safe.</P>

      <P>It is well known in the medical profession.  Teenagers may use condoms without knowing how to use them.  They will be experimenting with them &mdash; as is only natural &mdash; and when this Bill becomes law we will have more unwanted pregnancies than ever before and people will be crying out again for abortion.  This Bill will prove most destructive for youth.  This new law and social code of behaviour will pose serious problems for youth.  If the Bill is passed it will put the stamp of approval on that low social and moral code of behaviour. We need only have regard to what is happening in other countries.</P>

      <P>In such places as Sweden, Germany and Norway there is a growing concern regarding the falling numbers of young people.  There is concern that so many married people are deciding not to have children.  There are moves in Norway and Sweden to introduce tax incentives and allowances that would encourage couples to have children. It is well known that people are going from Africa to those countries to seek employment and this employment is available as a result of the decline in the populations in that part of the world.  The same applies to certain parts of Germany. The multinationals who have vested interests in the sale of contraceptives have been exploring possibilities for sales in other countries including Ireland <Col N="372" /> because their sales are diminishing in other European countries.</P>
      <P>In other countries, too, where contraceptives are freely available for single teenage persons, there have been changes in society.  For instance, there are the ever increasing number of unwanted pregnancies as well as a demand for abortion.  This state of affairs undermines the basic fabric of society.  It undermines the family.  Therefore, if the Bill is passed there will be problems for many parents.  In the US there is now a turnabout on issues such as these.  People are thinking in terms of controlling contraceptives and of prohibiting abortion. President Reagan is leading a campaign against abortion and this in turn will lead to a campaign against the use of contraceptives.</P>

      <P>I had hoped that this Bill, though introduced hastily, would have been debated in a mature and responsible manner and given the deep critical examination it deserves.  Unfortunately, due to the highly charged emotive atmosphere in which discussion and debate have taken place both inside and outside the House, this is now impossible.  However, I trust that in the short time remaining to the House for discussion of the Bill, the debate can be open, frank and, above all, charitable.  My contribution will be brief and deliberately low key because I hope to remove from the debate the element of sensationalism, to bring the debate back to the Floor of the House where ultimately decisions have to be made.  It would be my hope that the debate would be removed from television and from the banner headlines and be returned to the House where the Minister and all of us here have a contribution to make.</P>
      <P>The Bill is one of the most important ever to come before us from a moral, sociological and political point of view.  I sincerely hope that the Minister who is representing the Government here has not adopted an irreversible stonewall stance whereby he is immune to all reasonable and sincere efforts to resolve what is now a very serious and contentious issue.  For the Minister to act in that way would be to degrade and to demean the House and to remove from the legislators the right bestowed on them by the electorate to come here and debate legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not amazed that this issue should suddenly and with such viciousness erupt into such searing red hot controversy.  It <Col N="374" /> has all the emotive ingredients of politics, religion and sex, subjects on which every adult citizen has deeply held convictions and dogmatic views.</P>
    <P>Perhaps, ironic though it may be, some good will emanate from these discussions, perhaps a better realisation for the future of the different roles of both Church and State and above all an acceptance of the personal responsibility of parents and young people alike for their moral and social behaviour.  Perhaps it is timely that we look at where we are going as a nation, from a moral point of view. That is not just referring to sexual morality alone.  It is no harm now and again for the people to stand back and to forget the economic issues and to devote their time and energies to seeing where they are going and what type of environment they should like to have for their children.</P>
    <P>When one considers the ever increasing crime rate, the disasters and tragedies brought about by joyriders, the abuse of drugs, the beating up of people living alone, especially the elderly, then it is time for us all to be jarred into the reality and the morality of the Ireland we live in.  A lesson, too, for the future can be learned, in that where potentially contentious new social legislation is to be introduced, a lot of preparatory groundwork has to be undertaken so as to prepare the legislators and the electors alike.  All interested parties must be consulted so that there is at least some consensus before the matter is introduced red raw to the Floor of this House.  The hasty &mdash; and if I might say politically inept &mdash; fashion in which this legislation was introduced to this House is the cause of the present confrontation.  Sides were taken and statements made in the red hot flush of anxiety of both sides.</P>
    <P>Coming back to this Bill, I must confess that, for the first time in my parliamentary career of 12 years, I have grave reservations about a certain aspect of the Bill. I feel obliged to indicate, both to the House and to my electorate, the reasons for such misgivings and why I have delayed coming to a final decision in my voting intentions.  This delay was not occasioned by any indecision or wavering <Col N="375" /> on my part, but a determination by me that I should give the matter the closest and gravest consideration, so that my eventual decision would be as informed as it possibly could be.  In this regard, I should like to thank all those who wrote to me, phoned and met me and gave me the benefit of their views.  Fortunately so far, unlike a number of my colleagues, I did not receive any hate mail or phone calls.  There is a general acceptance that perhaps I was trying to decide on the delicate issues involved and the people were most grateful and most helpful. Indeed, much of the correspondence which I received left it entirely up to my discretion and indicated that no matter what decision I would take they would support it.</P>
    <P>I should like to come back to what I would see as the nub of the whole problem. It is in the Joint Programme for Government issued by Fine Gael and Labour in December 1982.  It is a small paragraph of 30 words.  I shall record it into the Official Report that we gave the following undertaking, both Fine Gael and Labour, if elected to Government as part of our health programme:</P>
    <P>There will be a review of the operation of the present family planning legislation with a view to providing full family planning advice and facilities in all cases where needed. </P>
    <P>To me, that is where the problem started.  I firmly believed, when looking for votes and approaching the electorate, that that commitment referred purely and simply to a family planning situation within the existing legislation, for bona fide family planning purposes.  A constitutional lawyer who offered me his advice said that he is absolutely and positively certain that in relation to existing law, especially the Health (Family Planning) Act, 1979 and to the reference to the family in the Constitution, no other interpretation could be taken out of that.  He has indicated that if other constitutional lawyers might think otherwise, any Bill which does not embrace that can be successfully challenged in the High Court <Col N="376" /> and Supreme Court.  Perhaps that is for another day.</P>
    <P>Here, I am not alone in my concern and doubts about that issue.  Not alone are there members of the Fine Gael Party but also members of the Labour Party who have such doubts as to the true meaning of that commitment.  I firmly believe that we had a commitment to the electorate and that commitment can be accepted by the electorate and by the vast bulk of the parliamentary parties with seven-eights of this Bill.  I support the Minister in the amendment of it, especially in sections 1 and 2 as they now stand. I have one query in particular about section 4, the added section in respect of family planning services.  I would ask the Minister to give the House an assurance that this family planning service will not be used for the procurement of abortions or referrals.  I would urge him to give this commitment to the House because there is much concern throughout the country that these family planning services, unless they are under the strict guidance of the Minister for Health and unless he is ever watchful, have a possibility of being used for referral purposes.  I hope that the Minister will give that assurance.</P>
    <P>The section about which I am particularly concerned is section 2, sub-paragraph (ia), which states:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The sale is a sale of contraceptive sheaths or spermicides to a person over the age of 18 years, or&rdquo;, </P>
    <P>I decided to have a look at that from various aspects, from the medical point of view.  I could not but be moved by a letter I received on 23 October, 1984 from 17 top medical men in the country, gynaecologists, consultant surgeons, psychiatrists. I must admit that one member whose name was signed to this letter informed us that he was withdrawing his name, but I cannot recall that name at the moment.  I feel that I should read this letter, so as to indicate my concern from a medical point of view.  These men are perhaps of no political persuasion or no religious persuasion.  Their one field is that of medicine.  As this is a health Bill, <Col N="377" /> their views should be taken into account. The letter goes:</P>
    <P>Dear Deputy.</P>
    <P>As members of the medical profession, we are extremely concerned at the recent proposals to make contraceptives freely available by law to young single people.  It is our understanding that the majority of people in this State oppose such a measure. </P>
    <P>It then refers to the Irish Marketing Survey poll taken in 1984.  The letter then goes on:</P>
    <P>We would regard the implementation of these proposals as injurious to the physical and mental health of our youth, with all its attendant social implications.  If these proposals become law, the inevitable consequences will be increased promiscuity, with an upsurge in venereal diseases. </P>
    <P>They list syphilis, gonorrhea, herpes and carcinoma of the cervix as experienced in this and other countries.</P>
    <P>The accepted high failure rate of contraceptives when used by teenagers must lead to increased teenage pregnancy and abortion.  We would like to emphasise that the setting up of an age limit for contraceptive practice is devoid of any scientific or sociological basis.  Furthermore, legalising something which is productive of so much proven pathological and sociological <i>sequelae</i> is to us both reprehensible and horrific. </P>
    <P>This is a statement by the top medical men of the country who are concerned primarily with what this Bill refers to.  I had to take note of that.  I could not glibly cast it aside.  This is the advice and experience of these men, informing us of the potential dangers.</P>
    <P>Irrespective of whether this Bill goes through or not, I would urge the Minister to make our young people aware of the dangers of using these contraceptives. Perhaps some of them are not totally aware of the high failure rate or of the other implications.  We are obliged to bring those facts to the notice of our <Col N="378" /> young unsuspecting boys and girls who might for some reason use these contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I must also look at the issue from a moral point of view.  I regret the Church-State confrontation on this issue, but perhaps it is inevitable because the two roles overlap.  The duty of the State is to legislate but the Church has a duty to give their views on the morality of any proposed legislation.  Then it is entirely up to the legislators to legislate according to their consciences.  I firmly support the Church authorities when they make a pronouncement on any issue such as this. If they were not to do so they would be lacking in the fulfillment of their duties. I decry the allegation that the Dáil is ruled by Rome.  That does not stand up to examination.  I refute the suggestion that the Irish people are sectarian.  On two occasions the people elected to the highest office of the land men of a minority persuasion.  In this House today there are three Members of the Jewish faith, one to each political party &mdash; three excellent Members who are making a great contribution to political life.  If the people were sectarian none of these three would be Members of the House.  If my figures are correct the total Jewish community here would be less than one third of a quota of votes needed to be elected.  We have another Member from Wexford who belongs to a minority religion and who is giving excellent service.  These instances prove that the Irish people are not sectarian, as does the fifth amendment to our Constitution to delete Article 44.2º because it might be offensive to the Northern people.  The Irish people overwhelmingly in a referendum decided to remove that Article, which said:</P>
    <P>The State recognises the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens. </P>
    <P>That is a simple statement, yet the Irish people when they were asked removed it from the Constitution.  Some of the Northern clergymen who are forever labelling us as being Rome ruled forget <Col N="379" /> they themselves are clergymen and that they are strutting across the political stage in Northern Ireland and neither the Catholic minority in the North nor the Catholic majority here are accusing them of being a people controlled by their Church.  I do not want to enter into a North-South discussion here, but in fairness to the Catholic hierarchy who are obliged to make their views known, I have made three remarks.  We are over sensitive here about accepting the views of the bishops on legislation or any other issue.  We should not think that they are trying to impose their will on Dáil Éireann. I do not accept that this is purely a Church-State confrontation.</P>
    <P>In relation to the provision restricting the sale of contraceptives to people of 18 years and over, I like, Professor Deputy John Kelly have doubts about it.  Unfortunately, time has overtaken us because with the Age of Majority Bill, 1984, is about to become law on 1 March this year; so whatever hope we had of putting the age limit at 21 years of age has now slipped by.  It is virtually impossible to enforce the age limit.  I hope the Minister will think of introducing identity cards so as to enable those people who are responsible for the outlets to ascertain the age of people seeking contraceptives. Most third level students have identity cards, and we have often heard of appeals from those in the licenced business for identity cards to help them in determining the age of a customer.</P>
    <P>Being the father of teenagers I am fully aware of the pressure, especially the peer pressure, that will be on our young boys and girls.  Perhaps there is nothing we can do in that regard, but we should at least alert our young boys and girls not to succumb to the peer pressure, to stand up for their morals and not to succumb to the easy catchcries of those who are indulging in sex at every age.  I have the greatest confidence and trust in our young people.  There is no imputation in my remarks to suggest that our youth have not the moral courage to decide right from wrong.  I admire our young people who face far greater temptations than I <Col N="380" /> had to face in my youth.  There is a great tenacity and hidden reserve in our youth which can be mustered to withstand the moral pressures being put on them today. But it is basically on behalf of parents that I address my remarks.</P>
    <P>I make a special plea to the Minister. All Deputies have been inundated with letters and appeals from parents expressing their grave concern at the consequences if this Bill becomes law.  Their one aim in life is to pass on to their children the vision of Ireland that they had and to retain what they believe are the traditional values of Irish family life. Of the many letters I received on this issue two remain uppermost in my mind. One was from a mother who pleaded on her bended knees to me to resist the Bill and vote against it.  I can picture the scene in the home of the second mother who wrote to me.  She had five young children around her and she indicated in her letter that her house was in a mess but yet she took time to write to me, and other Members, expressing her concern about the Bill.</P>
    <P>Irish parents may not have great wealth to bequeath to their children.  Their only treasures are the beliefs they genuinely hold in the goodness and wholesomeness of family life.  It is an enlightening experience for us to witness this spontaneous unorchestrated response from the parents of Ireland to what they perceive to be something that will be to the detriment of their children in the future.  I ask the Minister not to turn his back on the pleas of fathers and mothers.  He can be magnanimous and try to understand the genuine heartfelt fears of concerned parents, teachers, nurses, youth leaders and those involved in social work.  The Minister's political stature will be enhanced if he comes a little way down the road to meet those sincere wishes, to allay the anxiety of such people.  The Government, and the Minister, will not lose face but will be making a positive response to people whose sole interest is the moral and spiritual welfare of our youth.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister not to turn his back on the wealth of goodwill that exists <Col N="381" /> in our youth.  The essence of parliamentary democracy is to allow this and other Bills to be freely debated here and for the Minister, having listened carefully to the debate, to make prudent and wise amendments, where necessary, on Committee Stage.  In the course of his speech the Minister stated that 56 per cent of our people between the ages of 16 and 25 are losing confidence in the House.  I hope adults, and the parents I have mentioned, will not add to that list and think the House irrelevant or that the Minister has turned a deaf ear to their pleading.</P>
    <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to the suggested amendments I put to him yesterday.  Accompanied by three of my colleagues I met the Minister on three occasions yesterday.  Acceptance of such amendments would be an acknowledgement by him of the innate goodness of the Irish people and of the high standards we all desire in our youth. The Minister should not reject that openness, that plea for the family from the Church and others to join with the State in preserving what is good and noble in our unique way of life.</P>
    <P>I should now like to deal with my voting intentions.  I have given the matter more thought and time than I gave to any other previous political decision I have had to make.  I realise I am in a no win situation. No matter which way I vote there will be those who will find fault with me and accuse me of either political or moral cowardice.  I will have to live with that.  As a Deputy I have explored every available avenue open to me within the parliamentary party system to have some changes made to the Bill.  If I fail in my efforts I do not think blame can be levelled at me because at least I tried very hard.  Above all I have kept faith with myself and the electorate.  I trust I will be seen as a legislator aware of the deep issues involved and making an honest attempt to resolve them within my parliamentary party and the House.  It has been said that we are at a crossroads morally as far as the Bill is concerned.  I was at the crossroads politically in trying to decide whether I should bow out of politics or remain within.  On the advice of some <Col N="382" /> friends who stand a little further aloof from this issue and on whose judgment I rely heavily.  I have decided to remain in politics and strive to uphold the standards I have set for myself.  I have decided to support the Bill at all its Stages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief in my contribution because many Members are anxious to contribute.  As far as I am aware the Fine Gael-Labour joint Programme for Government proposed to preserve and expand our health services. However, in the area served by the Midland Health Board there has been a £2 million cutback.  That shortfall is having an adverse effect on clinics and other important services.  I was a Member when the other controversial Bills were introduced but on those occasions I was not approached by any member of the hierarchy or any clergyman.  I was not approached by those people on the issue before the House.  I was free to decide on the issues.  I respect the views of those who are in favour of the Bill, but it must be remembered that we have a right to put forward our views.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section I have grave reservations about makes contraceptives available to those over 18.  We are all aware that alcohol is restricted to those over 18, but what has happened in regard to that?  If the Bill is passed these devices will be available to all in chemist shops and other centres.  Are people prepared to accept such a massive change?  In my constituency the people are telling me that they are not looking for legislation of this type but the right to work, to have a job or be able to hold on to the one they have. They say that Members from all parties have a duty to tackle the grave unemployment position and not be wasting the time of Parliament on a matter that is not required.  That is the view of the majority of those I have spoken to, particularly the young people.  What are we doing to provide work for the young people?  What hope have they for the future?  Those are the questions they are posing.  They are not posing questions about this Bill.  In all my years here nobody has ever asked when we were going to legislate in this <Col N="383" /> manner.  I had some reservations when we introduced the 1979 Act.  I should make it clear that it was after the ruling of the Supreme Court only that eventually the leader of our party, the then Minister for Health, brought that Bill into this House.  It may have had its defects, but so have many Bills that have been passed through this House.  At a meeting of the Midland Health Board at the end of last year eminent medical people and others through a unanimous vote and with the support of that health board, were of the opinion that there was no need for any change in this legislation at this time.</P>
    <P>I might say that the attacks levelled at the clergy and hierarchy in regard to this Bill have been unwarranted.  Such people were only preaching the moral teachings of the Catholic Church in this respect.  I do not want to go too deeply into that area.  I should stress that, in all the years I have been a Member of this House not once have the hierarchy requested or written to me asking that I oppose any legislation in this House and, above all, in regard to this Bill.</P>
    <P>The manner in which the Minister for Health is implementing the provisions of the Health Act would lead one to suppose that everything in the garden was rosy.  He appears to be saying that there are no cutbacks being effected anywhere, that everything is running very smoothly while all these eminent medical people in our hospitals are complaining, stating that patients' health is being threatened and that, taking account of the major cutbacks being made, we shall have £2 million only of a cutback in the Midland Health Board whereas in other health board areas such cutbacks may amount to £8 million and £10 million.  These are the areas into which the Minister should be putting all the resources at his disposal rather than on a Bill of this nature which our people are not seeking.</P>
    <P>With due respects to them it is my opinion that journalists here appear to be engaging in a campaign to the effect that the electorate are demanding legislation <Col N="384" /> of this nature and they are engaging in that campaign in a subtle, futile way.  I have no doubt but that if this issue were put to the test of a referendum in the morning it would not be passed.  Some members of the media were very quick to point out that the ratio between those for and against was 50:50.  But that did not include another 16 per cent who were against.</P>
    <P>In summary, this Bill is not needed at present.  The legislation obtaining prohibited the sale of contraceptives to people of a very young age.  My one fear &mdash; and nobody has denied this &mdash; is that one can enact all the rules and regulations one likes, it is easy to pass a Bill in these Houses, but when it comes to the implementation of those provisions one must ask: is one capable of implementing them or, better still, will they be implemented? If this Bill is passed it will mean the initiation of a new type of family planning applicable to everyone.  Let us take the case of a person over age 18.  Younger boys and girls of 13 and 14 may say to those older companions: &ldquo;Go in and buy contraceptives, we want them.&rdquo;  Can they not do so?  I saw a young girl of 13 years at a music festival down the country plastered drunk.  One might ask: &ldquo;Where did she get the alcohol?&rdquo;.  It was carted out to her, and she was in a bad way from its effects.  I hope I shall be proved to be wrong, but it is my belief that these contraceptives will be purchased by older people and distributed ad lib among the younger and very young members of society.  This is something about which I would have grave reservations.  Therefore I could not support such practice.</P>
    <P>It is my belief that this House should be dealing with the real economic problems obtaining &mdash; for instance, the right to a job, the right to hold a job and to provide employment.  Those are the main issues to which we as legislators should be devoting our attention.  Many people outside this House would contend that the introduction of this Bill constitutes diversionary tactics.  Is it any wonder that many people now hold politicians in very low esteem?  They do so because, in this instance, we are here debating an issue <Col N="385" /> that, as far as the electorate is concerned, they do not want to know about.  Rather do they want housing and work in order to provide food on their tables, they being the main issues of the day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy to welcome this Bill in all its sections and provisions. I shall deal first with my reasons for welcoming the least controversial sections, which are those governing access to contraceptives. There has been broad acceptance here among all who have spoken of the need for reform in this area. It was most unsatisfactory that there were large areas of the country where even married people did not have access to contraceptive advice and services without having to travel great distances and causing themselves great personal inconvenience. Contraceptive advice of the widest possible range, including advice in relation to the side effects of various contraceptives, the advisability of various types of health checks was available more easily to the middle classes of our society than was or is currently available to working class and rural people.  This is an unsatisfactory situation, and I welcome the extension of possible outlets to properly supervised distributors such as chemists, health centres and especially to maternity hospitals because it is there that, universally, women come into contact with advice in relation to family planning and how to look after their own health and plan a family in a responsible way.  On my one visit to such an institution there seemed to be a great inadequacy in this regard, and I welcome the commitment to ensure that maternity hospitals will be given the opportunity to involve themselves fully in family planning advice to women.  With their wealth of gynaecological and obstetrical advice, who could be better qualified to advise women to have regard for their health?</P>

    <P>The other element of the reform there is the removal of the need for prescriptions for non-medical contraceptives which was seen as farcical under the 1979 Act and has proven to be an irritant and a difficulty to the GPs who have been trying to make moral decisions in relation <Col N="386" /> to individuals.  It is unworkable and has been flouted on many occasions.  The removal of that section is a desirable reform.</P>
    <P>The area of greatest controversy is the right to contraception of those over 18 years of age without distinction as to whether they are married or single.  I speak primarily as a younger person, and reflect more the views of that age group than others who have expressed very different views to me.  I respect and understand those views, although I do not share them.  When a person of whatever age decides to have sex, which I consider is the first decision they are likely to make, they should then have access to contraceptives. If I take that to its logical conclusion there would be no age limit. However, on reflection and after discussions with the Parliamentary Party, I felt that there was value in putting the age at 18.  Those of us who speak in favour of the Bill suffer from the danger of being labelled as encouraging promiscuity and decadence.  I reject that charge and I refuse to be labelled in that way for speaking honestly about the situation as I see it.</P>
    <P>To put an age limit of 18 years indicates that the parties in Government feel that an element of maturity is essential in the expression of any kind of physical relationship.  The coincidence of the fact that we hope to raise the marriage age to 18 and to reduce the age of majority to 18 would make it a logical age.  I have no doubt that this will be changed because it will come under pressure from what I see as inevitable trends in the future; but for the moment, in the context of this reform and of the kind of society we wish to see, the age of 18 is a responsible one and it is an indication that legislators do not wish to encourage the view that children of 16 and 17 years of age are mature enough to engage in marriage, sexual activities or any other major adult commitments.</P>
    <P>Genuine fears have been expressed to me regarding the Bill from a large number of my constituents, including older members of my own family, that there will be a deterioration in society <Col N="387" /> and that immorality and promiscuity will follow the passing of the Bill.  I understand those fears, but I do not share them. I draw assurance in particular from an examination of the situation in Northern Ireland, which is a country with traditions and morals very similar to ours.  They have had free access to contraception and abortion for many decades and, instead of there being an overwhelming descent into moral decadence and decay, their standards are arguably higher than ours where we have had limited access to such things.</P>
    <P>By comparison with Northern Ireland our rate of illegitimacy compares unfavourably. If you look at the statistics of the number of Southern Irish girls going to England, giving an Irish address, to procure abortions, we also compare unfavourably with Northern Ireland.  It is also valid to look at the situation around the Border.  To people who have fears in relation to this Bill it would seem to be logical that the incidence of immorality, as it has been described &mdash; although I do not agree with that description &mdash; would be higher in the Border area.  But I am sure the Ceann Comhairle and others would say that quite the contrary is the case and what rules in those areas is not the availability of contraceptives but the moral standards and attitudes of the society in which people are brought up. That is the greatest reassurance one can give to parents.  The average young persons of 18 years of age with caring parents who are conscientious and look after them are replicas of their parents in terms of views on morality.</P>
    <P>This is a state which should not and does not last for very much longer as they move into maturity.  From the ages of 18 to 20 years many young people are still very much under the influence of their parents, although perhaps beginning to find out things for themselves and to make their own decisions.  In the last few years contraceptives have been freely available from family planning clinics and they did not exclude anyone on the basis of age.  However, their experience indicates that people under the age of 20 have <Col N="388" /> not been looking for contraceptives in any large numbers.  Therefore, I think we will find that the genuine fears outlined by many people will not be realised.</P>
    <P>I tried to look for other reassuring comparisons but, not having been in politics for long, I drew reassurance from Deputy O'Malley's reference to the debate on the mother and child scheme.  Extraordinary fears were expressed than in relation to the State's interference in parents' care of their children and in relation to giving support services to mothers before and after the birth of their children.  To look back on that now it seems ludicrous.  In light of experience today that view would be outdated and unsupported and the contrary would be the case.  There is extensive demand for supports for mothers and families.  It seems to be socially and economically desirable rather than an attack on families.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the fears that have been raised on this issue will be totally unrealised.  Young people are capable of making up their own minds and have already indicated the kind of decisions they will make in relation to how they will manage their own morality and sexuality in the future.  We should have confidence in them to do that.  There is no doubt but that the Church will be able to continue to teach as it wishes.  Parents will have the same power and impact on their children as they have in cases where there is a strong family relationship. There are many people for whom that is irrelevant because there are many young women who become pregnant at 14, 15, 16 and 17 years of age.  We have not made studies of this and so cannot make objective statements, but I believe these girls would come from families where there is an absence of that kind of care. For those young women the die has already been cast.  If the availability of contraceptives meant that one fewer young person became pregnant or there were a dozen fewer unwanted children it would be morally good rather than morally bad.</P>
    <P>Young people listening to the debate will be struck by the level of hypocrisy in some cases.  They would be a little <Col N="389" /> intimidated by the fear of being described, if they spoke out, as promiscuous and permissive.  They would also be struck by the double thinking.  In the past year we have had a series of shocking cases involving young women who became pregnant &mdash; for example, the Granard case and the Kerry babies case.  In light of the hysteria over this Bill and the suggestion of accepting the reality of sexuality and sexual activity for married or single people it is hard to understand how it can be accepted that children dying at full term is less morally disturbing and gives less cause for moral hysteria.  There is obvious double thinking there.  I was very disturbed when reading reports of the Kerry babies case to see that the obstetrician in the hospital involved indicated in his evidence&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It was a comment that the case of mothers delivering on their own and infant deaths occurring as a result was not unusual.  That is a disturbing fact.  That these things can happen and not cause an upsurge of public concern and morality underlines young people's cynicism of politicians.  I am confident that by the Government attempting to face up to this issue, with all the difficulties and moral pressures, and reform the legislation will show young people that we are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I share other Deputies' views that this is not the primary concern of young people nor of people aged 30 and 40 years.  They are all more concerned with unemployment and day-to-day living. This issue is important is so far as it is a question of who rules the country, whether the Parliament rules the country, or if issues are to be decided by outside lobbies and pressure groups.  As <Col N="390" /> the days have gone by this has become the issue.  While many people do not become excited about the issue of contraceptives, because they are largely available to those who want them, they become excited about what the outcome of the decision will be tonight in relation to whether or not the Government are running the country.  Even people who disagree about the reforms we are bringing in consider it important that that issue be resolved and that the Government be allowed to make their laws.</P>
    <P>In dealing with hypocrisy there is nothing more unsavoury than the arrival of Deputy O'Connell into Fianna Fáil yesterday.  He is on record as being totally in favour of the further liberalisation of family planning and contraception.  He voted for reforms in this area and expressed dissatisfaction that the reforms did not go further.  There have been rumours about him joining Fianna Fáil for some time.  As recently as a week ago he expressed the views we have come to know.  Yet in the past day through some sleight of hand he has ended up in Fianna Fáil safely behind the Whip and will march in behind it.  That kind of behaviour will be seen through by everyone and it does not reflect well on the party or the individual.</P>
    <P>It is too early to say but it would seem reasonable to expect, in the light of commitments made by Deputies, that this Bill will be passed.  I welcome its passing in that another attempted stroke has not come off.  We can all be glad of that for the quality of Irish political life.</P>
    <P>This is not important legislation in itself, and I should have liked to see the ground tested on other issues such as illegitimacy, adoption and the Children Bill.  The passage of this Bill may set markers for other legislation.  It is important as part of a process of reforms.</P>
    <P>I will quote from a letter I received from a young person in a working class section of my constituency:</P>
    <P>In my opinion this is a very important matter for young people.  It is about time this country moved forward and <Col N="391" /> began to act as if it was in the 20th century and not the 17th. </P>
    <P>I have asked in my constituency for the views of people and I have tested their reaction to the Bill.  There is not a great deal of passion about it except from those who fear it, and I have dealt with their fears already.  However, there is a feeling of incredulity that we should be engaged in a debate of this nature which at times is turning its back on reality.  In the opinion polls it is indicated that more than 66 per cent accept that contraceptives should be available for married people.  Let us consider that point.  According to the teaching of the Catholic Church contraception for married people is wrong.  For young people there is an element of double-think here.  How is it all right for married people to go against the teaching of the Church when it cannot be considered for young people?</P>
    <P>I agree with those who say the State should not legislate for private morality. Deputy O'Malley this morning spoke about what might happen in Iran if a person broke the state laws that reflect the religion of that country.  By supporting such an approach to legislation here, are we condoning those forms of legislation in other countries that allow very severe penalties to be imposed on those who break the moral law?  There is a similar situation in Saudi Arabia.  In a Mormon state blood transfusions are against the religion of the people.  Let us consider the implications that could have. It is dangerous to have the State legislation reflect the views of one religion.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Catholic Church and its teaching on this matter, I have not found it easy to disagree publicly to some extent with the church in which I was brought up.  I have not found it easy to disagree with senior members of society for whom I have great respect and who tried to educate me in a particular direction.  However, like others, I have to be honest and consider where I am at and where I believe many young people are at.  Their views on morality have changed a little.  By accepting that change <Col N="392" /> and the reality of physical sexuality as part of their growing experience they are not losing a sense of value for sexuality and of its intense privateness and importance. They are not involved in promiscuity. These young people can be trusted to have a greater openness to sexuality in the next decade while retaining the highest standards of morality.</P>
    <P>The Catholic Church should talk openly to young people about those issues.  In its history the Church has moved on matters of morals and faith. To refuse even to discuss or to consider change is closing one's eyes to the history of that Church and to the movement at the time of Vatican II, and the atmosphere of Vatican II is closer to 20th century society in Ireland.  I should like the Church to enter into debate with young people at that level rather than at the level of proscription which will only alienate and serve to create greater distance between the Church and its flock.</P>
    <P>I am happy to welcome the Bill and I hope it will go through the House. Almost 50 per cent of the population wants this legislation as it stands and almost 50 per cent will be unhappy.  However, that should not exclude the 50 per cent who would like to see those changes. This legislation is simply allowing access to contraceptives and there is no obligation on anyone to use them.  Therefore, one can legislate for many people without interfering with the rights and entitlements of others to live according to their own standards of morality.  I have respect for their views but I think this legislation if it is passed will allow them an opportunity to practice their own morality as they wish.</P>
    <P>The young people can be trusted to act responsibly, to maintain and to continue to live according to the moral standards that have made us different from Britain or America.  Many parents and the senior members of society may find it difficult to accept changes that they are unable to reconcile with the standards that obtained during their youth and early married years.  The reaction I am getting from my constituency is that people <Col N="393" /> should be allowed to conduct their private lives in a private way and that the State should interfere to the minimum extent.  I am happy this legislation will intrude minimally on the right of people to live according to their own moral standards. On the other hand, it will allow people who wish to use contraceptives to have access to family planning advice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the question: what is the main purpose of the Bill?  Is it for the sole purpose of distracting the attention of the people from the issues of the moment?  Is this Bill a way of taking our minds off the real issues, namely, the failed economic policies of the Government and their failure to do anything about them?  Young people are calling on us to legislate on policies that will lead to job creation.</P>
      <P>It was an abuse of language to call this a Family Planning Bill since, in my understanding, a family involves marriage. The main aim of the Bill seems to be to provide contraceptives for the unmarried.  The Bill is being presented to the public as a minor adjustment to the Family Planning Act, 1979.  This is simply not so.  This Bill before the House this week is a radical departure from any legislation previously proposed in this country.  The sale of contraceptives to young people in their teenage years has never before been advocated by responsible people here.  The pressure for this very dangerous change seems to come from the International Planned Parenthood Federation to which the Irish Family Planning Association are affiliated. Obviously, while their professed contention is that we are allegedly backward, such organisations have a great deal to gain by extending the law so that they can sell their wares in a completely new market.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has spoken about large fines and the rigid enforcement of the law proposed under this new Bill, but can we trust the Minister to see that the law is enforced?  Did he show contempt for the law when he opened a family planning clinic in his capacity as Minister for Health in a Coalition Government?  Was <Col N="394" /> he not supported in the act of contempt by Deputy FitzGerald as Taoiseach? How do we know that what Mr. Desmond now proposes under the Bill is not a watered down version of what he would really like for the people?  How do we know that the fears which so many people, especially parents, now hold will not be realised?  Should this measure be passed then we can be certain that in the future dispensing machines will be seen in disco halls and in public toilets as is the fashion in other countries.  In allowing the free availability of contraceptives for all over 18 years of age Mr. Desmond is going a long way towards making this a reality.  Mr. Desmond and his colleagues across the House&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>Sorry, Deputy Desmond, Minister for Health, and his colleagues across the House have thrown insults at members of the Church, the hierarchy in particular, over the concern they have expressed on behalf of their flock.  The bishops and clergy are doing no more than their duty.  They are concerned for the wellbeing of the people and for the moral fibre of this nation and generations of Irish boys and girls yet to be born.  The Members of this House have been elected by the people, they are of the people and they should be acting on behalf of the people.  They should know that the common good of these people should be served.  That good is not being served by this Bill.  The Bill is a rejection of the will of the majority of the Irish people, a will which was reflected in the polls conducted in the past few weeks.  The poll conducted among the members of the ICA gives a much clearer indication than any other poll of the opinion of the Irish people and the people of rural Ireland in particular.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard statistics bandied about here in the last few weeks about the level of condom importation.  Quite an amount of them must have been placed in intervention awaiting the green light from the Minister for Health.  Many people, and I am one of them, have no doubt that this <Col N="395" /> is a totally inflated picture which has been blown up to support the view of the Minister for Health that there is need for a change at this time.  The voices which have been calling for a change in the law relating to contraception are the voices of the members of the Irish Family Planning Association of which the Minister for Health is an accredited member, and also of other minority groups who do not represent the general consensus of the views of the Irish people.</P>
    <P>The change proposed by the Minister for Health is pandering to the minority voice which keeps telling us that we are a backward little country which needs to be brought up to date.  If it is backward to keep contraceptives out of the hands of teenage children, then let us keep Ireland backward.  It is nonsense for the Minister or any other member of the Coalition Government to say that an age limit of 18 years can or will be observed.  Even if there is a will to observe it on the Government side, we know that this cannot happen.  It is not for contraception that our young people are crying out at this time.  It is for sound moral leadership and for an opportunity to fulfil their hopes and realise their ideas in the economic and social life of this nation.  It is a poor form of moral leadership which tells our youth that a large number of mature politicians now believe that sexual intercourse before marriage is really socially acceptable; but, whether we like it or not, this must be the logical consequence of removing a restriction in the law which exists up to now.  Is this the best that the Government can offer the youth of Ireland in this International Youth Year? If this Bill before the House is passed into law we will suffer the curse of generations who have gone before us and generations yet to be born.</P>
    <P>I urge this House to reject this Bill so that we as legislators can live with a clear conscience.  There is no doubt that many more serious problems face us.  Finally, my fervent hope is that this Bill will never pass into law and that our country will be saved the disastrous consequences of such irresponsible legislation.</P>
    <Col N="396" />
    <Speaker pid="JohnFConlon" hpid="Mr. Conlon Mr. Conlon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Conlan</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1979 Act, which this Bill proposes to amend, arose out of and 1973 Supreme Court judgment that married couples had a constitutional right to reasonable access to contraceptives.  It is probable that, due to the limited outlets in the number of pharmaceutical chemists prepared to stock or sell contraceptives, reasonable access was not available to married couples in all areas especially in more remote areas.  Therefore, I accept that it could be put forward that the number of outlets to comply with the Supreme Court ruling were not available. The 1979 Act went somewhat further than married couples, since bona fide family planning was not defined in the Act and under section 5 of that Act any person of any age, married or single, could import contraceptives as part of his or her personal luggage if he or she could indicate that they were for his or her personal use.  Nowhere in the Fianna Fáil Act is marriage or marital status mentioned.</P>
      <P>I find it difficult to associate family planning with single people.  I have reservations about the proposal in this Bill to make non-medical contraceptives more fully available to people who might be single.  I have found no demand for this course of action.  Since this Bill has been mooted, practically all the approaches made to me have been in the opposite direction.  It has been suggested that the liberalising of the law in this respect and the free use of contraceptives can lead to increased venereal disease, unwanted pregnancies and abortions.  Deputy Griffin in the course of his speech read out a letter which we received from a number of eminent obstetricians and gynaecologists who expressed those fears.  I hope that, even if this Bill is passed, our young people will be wise enough to realise these dangers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent a very big constituency, mixed in terms of age and of religious persuasion, but I have not found any demand for this legislation.  People advocating the legislation may put forward the argument that because of the nature of the matter constituents are reluctant to <Col N="397" /> stress to politicians their demand for contraceptives. From my 35 years' experience in public life I have never found the people of my constituency backward in coming forward to demand anything they might require.  They would not have the slightest hesitation in making their demands known.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes to extend the outlets for both medical and non-medical contraceptives to medical practitioners, employees of health boards and hospitals and family planning clinics.  In relation to employees of health boards and hospitals particularly, I should like the Minister to tell me if there are objections from such people about their being involved in supplying non-medical contraceptives to single people.  If they fail to comply with the legislation in that respect will there be any danger of their losing their jobs? One would hope that would not be the case.  I should like to know, too, what safeguards the Minister has in mind to ensure that the law is observed strictly so that people under 18 will not be supplied with contraceptives.  Publicans, for instance, who are anxious to observe the law, have great difficulty in doing so in respect of the sale of intoxicating liquor to people under 18.</P>
    <P>I have never had occasion to visit a family planning clinic but I understand that contraceptives are made available there by way of a slot machine, which is in contravention of the existing legislation. The operation is similar to inserting a coin in a vending machine in order to obtain a packet of chewing gum or cigarettes. What is worse is that, I understand, some of these clinics are acting as referral agencies for abortion clinics in Britain.  Are such people, people who have no qualms about breaking the law, to be associated with ensuring that only those over 18 are supplied with contraceptives? It seems that little or no attempt is being made to enforce the 1979 Act.  I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that the amending legislation will be enforced rigorously.</P>
    <P>My fear in relation to the legislation is that, though these devices may be available freely in certain parts of the country, <Col N="398" /> the provision for their availability by way of legislation will leave people inclined to regard them as socially acceptable.  Some have suggested that this kind of liberal legislation will help to bring about the unification of our country much sooner than might otherwise be the case.  As an Ulsterman I do not subscribe totally to that view.  The good six county Protestants, whether they be members of the Church of Ireland, the Presbyterians, Methodists or any other denomination, have very high moral values.  A much greater enticement to them so far as the unification of the country is concerned would be an improvement in economic conditions here.</P>
    <P>If the Bill were defeated it could be used, would be used, by extreme Unionists to point the finger at us and to accuse us of being subject to directions of the Catholic Hierarchy.  I do not think that the ordinary Protestant population of Northern Ireland will become part of a united Ireland any sooner by reason of the availability of this legislation.  In part of my diocese of Clogher contraceptives are freely available; but I do not have any evidence that the population there, regardless of denomination, are depraved or debauched.  Unfortunately there is political violence there and that is causing much suffering and bloodshed.</P>
    <P>I am glad that section 2 of the 1979 Act is being retained.  That is the section which empowers the Minister to provide a comprehensive natural family planning service.  I urge the Minister to give every encouragement to bodies who are engaged in research and development into those natural methods.</P>
    <P>My main reservation is that the making available more easily of these devices will result in their use being more readily acceptable by young single people.  However, I trust that, regardless of this legislation, young people's good sense would dictate that they maintain their high standards and values.  It would ease my concern if I could be assured by the Minister that the law will be enforced.  I should like him to tell me how people over 18 might be prevented from obtaining these <Col N="399" /> devices from recognised outlets and selling them to younger people.  The various outlets should be compelled to keep a register of those to whom they sell contraceptives and the quantities supplied, so that if anyone were found to be purchasing extraordinary quantities there could be an investigation into whether he was re-selling them.  We might make it mandatory also that those seeking contraceptives would have to sign for them just as they would sign for any medicines which come under the poisons regulations.</P>
    <P>In addition, people nominated to distribute contraceptives should be in a position to advise users of the dangers involved.  For instance, the fact that at least 10 per cent of these devices prove to be ineffective should be made known to potential users.</P>
    <P>As I have said, I have been in public life for almost 35 years.  I have served my party at local authority level and, for the past 20 years, as a Member of the Oireachtas.  During all of these years I have been a loyal member of my party. It would be only after the most serious thought that I would consider breaking the party pledge.  Down through the years I have tried to the best of my ability to represent the people who have returned me time and again to this House.  Their returning me at the various elections must be an indication that they are reasonably pleased with the services I render on their behalf.  I have indicated to my colleagues in the Parliamentary Party that I have reservations about the Bill and that I consider that a matter such as this warrants a free vote of the House. However, when no such agreement can be had across the Floor a proper free vote is not possible.  A free vote would give a better indication of the views of Members on matters such as this.  In that way, too, a better consensus could be arrived at.  I accept totally the view that churchmen of all denominations have a right and a duty to point out to their respective flocks what the Churches consider morally to be right or to be wrong.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested by the media at the weekend that my motivation in <Col N="400" /> questioning the measure arises from hostility on my part towards the Minister as a result of his proposal to remove the in-patient maternity service from Monaghan Hospital.  There is no hostility on my part towards the Minister.  Neither have I hostility towards any other Member of this House, but I have disagreed with the Minister in respect of the Monaghan Hospital.  I must make it clear that I have totally separated the two issues.</P>
    <P>Over the past two weeks I have given these proposals long and serious thought. I have considered fully all the representations and advice offered to me from many sources.  As I have already said, I entirely accept that churchmen are fully entitled to put forward the moral teaching or beliefs of their respective Churches.  I also must acknowledge that people over 18 years of age are entitled to vote in elections and to elect a Government. From 1 March they will be allowed to own their own property and so forth. I believe that they should, accordingly, be mature enough to distinguish between what is right and what is wrong.  This is an indication of my thinking at this time on this Bill.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear from the Minister that if the Bill is passed the law will be enforced with the utmost rigour and that anyone contravening it will be dealt with accordingly.  I would like also to add my voice to that of Deputy Griffin in appealing to the Minister if possible for the measure to be tightened up as regards the availability to single people.  We had lengthy discussions yesterday evening and put some proposals to him.  They might not be workable, but I would ask the Minister to give further consideration to this matter of tightening up the availability to single people.</P>
    <P>I have been a loyal member of my party over the years.  Having considered the matter at length, I want to make it clear to the House that I intend supporting this Bill at all Stages.</P>

      <P>I was sent here to this House to reflect the views of my constituents and to represent them here.  The title &ldquo;Teachta Dála&rdquo; means that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By coincidence, I have represented Kildare for 16 years, the same period as the Minister mentioned.  I am privileged to have two bishops among my constituents &mdash; the Catholic Coadjutor Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin and the Church of Ireland Bishop of Kildare and Meath. I have not had any discussions with either of these gentlemen, although I am on friendly terms with both.  I have not found it necessary to seek their advice, or to decide what my stance should be.  However, I respect the right of anybody, whether clerical or lay, to make his or her feelings public on this or any proposed legislation.  They also have the right, if <Col N="402" /> they wish, to contact me and let me know their feelings.</P>
    <P>There seems a resentment among certain Members of this House when some people air their views, particularly when these views are contrary to their own. There is obvious delight, too, when their views are shared by certain Members. Nevertheless, everybody in this country has the right to free speech and it would be wrong of us to deny them that.</P>
    <P>May I say that I have had numerous letters from constituents and others all over the country in this connection since the Bill was first mooted?  I did not detect any degree of demand for the changes before the media and the Minister forecast what was coming, but there has been a definite reaction to the published proposals. Ninety per cent, at least, have been in opposition to them.  These letters and messages have not come from craw-thumping, sanctimonious persons, but generally concerned people.  I shall quote from one such letter which is a fair reflection of the attitude of the people in my constituency:</P>
    <P>Dear Paddy,</P>
    <P>I know without doubt that you will be voting against Barry Desmond's proposals to change the law on contraception. Nevertheless, I wish to protest in the strongest possible terms against same proposals.</P>
    <P>We have six youngsters and God knows it is hard enough to feed and clothe them nowadays, what with the cost of living, outrageous taxes and no jobs, without this added worry.  Since contraceptives are available at present to married couples &mdash; and anyone else it seems &mdash; I can only assume that the sole purpose of the amendment is to make it as easy as possible for kids to indulge in irresponsible premarital sexual activities.</P>
    <P>At the first opportunity, I wonder would you ask Mr. Desmond how he proposes to confine the sale of contraceptives to 18 year olds?  Will there be someone checking birth certs in chemist shops and will there be someone else to follow the same 18 year olds to <Col N="403" /> the street corners to see that the goods are not passed on and sold at a profit to 15, 16 and 17 year olds?  The mind boggles at the outcome.  We as a nation are now saying to the kids &ldquo;We don't mind what you do now, or how promiscuous you become, as long as you don't get pregnant&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It is the greatest sweeping under the mat exercise of all times. </P>
    <P>I find myself in the unusual position of being the only Deputy representing Kildare who is completely opposed to this Bill.  I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that it is wrong.  I mix with the people in my constituency and, as far as I can gather, they do not want the existing law changed.  I note that one Deputy who represents Kildare has felt so strongly about this Bill that he has announced that if the Bill is defeated he will not stand again for election.  I, too, am prepared to stake my future in politics on the Bill. I am quite prepared to go before the electorate in Kildare and say that I opposed the Bill.  I am prepared to let them judge me on that.  I am confident that I represent their views here today.</P>
    <P>I may find myself at variance with the views expressed in <i>The Irish Times</i> in their results of the opinion polls.  I may not reflect the views of the electorate of Dún Laoghaire whom Minister Desmond represents, but I believe that I know what the Lilywhites want, anyhow.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to these amendments being necessary to provide a comprehensive family planning service. That is a misuse of the word &ldquo;family&rdquo;. The previous Bill which it is proposed to amend did refer to a family situation. These proposals do away with the family and go outside the family to provide contraceptives for anyone over 18 years of age.  Health cuts have been remarked about here.  The lady in Kildare town who was expecting to be called to a Dublin hospital this month for treatment and a possible operation for a kidney complaint got word from the hospital authorities on 14 February, St. Valentine's Day, the same day the Minister introduced his Bill, <Col N="404" /> that the ward in that hospital was closed because of cut-backs in the Minister's Department and that her treatment had to be postponed.  I know where that lady's priorities would be.  She would ask the Minister to do his job and look after the people's health and cut the cackle about contraceptives.</P>
    <P>It is hypocrisy for the Minister to refer to this as a Family Planning Bill.  They say what the evil men do lives after them and that the good is oft interred with their bones.  However, in Ireland, anyhow, once a person has passed away people are charitable and many a dear departed had been referred to as a good family man.  Is it possible that the Minister will be remembered as a good family planning man?</P>
    <P>I look upon the family as the foundation of a country.  Even the articles of the European Convention on Human Rights referred to the right to life, the right to respect for private and family life, home, and correspondence, the right to marry and found a family.  As a Member of the Dáil I have a duty to protect the family. I believe I have a duty to encourage them to be good rather than take a decision like this which will encourage them to be bad.  I do not want to see a free-for-all develop.</P>
    <P>The Minister sees &ldquo;the increase in extra marital sexual activity&rdquo; as a reason for throwing in the towel.  I do not agree. Is the measure for the good of the country? The answer is so obvious that one must vote against these proposals.  Perhaps some immature teenagers would disagree now, but if one could turn the clock forward a few years to when they are parents their attitude would be much more mature and responsible.  How many Members of this House are grateful for the parental control which their parents exercised when they were teenagers but which they resented then?  Future generations will not thank the present Minister if his ideas become law.  The Minister will be giving official sanction to a code of behaviour that will not lead to a better country.  The Minister said that he felt it was degrading for a couple to have to go to a doctor to discuss contraception.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="405" /> Our spokesman, Deputy Dr. Rory O'Hanlon, explained that, while this necessity for a prescription was a once off exercise, it was medically desirable for any couple to have medical advice in these matters from a competent qualified person, allowing them to choose the method best suited to themselves.  This situation was acceptable when the Bill was passed and it is still acceptable to the vast majority of people.  When the Minister quoted from the Irish Marketing Survey he neglected to tell us, with regard to information on family planning, the observation was made that almost half of those interviewed in the survey felt that there was insufficient information available to the general public in relation to family planning, that only four out of every ten adults claimed to know a good deal about all or most methods of family planning and that by contrast over one fifth of all adults and disturbingly higher proportions of single adults claimed to know very little about any forms of family planning.  Further on it says that doctors were seen by the public to be the most reliable source of information of family planning.</P>
    <P>Before making contraceptives available the Minister should ensure that the people are well informed on these matters. To make the contraceptives available in advance of the dissemination of this information can only be likened to someone who would leave loaded guns in the hands of children.</P>
    <P>During his speech the Minister referred to a drop in the birth rate and accepted that this was because of the use of contraceptives.  The Minister apparently dismissed the part played by the increased awareness in the use of natural methods of family planning as being an element to be considered at all.  Further on in his speech the Minister said that he will yield to none of his desire to uphold the true moral values of a caring society. The Minister's actions in this Bill do not bear out those nice words.  Chesterton once said &ldquo;It is not that Christianity has been tried and found wanting; it is that it has been found difficult and left untried.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> The Minister decided that it was too difficult when be brought in this Bill.</P>
    <P>There has been a hysterical reaction by many Deputies to the bishops taking part in this debate.  I cannot understand this reaction to a group of people who honestly feel that it is their duty to express an opinion for the good of their flock. They represent an organisation that has stood the test of time for nearly 2,000 years, which puts the Minister's and my 16 years in the Dáil into proper perspective. Nobody knows better than they about pressures, politics and persecution. How is it that the farmers can speak out on matters that concern them, and sometimes outline unusual courses of action, that tenants' associations can take a certain stance and threaten politicians that they will monitor their actions and advise their members accordingly at election time, and trade unionists can march and even advise their members to picket politicians' clinics and make them inoperable, and we hardly hear a murmur about all these activities?  Why is there such resentment when a clergyman points out the dangerous consequences of this legislation? Religious people sometimes take vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Obviously many politicians here would like them to take vows of silence as well.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his speech said that in these circumstances the Government and the Oireachtas had a clear moral duty in the interests of the common good to intervene.  The common good was quoted on 14 February in the Minister's speech in the amendment to the Offences against the State Act.  The common good took second place when the Minister for Health brought in this amendment which is a much more insidious offence against the State.  This is a bad Bill which will not do any good.  It is as simple as that.</P>
    <P>I have not got a satisfactory explanation as to how the provision to confine contraceptives to 18 year old people and over is to be implemented.  The Minister has had several requests from his own side for such an explanation.  The Minister owes it to the House and to the people to explain it.  The Minister claims that he knows the wishes of the Irish people and <Col N="407" /> he quoted figures and percentages to prove it.  Apparently the Minister did not even know the minds of his own party, although it is easy enough to count them and it will be easier to count them in the future.  The Minister concluded his speech by saying that the Coalition are not prepared to inflict unnecessary constraints that will result in hardship and misery but I can foresee that the passage of this Bill will mean added hardship and misery for future generations.  It will be a tragedy for our country if the Government get their way on this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill has raised conflict and confrontation throughout the country.  Statements have been made grossly overstating the position and, instead of being helpful, they have raised the temperature of this controversy.  This Bill makes a realistic effort to try to control the sale of contraceptive devices.  The present law has proved to be unworkable. At present a person of any age can purchase contraceptives.  This Bill will ensure that a person must be aged at least 18 years to purchase contraceptives.  The purchase of contraceptives will be only through strictly regulated outlets.  The main outlets are pharmaceutical chemists, dispensing chemists, registered medical practitioners or an employee of the health board.  The penalties for a breach of these regulations are strictly laid down.  A person guilty of a first offence faces a fine of up to £500 or, at the discretion of the courts, six months in prison, or both a fine and imprisonment. The person guilty of a second offence shall be liable on conviction to a fine of £5,000 and or 12 months in prison.  Many people have said that there is a similar regulation in regard to drink but there is a vast difference.  Section 10 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1924, the relevant section states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Every licence holder who shall knowingly supply or who shall allow any person to supply any description of intoxicating liquor to a person under the age of 18 years for consumption by <Col N="408" /> that person on the premises ... shall be guilty of an offence....and shall be liable...on a first offence to a fine of £5 and...on any subsequent offence to a penalty not exceeding £10. </P>
    <P>There is a vast difference because the word &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; is omitted from the Bill and the vendor, whether he is a doctor, a chemist, or a health board official, has an obligation to ensure that the purchaser has reached his or her majority.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any of the people referred to risking those fines, a term of imprisonment, or their professional reputation by breaching that provision.  Not having an age limit was a serious omission in the 1979 Act.  I can give another example of another serious omission.  It is in regard to the purchase of wine.  Wine can be purchased by a person of any age, even a 12 or 14 year old.  That person can buy up to two gallons of wine in a supermarket where there is a wine licence. Some of those omissions should be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has given an assurance and commitment to the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party that the provisions in the Bill will be enforced.  The Director of Public Prosecutions, an independent person who takes his duty seriously, will, I am certain, ensure that the provisions are enforced.  One aspect of the debate that has saddened me is the serious reflection and insult on the youth of the country. The allegation being made is that on the passing of the Bill our youth will suddenly lower their moral standards. The day we have to rely on civil law to maintain moral standards will be a very serious one for all of us.  There is only one way to maintain moral standards in society and that is through family love in the home and Christian love in the church.  Any young person who got a proper family upbringing will not suddenly lose his or her self-respect and dignity. The vast majority of our young people are kind, considerate and sensible people with high moral standards which they will retain because of their intelligence and educational background.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="409" /> However, if some wish to delude themselves and close their eyes to what is happening about them, then nothing I or any other Member will say will make them change their views.  If people refuse to see what exists that does not change the reality of things.  In the last four years more than 30 million contraceptives were imported.  In one of the Irish Sunday newspapers last weekend, a publication that enjoys a circulation of 350,000, at least six advertisements were carried advertising the sale of contraceptives. Many magazines which circulate freely in our bookshops carry such advertisements. A person of any age can reply to those advertisements and be supplied with those devices and if that person so wishes he or she can distribute those devices to other people.  There is no mention of the limit that can be supplied.</P>
    <P>It is my view that a local doctor or chemist will be more careful in the sale of contraceptives at their surgeries or pharmacies.  That will help to curtail the circulation of them rather than increase their supply.  Contraceptives have been on sale in slot machines in universities in Dublin for a long number of years.  The law is in disrepute and is being flouted daily.  I am confident that our youth will respond positively if we trust them, if fathers and mothers talk to them and extend the same kindness, love and understanding that has always been found in the vast majority of Irish homes. Young people as they leave their teens will experience many problems.  Surely it is better that such young people should approach their parents for advice and that the difficulties they face are discussed in the home environment rather than in a city or town where they are working or studying and where they may not have anyone to turn to for advice.  The responsibility on parents that has always existed will still be there.</P>
    <P>The Primate of All-Ireland, Cardinal Tomás Ó Fiach, represents the Catholic community North and South and in the North contraceptives have always been freely available.  It is my view that Catholics in the North of all age groups are as moral and good living as those in the <Col N="410" /> Twenty-six counties.  I have no doubt that we will retain our standards here if the Bill is passed.</P>
    <P>The Irish Medical Union on 9 November 1983 passed two motions demanding that the existing legislation be amended as a matter of urgency.  The Minister has complied with that demand.  I would have preferred if a free vote had been allowed on this issue.  Members would not have had any excuse then and could not fall back on the Whip.  Fine Gael at all times permitted a free vote and it would have been fairer and better for all concerned if that was allowed tonight.  I should like to suggest to the Whips of all parties that in future on issues like this a free vote should be allowed.  I have no doubt that such issues will arise again and, irrespective where we sit in the House, we should avoid playing petty politics on issues that affect the lives of so many people.  Unfortunately, that is happening.  The political ball game is being played.  When the heat has gone out of this debate I hope the Whips, and the leaders of the parties, permit a free vote on such contentious issues.</P>
    <P>It took me quite some time to make up my mind on this issue.  I listened to those who made representations to me.  I received in the region of 1,000 letters on the issue.  A sizeable number of them were in favour of the Bill, but the majority were against.  Most of the correspondence was helpful and courteous and people offered me good advice.  However, I have great sympathy for some of the people who wrote letters to me and those who live with them.  It is part and parcel of democracy that people write letters but some of the letters I received do not do any good to any cause.  In voting for the legislation I believe I am doing what is right because I have great confidence in our people, particularly our youth.  I believe our young people will retain the standards they have always retained and in that respect I have full confidence in them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Much of what I should like to say has been said already and, in the interests of those who would like to <Col N="411" /> speak within the time constraints on us, I shall endeavour to be concise.</P>
      <P>Deputy Enright's contribution reflected in great measure the concern, anxiety and uncertainty of very many Fine Gael Deputies in relation to this Bill.  As he said, normally Fine Gael in regard to legislation such as this have adopted the free vote.  It is of grave significance that they felt they could not on this occasion.</P>
      <P>I listened with great interest and attention to the Minister's introductory remarks and have since studied them in great detail.  His views on this subject are well known.  I should say that I accept fully the sincerity of his views, but I am somewhat disappointed and saddened by his apparent suspicion &mdash; and here I apologise if I am misinterpreting him &mdash; about the views held by many who oppose this Bill, and which has been echoed by many speakers in favour of the Bill, that Fianna Fáil, are opposing solely for the purpose of political expediency, that our sincerity in the matter is suspect.  It ill behoves some Government Deputies to suggest that Fianna Fáil, and particularly its leader, have their feet &ldquo;on the necks of Irish women,&rdquo; as the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Nuala Fennell, suggested, and that they were only political opportunists, when the only legislation for legitimate family planning in this country was introduced by the present leader of Fianna Fáil as Minister for Health.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Such remarks do little to help Deputies respond to the Minister's request for a full, positive and healthy debate.  I should like now to refer briefly to the tremendous pressures brought on Deputies <i>visà-vis</i> this Bill and to express my utter abhorrence and condemnation of those who apply such abnormal pressures. They do little to promote an understanding of or sympathy for the cause any group purports to expound; rather they have the opposite effect.  The manner in which threats made against those for the Bill has been dramatised by the media, with large headlines in newspapers, photographs on television and interviews <Col N="412" /> on radio, is in direct contrast with the publicity given those who were threatened who would be opposing the measure. In many cases they received passing comments only, buried in the centre of an argument or as a passing reference in a news item.  Threats made against any Member of this House should receive the same attention.  The greatest threat has been made against Government Deputies who are known to oppose this Bill, the threat of non-ratification for future selection, meaning in many cases that their livelihood would be taken from them.  When Deputy Mary Flaherty talks about the admission of Deputy John O'Connell to Fianna Fáil and of his stance in relation to this Bill she should remember the threats made to her own colleagues.</P>
    <P>I might recall to the House an incident that happened to me on 31 October last and those people who received threats that their houses would be burned, threats by cranks which I abhor.  There was an attempt to burn a property of mine and it is somewhat significant that, four months later, I have still not heard from the local officer of the Garda as to what has happened.  There was very little publicity given that incident.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister emphasised that, as Minister, he must be guided by grave health considerations. I shall address my remarks mainly to this aspect.  For example, the Minister spoke of the increase of 4.1 per cent in the number of illegitimate births since 1971 and linked this to the non-availability of contraceptives.  The Minister appears to advance the somewhat logical argument that the free availability of contraceptives could have prevented this and would do so in the future on the passage of this Bill.</P>
    <P>I submit that this has not been the experience in other countries, and particularly not so in the case of our nearest neighbour Great Britain.  Statistics from the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys issued on 17 July 1984 show that in England and Wales in 1981 28.5 per cent of all conceptions occurred outside marriage, this in a country where the <Col N="413" /> Department of Health and Social Security <i>Handbook on Contraceptive Practices, 1984,</i> states that in Britain it can no longer be said that there are couples who are totally unaware of the availability of contraceptives nor is there a scarcity of centres to which they can go for advice, certainly in urban areas.  I submit that the figure of 28.5 per cent is revealing in the light of the fact that sex education is the norm in most schools in England and Wales and because free contraception is available under the National Health Service there.  Therefore our Minister's argument does not stand in the face of these facts and statistics.</P>
    <P>Also in the course of his remarks the Minister reminded us that the abortion option is chosen increasingly by those who become pregnant outside marriage and, by implication and suggestion, he tells us that to prevent this we should support the Bill.  The experience of England and Wales is that 40 per cent of those who became pregnant outside marriage in 1981 chose the abortion trail, again in a country where all types of contraceptive devices are known about and are freely available.  Why then are there so many unwanted pregnancies and abortions? Perhaps the answer lies in the link between the general availability of contraceptives and abortion which many family planning associations and experts on family planning acknowledge.</P>
    <P>In 1979 a member of the New Zealand Family Planning Association and of the Abortion Law Reform Association of New Zealand told their abortion supervisory committee that personally and from the viewpoint of both the Abortion Law Reform Association and the New Zealand Family Planning Association he thought this to be a legitimate interest &mdash; that there be an intermingling of contraception and abortion, that they could not be separated for various reasons.</P>
    <P>Doctor Judith Bury of the Edinburgh Brook Advisory Centres in <i>The Scotsman</i> of 29 September 1981 said there was overwhelming evidence that, contrary to what one might expect, the availability of contraception leads to an increase in the abortion rate.  The Ward River Press, <Col N="414" /> item 216, which was headed &ldquo;Abortion. The Irish Question&rdquo; stated that the answer to this question used to be to improve sex education, make contraception freely available and the need for abortions and the number of unwanted pregnancies would decline.  Now we know from the experience of other countries who have had the very best of sex education programmes, coupled with freely available contraceptives, that this does not reduce the need for abortions. If anything it increases it.</P>
    <P>I might quote now from a letter sent to the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> on 28 January 1984 &mdash; I have already quoted part of this letter &mdash; which is headed &ldquo;Misleading propaganda&rdquo; and which had this to say:</P>
    <P>Dr J D J Havard of the British Medical Association (Jan. 18) perpetuates the same misleading propaganda on the provision of contraceptives to under-aged children which is being spread around by various groups in the family planning industry.  He really should acquaint himself with some facts.  He emphasises the need of girls to be &ldquo;protected&rdquo; from pregnancy: the false promise of contraceptive protection to which the young have been subjected in widespread sex/contraceptive education.  What has been the result? According to the industry itself: &ldquo;There is overwhelming evidence that contrary to what you might expect the availability of contraception leads to an increase in the abortion rate&rdquo;. </P>
    <P>From 1969 to 1982 the number of pregnancies occurring in girls below the age of consent virtually doubled from 2,660 to 5,021 in 1982.  The majority of these pregnancies ended in abortion which is evident by the fact that between 1969 and 1982 the rate of abortion among those under the age of 16 trebled. Common sense dictates and the evidence shows that the exposure of teenagers to contraceptives has been a disastrous policy.  It has led to more sexual intercourse at a younger age with more contraceptive failures, promiscuity, cancer of the cervix, parental estrangement and the exploitation of girls.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> I fail to see how the passage of this Bill will advance the status of women and the signature on the letter to which I referred was that of a woman, Mrs. Valerie Riches.  There are other aspects of Irish law which could and should be changed which would add to the status of women.</P>
    <P>The letter also spoke of an increase in cases of cancer of the cervix.  In a letter to the <i>British Medical Journal,</i> volume 289, of 4 August 1984, Angela Mills of the London Family Planning Association stated that, despite the density of cervical screening, the estimated proportion of positive smears from the 25-35 age group more than doubled between 1973 and 1980 and that during this time the death rate from cervical cancer increased only in these younger women.  How comforting it must be for other women to be told that this only happened in the case of younger women.</P>
    <P>In the period 1971-1983 new cases of sexually transmitted diseases reported by clinics in England rose from 299,905 to 517,668 and is continuing to rise.  It appears that, despite contraception or because of the attitude to sexual behaviour caused by contraception, increased sexual activity has resulted in an increase in these diseases.  The need, which the Minister acknowledges, for education towards responsible sexual behaviour will not be met by the passing of this legislation. It will be discouraged by the perception which this legislation gives to people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly expressed shock that very young girls would obtain and use contraceptives and rightly said that this could constitute a criminal offence.  He obviously felt that the speaker who mentioned this has been trying scare tactics. He may be interested to hear that in Britain a very large number of young girls under 15 years of age were attending contraception outlets.  Will we follow that example?  If so, what will Deputy Skelly do?</P>
    <P>It is not possible to enforce the section of the Bill which deals with the age at which contraceptives may be obtained. There is no way that people under 18 years of age can be prevented from <Col N="416" /> obtaining contraceptives.  Already &mdash; this is of some importance in relation to the commitment which the Taoiseach, according to Deputy Enright, gave to the Fine Gael Party &mdash; some exponents of family planning in Ireland have stated that if a 15 or 16 year old comes to them looking for contraceptive devices they will supply them.</P>
    <P>At this stage someone should define what the word &ldquo;family&rdquo; means.  Is it the same definition as is contained in the Constitution?  Much as been written and spoken about our aim towards a pluralist society.  Frankly, if that means that very young teenagers can have free availability of contraceptives leading to unwanted pregnancies and abortion, many &mdash; not all of them Catholics &mdash; would abhor that concept.  My idea and definition of pluralism is completely different.</P>
    <P>Deputy Conlon spoke of the concern of Unionists.  They would have much more respect for us upholding our standards, which are Christian and not Catholic, than if we lowered them.  He spoke from his knowledge of people who are not hardline Unionists and he has a far greater knowledge of these people than I have.  Therefore, I accept his comments on this matter.  Much has been made of the comments of the Catholic bishops and their right to offer advice with regard to this Bill.  I fully accept their right to offer advice, which is similar to that of everyone else to offer advice.  There have been times when we cannot get into Leinster House because of the pickets placed outside and, as Deputy Power said, very little was written about the right of the Dáil or that democracy would fail if particular legislation did not pass.</P>
    <P>This Bill is contrary to the religious teachings not only of the Catholic Church but of the Protestant and Jewish religions, all of which frown on and are opposed to sex outside marriage.  The IPPA and IFPA will celebrate if this Bill is passed.  They will have succeeded, after many years of trying, in getting this legislation on the Statute Book and will be encouraged to try for further legislation. The Minister said that Fine Gael Deputies were in touch with their constituents.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="417" /> I am also in direct touch with my constituents and they do not see the need for this legislation and are not demanding it. Young people particularly are interested in and worried about the lack of employment opportunities.  Many have finished third level education but are still unemployed. Others are studying extremely hard for examinations but are at their wit's end because they know that in many cases the stark reality is that they will have no opportunities to obtain employment at home.  They are frustrated, of course, not because they cannot obtain contraceptives but because they have no jobs and they see very little likelihood of obtaining them.  Contrary to many suggestions, there is no real demand for this legislation.  It will not solve any of our problems; it will only create more.  These are some of the reasons why I am opposing this legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>In contributing to this debate I believe that there are some fundamental principles which need to be restated if we are to keep the issues in perspective.  Firstly, and above all else, we must remind ourselves that this is a democracy and that those of us who are charged with the running f the State are accountable only to those who elected us as legislators.  Naturally, as part of the the democratic system we must take account of all representations and viewpoints no matter how trenchantly expressed, except the form of imtimidation that has become evident on all sides of this debate over the last few weeks.  My family received threats last night that the house would be burned down if I voted against the Bill.  That kind of threat serves no purpose and I certainly would not be intimidated by it.  It makes it very difficult for legislators to debate any issue in the calm and rational manner which such a sensitive issue as this requires.  The freedom to lobby public representatives in the strongest possible manner on any issue is at once the cornerstone and glory of the democratic process which makes it the greatest of all the political systems. Having studied fully the representations <Col N="418" /> made it is then our solemn duty to legislate for the overall common good.</P>
      <P>In that context one of the most significant and welcome statements made in politics since the foundation of the State was that of Most Reverend Dr. Cathal Daly, Bishop of Down and Connor, when addressing the New Ireland Forum on behalf of the Catholic bishops on 9 February 1984.  He stated <i>inter alia:</i></P>
      <P>The Catholic Church totally rejects the concept of a confessional state.  We have not sought and we do not seek a Catholic State for a Catholic people. We believe that an alliance of Church and State is harmful for the Church and harmful for the State.</P>
      <P>We rejoiced when that ambiguous formula regarding the special position of the Catholic Church was struck out of the Constitution by the electorate of the Republic.  The Catholic Church has no power and seeks no power except the power of the Gospel it preaches and the consciences of those who freely accept that teaching. </P>
      <P>They go on to say:</P>
      <P>It is not for us to formulate proposals for constitutional change or to draft blueprints for a future Ireland.  That is the business of legislators. </P>
      <P>As a member of the New Ireland Forum I welcomed that profoundly clear and important statement.  It is against that background that I have formulated my own position on this Bill.  I am equally conscious of the fact that one of the greatest documents of Vatican II was that on religious freedom which has been proclaimed by Pope John Paul as one of the great documents to emerge from that council.  One of the major architects of that document, the Jesuit historian John Courtnay Murray, the American, remarked:</P>
      <P>A long standing ambiguity has finally been cleared up. </P>

      <P>I cannot give the exact source of the quotation.  I will get it later if it is necessary.  He stated:</P>
      <P>A long standing ambiguity has finally been cleared up.  The Church does not deal with the secular order in terms of a double-standard ... Freedom for the Church when Catholics are in a minority, privilege for the Church and intolerance for others when Catholics are in a majority. </P>
      <P>I have not and will not bow to pressure from any source, however much I respect the opinions of that source.  That leads me directly to my second principle, which can bear with repetition here today. Having asserted the fundamental right of legislators to legislate as they think proper it must be an inalienable right of any elected representative in any democracy to dissent from his party policy on grounds of conscience and, by extension, the right not to vote if he or she thinks fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that is the position in many other parliamentary democracies, certainly in Westminister.  Deputies have a free vote on all issues except those <Col N="420" /> relating to financial policy.  Surely, if we are mature enough to be free to make up our minds in this House without extra parliamentary pressures, that automatically implies we should be able to have a free vote on any issue other than finance and especially when we are dealing with matters that impinge on morals and conscience.</P>
    <P>It is safe to assume that in any political party in the world, even under totalitarian regimes let alone in democracies, there will be strong held differences of opinion, but it is only in a democracy that dissent based on conscience can be freely advanced.  We must never forget that. That is why when this issue was first raised at our Parliamentary Party I supported strongly the case for a free vote on an issue which runs counter to my own fundamental beliefs.  The reason this was refused was, I understand, that Fianna Fáil would not allow a free vote to their members.  This shows clearly the intention of Fianna Fáil to use this question simply to bring down the Government. This was the position outlined recently by Deputy Flynn in the &ldquo;Tuairisc&rdquo; programme on Radio Éireann, which I listened to last Thursday as I drove home to Limerick.  I hope I am quoting him, if not directly, in the sense in which he said: &ldquo;Dúirt sé dá mba rud é go gcaillfí an Bille seo go gcaillfeadh an Rialtas aon chreidiúnacht a bheadh acu agus go gcaithfeadh siad éirí as an Rialtas laistigh de thrí mhí nó mar sin&rdquo;.  The irony in the situation into which Fianna Fáil have got themselves is that if they were really serious about defeating this Bill <i>per se</i> they could have done so by allowing a free vote.  They would have achieved their objective had that been the position.</P>
    <P>They have admitted that there were inadequacies in the original Bill introduced by Deputy Haughey in 1979.  The reason they are advancing for opposing this measure is that there is no great demand for it.  Could I ask them if this Bill is passed and they are returned to power again as a Government, will they bring in amending legislation to restore the <i>status quo</i> as it is to-day?</P>
    <P>While I agree with them that there is no <Col N="421" /> great demand for change in the present system, my opposition to this Bill goes much deeper than that.  I cannot vote for this Bill in its present form.  I accept fully the compassion and concern of the Minister in relation to those married couples who cannot avail of what is their legal right to contraceptives because of the failure of local chemists etc. to stock these devices.  I see nothing wrong as a legislator in remedying this deficiency but I cannot support the wholesale issue to teenagers of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>With other Deputies I spent about three hours with the Minister last night advising him that I could support this Bill if that clause was taken out of it.  I assure the House that this is the viewpoint of the overwhelmining majority, on a basis of about 97:3 of all those who corresponded with me.  I never received more correspondence on any other subject since my election other than on the referendum debate in 1983.  I met representatives of the Limerick Family Planning Clinic yesterday morning.  They presented me with a petition signed, they said, by 900 people.  I was very sorry to see that among the signatories to that were children aged 16 who are known to me and who could not, I submit, in all objectivity make up their minds on a much deeper issue than the mere provision of contraceptives.</P>
    <P>I happen to be one of those who incline to the viewpoint outlined by Lord Devlin, Judge of the Queen's Bench, in his <i>Essay on the Enforcement of Morality</i> published by Oxford University Press in 1965.  He said:</P>
    <P>If men and women try to create a society in which there is no fundamental agreement about good and evil, they will fail; if, having based it on common agreement the agreement goes that society will disintegrate.  For society is not something that is held together physically; it is held by the invisible bond of common thought.  If the bonds were too far relaxed the members would drift apart.  A common morality is part of the bondage.  The bondage is part of the price of society. <Col N="422" /> and mankind which needs society must pay its price. </P>
    <P>The signs are all too painfully there for everybody to see, that our cultural values in this country have undergone a traumatic change over the past 20 years or so. Some of these have undoubtedly been for the good; in particular a greater tolerance and sympathy for minority viewpoints, whether religious or social, and the gradual elimination of old divisions which have their origins in less tolerant times and attitudes.  But side-by-side with this welcome trend we are witnessing a level of lawlessness and crime unprecedented in our history, where old people are afraid to go to bed at night for fear of being robbed and murdered or having their fingers cut off by robbers in search of money, where women in advanced stage of pregnancy are being gang-raped, where young children are being kidnapped for ransom and churches and presbyteries are ransacked for money. All these things have happened here in the past 12 months.  These are all symptoms of a deep malaise in our society.  I do not want to overstate the point, but the facts are there for all to see.</P>
    <P>One of the basic laws of science is that everything has a cause and an effect.  I believe that one of the main reasons for our present situation as I have outlined it is the widespread disregard for law and authority and a decline in its influence, whether civil or religious.  These sentiments will be dismissed by those of a liberal inclination as being too conservative or pietistic but nevertheless I believe they need to be said in this debate.  Some of the greatest conservatives &mdash; with a small c &mdash; I have met are those who like to proclaim themselves as liberal or progressive, but, at the same time, they are so rigid in their own viewpoints as to be almost immutable &mdash; too far east as west.  Some of them are among the most intellectually intolerant people I know.</P>
    <P>One of the overt reasons for this Bill is to bring the law back from the area of disrepute.  I suggest that anyone who is <Col N="423" /> sanguine enough to believe that can be done does not know or understand the history or the ethos of our people.  As Rex Mackey pointed out, we are a society by our culture, history and tradition that lives windward of the law.  For obvious reasons we have what some might describe as a healthy disregard for the law and its institutions.  Nevertheless, the situation is if we give the nod to young people in this matter we are encouraging conduct that I think is known to be morally wrong.  We must be free to legislate but, as Edmund Burke reminded his electors in Bristol in 1774, &ldquo;Your representative owes you not his industry only but his judgment, and he betrays instead of serving you if he sacrifices it to your opinion&rdquo;. Above all, we owe it to our children to give them sound moral guidelines even if they wish to reject them.  The passing of this Bill will, I believe, do a great disservice and unfairness to our young people.  It will give them the impression that the Government and leaders of our country are approving officially conduct that is basically wrong.</P>
    <P>I am not in any sense whatever arguing for a draconian form of society &mdash; quite the opposite.  If history has anything to teach us it is surely that legal or religious extremism has no enduring place.  The most ruthlessly inexorable force of all is moderation.  I am pleading here for a rethink on this question of making contraceptives freely available to our young people.  In my view, there is no great demand for such change.  Contraception is a mentality and those who want to avail of it will find the means anyway; they have done so since the dawn of society. The Minister himself has admitted that 30 million condoms have already been imported since the 1979 Act.  Although I may not be around, because some of us will be gone the way of truth, it will be no harm to look back.  I say that the cost to the taxpayer of this country will extend far beyond that of providing contraceptives to those people who look for them. Experience everywhere has shown that a greater availability of contraceptives, far from reducing social problems such as <Col N="424" /> venereal diseases, single parents, teenage pregnancies and so on will only increase them with the State paying the price, and I am not talking of money only.</P>
    <P>I realise that in not supporting my party colleagues on this I incur automatic expulsion from the Parliamentary Labour Party, the party to which I have given 33 years of my life and for which I have worked and laboured for their objectives with as much industry as any one single person could do, perhaps to the neglect of my family and other interests.  I am sorry I have to part company with them on this, but I would point out to those who say that availability of contraceptives for all was part of Labour party policy that I believed an issue with such conscientious difficulties for some Deputies would have to be catered for by a free vote as was the case on previous occasions, most recently the last constitutional amendment.</P>
    <P>I am even more deeply depressed by the belief that if this Bill is lost its defeat will mean the end of the fondly cherished hopes and high vision enshrined in the New Ireland Forum with all its generosity and nobility of purpose.  Because of the insentive manner in which opposition to this Bill has been launched, its defeat will be welcomed by the most extreme Unionists as a vindication of their tribal hatred and suspicion of all things Irish and Catholic and will set back for decades the hope of helping the Northern minority and restoring peace to this land.</P>
    <P>My peace of mind was not made any easier last week when I was approached by a very prominent representative of the SDLP in the North to say that if this Bill were defeated it would be a matter of despair for the Catholics and the minority in the North who would then have lost all hope in the New Ireland Forum.  That only helped to deepen the awful dilemma in which I find myself, that although I come from a background of trade union and Labour tradition of democratic procedures, nevertheless I cannot genuinely vote for something which I believe is fundamentally wrong and with which I disagree in conscience.</P>
    <P>Therefore, having discussed the matter <Col N="425" /> very fully over a long period with my colleagues and advisers in the Labour Party and the trade union movement in Limerick, I am guided by their advice that the only realistic and very unpalatable option I have is to abstain on this issue.  This I propose to do for all the reasons I have outlined.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The proposals to amend the Family Planning Act has given rise to considerable public concern.  In making my contribution to this debate, I am saddened at the fact that at a time when the country is faced with so many major problems of high unemployment, low standards of living and poverty the Government and the Minister for Health saw fit to bring this legislation before the House at this time.</P>
      <P>In the past week we have seen how divisive is this legislation, not just among politicians, not just among the clergy, bishops, priests and religious, but among the community at large.  It can be laid fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Minister and the Government that they are the cause of the confusion and divisiveness in our community which we may never overcome.  During the week we heard a great deal of comment, which at times was very clever, criticising bishops and individuals and particularly parents who were very concerned at the effect this legislation would have on their children.  They are being accused of being cranks, freaks, you name it, it was mentioned. It is a disservice to those people that because of their dearly held convictions and concerns for their families they should be treated in this manner even by Members of this House.  I saw the contribution of some of those people on television last weekend, and it was most unbecoming of representatives of political parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Mind boggling&rdquo; is the only term I can use to describe some of the contributions here today.  People on the other side of the House contributed as if they were parish priests or bishops and at the end of their contribution they said they would support this Bill.  Black is black and white is white, and you cannot serve both, and <Col N="426" /> that is what people are trying to do in this House tonight.  They are expressing concern for the situation as we find it and as it is, and they will go up there tonight and turn left.  It is hypocrisy of the highest order.  We are legislators.  I am in here as a legislator, not as any bishop's man.  I am here to represent over 7,000 people in Cork who elected me, and it is a pity that we cannot say that about many of the people who have spoken in this debate so far.</P>
    <P>Deputy Shatter in his final comment last night said that he wished the people who should know better would express their views in a calmer way and not give respectability to a small minority in society whose views even in a delicate situation can be given an aura which they do not deserve.  I do not know what minority Deputy Shatter was referring to, because he did not say.  I have my own views on it, and I hope that I am not right.  Minorities have been well served in this community and they have little to complain about, but you cannot override the opinions and the views of the majority as some people on the other side of the House would like us to do.  We have always been concerned for the rights of individuals and minorities, but I would have no part in imposing minority views and opinions on the majority while I am a Member of this House.  The division that has been caused by this measure can be laid fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the Government.</P>
    <P>After two and a half years as a legislator in this House I am very disappointed that we have very little to show the young people.  In my clinics every week people do not come in looking for contraceptives, but young people come in looking for jobs, a better standard of living and a better quality of life than they have at present.  I can say without fear of contradiction that the young people today face more problems and difficulties than ever we faced in our lives, and they are entitled to our assistance in every way possible in these difficult times.  The free availability of drugs and the excessive use of alcohol are creating turmoil in our community today and will not help young people <Col N="427" /> while they continue.  Then the Minister for Health came into the Dáil last week and circulated a Bill to make contraceptives available to people over 18 years of age.  Some Deputies who were indecisive all the week spoke here this afternoon and sought all sorts of assurances from the Minister about how we were to protect people under 18 when they know in their heart and soul, as I know, and so does the Minister, that he cannot give them those guarantees.  This is the fallacy of this legislation.  We cannot protect people under 18 in this legislation irrespective of how some of the people in the Government benches would like to wriggle out of their indecision during the week.  Now they state that they will walk behind the Minister tonight into the lobbies to make sure that this legislation goes through.</P>
    <P>We have heard about the need for legislation and what it will do for us.  It will reduce unwanted pregnancies and abortions.  We will have a quality of life never before experienced.  There are no statistics to back that up anywhere, and neither the Minister nor any speaker from that side of the House has given that information to the House, because it does not exist.  I will give some statistics.  They are not mine.  They were published in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 19 November 1984. In 1968 in the UK for every 100 registered births there were three abortions.  In Denmark in 1968 for every 100 registered births there were eight abortions.  In 1981 in the UK for every 100 births registered there were 43 abortions and in Denmark in 1981 for every 100 births registered there were 43 abortions.  These are EC statistics for anyone to see.  Where do the people who say that this will remedy matters here and help prevent unwanted pregnancies, illegitimacy and abortion get the facts and figures?  They are fallacious and those people know that, but in order to justify walking into the lobbies tonight to pass this legislation they are saying such things.</P>
    <P>There has been much criticism of the Catholic bishops in regard to this legislation. The first bishop whom I heard make <Col N="428" /> public comment on it was the Church of Ireland Bishop of Cork, Dr. Samuel Poyntz.  On Friday night after the Bill had been circulated he welcomed the legislation and said that in his opinion it was helping us towards a pluralist society. I did not comment on Dr. Poyntz's right to speak.  He was quite entitled to do so.  However, the minute the Catholic bishops expressed their opinion which they believed to be right, and they believed their right to be to advise their flocks, all hell broke loose.  It was like a red rag to a bull, particularly to some people in this House whose values may not coincide with those of the bishops and whose opinions of the quality of life may not coincide with mine.  All hell broke loose because the bishops were carrying out their duties as they saw fit.</P>
    <P>I am here as a legislator and to represent all the people of my constituency. I welcome the views and the opinions of the bishops.  I am a friend of both the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Bishops of Cork, but there was no pressure brought to bear on me in regard to how I should vote in this legislation.  It is my conviction that the provision of the legislation would result in a lowering in moral standards and in the quality of life. That contention cannot be contradicted. We must have our priorities right on this matter.  It will not be possible for the Minister to ensure that those under 18 will be prevented from obtaining contraceptives. I have here a question and answer document which was circulated by some Deputies from the other side of the House.  The first question is whether the Bill would provide unlimited access to contraception.  The answer is, &ldquo;no&rdquo; but that it limits access to specific outlets, namely, doctors, chemists, health boards, family planning clinics and certain hospitals, and that all of these will be under an obligation to limit sales of contraceptives to people over 18.</P>
    <P>If, for instance, an 18 year old goes into a chemist's shop and buys two dozen of these devices and then goes out and proceeds to distribute them to seven or eight friends who are younger than he, is the chemist in that case considered to be <Col N="429" /> observing the law?  The Minister has not spelled out what would be the position in such cases.  Instead, there have been some cleverly put statements by the Minister and by some other speakers in expressing their concern on the question of age.  They say that the chemists will ensure that the law is complied with, but the fact is that the law in this regard cannot be applied.  This legislation will put us on a slippery slope.  The free availability of contraceptives in such permissive societies as those in Denmark and Britain has failed to prevent unwanted pregnancies. It will fail here too.</P>
    <P>The second question on the questionnaire was how effective one thought the legislation would be, and asked whether drink is sold to people under 18.  The answer was that the two situations are totally different, that there are thousands of pubs concerned exclusively with the sale of drink whereas the outlet for contraceptives would be limited and that clearly the vast majority of doctors, chemists, hospitals and so on would act responsibly and would apply the law.  The answer went on to proclaim that it would be relatively easy to identify a small minority who would break the law.  In other words, it has been admitted already by people on the other side of the House that the proposed law would be broken. We have failed the young people in regard to the licensing laws.  I have no wish to be emotive, but I speak here as a result of my concern for our young people.  The Minister or the Government are blindfolded to the reality of what will happen as a result of this legislation being passed.</P>
    <P>We are told that young people are using contraceptives anyway.  Many young people are using them but there are many who are not using them.  However, if this legislation is passed, many more young people will be using contraceptives. Therefore, we will have created a greater problem than we have now.</P>
    <P>We have failed our people, and our young people particularly, in terms of jobs and of the type of environment they are entitled to.  That is why the Government are taking the easy way out.  In <Col N="430" /> the short time.  I have been there I have learned that one expresses a view and then acts in the opposite way.  The press will publish what one says but the way one votes is not recorded and that gets him off the hook.  I have seen that happen too often here, and we will see it again this evening when the people who have expressed concern about the Bill will vote for it.  I urge such people at least to be manly enough to do what they believe is right.  There was much criticism of Deputy Flanagan last week for his saying that his conscience is his own.  My conscience is my own and I will do what I consider right having regard to the views of the people but the final decision must be one's own.  Some speakers today dismissed much to easily the opinions of those who wrote to them on this issue. Deputy Kelly and Deputy Shatter have told us that very concerned people wrote nice letters to them, letters that were not offensive in any way.  I was very glad to hear that, but I was sorry to hear of the abuse and the threats to which Deputy Prendergast and some other Members were subjected.  However, in some other instances I understand that the reports of threats and so on were fabricated.</P>
    <P>We have a duty to the people, but by passing this legislation we are failing in that duty.  Some Deputies on the Government side who have been undecided all week as to how they should vote have come here and expressed their concern but have indicated that they intended supporting the measure on the basis of assurances given to them by the Minister. The Minister cannot give them the assurances they seek, and consequently they should be honest.  If they are sincere in representing their constituents they should oppose the Bill this evening.  I trust that the legislation will be defeated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Those of us this morning who had the privilege of hearing Deputy O'Malley not only witnessed a superb and honest parliamentary performance but had the opportunity of having the real issues in the debate set out, clarified and put into context in a way that had not happened up to then in this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="431" /> There was not a word or sentiment uttered by Deputy O'Malley this morning with which I would disagree.  In the short time available to me I shall address myself to what I regard to be the main issues in the debate.</P>
    <P>First there are the contents of this extremely short Bill.  Like Deputy O'Malley I wonder also whether a year from now we will be asking ourselves what the fuss was all about.  The effect of the Bill are extremely straightforward. First it will remove from our legislation the meaningless and unworkable concept of bona fide family planning.  The concept may have been a nonsense in 1979, though maybe it was important to use it then in order to have the Bill passed, but it has no place today.  Secondly, the Bill frees our doctors from the obligation of prescribing for non-medical contraceptives. This is being done at the request of the overwhelming majority of Irish doctors as expressed through their professional associations.  Thirdly, the Bill provides a framework of control within which condoms can be dispensed in an ordered and regulated way and which provides very severe sanctions against those who would break that law, and that is something that does not exist in the present legislation.  Lastly, this short Bill extends the availability of condoms to parts of the country where people, mainly married people, who would have a right to contraception, cannot exercise that right because of the outlets not being available.</P>
    <P>That is what the Bill is all about.  It is not in any way about the opening up of floodgates or about the collapse of moral standards.  There is no element in the Bill of the forcing of alien moral standards on anyone.  People will continue to be free to do as they wish and in accordance with their conscience.  The Bill seeks only to amend the practice of a principle which was enacted here in 1979.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the understandable fears of many of those who are opposed to the Bill, but I would ask them to have regard to the facts.  In many ways, as Deputy O'Malley mentioned, what is more <Col N="432" /> important than the measure itself is the context in which we are debating it. There are three main elements in the climate and the context in which we are debating the Bill.  The first stage is the way in which we, as parliamentarians and Members of the Oireachtas, have handled the Bill and the entire matter. Anybody who listened to the eloquent and very honest speech of Deputy Prendergast and the speeches of people like Deputy Griffin and Deputy Conlon must have wished that we could have had a free vote on this Bill.  It is worth recalling that when this House was being set up, when our democracy was being established, it was the earnest hope of the founders of this State that most issues would be debated in a free way, that a defeat on a measure would not mean the collapse of a Government.  Unfortunately, civil war politics meant the end of all that.</P>
    <P>Certainly, if this issue had been debated on the basis of a free vote, two things would have happened.  We as legislators would have been under far greater pressure, individual pressure and pressure from various groups and each and every one of us would be personally accountable for our vote here today.  I would have welcomed that and I would be voting tonight as I intend to vote, for this Bill.  When people outside and inside the House talk about a free vote and the absence of it, the blame for the absence of a free vote must be placed squarely where it belongs.  I say this, not as a criticism but as a matter of fact.  The Fianna Fáil Party for its long years of history have always said that they do not believe in free votes.  That is their way. It suited Fianna Fáil well down the years and I am not here to criticise it.  It is not my way.  Perhaps that is one of the reasons for my feeling happier on this side of the House.  Perhaps Fianna Fáil are happier to have me over here, too. That is the way it is and has been over the years.</P>
    <P>There is no such thing as a free vote for one half of the House only.  I am quite certain that the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party would have been very <Col N="433" /> happy to have a free vote if it was genuinely a free vote for all the House.  I was struck by the perhaps unconscious hypocrisy of the last speaker when he pleaded with the people over here, those who are voting on this Bill and who have had great difficulties which they have spelt out, to vote &ldquo;No&rdquo; tonight.  Would he extend the same freedom to Deputy McCreevy and Deputy Harney?  Of course, he would not.  For Deputies on the far side to vote with their consciences is seen as betrayal, as an act of treachery against the Party Leader.  If people in Fianna Fáil are talking about a free vote, or people outside are wondering why there is not a free vote, let them look fairly and squarely where the reasons for this lie.</P>
    <P>The second context in which this Bill is being debated has been touched on by very many speakers and it would be wrong of us not to draw attention to it, that is, the part played by the various churches in this debate.  From the point of view of the nation, the debate over the past number of days has been an extremely healthy and open one.  When the smoke has cleared away, we shall find that a framework has been laid down in an area where issues and practices hitherto were very unclear and very illdefined. This debate will serve as a basis for future discussions on genuinely important matters which concern both Church and State.</P>
    <P>Most politicians in this House took the bishops at their Forum word, that ours was the right to legislate, theirs was the right to teach and to instruct but, ultimately, ours was to be the final word.  The experience of the past few weeks probably has not been all that easy for people on these sides of the debate &mdash; I mean the bishops and the politicians.  Old habits die hard.  The bishops and politicians are better off that these issues have been aired and that what I believe to be a new framework for discussion is being laid down.</P>
    <P>Every Member of this House has listened to and read the warnings, instructions and teachings of the Catholic bishops in this matter.  These teachings have <Col N="434" /> been taken into account with great care by every legislator in this House.  What they have said has been evaluated with perhaps greater care and at greater length than the warnings of any other group but, at the end of the day, as the bishops have told us, people here, either individually or collectively, within the democracy of their parliamentary parties are making up their minds.</P>
    <P>If this episode is seen, as it tends to be seen by many in the media and by people outside this country, as being a Church-State clash &mdash; and I add that very few in this House see it as such &mdash; the fault for that perception must lie fairly and squarely with the bishops.  There was not a collective statement from the bishops. Their statements were made individually but the majority made their case in a calm and reasoned way.  This is especially true of the statements made by the Bishop of Ferns, Dr. Cummiskey, the Bishop of Galway, Dr. Casey, Bishop Cassidy of Clonfert and, of course, by Cardinal Ó Fiach.  However, for whatever reason, historical or otherwise, the context of the debate has been changed harshly by the intervention of two of the bishops.  They intervened, as was their right, in the way in which they wanted to intervene but their intervention did change the context of the debate and changed it in a harsh direction.  I refer first to my own archbishop, Dr. McNamara of Dublin.  The speed of his intervention in the debate, the apocalyptic nature of the language which he used in his first and subsequent statements, the sweeping and, I believe, not always sustainable nature of the sociological claims he made about the consequences of this legislation and his unyielding stance created an atmosphere in which confrontation and not conciliation became almost inevitable.  Dr. McNamara, who is a man of whom people speak very well indeed, either on purpose or inadvertently harshened the tone of this debate.</P>
    <P>The second bishop is Dr. Newman of Limerick.  I am afraid that Dr. Newman went even further.  Does this learned and good man realise the effect of what he says on every Member of this House in <Col N="435" /> telling us that we as Catholics have a duty to follow the line laid down by the bishops in this matter?  He puts every politician in this House into an impossible position. If we vote against the Bill, the perception will be that this House, individually and collectively, has bowed to the crosier, that we have been whipped into submission by the bishops.  If we vote for the Bill, then we will be seen as defying the bishops and engaging in a Church-State clash, one which does not exist and which on one in this House and very few outside it want.  Does Bishop Newman think sufficiently of the impact of his statements, on the impossible position in which they put every Member of this House, on the way in which this House is portrayed outside and the perception, which can be extremely dangerous, in Northern Ireland in the entire process of reconciliation? Does he think sufficiently of the consequences of his words when he makes statements such as he made on television last Sunday and in his other utterances?  I do not doubt his sincerity or his goodness but I doubt his judgment in this matter.</P>
    <P>I hope when this Bill is passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas &mdash; and passed it certainly will be &mdash; that both bishops and politicians will have learned a great deal from this experience, that we can resolve our legitimate differences without confrontation, in the language of debate and in language which will be healing and unifying.  It is probable that when historians look back on this episode they will see that there was a possibility of scarring confrontation but that commonsense prevailed and that confrontation did not take place and that we, as a parliamentary democracy have come of age and shown a great deal of maturity in this whole matter.</P>
    <P>Following on from that, I would like to talk about this Bill in the context of the Forum and of Northern Ireland but I am very conscious that there are many speakers who want to come after me.  All I shall say in that regard is that everything which would have been a consequence of this Bill failing was said eloquently this <Col N="436" /> morning by Deputy O'Malley.  The consequences of failure of this Bill to pass &mdash; it should pass on its merits &mdash; in Northern Ireland, put the SDLP and the integrity and authenticity of the Forum report in great peril.</P>
    <P>For these and other reasons I commend this Bill to the House and in doing so I praise the courage, the integrity and the courtesy of the Minister for Health who has steered this Bill through the House. The Minister deserves full support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I oppose this unwelcome and unwarranted legislation. Deputy Maurice Manning referred to the intervention of the hierarchy in this debate.  The hierarchy as members of the electorate are entitled to express their views at any time.  I welcome the views of the hierarchy.  If the hierarchy had expressed views favourable to this legislation, Deputy Manning, the Minister and the Government would be delighted; but when the hierarchy and individual bishops express views opposing the legislation they are not so welcome.  To amend legislation to suit another administration is a bad reason for bringing this Bill before the House.  If we have legislation that suits our people we should be satisfied with it and we should not amend an Act to appease people outside the State or to try to ape another administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill should not be called a Family Planning Bill; it should be called The Sale of Contraceptive Devices Bill, 1985, as suggested by Deputy Alice Glenn.  It has nothing to do with family planning.  It just makes available the sale of contraceptives to 18 year olds.  What mandate have the Government to introduce this Bill? In the Programme for Government this idea was hatched out between Labour and Fine Gael after the general election of 1982.  It was not a consideration during the 1982 electoral campaign.  I have no doubt that, if it were, this Government would never have got into office and if many Deputies who are voting for this legislation tonight had expressed that view during the 1972 campaign they would not have been returned to the Dáil. The Fine Gael Party stayed away from <Col N="437" /> this issue during the campaign.  An agreement was made between Fine Gael and Labour and one of the conditions of that agreement was that a review of the 1979 Family Planning Act would be undertaken, but even that undertaking in the agreement is not too clear.  When introducing this legislation the Minister said that the agreement was to review the operation of the present family planning legislation with a view to providing full family planning advice and facilities in all cases where needed.</P>
    <P>The agreement did not say that the Legislature would pass a Bill to provide for the free availability of contraceptives to 18 year olds.  The danger is that this Bill will provide for the availability of contraceptive devices for younger people.  The Government cannot enforce this legislation.  The Bill does not make it a condition of sale that a prosecution will be pursued in relation to the sale of non-medical contraceptives to people under the age of 18.  The Bill does not prevent the sale of contraceptives to young people by slot machines placed in chemists shops.  The Bill does not insist that the chemist should undertake the sale directly to the person involved. Members of the chemist's staff, of any age, would be free to make the sale. There is nothing to prevent an unscrupulous chemist opening a separate unit of his shop for the sale and distribution of contraceptives to teenagers.  It is open to large multi-national stores to engage the services of a chemist for the sale of non-medical contraceptives in supermarkets. The legislation is very loose in this regard.  The legislation is faulty in that area.</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Bill is to make contraceptives available without control. The Minister is achieving that objective by having this legislation passed through the House.  There is an inherent danger in providing for the availability of contraceptive devices on such a scale.  In my seven and a half years as a Member of this House I have never received representations from young people in regard to the availability of non-medical contraceptives. They are more concerned about <Col N="438" /> jobs creation and educational facilities. They are not concerned with this legislation and this House has spent many hours debating an non-issue.  The Minister has a clear commitment to the liberalisation of the family planning laws.  This is one of the conditions for the Labour Party staying in Government.  It is one of the conditions imposed by the Minister in exchange of his support of the budget in 1985.  These are conditions which the Minister must have imposed on the Cabinet. Soon after the recent budget was introduced a <i>quid pro quo</i> was involved &mdash; the Minister and the Labour Party were prepared to support the budget if this legislation was introduced.</P>
    <P>There is a prohibition in relation to the sale of drink to people under the age of 18 but it has been found to be unforceable. The same situation will apply to this Bill.  The Bill does not make it mandatory on the person wishing to purchase non-medical contraceptives to produce evidence of his age.  The Bill does not copperfasten the provision that the chemist will have to satisfy himself that the person is over 18.</P>
    <P>The Bill should be put to the real test, it should be put to the people in a referendum. It would be worth while to place these proposals before the people and give them an opportunity to decide on the issue.  It is my view that more than 62 per cent of the electorate are opposed to these measures.  We do not have a mandate from our constituencies to vote in favour of it and the Government do not have a mandate to bring it forward. I am confident that if the proposals were put before the people in a referendum more than 62 per cent would oppose it. Like all Members I would abide by the decision of the majority in a referendum. I challenge the Minister to put his opinions, and the Government's credibility, to the test in the form of a referendum. That referendum could be held in conjunction with the local elections this year and if that took place it would not be a very costly exercise.  The result of the referendum would be a clear statement from the majority, like that given <Col N="439" /> in the referendum on the pro-life amendment, to the Government.  It is worth recalling that in the recent referendum more than 85 per cent of the electorate in my constituency voted for the pro-life amendment.</P>
    <P>The Minister should consider Article 41.2º of the Constitution which states:</P>
    <P>The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State. </P>
    <P>The Bill seriously undermines the family and Article 41.2º.  For that reason it should be referred to the Supreme Court. I make that suggestion if the Minister says that he is not prepared to refer it to the people in the form of a referendum. The Bill seriously undermines the family unit and will pose a difficulty for our young people.  Since it was published I have had talks with various interested groups and young people about its provisions, and they all expressed serious reservations about them.  The fact that the provisions have been so widely publicised and debated has also damaged the fabric of the family and our young people. Children of nine and ten are now asking what contraceptives are and where they can be obtained.</P>
    <P>The media has a massive obsession with this issue.  Whenever so called social or liberal legislation is brought before the House one is guaranteed that our national newspapers will give it front page coverage and that it will be highlighted on radio and television.  There has been more attention given to this issue than to the fact that 235,000 people are unemployed.  Why is it that the mounting problem of unemployment is not given banner headlines each day?  Why is it that the media are not concerned with the ever increasing rate of unemployment and emigration?  I understand that emigration is now estimated at 30,000 young people per annum.  That is a tragedy.</P>
    <P>The Government are aware that the Bill has deflected public attention from <Col N="440" /> the main concerns of our people.  It has cleverly deflected the attention of the electorate from the inability of the administration to bring forward policies that would create jobs.  We have spent hours discussing a Bill for which there has not been any demand.  Has Minister Desmond any constituency considerations for job creation following the passage of the Bill?  In my view it will not create any jobs.  It is possible that the Minister has some other direct reasons for his passion to bring the Bill before the House.  A passion it is.  The Minister has displayed a single minded extreme view that it must be brought forward and I believe he would be prepared to resign if the Bill is defeated.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister alleged that the leader of our party, Deputy Haughey, when Minister for Health, had secret meetings with the hierarchy.  That is a blatant lie.  Former Minister Haughey had confidential private meetings&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The general statement was a blatant lie.  That is not attributing it to any one individual in the House.  The fact is that it is a lie.  I will not quibble about words but I stand over my statement that it is a lie.  Former Minister Haughey scrupulously researched this matter before bringing in the 1979 Bill. He had 17 meetings with other groups, and yet the Minister dishonestly would not refer to those groups when he mentioned the hierarchy because he felt that by implying that the former Minister for Health, former Taoiseach, and present Leader of the Opposition had secret meetings with the hierarchy it would in some way undermine our opposition to the Bill.  That is the psychology behind the Minister's statement.  If former Minister Haughey had secret meetings with the hierarchy he would not leave a detailed minuted file in the Department of Health when he was leaving it that Minister Desmond could not get his greedy hands on. A secret meeting would not have been minuted, would not be detailed.  The Minister brought forward the actual minutes of that meeting into this House, undermining the confidentiality of a former Minister when he was prepared to state that a former Minister had had that meeting, which was well documented and published at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I compliment the then Minister who was prepared to have open dialogue with 18 groups before introducing the Bill for which I voted in 1979 and which was rendered necessary under the Constitution because of the ruling in the McGee case. That is an excellent, workable Act, but the will to make that work is not within the competence of this Government; they do not want that Act to work.  Many who were prepared to vote against that Bill in 1979 are now those queuing up to vote with the Minister on this slim, inadequate <Col N="442" /> Bill, the simplest, most dangerous Bill that has come before this House in my time here, a most sinister Bill, the most undermining Bill ever brought before this House.  Time will tell how right I am and how right are Members on this side of the House in relation to our position on this Bill.</P>

Her name will be remembered with those of Deputy O. J. Flanagan and Deputy Tom O'Donnell. Now Deputy Prendergast is at least prepared to abstain, but I would recommend him to go in and vote on this Bill when he also will join that group of honourable, respectable and decent Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Séan Treacy expressed so well his reservations.  He is prepared, as a <Col N="443" /> former Ceann Comhairle, to go into the lobbies with us this evening because, in the best interests of our people, he does not care about his future here, his political future, but what he can achieve will be achieved.  They will go down in our history as achieving more for our people than any other Deputy here.  I am proud to be with them this evening voting against this Bill.</P>
    <P>In regard to the consultations which the then Minister for Health, Deputy Haughey, had honourably in 1979 with 18 groups I wish to pose this question to the Minister: had he any secret meetings with the Irish Family Planning Association, a group of which I understand the Minister is a paid-up member?  He has an opportunity of denying here this evening whether he is controlled by the Irish Family Planning Association.  He is the puppet of that association.  He is bringing in their Bill.  He is a very proud member of that association.  He was prepared to break the law, going to Dun Laoghaire and opening an illegal family planning clinic.  He broke the law and the only honourable course open to a Minister who breaks the law is to resign from his ministry and, I go further, resign his seat in Dáil Éireann.  He did not apologise for that illegality, which he must accept was such.  And the fact that the Taoiseach and the Tanaiste did not reprimand or dismiss that Minister means they are condoning his illegal activities.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to say here this evening if he is a member of the Irish Family Planning Association.  I want him to admit it, because that group is associated with the International Planned Parenthood Federation and we are all aware of their commitment to the sale and distribution of contraceptives, being linked to the multi-national producers of non-medical contraceptives.  By being involved with its Irish section the Minister is himself involved in that area.  I want the Minister to apologise to this House, when replying.  He should apologise for casting aspersions on a former Minister who held honourable discussions with 18 <Col N="444" /> interested groups before the Family Planning Act, 1979 was implemented.  Would the Minister object to consultation?  I know that the Minister in his Department has adopted an aloof, arrogant manner in relation to consultation with interested parties.  For example, surely the pharmeutical groups should have been consulted before the introduction of this Bill? Surely the 18 groups consulted by a former Minister, Deputy Haughey, should have been consulted again before this Bill was introduced?  I feel confident had the Minister been prepared to have widespread consultations with all those interested groups, then he would not have brought this type of Bill, which is totally unworkable, before the House, because he would have been told by them that it was totally unworkable.</P>
    <P>Has the Minister any intention of changing the provisions of section 11 of the 1979 Act which stated conscientious objections?  In that section the then Minister provided for any doctor, pharmacist or health board to opt out of the provision of non-medical and other family planning facilities.  I want to ask the Minister this evening: will he impose any sanctions if the health boards are not prepared to operate the provisions of this Bill?  Will he bring about a situation in which funds will be withdrawn?  Will he introduce a blackmail type of sanction on health boards who will not operate the provisions of this Bill, because that would be a very serious and irresponsible action for him to take?  I believe the Minister is prepared to carry out his single-minded plan whereby non-medical contraceptives will be available in every village and town in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to have second thoughts about this Bill, put it before the electorate in the form of a referendum; better still, put it before them in a general election campaign, when I can assure him he will never again sit there as Minister for Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank all Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  The measures contained in this Bill are extremely limited <Col N="445" /> in nature; in scope they are somewhat significant.  They provide that the sale of contraceptives can be made legally at a more realistic range of outlets, all of which will be staffed by responsible individuals. They cannot and will not be indiscriminately distributed without a sense of social responsibility.  The outlets are clearly defined &mdash; chemist shops, GP surgeries, health centres, family planning clinics, maternity hospitals and hospital clinics for sexually transmitted diseases. I submit that many Opposition Deputies have cast aspersions on the professional staff of those outlets by implying that there will be indiscriminate distribution.</P>
      <P>The Bill also provides that adults who so decide may purchase non-medical contraceptives on their own initiative and without seeking the permission of a third party.  Given all that we say about the protection of our young people and their sense of responsibility and our decision in recent months in this House to recognise the age of 18 as the point at which people enter into adulthood and that we passed the Age of Majority Bill without dissent, I submit that it is outrageous to deny adults &mdash; not teenagers &mdash; the legal right to exercise, if they so wish, the purchase of non-medical contraceptives. Of course, medical contraceptives will required medical prescription, and that applies irrespective of age.  There are young people aged 15, 16 and 17 who, in the context of cycle regulation, require and will be given them in accordance with medical prescription.  That was in force long before the 1979 Act and, therefore, any objective analysis of what is proposed must conclude the measures in this Bill are reasonable and moderate in intent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impose contraception on anybody, young, middle-aged or old.  It merely, as Deputy Kelly correctly pointed out, extends to adults the legal right to purchase non-medical countraceptives in the case of condoms and spermicides in the case of women from an extended range of professionally controlled outlets.  This House, without dissent, accepted the age of majority as 18 and the capacity of <Col N="446" /> young adults for responsible behaviour in a variety of circumstances.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of the morality of contraception.  I want to repeat the point I made in my opening address concerning the nature of the issue before us. It is not for us in this House to determine the morality or the use of contraception; that is not our function, which was so dramatically and cogently argued in Deputy O'Malley's magnificent contribution to this debate.  It is not for us to determine the morality of contraception or the use of contraceptives.  That is a matter for individual conscience guided by the moral or religious teaching each citizen is guided by.  Our task as legislators is to frame legislation as best we can, having due regard to the overall common good.  I would have though that we, as legislators, would at least know that much in the context of our contributions to the debate.  Of course we all have strong views with regard to responsible sexual behaviour in society.  Furthermore, many Members have very strong views &mdash; and I fully respect those views &mdash; on the intrinsic morality of contraception. They are entitled to their views, and many Members of this House are guided by the teachings of the Catholic Church. That is to be profoundly respected, but the line must be drawn in the context of legislation overall for the common good. I am aware of the official position of the Catholic Church on this issue and I did not have to have any consultations in that regard.</P>
    <P>It was stated recently and, thank God, most rationally, by Bishop Cassidy in a radio interview on Wednesday, 13 February, that the Catholic Church teaching on the issue of contraception has to be taken very seriously and weighed with all the other considerations that a legislator must take into account.  He said that a legislator had to consider individual freedom in society, the common good, and to try to balance the two.  He has to consider the views, convictions and standards of the people who elect him and, if he is a Christian, the teaching of his Church.  In that context, having given due regard to all the factors involved, I have <Col N="447" /> proposed this Bill to Government.  The Bill is not a Barry Desmond Bill.  It is a Bill approved by all the Members of the Government accepting collective responsibility.  It is Government sponsored legislation and, as such, the Whip is imposed to have the legislation enacted in this House.  I wish to state that, in view of the hysteria of some Members of the Opposition about Desmond and the Bill.</P>
    <P>There are those who opposed this Bill on four principal grounds.  They have said that there is no need for the Bill, that there is no demand for the Bill, that the consequences would be harmful to the common good by providing an incentive and encouragement to young people to engage in irresponsible sexual relations with all its consequences, and that it is not appropriate at this time.  With regard to the need for this measure, great difficulties are being experienced by a significant proportion of the adult population in gaining access to their desired means of limiting their families and engaging in contraception.  There are areas in which contraceptives are not on sale generally or, if they are on sale, in a very covert manner.  As a result, people travel long distances to major urban centres where family planning services of a specialist nature are known to be available.  This is undesirable, and there has been a demand from the medical profession to be relieved of the hypocritical requirement that I, as a married man, must go down the road to a general practitioner whom I know personally and ask him for an authorisation and a prescription, in personal humiliation, and then go along to a local pharmacist whom I also know personally and ask him for a packet of condoms across the counter.  That is a sick legislative provision which should never have been enacted.  The Irish College of General Practitioners and every other medical body I can think of have said that it is ludicrous and that I should amend it. There is clear evidence that the requirement should be removed.</P>
    <P>Regarding the consequences of the passing of the Bill, I wish to repeat my belief that the cataclysmic predictions of <Col N="448" /> the consequences of adopting this Bill are incredible.  I hand it to Deputy O'Hanlon, who quite rightly said he was confident that young people would not rush out and buy contraceptives simply because they would be legally available on the passage of this Bill.  He should reflect on this position.  Some Deputies have inferred, grossly unfairly and abusively, that I have some peculiar obsession and aberration to get this Bill through. That is not true.  One Deputy suggested I had a perversion of reason in advocating this legislation.  If this is so then the recently retired secretary of my Department, Dermot Condon, is so possessed. The current secretary Liam Flanagan is equally so possessed.  I sought their sound views and obtained professional advice.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden asked whom I consulted. The inference was that I had no professional advice on this area.

      <P>I raise the matter because it has been suggested that I, in my perversity of attitude, am bringing forward a Bill which will lead to an escalation of sexually transmitted disease, an increase in abortions, unwanted pregnancies, and a growth in cervical cancer.  On all the evidence available to me within my Department no such assertion is borne out and no such evidence has been submitted to me in that regard.  That applies as much to the ethics committee of the Irish Medical Organisation as it does to the professional medical staff of my Department.  I have no authoritative evidence in that regard.  In fact, the evidence available suggests the exact opposite. What we are trying to do is prevent by a variety of measures &mdash; contraception, sex education and others &mdash; abortion, teenage pregnancies and venereal disease.  That is one of the major beneficial effects of this legislation rather than the opposite of which I have been so vehemently accused in this House.</P>

I readily recognise that the solution put forward in the last piece of legislation was by no means perfect, that it had certain drawbacks and disadvantages, some of which you mentioned, and the way it has operated has not been very successful either because, as you probably recall, the original legislation placed very great emphasis on the building up <Col N="451" /> of family planning services, including natural family planning.

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Bernard Allen has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the refusal of insurance companies to insure the contents of flats and apartments. Deputy Allen has eight minutes and the Minister has four minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I raise this serious matter tonight because of the inability of thousands of flat and apartment dwellers to obtain insurance cover for the contents of their flats and apartments.  The situation has been brought about because of the refusal of insurance companies to accept such business on the grounds that it is a bad risk.  I raised this matter in April 1984, and the Minister stated in his reply that he had taken the problem up with the companies concerned and they had indicated to him that each application for house insurance or any other type of insurance is examined on an individual basis based on the information given on the proposal form.  He said he could not compel insurers to underwrite particular risks and that it must be left to their own commercial judgment.  Unfortunately, the situation has continued to exist since then, and a number of people whom I know personally have suffered serious financial loss as a result of fires and storm damage because they were unable to obtain insurance cover for the contents of their apartments.</P>
      <P>I can prove that the insurance companies have misled the Minister, and I can give cases where insurance companies have refused business out of hand without even considering the individual merits of each case.  I have discussed this appalling situation with an executive member of an insurance company in the last few days, and I have a certain sympathy for some insurance companies who have been left with bad risks on the nonprofitable part of house insurance because of a number of factors, and I would like to refer to them briefly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I refer to the restrictive practices being pursued by building societies in forcing their member borrowers to take life and house insurance business from an insurance <Col N="457" /> company nominated by them.  This has resulted in the creaming off of the more lucrative portion of the market by these companies.  In my view this restrictive practice is illegal because, I am informed, the building societies gain something like 33? per cent commission on this type of business.  Therefore, not only are they entering into a restrictive practice with their borrowers, they are entering into unfair competition with insurance brokers through the country.</P>
    <P>The second major factor which, I have been informed, is causing this problem is local authorities insuring their properties with Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Ltd., who because of their structures are unable to take insurance on the contents of apartments.  I would ask the Minister for the Environment, too, to consider the matter because it is creating a problem.</P>
    <P>Finally, I ask the Minister to impress on his colleagues that until such time as the reform of the court system and a closer scrutiny of the escalating legal costs takes place, we will continue to have an increasing problem in the area of insurance.  These are matters which must be tackled in the long term, but I am asking the Minister to begin discussions immediately with the insurance industry in order to alleviate the hardship being experienced by thousands of people in Cork city and county, and I expect tens of thousands throughout the country</P>
    <P>Another matter I wish the Minister to pursue immediately relates to the practice whereby building societies insist on their borrowers dealing with specific insurance companies.  That should be discontinued.  I understand that in 1984 one building society alone made profits running into millions of pounds as a result of this restrictive practice, which is unethical and possibly illegal.  When the building societies sought recently to increase their interest rates the Minister might have taken the opportunity of discussing that practice with them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy wrote to <Col N="458" /> me about this matter in March 1984 and I told him then that the insurance companies had indicated that all applications for household contents or any other kind of insurance were being examined strictly on their merits.  However, I took the question up with the two representative bodies of the insurance companies, the Irish Insurance Association and the Federation of Insurance in Ireland.  They both confirmed that each case is treated on merit, that there is no specific policy of refusing to ensure the contents of flats or apartments in the Cork area.  I asked the Deputy then if he would let me know of any specific case with which he was concerned and in which insurance companies were adopting discriminatory policies without reasonable grounds.  The Deputy raised the question again by way of Parliamentary Question in October 1984 and I again invited him to submit details of specific cases but he has not done so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I can do that now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is welcome to submit these details now or to call at my Department to discuss the issue with officials as he has done on a number of other issues.  He is most welcome to approach the Department's officials on this issue.</P>
      <P>The position with regard to flatdwellers is that companies treat all applications for insurance on their merits.  There is no policy of discrimination against flat dwellers.  Though the level of claims in respect of flats is very bad, insurance are very concerned about the level of burglaries and the subsequent claims in the area of household insurance generally.  They are anxious to improve their results in this area, in which they have incurred huge losses in recent years.  There is no need for me to reflect on this in the House this evening.  The House will be well aware of the price applications I have sanctioned in the past two years.  These reflect the underwriting position with regard to household insurance, especially in respect of contents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no evidence to suggest that <Col N="459" /> flatdwellers are being discriminated against, but if the Deputy furnishes me with details of specific cases I shall have them investigated.  However, he must realise that there may be specific reasons in some cases for refusing cover.  I cannot compel any insurance company to underwrite any specific risk or indeed to provide full cover.  My authority in this matter is a supervisory one so I cannot force insurers to assume risks.  My primary duty is to ensure that insurance companies are viable and operate within the very strict liquidity reserve ratio terms that apply to all insurance companies operating on the Irish market.</P>
    <P>The insurance companies are in the business of offering insurance, and they have a requirement to make profit for themselves.  In my price application situation I have tried to ensure that by and large the companies have an underwriting break even level.  This criterion has been <Col N="460" /> adopted in the Department down through the years, but to this extent the insurance companies have not been very successful in recent years because of the increasing level of burglaries and break ins, sometimes with violence, as the House knows.  However, I am again issuing an invitation to the Deputy to come to the Department and discuss any specific case he may know of in the Cork area in which he believes there is discrimination. I am most anxious, as are the representative bodies of the insurance companies, that insurance is available to apartment and flat dwellers in general.  If the Deputy can bring specific cases to my notice I will have them investigated.  His concern is shared by me and by the insurance companies also.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture the actual volume of milk delivered to milk plants for the first nine months of the super-levy year from 2 April 1984 to 31 December 1984; how that volume compares with the relevant period for 1983; with the co-responsibility returns for each of the same periods; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The figures furnished to my Department by creameries and dairies show that deliveries to milk plants in the period 2 April <Col N="330" /> to 31 December 1984 amounted to 996 million gallons.  This represents an increase of approximately 3.1 per cent over the deliveries for the corresponding period of 1983.  The figure for deliveries in 1983 is based on the co-responsibility returns for that period but the 1984 co-responsibility returns are only available up to end November as a number of returns for the month of December are still outstanding.</P>

      <P>If the market exchange rate of the Irish pound were to fall in value by 5 per cent against the currencies participating in the EMS exchange rate mechanism and against the ECU the effects would be as follows: (i) some £140 million would be added to the Irish pound value of the Exchequer's outstanding foreign debt; (ii) Some £9 million would be added to the Irish pound value of foreign interest payments this year.</P>

On the base of the exchange rate of the dollar against the Irish pound and the Exchequer's foreign debt outstanding at 19 February 1985 it is estimated that each one cent appreciation in the exchange rate of the dollar against the Irish pound would add approximately £3.5 million to the cost of foreign interest payments in 1985.</P>

He appealed against the amount of means assessed against him but an appeals officer on 16 August 1984 also assessed him with means at £35.10 and £36.16 respectively and disallowed his unemployment assistance claim.  If however he considers that his circumstances have changed since the date on which the appeals officer assessed his means it is open to him to apply for a further investigation of his means.  A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.</P>

These earnings were not on record at the time she made her claim and she was therefore requested to furnish her P60 income tax form.  In the meantime, her claim was authorised for payment at the weekly rate of £64.88 which is the minimum rate payable under the maternity scheme for women in employment.

      <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of a deserted wife's payment is that a woman 40 years of age must have a qualified child residing with her.  Payment of deserted wife's allowance to the person concerned was discontinued with effect from 9 August 1984 because it was held that the above condition was not satisfied in her case.  She is not yet 40 years of age and her twin children having attained eighteen years of age on 3 August 1984 are no longer qualified children unless they are in full time education by day, in which case the allowance is payable up to twenty-one years of age.  She was notified on 22 August 1984 that it was open to her to reapply for the allowance should either or both of the children be continuing in full time education.  Failing this she was advised to reapply when she reached forty years of age.  Nothing further has been heard from her since.  She is currently in receipt of unemployment assistance from the Department.  If her children are also unemployed it would be open to them to apply for such assistance.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 28 March 1984 to 11 April 1984 but his claim was disallowed under the trade dispute provisions of the Social Welfare Acts. He claimed unemployment benefit again from 1 May 1984 and was paid flat rate <Col N="347" /> unemployment benefit at the weekly rate of £90.15 increased to £96.55 by means of the budget increases with effect from 5 July 1984 and weekly payments of flat rate unemployment benefit at this rate continue to be made to him as they become due.</P>
      <P>Certain difficulties arose in determining his entitlement to pay-related benefit. Entitlement to this benefit is subject to the condition that the total of flat rate benefit, pay-related benefit and incometax refunds may not exceed 85 per cent of the person's average net weekly earnings in the period before the period of interruption of employment began. Under the provision of the scheme, which links breaks in employment within 13 weeks of each other, this period of interruption of employment began on 28 March 1984 when the person first claimed benefit.  The 85 per cent limit was initially incorrectly calculated at £118.21 by reference to the 1st May 1984 but was afterwards recalculated at £108.58 when the error was discovered.  Evidence subsequently came to light of some additional earnings by the person concerned which enabled the 85 per cent limit to be readjusted upwards to £113.89.  The person concerned is accordingly at present in receipt of a combined weekly payment of £113.89 representing flat rate unemployment benefit £96.55 and pay-related benefit £17.34.</P>

      <P>The appeals officer has decided to hold an oral hearing in this case.  The date and place of the hearing will be arranged as soon as possible and the claimant will be notified.  Because of the increased number of appeals under the various social welfare services some delay in arranging for hearings is unavoidable at present.</P>
      <P>The conditions for unmarried mother's allowance provide that a claimant shall be disqualified for receiving an allowance if and so long as she and any person are cohabiting as man and wife.  A deciding officer held that the claimant in this case was disqualified under this condition on foot of evidence from a local officer of the Department which indicated that she was cohabiting with another person as man and wife.  This evidence will be considered by the appeals officer in the light of the statements and evidence of the claimant at the appeal hearing and the appeals officer will then make a decision on the case.</P>
      <P>The claimant's solicitors were contacted on the question of whether their letter dated 27 November 1984 to the Department was to be taken as saying that cohabitation had ceased and that the claimant was re-applying at that stage or that cohabitation never existed and that the claimant was appealing against the earlier disallowance.  The solicitor stated that his instructions were to appeal on the basis that there had never been any cohabitation.  Accordingly the correspondence was not treated as a new claim on her behalf.</P>

      <P>Grant aid of £2,231 (less £40 in respect of two farm visits) was paid in November 1984 in respect of a milking parlour, dairy, grain loft, concrete wall, calf house, slurry tank extension, assembly and exercise yards.  The cost of the works (£8,924) was calculated in accordance with the standard national costings used by the farm development service.  The rate of grant was 25 per cent which is the rate appropriate to a development farmer under the revised farm modernisation scheme effective from 3 January 1984.</P>
      <P>Grants amounting to £4,440 were also paid in earlier years for drainage work, water installation, silage base, concrete apron, slurry tank and cubicle house.</P>
      <P>Items included on the farm plan which have not been grant aided are: (a) bulk tank, tractor and some land reclamation in respect of which application was not made to the farm development service and (b) milking machine, feeders and concrete yards for which application was made but which are not eligible for aid under the revised scheme.</P>

        <i>Limerick East</i>): In the document <i>Building on Reality</i>, the Government expressed concern that our alcohol licensing arrangements were an impediment to the full development of the tourist trade. One of the measures decided on to help the tourist trade in this respect was that special provision should be made for the granting of full liquor licences to restaurants of an acceptable standard.  Amending legislation will be needed to implement the decision.  Work is at present in progress on the details to give effect to the Government's decision but I cannot at present say when I am likely to be in a position to submit draft legislation to the Government.</P>
