      <P>Other events superceded this debate, for example, the Family Planning (Amendment) Bill and the discussion surrounding the emergency legislation introduced by the Government to take control of funds supposedly in the hands of the IRA.  Then there were various political matters concerning Members of the Opposition.  With it all, the political talk as far as the budget is concerned has dwindled a great deal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to many speakers over the last three weeks each commenting on the value of contributions made by Deputies. It is important that even though the budget has been announced for some weeks, Members still have an opportunity to reflect on it and put forward the <Col N="1087" /> views of those they represent.  The budget aimed at three important items: improving the environment for increasing employment, the reformation of the tax system and the protection of those on low incomes from the impact of the recession. The budget should be seen, not in the light of a giveaway budget but as a budget of reform.  It is a reforming of the tax system and, as was pointed out on budget day, tax reform will help to create conditions that will favour expansion of employment, that will reduce opportunities for evasion of tax and restore a competitive balance between domestic business and the commerce and trade of Northern Ireland.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EndaKenny" hpid="Mr. Kenny Mr. Kenny">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>As reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday last the Minister for Finance said, by way of a prepared script, that spending would exceed revenue by 30 per cent in 1985, that the debt service alone this year would consume almost 35 per cent of tax revenue, or virtually the entire take from income tax, and that this necessitated of itself a curb on expenditure. The Minister defined the issue as being a matter of how to achieve this goal as quickly as possible with the minimum dislocation to the performance of the economy and the position of the disadvantaged.</P>
      <P>That is the kernel of the problem, and it corresponds with the statements made by Deputies here in the past number of weeks concerning the lack of employment and the various advantages and disadvantages in our society.  The 1977 budget, which was introduced by Fianna Fáil in Government, is responsible primarily for the economic crucifixion of our people.  We are still paying for the seed that was sown at that time.  Irrespective of one's political views one must accept that the massive debts incurred at that time are not yet paid off.  This is putting economic pressure of an unprecedented kind on all of us.  Those who have lost their jobs are carrying the burden of economic adjustment for everyone else while those who retained their jobs after the 1977 to 1981 period had no wish to reduce their lifestyles appreciably.  This has necessitated even further borrowings with the consequent interest repayments and, in turn more bad debts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additional spending in 1985 obviously means extra debt and that means extra interest payments in 1986.  That situation in turn means higher taxation and probably more people losing their jobs.  I have been intrigued by speeches from the Opposition regarding the current budget deficit.  On the one hand Deputies opposite slated the Government for not being in a position to bring the deficit in this <Col N="1089" /> regard down to 5 per cent, and to abolish it if possible, while on the other hand they have spoken repeatedly about what would be likely to happen if the level were reduced.</P>
    <P>On 10 October 1984, Deputy Haughey said, in referring to <i>Building on Reality</i> that for two years the Government had kept on telling us that they were devoting all their energies to putting the public finances right but that they had not done so.  He said that the foreign debt was two and a half times what it was three years ago and that the document stipulated that the current budget deficit would remain at its present level of about 7½ per cent of GNP not merely in 1984 but in 1985 also.  He went on to say that on the revised GNP figures published earlier in the year the current budget deficit in 1981 was 7.7 per cent of GNP and that in 1985, on the basis of the decisions in the Government's document, the current budget deficit would be 7.7 per cent of GNP.  The Deputy pointed out the various difficulties facing the country. The implication is that if the current budget deficit were to be reduced to the level expressed in Deputy Haughey's statement, matters would be much worse than they are.</P>
    <P>On the following day, Deputy Reynolds said that in regard to borrowing and bringing the State finances into line, the projection is that the current budget deficit would be 5 per cent of GNP in 1987.  He made the observation that the greatest let down for people generally was when the Taoiseach did a U-turn on the current budget deficit.  Deputy Reynolds, too, advocated an immediate reduction in the current budget level but he must have realised that that in itself would impose even harsher and more stringent pressures on the economy and on the people.</P>
    <P>On 16 October 1984 Deputy Bertie Ahern said that bad as the situation was it would have been worse if the Government had taken the advice of the Governor of the Central Bank and opted for eliminating the budget deficit for 1987 instead of reducing it to 5 per cent of <Col N="1090" /> GNP.  He said that for those people who are unemployed or who for whatever reason are on the breadline the adoption of the suggestions by the Governor of the Central Bank would have made matters worse.  That is an indication that the Government realise the implications of an immediate reduction to the level of 5 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that between 1970 and 1980 in the US about 15 million jobs were created in a population of about 220 million while the corresponding figure for Japan was 3 million new jobs in a population of about 70 million. However, in the EC, in a population of 270 million, 750,000 new jobs were created. That would appear an almost unbelievable statistic but it was quoted recently by the CEO of the IDA.  But one must ask what kinds of jobs were created in the US and in Japan and where we have failed in the Community as a whole and as a nation to measure up in terms of the creation of employment.</P>
    <P>There is a need to create a mood of optimism and of confidence.  An examination of the figures for the past number of years does not lead one to believe that there has been sufficient optimism and confidence in the climate for employment creation.  Potential employers will now find it more beneficial for themselves to hive off any profits or lodge them where they might give a better return than Government securities or venture capital or the risk of attempting to set up a new industry or expanding ones which exist would yield.  The climate of optimism and confidence must be tempered with a sense of the intensity of the competition for the attraction of industries into our country.  Discussions with the IDA, CTT and various industry inducing agencies give one an idea of the pressures facing the IDA in terms of attracting industries in here.  We are an insular nation removed from mainland Europe, therefore removed from mainland markets and so we require in the main transport subsidies and various other incentives to get foreign industrialists in here.  Many of these come in for a short time, avail of the various grants put out by the various <Col N="1091" /> agencies and leave once the terms of their export relief are up.</P>
    <P>The dollar has become so strong of late that financial commentators in many Western Governments are seriously concerned about it and about the potential danger inherent in its continuing strength.  President Reagan said recently that his intention is not to toy with the dollar at its present level.  For every cent that the punt drops against the dollar the cost to this country is in the order of £3 million increased foreign debt repayment. Recently I saw a documentary on the BBC which I found very disturbing in that it revealed that many Western heads of Government together with their financial advisers appear to consider that if the dollar continues on its upward path it will be very much overvalued and could through various difficulties induce another recession in the US which would have a follow through effect throughout Western European democracies in the next two or three years.  One wonders about the political aspirations of the EC. It has taken over ten years to put together a foreign passport and various member states have still not agreed on the costings of this and how it should be implemented. When they get down to grapple with larger, more political problems one wonders where their real interest lies.  One man's disadvantage can be another person's advantage, and the strength of the dollar itself should be good for our exports.</P>
    <P>CTT in a recent report stated that their projects for the coming year were that they would provide a programme of incentives and services for at least 2,400 exporters and that these services would include the provision of trade information to approximately 2,000 firms, a marketing advisory service both at home and abroad for about 1,200 firms, arranging 3,500 exporter visits to be organised through their overseas offices, preparing 2,000 research reports by the overseas offices and making something like 7,500 trade contracts to be carried out by the head office for approximately 850 firms. <Col N="1092" /> That is a commendable projection, and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Finance in terms of the strength of the punt against the dollar should see to it that CTT are given every possible assistance in their effort to break into the American market.  That can only do good for exports for the country and help employment.  Within the mood of optimism and confidence created, reward for investment in hard work must be seen and I trust that the projections through CTT will result in increased employment in that respect.  People will not invest money unless an adequate return is evident from any investment they might make.  The incentives to them to invest money should be at least equal to the risk they might take in buying Government securities.</P>
    <P>The black economy is on the increase and we have all heard reports concerning the amount of money leaving the country. The estimated figure appears to be upwards of £300 million a year haemorrhaging out of this country.  If that allegation is true, then surely there must be some authority or ability within Government to harness that kind of money and use it for employment creation potential within our State for the numbers unemployed here.  It is interesting when comparing the energy, motivation and incentives that exist in the US against Western countries and particulary here, to appreciate the level of interest that people have in work and job creation.  At present the US are going through a second industrial revolution. The shift is towards the information and service industries and high technology.</P>
    <P>The key element in the attitude of American workers is the discretion they are given in the workplace.  During the first industrial revolution in the US the level of that discretion was very low. People left the land, crafts and so on and headed into various industrialised centres where the assembly line did not demand any great level of motivation, where jobs were simplified and concentration was on increased output and productivity.  That left many of the high discretionary jobs <Col N="1093" /> in agriculture and the various crafts in decline.  In the mentality of the American worker are two contracts, first the economic contract in getting to work, staying there and having the resulting material benefits from salary, and secondly, of late, the psychological contract in that blue collar workers in many cases have now more discretion in their areas of work than white collar workers have. They see this as important for the value of the job, for personal challenge and also as a result of management's ability to upgrade skills and accountability within the various departments of industry.</P>
    <P>This trend in American industry giving workers much higher discretion than they had heretofore, naturally, leads to increased motivation and personal challenge and, therefore, a greater interest in one's work.  For instance, in 1950 the goods producing sector in the US comprised 41 per cent of all jobs while service industries accounted for something like 59 per cent.  In 1981 the goods producing sector was 28 per cent of all jobs while the service industries had grown to 72 per cent.  This country can learn a lesson from the kind of jobs that have become available in the US in the 1970-80 period. While it was a privilege to have a job during any recession, it has now become a demand and a right for everybody.</P>
    <P>A study carried out by a Professor Cherrington in one of the universities there, in which he clocked behaviour over a two year period in an objective sense, revealed that half of the workers' time was related to the job and the other half was related to coffee breaks, late starts, early finishes, personal activities and idle time.  A lesson can be learned from that kind of study.  The management courses run by the IMI and the various other bodies could lend themselves to that kind of activity.  We have heard of the poor performance of many of our industries, heightened by poor labour relations. Management should see to it that their workers have a higher interest level, greater motivation and greater discussion in the work place.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> Naturally the work place itself has strong connotations for family, status and authority.  If that were handled properly from a management and skills point of view, much could be gained.</P>
    <P>The average business has been under enormous pressure in recent years.  When books are audited at the end of the year the accountants usually tell an industrialist who is under any kind of pressure to shed labour and to put in machinery that will not go on strike, that will not answer back and that will perform at maximum productivity level on a continuous basis. Many industries here who have expanded in the past ten years and who find themselves under pressure from a competitive, quality or undercutting point of view, instead of sustaining the workforce on a three day week to meet that level of competition and demand find that their entire industry goes to the wall.  In many cases the markets they had three or five years ago prior to their problems developing are still there.  However, there is an inability to reduce the output to that level of market and in many cases the pressures on the industrialist bring about the demise of the entire industry and more people are put out of work than is necessary.  This has happened in a very personal sense to people who have over-borrowed or who have taken out too high mortgages.  Then, because of redundancy or for some other reason, they find it is not as easy to meet the repayments.  If they had the opportunity to reduce their lifestyles to the standards obtaining five years prior to their problems developing they would gladly accept that opportunity. The vital thing is to hold what we have and to expand where that is possible and necessary.</P>
    <P>How does this country measure up in terms of creating a suitable environment for industry, where industrialists and employees can be motivated to increase national output?  What atmosphere of optimism and confidence has been created by this budget and by the Government? In the industrial sense, what platform do the Government stand on? Some 5,000 people have availed of the enterprise allowance scheme in the past <Col N="1095" /> 12 months.  It will be interesting to see how many of these people will be able to continue in employment after one year. Under this scheme married people get £50 a week or the entire amount of unemployment benefit in one lump sum in order to develop a business.  The social employment scheme announced recently is expected to take 10,000 off the unemployment register.  Difficulties have arisen because the National Manpower Service, who are to operate the scheme, are unwilling to do so because of lack of funding and extra staff requirements.  I understand that calls for the appointment of an arbitrator have been made to the Minister for the Public Service and I trust he will ensure that this matter is sorted out in the shortest time possible.</P>
    <P>Representations have been made about the level at which payments under the social employment scheme have been struck.  Many people are working very hard for £90 per week, even though I accept they may be eligible for the family income supplement.  However, if a worker gets £70 for two and a half days work, naturally some people will question why they should work a full week for £90.  That is something that must be treated with due care and attention.</P>
    <P>The Youth Employment Agency have given £92 million and many imaginative and worthwhile schemes have been carried out.  The important point in those schemes have been the appointment of supervisors.  In many cases this has been a waste of time and money and has not led to any element of training for young people.  Where the supervisors had their programmes properly set out and where the necessary discipline was imposed, the schemes were worthwhile.  We have had the alternance scheme, which is a concept in training and work experience, the employment incentive scheme and others.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy when speaking in the debate challenged all and sundry to indicate one area where jobs would be created as a result of the budget and he repeated this call several times in the following days.  However, as things changed <Col N="1096" /> and political discussions became more heated it appears this challenge was not answered either by his own side or by some people on this side.  The budget will help people involved in tourism and it will also help in the diversion of cross-Border trade on this side of the Border. The manufacturers will also benefit from the cash flow effects of the reduction in VAT.</P>
    <P>With respect to cross-Border trade, in some cases we have a rather warped mentality about where we are heading as a nation.  One can find republican sympathisers in a most vociferous mood singing republican songs; but in many cases if one asks them where their wives are one is probably told they are up in Enniskillen with the ICA or some other organisation on a day's shopping.  It is time that kind of mentality was thwarted by Government action and I was glad to see the response of the Minister for Finance to the calls made by Border Deputies in particular to do something about the matter.  The electrical industry expects sales to increase by 7 per cent to 10 per cent in the coming month and the Minister should be congratulated for his action.</P>
    <P>VAT at point of entry has had a most detrimental effect on manufacturers and industrialists.  I have had many representations from people who have entered the country at the North Wall or at other points of entry complaining about the lack of facilities that exist at many of those places.  If the documentation is not absolutely in order they may have to wait overnight before getting the various loads released.  Last Christmas I received representations from a person who came from the North with a container of toys. He had to spend two days going through every single item, setting out the serial numbers, the country of origin, the category of toy and so on.  These people are investing in businesses and are investing under extreme pressure and their representations must be considered.  I hope the day will come when the Government will dispense with VAT at point of entry.  I will refer to tourism and its potential for employment at a later time.</P>
    <P>The Republic of China and Taiwan <Col N="1097" /> are most progressive from the industrial point of view.  This year is the Year of the Ox in China and they expect to invest more than $20 billion in the next few years to achieve a further growth rate of 8.6 per cent in their economy.  Their stated aim is to help traditional industries to renew their equipment, to increase productivity, to expand local industries, to strengthen their research and development and to provide information on marketing and investment opportunities.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has covered all those points in various addresses and through various actions on behalf of his Department and the Government.  He referred to profit sharing and I wonder why this had not been followed up.  When compared with industries here, their counterparts in the US and in Britain are up to 150 per cent as profitable.  Six thousand companies in the United States operate profit sharing.  This gives increased motivation to many workers. Management might be wary of it because it might lead to acquisition by workers of confidential material.  This should be looked at.  Over the last five years there have been 1,500 employees in Britain involved in this area and this has led to increased productivity and harmonious industrial relations in each case.  If management and workers have a common goal it is easier to achieve stated objectives.</P>
    <P>I noted Fergal Quinn's recent statement about a £75 million market in fruit and vegetables.  In 1983 we imported 31,421 tonnes of potatoes and £146 million worth of fruit and vegetables.  Some of these could not have been grown here, but others could.  Instead of wishing to be at the top of the market someone should start at the bottom getting advice and encouragement from existing State agencies.  In 1984 imports of fruit and vegetables reached £149 million from January to October, and that included 35,000 tonnes of potatoes at a value in excess of £7.4 million.  For an agricultural country with many different soil conditions we could make genuine in-roads <Col N="1098" /> into those imports and provide employment at home.</P>
    <P>I recently heard of a very observant person who took the time to travel to the Dublin market every Monday morning for six months.  He decided to grow cabbages. First he inquired about markets in his local towns and he was assured of them.  Then he decided to get the best strain and varieties of cabbages to grow in a ten acre plot on a rota basis so that the best vegetables would be available at any one time.  When the crop came to maturity the local markets were not available. Many people preferred to buy from the Dublin market and to have the vegetables transported by truck.  He said his mistake was that he could not market the goods he produced.  When he went to the United States later he went into a very large supermarket and saw that a local farmer had a stand in that supermarket. He sprayed the vegetables with water from a container giving the impression that the vegetables were fresh from the field, even though they may have been there for some days and the unsuspecting consumer bought those vegetables.  The vegetable industry is run in a haphazard way.  There is too much of one variety grown at one time and not enough of another.  If the vested interests were to get together and decide what should be done, we could make inroads into those imports.</P>
    <P>It is a long time since the first Cumann na nGaedheal Government backed Dr. Drumm's invention for a battery which would provide an experimental train from Dublin to Greystones.  Over the years the operations of CIE have been a bone of contention because of the number of industrial disputes, the very bad industrial relations and complaints about the quality of service.  I want to refer to the train services where CIE appear to be in difficulties.  I avail of the transport service to the west.  Over the years there have been calls for new trains and an increase in the standard and quality of the existing service and this has been brought about lately.  In his capacity as Minister, Deputy Flynn, did not put his head on the line but he made strong <Col N="1099" /> representations to his Department that the supertrains and the better quality trains should be put on the western line. That has happened, but the trains cannot be used to the fullest extent because of the poor quality of the lines.  Many railway stations have become very dilapidated. The architectural quality of those buildings is second to none.  The social employment scheme could be used to clean these buildings and provide a better visual impression of the country.</P>
    <P>I am intrigued by the price system CIE operates.  The normal train to the west has a carrying capacity of 300 passengers. This is in competition with a fleet of private buses from provincial towns who charge a return fare of approximately £8 to £10.  CIE operate various charges on different days, but the average consumer is not aware of this.  It costs approximately £26.50 for a return ticket from Castlebar to Dublin but the equivalent rate on a private bus is £8.  Students, civil servants and young people from the west living in Dublin do not have the money to pay the high CIE fares.  Admittedly the fares are reduced at the weekends but people are not aware of this even though the lower rates are advertised in the local papers.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>Recently I was coming to Dublin on a morning train with the capacity for carrying 300 passengers and there were only 92 people on it &mdash; 40 pensioners, three students and the rest fare-paying passengers.  If CIE reduced their fares, as they did last November, they would have a full train and this would make economic sense.</P>
      <P>The number of unemployed has always been a bone of contention.  In his speech on the Finance Bill on 17 June 1982 Deputy O'Kennedy said, at column 506 of the Official Report:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of the level of unemployment, which has been mentioned <Col N="1100" /> so often, perhaps when one is on the Opposition side one likes to blame the Government.  I have been on both sides and now find myself on the Government side but not in Government so I can perhaps take a rather special view of it.  But we all generally recognise that the level of unemployment in terms of the figures presented is not the true level of unemployment.  Most Deputies know that in many parts of the country where we supposedly have high levels of unemployment the fact is that they are not nearly as high as are being registered in the unemployment exchanges, because many people are doing what are called nixers.  This could be dealt with by a strengthened inspectorate, but it also calls for an awareness on the part of the citizen.</P>
    <P>We have an inherited attitude about informers.  Those who communicated with the State to the detriment of their fellow citizens did not earn very much respect but, in a sense, the whole community now needs to become informers for the public good.</P>
    <P>The unemployment figure stands at 234,000 approximately.  This would lead one to believe that about 80,000 to 100,000 of those registered unemployed people are not unemployed.  This points to the growth in the black economy.  One has to weigh that against the robbing of the PAYE workers to pay people who are registered as being unemployed but who are not unemployed.  It is the system which is at fault.  The PAYE worker should be given an incentive and should be seen to be able to get a reward for his work.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy said that this budget would not create jobs.  However the reduction in VAT on accommodation in the tourism area creates a significant potential for job creation.  Because of the strength of the American dollar against our punt there will be a bonanza for American tourists if Bord Fáilte have the capacity to attract them.  We should have a significant increase in American tourists this year.  At the higher end of the market <Col N="1101" /> the Americans have already booked out many of our finer establishments.  Ashford Castle where President Reagan stayed last year has had enormous calls on its capacity.  We are getting a new breed of tourists from the Continent, people who travel around staying in caravan parks and camping.  This market has not yet been fully exploited.  We have the best fishing, hunting and outdoor facilities in the world.  Many athletes would agree that we have the best outdoor pursuit facilities in Europe.  It is difficult to beat the friendliness of our people.  This aspect of tourism is very important and we should do everything to maintain the quality of the service we can offer.</P>
    <P>In the <i>Irish Independent</i> on Monday 25 February last Dr. Tony O'Reilly remarked that the &ldquo;Brits Out&rdquo; policy could lead to a civil war and he praised the Forum document which he described as a unique Grecian attempt in that people came down to the market place and honestly and honourably put forward their points of view.  In relation to the tourism industry it is important to understand the mentality of Irish Americans.  There are something like 40 million Irish Americans who have a legitimate right and aspiration to see the country of their origin reunited. However the activities of the Provisional IRA and others have led Irish Americans to believe that the country is at war with itself and with Britain.  Many Irish Americans are misinformed as to the situation here, perhaps because of history, the thousands of miles and the generations that separate us.  It should be remembered that the annual invasion by Irish Ministers of the United States on St. Patrick's Day does not really inform the vast number of Irish American households about our situation.  It calls into question the ability of Governments to deal adequately with the perception that Irish Americans have of British domination here.  The staffs in the Irish American consulates are first class and do an excellent job although their numbers are insufficient to cater for the demands. Irish Americans who might wish to travel to Ireland on holiday or who might wish to invest their money here are not <Col N="1102" /> inclined to do so on the basis of their perception of a country at war with itself and with Britain.  The Government should make efforts to inform the Irish Americans of the true situation here and to assure Irish Americans that if they invest here they will get a return.  That policy will demand a high level of commitment from our personnel in the US. Calls have been made over the years for the floating of Government bonds by the American President to allow Irish Americans to invest here and that is an important point to remember in the context of the budget.</P>
    <P>Mr. O'Kennedy in his contribution to a debate on 17 June, said:</P>
    <P>The Department of Health particularly, should insist on not just being a channel of public expenditure.  They have an obligation which, speaking from my experience as Minister for Finance, I am not convinced they have always readily accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kenny</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the debate on 17 June 1982 at column 502, on the Finance Bill. Deputy O'Kennedy then pointed out that further savings could be made by the Government provided they went into conformation of standards, prescriptions and so on.  It is time the Government looked at legislation which governs health boards.  The setting up of the health boards by the late Erskine Childers has probably unintentionally led to them becoming licensed authorities to spend ever-increasing amounts of public money so that the Minister for Health is now in difficulties with many health boards in relation to cutbacks.  Few businesses would appoint chief executive officers for life with the authority to spend the amounts of money that have been spent by the health boards over the years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many cases savings were not implemented when they could have been.  For instance, in the area of dental care I have heard Deputies speak about grandiose schemes for orthodontists and so on.  The Western Health Board had something <Col N="1103" /> like 3,300 people on their 1983 list for orthodontic treatment and about 4,000 people in 1984.  The cost of a fixed appliance in any orthodontic treatment would pay for 40 to 50 ordinary examinations. What has happened is that the most vunerable age group between 12 and 18 have been left out in the cold and in many cases are not examined at all.  This results in some orthodontic difficulties which could have been prevented, at a cheaper cost, from arising and needing treatment later on.</P>
    <P>Forty years ago an old age pensioner was entitled to get glasses and dental treatment when the County Councils administered the health schemes.  At present he cannot be catered for in that way, but at the same time we allow a person with a very high income to have a free bed in a public hospital.  We have gone too far along that road especially when we consider that many people in the high income group would not avail of a public bed anyway.  The health boards have introduced fine schemes in relation to speech therapy, occupational therapy, child care, psychiatric services and so on. These are all valuable but what has happened is that we have set up an administrative system of programme managers and various grades of officers and administrators who are removed from the ordinary people and who do not know the effects of the schemes they are implementing. For instance it will be found that the calls on the time of a dentist who operates for any health board are enormous and he is not able to cope with the demands.  They often have to treat people who have not been listed in their registered appointments.  What is a dentist supposed to do if a casualty comes in having broken his teeth while playing a hurling match?  Should he write to the CEO and ask for permission to operate? In many cases dentists are operating on up to a third of their patients who were not registered appointments and they do not get paid for that work.  This is a service which needs to be looked at seriously in the context of the effect of the overall budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1104" /> The only aspect of agriculture I wish to refer to is the proposed land tax.  I regard it as being as fair a system as can be devised.  However, there would appear to be a need for some sort of sliding scale for those above the 20 adjusted acres rate.  We have had various political speeches on this in the last two months.  True to form, Fianna Fáil have used it to try to stir the emotions of the farmers, to try to bring about an atmosphere of hysteria.  They have been saying that the Department of Agriculture intend to go to town on this.  The effect of Land Commission inspectors going out to do the valuations will be beneficial. They are highly qualified and should be able to do a good job.  I would issue a word of caution to the Minister.  I suggest that the demise of the Land Commision could lead to a new system of Irish landlords because you could have people buying up land at an enormous rate, speculating saved money in this way and thereby creating a new system of Irish landlords worse than that of previous years.  In regard to the land tax I should like to give a quotation:</P>
    <P>What the farmers should pay should not be annuities but a land tax for the privilege of using their land.</P>
    <P>That was uttered by none other than the late Eamon de Valera on 28 June 1927 in an interview with <i>The Manchester Guardian.</i> Those who espouse his cause should take a look at that.</P>
    <P>I listened carefully to some of the speeches made in regard to the employment assistance scheme.  The Minister for Social Welfare has gone a reasonable way in his attempt to see that justice will be given to every person.  The onus and the responsibility is on social welfare applicants in accordance with a Supreme Court decision of years ago.  They must put forward their true list of expenditure which they will be claiming against assessed income.  The Minister provided a list of items against which people may claim. People may say that social welfare officers may have hounded applicants throughout the country but when one sits and talks to applicants one can give them <Col N="1105" /> explanations which they understand and in many cases accept.  When you try to tamper with a system like this, instead of giving more to those who deserve it you often end up by destroying the whole system.</P>
    <P>I should like clarification in regard to medical card assessments which do not seem to be as clear as they are for social welfare benefits.  In December the Minister said that generally a person in receipt of unemployment assistance would also be entitled to a medical card.  That is not the case and I should like the Minister to say in his reply what are the criteria laid down for social welfare officers.</P>
    <P>In relation to the bovine TB scheme, I trust the veterinary officers will accept the calls by the farming organisations and the Minister so that at least a start will be made with the scheme as proposed by the Minister.  If difficulties arise later I am sure the Minister will be lenient in some respects.  I was glad to see the recent statements about the western drainage project.</P>
    <P>I will not comment on car thefts, about which many statements were made during the debate.  However, just to show how times have not changed I should like to read an extract from <i>The Western People</i> at about the time the late Mr. de Valera made his statement on the land tax:</P>
    <P>Look back, then, to 1921, to 1922, with its turmoil and murders and gun-manship, its cannonading and midnight raids, its horrors, its tragedies and its enmities, its broken bridges, and nameless graves, its uncertainties from hour to hour, when neither banks nor Government, nor even life or property were safe from moment to moment when County Councils were more effectually silenced and abolished than any declaration of a Minister could silence or abolish them, when farmers suffered less from bad prices than from trenched thoroughfare, and when most of them would have gone ungrumblingly to the brink of starvation if only they could feel certain that the morrow's <Col N="1106" /> sun would not shine through where the night before there was a solid and opaque thatch, or that their persons or possessions would not be shot up before the next sun had gone down.  It is well, is it not, that we should sometimes remember that we did not always enjoy the freedom of speech, of movement, of action, aye, even of soul or conscience, that is ours to-day. There is a certain solace in the knowledge that if we are growing old, we are growing old in relative peace.  The danger lies not in the length of the years, but the shortness of memories.</P>
    <P>I do not think times have changed in many respects.  I will conclude by saying the budget is progressive.  We could be one of the foremost nations in our continent and I hope the Government will continue by giving encouragement, increased motivation and dedication to the cause for which they were elected.  I know they will not fail us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>Ireland is going through the greatest economic crisis in its history, and despite Ministers' repeated assurances that Ireland is &ldquo;poised for recovery&rdquo;, the economic recession is worsening, the numbers of firms closing are increasing daily, and rising unemployment figures make depressing reading. Those who are still fortunate enough to hold down jobs, understandably are frustrated at the Government's taxation policy which is the most regressive in western Europe.  Am I exaggerating?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures speak for themselves. Almost 2,000 firms closed down in the last two years and we have had a considerable increase in the number of unemployed in the last 12 months alone.  The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> in a recent editorial highlighted the injustice to the Irish worker and businessman.  It pointed to the very attractive incentives available to foreign investors in Ireland where there is an average of 30.7 per cent return on investment, twice the Common Market average.  It referred to the right to repatriate profits and to the added advantage that foreign workers in Ireland are not <Col N="1107" /> subject to Ireland's high personal taxes. That is the great attraction for foreign business coming here.  Of course there is no return to the Exchequer here by way of taxes.  By contrast, the Irish businessman is discriminated against, <i>vis-à-vis</i> his foreign counterpart, with a 50 per cent corporate tax and a punitive personal tax and a high VAT rate.  The workers here fair no better under foreign employers than under Irish employers.</P>
    <P>Our unemployed now total 234,000, 17 per cent of our workforce, almost one in six.  However, that figure is not accurate because there are many in AnCO courses who are not employed, thus disguising the real unemployment figure.  This figure cannot in any circumstances be justified as in statements by the Tánaiste such as the following: &ldquo;1984 saw a slowdown in employment loss as against 1983 or 1982&rdquo;.  Whom is he trying to delude? This figure of 234,000 unemployed is a damning indictment on a Government with a so-called socialist component who seem more preoccupied with their monetarist policies than with easing the hardship of these people.  We must remember that over 50 per cent of these are on unemployment assistance, which is means tested.  Because of this, it is no exaggeration to say that today as much as 25 per cent of our people are living at or below poverty level.  I do not think that charges of abusing the social welfare system can ever disguise that fact.</P>
    <P>With the country in such a deplorable state, one must ask what are the options open to us to get us out of the difficulties and help us to pay our debts?  First, we could cut back drastically on social welfare benefits and payments; second, we could reduce public expenditure generally; we could hive off the semi-State industry, reduce considerably our army of civil servants, teachers, doctors, nurses, gardaí and the Army, for these groups are what comprised the public service; third, we could increase further the direct and/or indirect taxes, or alternatively &mdash; and in addition perhaps &mdash; widen the tax net to pay for the public expenditure costs; fourth, we could <Col N="1108" /> borrow more at home or abroad, or do both, and let posterity pay.  These were the options facing the Government and the recent budget was their answer.  What exactly will this budget do or what does it aim to do to solve our national economic problems and restore the morale of our people?  The Taoiseach in his budget speech has said:</P>
    <P>We have at a stroke rationalised and simplified the tax system both in respect of income tax and VAT.</P>
    <P>One would be justified in assuming that the main purpose of the budget was to bring about tax reform.  The Taoiseach's statement was a very bold statement which should be analysed carefully.  He claims credit for what he calls &ldquo;so many radical and innovative measures&rdquo;.  The 65 per cent tax band has been abolished, but what we must always remember is that it was the Taoiseach and his Government who introduced that tax band in the first place.  The abolition was an admission that they were wrong in introducing it.  He said that selective changes in the other tax bands have also been provided for, but hardly anything approaching what the Taoiseach calls &ldquo;radical and innovative measures&rdquo;.  The 35 per cent VAT rate has been reduced to 23 per cent.  Was that radical and innovative? We must remember that it was the Taoiseach and his Government who introduced the 35 per cent VAT rate in the first place.  The Taoiseach is admitting that he and his Government were wrong in introducing this punitive VAT rate which had a disastrous effect on the economy. However, he is making a bold claim to radical and innovative measures now. Can this be termed a major achievement of the present Government?  No, it is an insult to our intelligence to suggest so.</P>
    <P>In the case of VAT, there was some financial juggling in this budget, forced on the Government by cross-Border trading, not done by their own volition or as radical measures in the interest of the country.  They had no alternative and it is a lie to suggest that these are innovative measures.</P>

      <P>It is a lie for the Government to suggest this and that is not charging any person, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.  It is a lie for them to suggest that these are radical and innovative measures.</P>
      <P>Has the income tax reform of which the Taoiseach spoke so eloquently eased the burden on our PAYE workers?  He says:</P>
      <P>We have brought one-sixth of those on higher tax rates down to the basic 35 per cent income tax rate.</P>
      <P>Sixty one thousand taxpayers, or 12 per cent of the total number of PAYE workers were affected.  What about the 448,000 PAYE workers whose position was not improved by this measure which he calls so innovative and radical?</P>
      <P>With regard to the excise duty on TV sets, was that innovative?  Never.  It was again forced on the Government by the cross-Border trade.  It was a reaction to the problem but never innovative.  Was doubling VAT on house sales from 5 per cent to 10 per cent innovative?  This will be detrimental to the housing construction industry.  Increasing the grant to first time house buyers certainly will not mitigate the effect of this VAT rise.  Increasing the tax on building societies will also be detrimental to this industry.  This is the sum total of the tax reform measures of which this Government boast.</P>
      <P>The next question to be asked is: what will this budget do to solve unemployment, remembering the 234,000 who are anxiously waiting for some action?  The Tánaiste in his letter to the Labour Party of 30 January 1985 speaks about:</P>
      <P>A big impact on jobs in specific areas like the newspaper industry and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the newspaper industry, I challenge anybody to tell me that there will be more than 200 jobs provided by that measure and that is being very generous.  I fail to see how he could ever meet such a target. There is nothing there to suggest a big <Col N="1110" /> impact on jobs in specific areas like the newspaper industry and tourism.  Again in his letter he talks about:</P>
    <P>More good news for jobs with a significant reduction in cross-Border trade.</P>
    <P>Again this was forced on him.  The problem was created by the Government who had to backtrack quickly to get the country out of the mess.  Finally, he says:</P>
    <P>The overall thrust of the Budget will be to stimulate confidence, to boost consumer demand, and to stimulate new hope.  VAT changes will have a significant impact because they will reduce cross-Border trade.</P>
    <P>What does the Taoiseach say about this budget regarding unemployment:</P>
    <P>No longer do they [the people] have to watch employment falling and unemployment accelerating out of control.</P>
    <P>Almost while he was saying these words, an extra 34,000 people were becoming unemployed.  There is no indication whatsoever of the number of jobs that will be created by this budget.  If anything, the chances of job losses will be greater than those of job creation.</P>
    <P>We must all ask: how far will this budget go towards reducing or eliminating our debts?  The Taoiseach says:</P>
    <P>This Government has brought our country successfully through the crisis we inherited in 1981 &mdash; not, of course, that this crisis has been resolved, but that it has been brought under control.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I am a little simplisitic and perhaps I may be a little dense, but I find this statement rather baffling.  Bringing the country successfully &mdash; note that word &ldquo;successfully&rdquo;&mdash; through a crisis would suggest that the crisis is over.  If you bring somebody through a crisis, in medicine or anything else, the crisis is over.  However, the Taoiseach is at pains to emphasise that the crisis is not over, merely brought under control.  That is not possible.  You either have a crisis or you do not.  You cannot have a crisis under control.  I should like him to tell us by what figment <Col N="1111" /> of his imagination he has a crisis not solved, just under control.  He continues:</P>
    <P>As a member of this control, the current budget deficit has been brought into line with budget projections.</P>
    <P>Last year he told us that the Government brought the budget deficit in under target.  One could suggest any target under which to bring it in.  In simple terms, this will mean that it will cost £200 million more to run the country this year than last year and the national debt will reach £21 billion by the end of this year. That is what has been achieved.</P>
    <P>The Government said there would be no foreign borrowing.  Instead, they started borrowing on the domestic market and sent the interest rates rocketing, creating a shortage of funds for private sector borrowing.  Even Dr. Brendan Menton, a consultant economist, had some words to say on this in the <i>AIB Review</i>, Economic Outlook 1985.  He said:</P>
    <P>Increased recourse to external borrowing as a source of funding could dampen the pressure on domestic interest rates, which in real terms are at an all time high.  Lower domestic rates would reduce costs and give a stimulus to economic activity, especially investment.</P>
    <P>By borrowing on the home market we are now doing the reverse.  We are inhibiting economic activity, inhibiting investment and increasing costs.  There is no reason why, with our stable currency within the EMS, we cannot borrow at acceptable rates on the European market.  There is no reason in the world why we cannot do that and protect the home interest rates.</P>
    <P>What has the budget done for the unemployed, the handicapped, the disabled and the socially deprived sectors of the community?  The Tánaiste in his budget speech said he fully accepted that this was not what might be called a socialist budget.  Well might he make that statement. Of his 5,000 word speech less than 800 words were devoted to the social aspects of the budget.  A 6½ per cent increase in social welfare benefits from <Col N="1112" /> July next puts this section of the community in a worse position, not better.  For years I have pleaded with Governments to ensure that social welfare allowances are indexed annually in line with inflation as of right without any interference from Government in a budget and that, in addition, the Government would increase them in line with improvements in the GNP.  It should be done as of right annually and not at the political whim of any Government.  There was not one word about children's allowances or about the hardship caused by the withdrawal of food subsidies.  There was an admission that the family income supplement scheme is not working and a token gesture to the increasing poverty in our society with a promise to set up a combat poverty agency.  I saw the farce of a similar such body set up during the 1973-77 Coalition Government, a farce if ever there was one.  That is the total Labour input into the budget and hardly one of which that party can be proud.</P>
    <P>It is important to emphasise that point because the Labour Party were in a unique position in the Government, knowing that there could not be any Government without them.  Their input could have been significant in improving the lot of so many people in our society. For any of us as legislators it is not sufficient that we condemn things without offering proper alternatives.  I have always maintained that if we are prepared to criticise we must be constructive in our criticism.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that the Taoiseach's performance in the budget debate left a lot to be desired.  He was at pains to emphasise the aid to the Zoological Gardens, the park for Cork and the increased assistance to Irish welfare centres in Britain.  I wonder if the increase in aid to Irish welfare centres is in anticipation of massive emigration which is already on the way.  I omitted to mention the imposition of VAT on footwear which will cause hardship to needy families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1113" /> However, I must say that the public relations job on the budget was wonderful.  I have never seen anything like it.  It fooled the political correspondents because they were all very much in its favour.</P>
    <P>What should the budget have done? As I see it, our semi-State bodies are an intolerable burden on the economy, and CIE is just one example.  The decision in the national plan to divide up this body fails to solve the basic problem there, which is that CIE is a loss-making inefficient body not fulfilling the purpose for which it was mandated.  Why?  It is because the words &ldquo;incentive&rdquo; and &ldquo;motivation&rdquo; are alien terms within that organisation, and nothing is being done to rectify it.  Take the case of the ordinary bus workers.  Those good people are an essential part of this organisation but they are barely eking out a living.  Do they receive bonuses?  No.  Do they receive a share in the profits?  No.  It is a strange situation that the national plan outlines how every effort should be made to encourage private businesses to involve their workers in profit sharing arrangements &mdash; indeed, the Finance Acts provide incentives and concessions to encourage such worker participation &mdash; but there is not one word in the national plan for the workers in semi-State bodies to share in the organisation.  Why?  The Government have failed to appreciate the importance of this.  It is difficult to understand why they do not set an example to private industry by introducing a profit sharing scheme in the semi-State bodies or by encouraging workers to get shares either free or at nominal cost.</P>
    <P>While a member of the Labour Party I could never understand the party philosophy that &ldquo;profit&rdquo; was a dirty word.  I could never understand the party's support for semi-State bodies such as CIE which are soulless impersonal bodies &mdash; I believe the Leas-Cheann Comhairle was associated with such a body &mdash; ostensibly operating in the interest of workers but in which workers are treated as robots without interest or a feeling that they belong.  How can employment in bodies such as CIE be more spiritually uplifting <Col N="1114" /> than in private industry?  Would it not seem more sensible that workers be allocated shares in them free or at nominal cost in proportion to their years of service? Would that not motivate workers much more, giving them a say in the operation of their company?  Why not hand over these bodies such as CIE to the workers?  That was done successfully in Malta with the shipyards.  The Prime Minister, Dom Mintoff, said the Government could not afford them and they gave them to the workers.  The response was magnificent and productivity increased fourfold.  I went there and saw the result. Why is it that we cannot learn a lesson from that?</P>
    <P>That is the position, as I see it, with semi-State bodies.  I do not think the country can afford the luxury of semi-State bodies which are inefficient and a constant drain on the Exchequer I cannot understand how the present structures of our semi-State bodies, which deprive their workers of active participation and a share in the profits, can be honestly defended by the Labour Party, the most ardent supporters of semi-State bodies. The item is now opportune for a serious debate in the House on this question of semi-State bodies and the role they must play in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be profits if we get worker participation.  Might I ask the Minister of State to defer his contribution until I have finished mine.  Unless we apply ourselves seriously to this question there will be a further drain on our natural resources, never restoring balance to our national finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might refer to the latest semi-State body, Telecom Éireann, another company with the potential to make considerable profit.  Their only means of doing so is through the creation of a State monopoly. <Col N="1115" /> What have Telecom Éireann planned for their workers?  Will they have participation in the company?  Not as I see the position.  They will have guaranteed employment, but one must ask: is that sufficient nowadays?  Would it not be in the better interests of the public and employees if they both could acquire shares in that company?  The State would benefit, the employees could be given preferential shares, and that semi-State body becoming much more efficient would be to the benefit of the public.</P>
    <P>Might I pose the question: what is the difference between State and private monopoly when the workers are not the beneficiaries?  The PAYE taxpayer is paying a disproportionate part of his income in tax.  Unless we can satisfactorily come forward with some alternative source of revenue to the Exchequer we may find a serious social upheaval on our hands.  There is no incentive to work; it is as simple as that.  The present Government have chosen to ignore the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation.  The Taoiseach has said that with the fiscal rectitude his Government are applying we shall in a few years reap the reward of a higher living standard and lower taxes.  Beyond those words there is no guarantee.  It is a very simple statement to make, but it offers nothing because the budget offers nothing &mdash; he cannot offer anything to the public.</P>
    <P>It is difficult to expect workers, overburdened with this tax, to accept such promises when they have been deluded before.  It is so ridiculous to ask that, as proof of our sincerity, of the Government's sincerity and as an earnest of their intentions, the Government agree an immediate percentage reduction in PAYE right across the board, giving refunds to taxpayers by way of tax rebate certificates redeemable in, say, five, six or seven years' time?  What is so preposterous about that?  That would be the best way of telling the workers we mean business, that we are serious about it, that we will issue tax rebate certificates now, redeemable in five to seven years' time.  This would restore the flagging <Col N="1116" /> morale of our workers and at no immediate cost to the State.  Can one imagine what incentive this would be to workers?</P>
    <P>That is a subject that should be debated in this House.  We need the collective minds of the Members of this House applied to problems such as these.  We need innovative measures, but they are not forthcoming from those benches.  The public want it, the public demand it.  One might ask: is it too proposterous to suggest that perhaps the depopulated area of Connacht province be declared a low tax zone?  In such circumstances could one imagine the influx of foreign business tycoons there?  Can one imagine the impact this would have on Government Departments which have been endeavouring to decentralise but meeting such resistance?  Is that such a ludicrous suggestion? Remember Berlin &mdash; the German Government introduced a low tax zone there with tremendous success. This is not my idea; it has been done before.  Is it too much to suggest that perhaps a Government representative go and examine such a system?  Remember also the Isle of Man, an area smaller than Connacht, a very lucrative island because of its low tax status.</P>
    <P>The present policy of the Government &mdash; borrowing on the home market and thereby shoving up interest rates &mdash; is creating havoc for Irish business people and a serious disincentive to business investment.  Is it any wonder there is such reluctance to invest in private industry when interest rates of 14 per cent and more can be obtained without any risk? They have declared themselves to be totally against foreign borrowing.  That is understandable in the present climate of uncertain interest rates but it should be possible to borrow at acceptable rates and not start a domestic money market of funds for private investment.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach is an honourable man. There are 15 honourable men in Government &mdash; well intentioned, I have no doubt, but totally inexperienced in the complexity of high finances.  They are being advised by Government economists who themselves are so inherently conservative that no major innovative <Col N="1117" /> changes can be expected.  That is the situation as I see it, and I see little hope of change.  It is little wonder there is such general malaise through the State?  The present Government offer a plan but there is no incentive accompanying that plan.  There is no point in having a goal if it carries no incentive, and that is what is missing.  Their vague, nebulous, meaningless statement gives no firm commitment of the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>If the workers were promised that their tax bill would be reduced to 30 per cent in, say, three to five years, with a maximum of 50 per cent, with a VAT rate of 15 per cent and no higher, that would be positive and the kind of thing needed to stimulate our people, but there is no evidence of that.  That would give the worker something to work for.  Such must be Government commitment to gain the co-operation of our people.  But they should not ask for sacrifices if they cannot offer some positive hope in return.  I would contend we need to motivate our people with offers of tax incentives.  We need to create jobs for the 250,000 odd who are jobless.  We need to come forward with specific proposals for the elimination of poverty in our society.</P>
    <P>Even with regard to the unemployment situation, I do not see how the present enterprise allowance scheme can make much difference to or impact on that problem.  There have been statements to the effect that there are 5,000 applications a year with no indication of the success or otherwise of the scheme.  But they tend to delude the public that the scheme is successful.  We must be told how many of those applications were approved.</P>
    <P>Let us be honest about it.  We have got to be more radical.  We must seriously consider early retirement to provide more jobs in the market place for our young people.  If we feel that early retirement is too dramatic could we not then arrange a phased retirement, shortening the working week for those aged 60 and bringing in young people to replace them, again on a phased basis of two to three <Col N="1118" /> days a week initially?  Where is the innovation from this Government?  I am afraid they are not willing to experiment with such ideas, or is it that they listen too much to conservative departmental thinking?  That is very obvious to me. I cannot see how such a phased early retirement scheme could be seriously resisted once we arrange for proper benefits to be paid for those opting for early retirement.  It should not be beyond the ingenuity of the Minister and his Department to devise a satisfactory scheme.</P>
    <P>I might suggest another idea to the present Government.  Could we say for every worker employed by a company over and above their present workforce the Department might consider paying a contribution towards the workers wages of a sum equivalent to the unemployment benefit for, say, a period of six months? The cost of such a scheme to the State would be nil, but the return to the State by way of worker paying income tax and PRSI would be enormous.  The return to the firm employing the worker could be enormous also, and to the worker himself a boost to his morale with, in turn, a considerable reduction in the dole queue. There are so many jobs that could be got in companies but we must assist them.  It would entail no cost to the State and the unemployment numbers could be halved by the implementation of such a suggestion. Of course there would be need for stipulation to the effect that the firm do not exploit workers and also that no worker could be dismissed by the company for a new worker.  Each worker under the scheme would have to be paid full wages and recruited from the employment exchange.  The return to the State could be enormous and would help to eliminate the black economy.</P>
    <P>Why could we not have a clean up programme for public buildings?  This is normal work which should be done to prevent deterioration and not just to employ people.  The saving to the State would be enormous if a scheme of this nature was implemented.</P>
    <P>We must apply ourselves to these problems and come forward with ideas.  I read <Col N="1119" /> the speeches made by the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and I did not see anything in them which will stimulate the economy or offer hope to the people.  The Taoiseach said that after three successive budgets of a radical and imaginative kind, three years of low inflation rates and rising employment, with unemployment beginning to fall as the special measures introduced by the Government start to take effect, the electorate would in 1987 respond to good Government and bad opposition.  Everything seems to be in terms of voters, not people.  I do not understand the Taoiseach's reference to three successive budgets of a radical and imaginative kind.  Where are they?  One third of the Taoiseach's speech was devoted to a vilification of the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>

      <P>Despite all the gloomy forecasts, this country has great potential under proper leadership.  We have a well educated, young population and considerable natural resources sufficient to ensure a proper standard of living for all our people.  There is a great danger that we could talk ourselves into a state of despair.  President Roosevelt said that we had nothing to fear but fear itself.  Of course there are difficulties, but these can be overcome with proper leadership. People need to be motivated and we must provide the challenges necessary to stimulate the economy.  We must rid society of the selfishness that exists and which is at the root of many of our problems.  The unemployed, the handicapped, the aged and PAYE workers are making all the sacrifices and sacrifices should be made at the top.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regrettably, many sections of society are not prepared to make sacrifices. Indeed, the recession could be a challenge, and we should not be held back by the conservative elements in Government Departments.  Bureaucracy has a stranglehold on the country and is stopping many ideas from coming to fruition. There are jobs in abundance to be created <Col N="1120" /> but, in order to achieve this, the people in authority must have the will and determination to do so.  We must offer something to the people who are at present losing heart.  We could reduce the dole queue by half within a year with a little effort.  If we did this, we could restore morale and start a crusade to bring back prosperity and pride to our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was elected to the Dáil approximately three years ago and in that short period I have heard a number of budget speeches from different Ministers. Each time a budget is introduced Members of the Opposition come in here and harangue the Minister.  We have just listened to such a speech from Deputy Dr. John O'Connell who, at the end of his contribution, tried to temper his attitude towards the Government by suggesting that there is hope for the future.  He seems to have missed a lot that has gone on over the last two years and to have forgotten that, when Senator Dr. Martin O'Donoghue was Minister for Finance, he proposed schemes to provide employment including an expansion of the health boards, and the number of people employed in the boards has increased since 1977 from 20,000 to approximately 40,000 at present.  Deputy Dr. O'Connell was very concerned about the PAYE workers, but I should like to ask them if the country has benefited from such a big increase in the number employed in the health boards.  Where has this expansion led us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government inherited what has been described by other Deputies as a rag bag economy crippled by stagnation. They have tried to marshal the finances of the country.  Most independent commentators agree that the Minister for Finance has made strenuous efforts, which have been successful, in bringing our financial difficulties under some kind of control.  In 1984 the Minister predicted that the economy would return to the path of growth last year and, indeed, that was the case after a number of years of virtual stagnation.  In 1984 our exports contributed overwhelmingly to the <Col N="1121" /> increase of national production of approximately 2 per cent, which was quite an achievement considering that the home market and demand made very little contribution to the growth in the economy.  Of course, Deputy Dr. O'Connell did not hear anything about that, as he has been away for the last number of years.  When a Deputy of his stature harangues the Government he should prove his sincerity by making a personal gesture.  I suggest that he should return his income for the last two years to the Exchequer.  That would be the correct thing to do and would be a very generous gesture.  If he did this PAYE workers would appreciate his sincerity.  Deputy Dr. O'Connell's criticism of the budget was of a personal nature in attacking the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>Was the Taoiseach correct when he said that after three radical and imaginative budgets he expected the electorate to respond to the Government?  I understood what the Taoiseach was saying.  I do not have the lack of imagination which Deputy O'Connell seems to have.  There are two further budgets to be introduced. This budget is consistent with the targets in the national plan and the Taoiseach has every reason to be confident.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been at pains at all times to undermine confidence.  If they could destroy confidence in this country they would be happy because that would bring down this Government.  They want power for power's sake.  We witnessed that the other day when Deputy O'Malley was turfed out of the Fianna Fáil Party because he dared to make one point or another about how this country was going.  The Government are not trying to keep power for power's sake but have tried to bring order to our finances.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that in 1982 the Government was short lived.  The budget which had been introduced was overspent by £800 million by July 1983.  The world bankers then stepped in and said that this country was insolvent.  The reason we are in Government now is that the Opposition did not live within their targets.  If this Government have done nothing else they have at least shown that they are <Col N="1122" /> prepared to live within the financial constraints. That is an achievement.  I hope the people realise that the Government understand their problems and will try to relieve them the best way they can.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell suggested that the State could borrow in the EMS.  He said the Minister for Finance was wrong not to do so.  It was as simple as the Government walking in any day to a bank, say in Germany, and borrowing.  Deputy O'Connell never heard of financial queues and does not know that other countries borrow within the EMS.  That would be an easy solution to our problems.</P>
    <P>The Government have borrowed substantially abroad and on the domestic market.  It was in an effort to keep the balance between domestic and foreign borrowing that domestic rates went up last year.  The Minister was acting in the national interest.  We continuously hear simplistic solutions from Deputy O'Kennedy. The other day Deputy Haughey said on radio that the Government had over-borrowed and that if he was in power he would have borrowed in the EMS system which would have saved £400 million.  He said he would have put that into the building industry.  Deputy Haughey was Minister for Finance at one stage, and he should remember that.  It is suggested that the Coalition have indulged in cruel borrowing and that the Minister borrowed in America rather than in Germany or Holland because he gets on better in America.  The simplistic approach of the Opposition must be admired.  People would believe it except for the fact that in 1982, when Deputy Haughey found that the financial institutions of the world were not prepared to lend any more to this country, he started to cut back.  I remember the screams from the health boards when they were told that this and that was gone.  Fianna Fáil put down a motion about the health board cuts.  There were very savage cuts brought in by Fianna Fáil in 1982, far more severe than anything this Government have brought in.  As far as the Opposition are concerned, they should be given <i>carte blanche</i> when it comes to <Col N="1123" /> economic matters.</P>
    <P>There was some improvement in the position in 1984 and one of the things that contributed to that was the fact that the rate of inflation came down.  I remember various sections of the economy crying out about our terrible inflation rate, in particular the farmer organisations. They were at pains to say that the Government had not taken any action on inflation and that they did not understand the trauma farmers experienced as a result of inflation.  This Government reduced inflation from approximately 20 per cent to 6 per cent.  That is an achievement, and is something Deputy O'Connell ignored.  The deterioration in the national finances was checked and there was a marked improvement in the balance of external payments.</P>
    <P>I will recall for the House the deficits we have had in the balance of external payments.  In 1981 it was £1,595 million or 15.1 per cent of GNP.  In 1982 it was £1,316 million or 10.9 per cent of GNP. In 1983 it was £863 million or 6.5 per cent of GNP; and in 1984 it was £720 million or 5 per cent of GNP.  Those figures are contained in an article by Brendan Menton in the Allied Irish Bank's <i>Review.</i> It is suggested in that document that there will be further improvements in 1985, although they will be moderate.  They will not be as expansive as the growth Deputy O'Connell looked for.  He was wrong to suggest that it would be possible to reduce unemployment from 234,000 to 112,000 in one year.  That is not possible.  Why has he resorted to the ridiculous and why have the Opposition resorted to these misguided tactics?  Why do they tell the people to take this leap into the unknown and that it will produce this magic solution they have in the back of their heads?</P>
    <P>Of course, Deputy O'Connell's contribution was very constructive.  He said the 15 Members of the Government were good men but had no initiative.  Innovation of the kind we have seen from Fianna Fáil has only led us into financial ruin instead of taking us out of it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Kenny referred to the emphasis being placed on the budget deficit <Col N="1124" /> by some Fianna Fáil speakers and their implying that if they were in power there would be an enormous reduction in this respect &mdash; a reduction which, according to them, could be effected easily and painlessly.  Some people opposite suggested that State companies be disposed of, but I would remind them that some semi-State companies are profitable.  It is ludicrous to suggest that the Irish economy would benefit overnight by way of the sale of semi-State company shares.  Do Fianna Fáil believe that there are people merely waiting to buy such shares in their present state?</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell emphasised the need for worker participation in profit-sharing schemes and he accused the Government of negligence in that respect. The Deputy might like to hear that only last week one of the few semi-State companies making a profit, Aer Rianta, set up an industrial council which includes workers and that they will operate a worker participation scheme.  Legislation will be introduced shortly to provide for the scheme.  The Government are aware of the necessity for worker participation. The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism has encouraged profit-sharing schemes for workers and also worker participation on boards.  That is the way forward.  It is the way by which employees can have confidence in their companies.  A new and imaginative format is to be adopted in respect of the Aer Rianta worker participation scheme. The scheme will allow for extensive powers and representations for all unions.  One union who have only one member with the company are being represented on the industrial council by that member.  That is an indication of how democratic the semi-State bodies are, of how forward looking they are, with the assistance and guidance of the Government.</P>
    <P>The 1985 budget changes should result in an increase of 2 per cent in personal consumption.  That has been the real problem in the economy.  The home demand has made virtually no contribution. There are reasons for believing that an increase in domestic consumption will help to generate confidence in the economy. <Col N="1125" /> Opposition spokesmen have made the point in regard to the budget deficit that public expenditure will increase by ½ per cent.  By modern standards that is not an extraordinary increase.  While it is not in the direction we would wish to be going, at least the budget will result in maintaining the present position and in giving the opportunity for the domestic economy to grow.  Together with that, the volume of exports will increase by about 9½ per cent, and this should contribute to an increase in employment.</P>
    <P>I agree that unemployment is at a very high level, but some Deputies seem to be confused about the rate of increase in unemployment on the industrial scene and the reduction that has been occurring generally for a number of years.  This is a very important aspect in so far as the export area is concerned.  I do not agree with the thesis propounded, particularly by Deputy O'Connell, that the public service and the services generally are the means by which we will improve our overall level of unemployment.  I consider the answer to our unemployment problems to rest totally with the amount of native raw material we can process and export so as to earn valuable international currency.</P>
    <P>The budget is expected to result in growth rate of 2.7 per cent.  These various assumptions are based on such factors as growth in the US economy.  The American economy grew by approximately 7 per cent in 1984 and on the basis of present trends it is likely to grow steadily again in 1985.  World trade is expected to expand and as a result of the various budgetary measures personal disposable income should rise by about 7 per cent in money terms.  This has been approximately the level of wage agreements entered into so far.  The increase in real disposable income will be of the order of 1 per cent and that is another achievement for the Government.  It will represent the first real increase in disposable income in the past four years.</P>
    <P>Rome was not built in a day but the targets set out by the Government in their national plan are achievable.  The Government were not over ambitious in <Col N="1126" /> that plan though they have been criticised on that account.  For too long we have suffered from the misconception that confidence in the economy is a matter which rests only with one party or with one set of leaders.  The Government inherited a very bad economic and financial mess.  They have tried to rectify that and their targets for the years 1985 to 1987 should inspire confidence in the economy.  In addition, the 1984 budget contained provisions for the improvement of employment on the domestic front by way of the use of venture capital. I regret that not very much use has been made of this provision.  I understand that the banks are reticent about becoming involved in the scheme and have not set up funds for that purpose.  Some people tell me that there is a need for a change in the trust legislation.  Consequently, I urge the Minister to include the necessary amendments in that regard in the Finance Bill so as to allow for greater participation in this very laudable scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister has indicated his intention to pursue tax collection more vigorously in an effort to reduce the black economy.  There are people who are avoiding their tax payments.  Calculations of the amounts involved in this respect have varied from time to time.  In some instances publication of figures by the Revenue Commissioners has been counter productive and very alarming.  In some cases the figures do not add up at all.  At the year end an amount of tax remains unpaid.</P>
    <P>I urge the Minister for Finance to discuss with the Revenue Commissioners statements about outstanding tax and how shortfalls are arrived at.  The impression has been created that if the Minister for Finance takes out his whip and gets the Revenue Commissioners into line they will find the crock of gold at the end of the black economy rainbow and that this tax is there for the great relief of PAYE workers.  Anybody who has examined the records will know that these figures, which were published early in the year, are grossly exaggerated and used out of context especially by people who <Col N="1127" /> are attacking the basis of this democratic State.</P>
    <P>The Minister's rationalisation of VAT is the engine which will inject growth into the domestic economy.  Many people were very disheartened about the VAT increase.  Deputy O'Connell pointed out that this Government brought in the 65 per cent rate in PAYE and the 35 per cent VAT rate.  Of course, he forgot to mention the circumstances in which the Government brought in those rates.  The Government were elected in November 1982 and had to bring in a budget based on Estimates published in October of that year.  Some of the figures did not unite, consequently the emphasis had to be on trying to keep this country solvent by tax. Unfortunately, that bore heavily on the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>The Government have recognised the severity of these measures and have moved in to rationalise them.  In rationalising VAT they have brought hope to the tourism industry.  Forecasts for the western seaboard, as Deputy Kenny has said, are for a bumper year in 1985.  Some tourist sources in my constituency in Clare say that advanced bookings are 50 per cent up on last year.  In our constituency now accommodation is almost unavailable.  I heard recently that a group of European tourists who are to come to Clare in 1985 wished to reserve accommodation in a good hotel and failed to find bed nights.  At least the facilities available will be utilised to the full, and this should lead to some employment in my county.  I am grateful to the Minister for that.</P>
    <P>I am unhappy about the 10 per cent imposed on the building industry.  However, if we are to suggest any improvement there we must examine the total State package for house building.  We have the £3,000 mortgage subsidy, the £1,750 house grant and in the national plan the Government announced a £5,000 grant to people who vacate local authority houses.  In the aggregate these grants should help to maintain the rate of house building.  The dispute between the building industry and the Government <Col N="1128" /> outlines a few of the problems.  The speculative market has been hit badly. However, the Minister for Finance has given a great opportunity to speculative builders to avail of the time up to 1 May to dispose of their houses.  This will give an impetus to movement in that regard.</P>
    <P>Contrary to what Deputy Dr. O'Connell said, in the area of legislation and social welfare this Government have index linked social welfare payments. The Government have been consistent in doing that.  However, I have one group in mind for whom I appealed last year in this House.  They are old age pensioners who do not qualify by virtue of loss of credits due to a change in legislation between 1953 and 1970.  The Ombudsman and the Social Welfare appeals officers have recommended a number of these people for inclusion in the system. These people are suffering because of an anomaly.  I urge the Minister to examine this matter and bring in the necessary amendment to the Social Welfare Bill which will enable them to be included.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the Minister has made as good an adjustment in the economy through the instrument of the budget as was possible and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>There are 234,000 people unemployed.  That is the measure of the Government's failure.  I have stated on numerous occasions in this House that unemployment is the greatest problem facing the country.  In view of that fact, a budget is good or bad in relation to what it does or does not do to increase employment.  The 234,000 people unemployed are proof of the failure of past Coalition budgets.  The loud applause from the Government benches for the present budget was not the result of any deep consideration of what the budget contained; rather it was a response to a well presented public relations speech.  The announcement of the huge increase in the numbers unemployed two days after the Budget Statement brought the Government and the Deputies opposite rapidly down to earth again.  When large numbers of people are <Col N="1129" /> out of work, when young people in ever increasing numbers are leaving school with little prospect of employment, when industries are closing down with frightening regularity, then judgment on the soundness and efficacy of the budget must be related to what it will do to provide jobs.  This budget is doing nothing to improve employment prospects.</P>
      <P>In my constituency of Louth over 8,000 people are on the live register, unemployed. That is frightening.  It is understandable that they all watched for a sign through this budget that the Government were going to grapple realistically with our shocking unemployment problem. This budget made no provision to tackle that problem.  Looking at the Government's programme <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987</i> we should have anticipated that this budget would have done nothing for our unemployed people. After all, the Government in that programme accepted that unemployment would increase by the time the programme ended in 1987.  However, one would have thought that since that programme was announced the Government would have had a change of heart and would have given some consideration to the plight of the unemployed.</P>
      <P>One might have hoped that the Labour Party particularly, who are so fond of using the word &ldquo;compassion&rdquo;, would have insisted on positive steps being taken to cut down the numbers of unemployed people.  That was not be.  It appears the Labour Party believe the level of unemployment is tolerable despite their verbal protestations.  To me it is shocking that in my constituency 8,000 people are on the unemployment register with all the misery and hardship that entails for them and for their dependants. I shall persist in pressing for measures to be taken that will improve their employment prospects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On numerous occasions in this House I pointed out that with proper planning the building and construction industry could provide jobs of a permanent kind and provide them quickly; and I expressed my concern at the neglect by the Coalition Government of this vital <Col N="1130" /> industry and their failure to finance it adequately.  In this budget the Government take a further step towards damaging that industry.  They have ensured that employment will fall further by doubling the VAT rate on the industry from 5 per cent to 10 per cent, having already increased the rate from 3 per cent to 5 per cent in a previous budget.  This VAT increase will have a disastrous effect on house building, and when one takes account of the fact that since this Government took office the industry has been declining rapidly this new imposition will have a very bad effect.  It is obvious to me that any re-allocation of funds into the construction of roads and schools as outlined in the Government's programme <i>Building on Reality</i> will be negatived by the tax increase and it will mean also that the volume increase will be very small</P>
    <P>There will also be a considerable decline in the value of the £5,000 grant for local authority tenants who wish to buy their own house because of the increase in the price of houses caused by the new VAT rate.  I was very interested in the defence made by the Minister for Finance, in reply to complaints made about the increased VAT on the building industry, when he said that in respect of the increase on a particular type of house it would cost only an extra £800.  Clearly the Minister is out of touch with reality. Is he aware that many people were unable to pay the original price of a house, never mind paying an additional £800?</P>
    <P>It is obvious that the increase in the VAT rate will increase the price of new houses and will make it even more difficult for people to buy them.  In itself that will reduce further the numbers employed in the industry as well as resulting in a reduction in the numbers employed in ancillary industries.  The increase in the price of £30,000 house will be approximately £1,500 and for people who were at their wits' end trying to buy a house before this increase was announced their prospects of buying a house in the future are very bleak.</P>
    <P>The Government point to the increase of £750 in the grant for the purchase of a <Col N="1131" /> house.  However, this applies only to first time buyers, but even a first time buyer who purchases a £30,000 house must find an extra £750.  It should also be pointed out that the reduction in VAT on materials used in house construction will have no effect on house prices because the building companies who are registered for VAT will have it refunded. There has been a significant drop in the level of private house building in the past few years and the level of completions has fallen considerably also.  The increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent will accentuate this decline and will increase the numbers on the housing lists of the already hard-pressed local authorities. As a result, many people who are already on those lists will have to wait for a considerable time before a house becomes available.</P>
    <P>Building is our second largest industry and is worth more than £1.8 billion but the Government have failed to face up to the need to develop it.  We were told in the document <i>Building on Reality</i> that the Government proposed to stimulate construction.  They have a rather peculiar interpretation of what the word &ldquo;stimulate&rdquo; means.  Even if they reach the objective outlined in their programme &mdash; and present policies, as far as I can see, show how unlikely that will be &mdash; it would mean by their own admission an increase in the workforce of the building and construction industry of only 1,000 workers by 1987.  That is in an industry where the workforce has already been cut in half. Surely the Government are not suggesting that an increase in tax on the building and construction industry is the way to stimulate it?  Adding this extra 5 per cent to the price of a house, together with the increased mortgage rate, will ensure that there will be a considerable drop in the number of house purchasers, a drop in house building and, consequently, a further drop in employment.  The Government need to adopt a completely new approach to this vital industry.  Such a change is needed immediately.  However, if one is to judge by this budget, the <Col N="1132" /> Government have not the political will to help and it is likely that nothing will be done.</P>
    <P>The changes by the building societies to increase the mortgage rate will mean a reduction in the number of people purchasing houses, as well as contributing to the very considerable problems facing those who have already got mortgages from the building societies.  As far as I can remember, the Minister suggested to the building societies that they should impose the charges on the depositors rather on those who had mortgages, but nobody knows better than the Minister himself that if these charges were imposed on the depositors they would simply go elsewhere with their money with a result that less money would be available for house building in the future.</P>
    <P>On a number of occasions in this House I mentioned that when the Government took office they cut back on the Fianna Fáil public capital programme by £220 million and I said this would prove dissastrous.  I pointed out that the outgoing Government had published their Estimates before the election and they had also put forward a policy document.  It was clear both from the publication of the Estimates and the policy document that the current and capital budgets had been cut to the bone.  Nevertheless, when the Coalition Government came into office they cut the Fianna Fáil public capital programme by £220 million.  I pointed out that there would be dire consequences because of this cut not only on the building and construction industry as a whole but on the economy generally.  It was obvious to me that unemployment would rise rapidly not only among building workers but among workers in ancillary industries.  I made the case that such a huge cut was bad economics and would create a deflationary cycle which would intensify as time went on and its effects would permeate society.  My forecast unfortunately has proved only too true.</P>
    <P>There are now 45,000 building workers unemployed, construction work has been slowing down and redundancies occurred <Col N="1133" /> in Cement Limited Drogheda for the first time in their history.  In all these circumstances I would have expected the Government to rethink the financing of the building and construction industry.  I felt they would not allow such a situation to continue in a vital industry but perhaps I was expecting too much.  The forecast in <i>Building on Reality</i> was that they expected only 1,000 extra workers to be employed in the building and construction industry by the end of 1987, leaving 44,000 building workers still unemployed. This should have forewarned me that this Government care little for the industry and the increase to 10 per cent of VAT on this industry proves once again how little regard they have for it.</P>
    <P>The building and construction industry provide homes, schools, hospitals, factories and the infrastructure needed for development.  They provide work not only for building workers but for all engaged in ancillary industries, such as cement production, furniture making, electrical supplies, household goods and so on.  New homes are badly needed for young people.  If one is to judge by this budget, Government policy is very deficient in this vital area and must be reconsidered and revised immediately.  I had hoped that when the Minister met the representatives of the building and construction industry to discuss the implications of the budget on that industry he would agree to make the necessary changes in the Finance Bill to revitalise this industry which can help to turn the tide of unemployment more quickly and efficiently than anything else.</P>
    <P>Even the banks are proposing that there should be more capital expenditure. I read in the Allied Irish Bank's <i>Review,</i> Economic Outlook 1985, that the size and intractibility of our unemployment problem makes a strong case for increased expenditure in worthwhile labour-intensive investment.  I do not know a more worthwhile labour-intensive investment than the building and construction industry.</P>
    <P>It was ironic that on the day it was announced that the Clarks factory was closing down, the Minister for Finance <Col N="1134" /> announced a 10 per cent VAT rate was being imposed on footwear, on leather normally used for the the manufacture and repair of footwear, soles, heels and insoles.  In reply to supplementary questions on a Private Notice Question submitted by Deputy Kirk and me on the closure of the Clarks factory, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism stated that his Minister of State had been in touch with Clarks factory for more than a year endeavouring to help the firm overcome their difficulties.  The Minister obviously knew the conditions that existed in that factory.  I expressed amazement at that time, and I am still amazed, that any Minister could even contemplate putting a 10 per cent tax on footwear when he knew that the largest footwear factory in the country, with 370 jobs, was in jeopardy.  If the company had hoped to keep the factory in operation this tax would have ended all hope. The company did not make that effort but that was no excuse for imposing a 10 per cent tax on footwear.</P>
    <P>When I asked supplementary questions on this matter the Minister said that the tax would be 10 per cent on all footwear, home produced and imported, and that there would be no disadvantage for home produced goods.  In fact, he said it could be an advantage for home produced footwear.  That is clearly nonsense. Clarks produce high quality shoes and therefore they would be more costly than most imported footwear.  Obviously the higher priced shoes would be more severely hit by the 10 per cent increase and this will create very serious problems for other shoe manufacturers and their workers.</P>
    <P>The closure of Clarks factory is a severe blow to the town of Dundalk which developed over the years because of this industry.  The shoe industry is part of this town's industrial tradition and therefore this closure is a grievous blow to the morale of the town which has been ravaged by unemployment and where trade and commerce have come to a virtual standstill over the past number of months.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1135" /> There are 8,000 registered unemployed in my constituency.  Is it any wonder that in a recent report the northeastern development organisation stated that County Louth could be described as a disadvantaged area?  It is of vital importance that County Louth should be immediately classified as a designated area.  The five Border counties on this side and the seven district councils on the other side, which form the Border area, all qualify for the maximum financial aid and incentives available from the respective development agencies, except County Louth which is not classified as a designated area.  That situation might have been acceptable some time ago when industry was thriving in that county, but in recent times with the dramatic downturn in industry, trade and commerce and when unemployment numbers have increased so rapidly, there can no longer be a case for the exclusion of County Louth.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent VAT on footwear generally will seriously jeopardise employment in other footwear companies and will place the jobs of the workers in those factories in grave danger. In the main Irish products are of a much better quality than imported footwear and so cost more.  The price of Irish shoes with the tax added will make them less competitive on the Irish market as well as on the export market so that fewer Irish shoes will be sold.  The Government must have been aware of the problems facing the footwear industry.  I am amazed that the Government would even contemplate introducing a tax to further damage the industry, but that the Labour Party should troop through the lobbies to vote for such an increase is incomprehensible.</P>
    <P>In relation to the closure of Clarks I am not happy with the reasons put forward by Clarks for the closure of their factory.  They let their employees down very badly.  For a number of years Clarks have done very well in this country and with a little bit of sympathetic consideration they could have continued their operations in Dundalk.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1136" /> I do not accept the nonsense being put forward by the Labour Party as an excuse, that had we not entered the EC our boot and shoe industry would be secure.  The reality is that had we not entered the EC we would not have our foreign based industry which employs about half of our industrial workers. What level of tariff would we need to keep out cheap imported shoes, if we were isolated?  Imported shoes in some of our stores cost £6 a pair and a 100 per cent tariff would raise the cost only to £12, a figure still well below the price of quality Irish shoes.  If we put exceptionally high tariffs on imported shoes other countries would retaliate by putting high tariffs on our exports.</P>
    <P>The 10 per cent VAT was imposed by a Fine Gael-Labour Coalition.  The Deputies in the Labour Party voted for it.  I make this statement because I have heard Labour Party speakers attempting to excuse themselves by stating that the Irish footwear industry was in a bad way. I do not understand the logic of that argument.  Is it suggested that, when an industry is in a bad way, the way to revive it is to slap on a 10 per cent tax?  I was shocked when Labour Deputies voted for this 10 per cent VAT imposition on the footwear industry.  The Labour Party Deputies did not refer, in their contributions in respect of the 10 per cent tariff, to the fact that this will increase the price of shoes.  The prospect which our unemployed people and their families now face is that, difficult though it was to buy a pair of shoes before the budget, it will be more difficult now and many will have to do without.  The increase in the VAT on clothing from 8 per cent to 10 per cent will have a similar effect &mdash; the poorer people will be adversely affected.</P>
    <P>For a period before Christmas and since then there has been a considerable differential between tax rates here and in the North and this has caused an exodus of shoppers from here into the North. Millions of pounds were spent by shoppers in the North.  Cars and buses have travelled in a procession day after day to and from the North with shoppers.  The <Col N="1137" /> effect on employment here was catastrophic in industrial employment and in the retail and wholesale businesses.  My constitutency was devastated.  We urged the Minister for Finance to make the necessary changes in the tax system to counteract the situation, which was creating unemployment problems for the people and financial problems for the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his budget went some way to meet the case we consistently made.  However he then proceeded to negative the advantages accuring from the measures he took by increasing the price of petrol by 10p a gallon thereby increasing the differential in the price of petrol here and in the Six Counties.  This is a serious matter particularly in my constituency. About a year ago there was a considerable difference in the price of petrol here and in the North.  Many people went across the Border to buy petrol and, having gone there, invariably bought their household requirements as well.  Once again more people will be tempted to go across the Border, to the detriment of the business people in County Louth.</P>
    <P>The business people in my constituency were badly hit by this in the past.  The change in the price of petrol will create similar problems now.  I would have thought that the Government, knowing what this area had suffered in the past, would have been slow to create conditions which will result in a similar experience for these people.  As far as I can remember, either the Minister or somebody on that side of the House suggested that this 10p increase in the price of petrol would be absorbed by a reduction in the price of petrol generally.  Looking at the situation now this is very unlikely to be the case.</P>
    <P>In 1983 the Coalition budget increased the price of petrol by about 35p a gallon. The immediate effect of that increase was to direct the attention of motorists to the fact that considerable sums could be saved by going North for petrol and so we had an exodus of cars across the Border.  The first to be affected were the petrol filling stations on this side of the <Col N="1138" /> Border.  A number of them were forced to close down.  People calculated that they would save a certain number of pounds on the transaction and they then proceeded to buy goods in those towns across the Border.  The psychological effect was that, after buying the petrol and buying goods with the amount of money they had saved on the petrol, they would not be any worse off had they simply purchased the petrol in my constituncy.</P>
    <P>The new increase of 10p a gallon on petrol will reactivate the trek across the Border, and not only will garage proprietors and petrol pump owners lose out but so will the wholesalers and retailers in my constituency.  I would emphasise that, apart from relatively small number of categories of goods, there is little or nothing that can be purchased in the North which is of better value than is available in my constituency; but because the Government by increasing the price of petrol have made it more attractive to go across the Border for petrol I fear that shopkeepers in my constituency will continue to lose in a big way.</P>
    <P>Another aspect of the increased price of petrol is that large numbers of people have to go to work in their cars.  Already the price of petrol was very high and the cost of travelling to work and home was a considerable drain on weekly pay packets. The increase of 10p a gallon will increase the cost on the overburdened workers.  To add to this, we have an increase in road tax.  The annual tax on private cars has been increased by 50p per h.p. for cars under 8 h.p., by £1 per h.p. for cars between 9 and 15 h.p., and by £2 per h.p. on cars of 16 h.p. and more.  The manner in which this was put before the House was a good example of a public relations job: it looks better to say 50p per horsepower for small cars than to give the total tax payable.</P>
    <P>I will make a special comment on the increase in diesel price which has been increased by 10p a gallon.  In my view this is particularly serious.  For example, it is estimated that the increase will cost between £36,000 and £40,000 for those operating out of the port of <Col N="1139" /> Greenore, a huge increase for hauliers working from a relatively small port. Greenore is the hub of economic activity in the Cooley Peninsula and large numbers of people there earn their living by hauling goods.  They will be badly hit, and the consequence for everybody else as well as the hauliers will be serious.  By increasing the price of diesel the Minister turned his back on the development of remote areas throughout the country. The effect on areas in the west will be similar to that on Cooley.  Indeed, it will be much worse for them because they are much farther away from import and export outlets.  The cost of transporting materials to and from the east coast will be increased and the cost of the distribution of finished products to the various centres throughout the country and to the ports for export will rise.</P>
    <P>We are all too well aware of the keen competition facing Irish goods in both home and foreign markets and this extra 10p a gallon on diesel will reduce the competitiveness of home produced goods which can result in further industrial closures, particularly in remote areas.  I am convinced the Minister did not give sufficient thought to the increase in diesel prices on an already overburdened industry and I suggest to him to reconsider this aspect of the budget.  I have given a practical example in the Cooley Peninsula and if such damage can be done in a small area on the east coast the damage to remote areas will be evident.</P>
    <P>The treatment in this Budget of social welfare recipients is the norm for Coalition Governments.  Over the years Fianna Fáil Governments have endeavoured not just to give increases to compensate for the rate of inflation.  They gave much above the percentage increases in the cost of living and the purpose was to ensure that the living standards of people depending on social welfare benefits would be raised.  We have seen Fianna Fáil Governments giving 25 per cent increases on a number of occasions and this was well above inflationary rates.</P>
    <P>One must remember that this year's <Col N="1140" /> social welfare increases do not take account of the cut in food subsidies last year.  I referred to this at the time because in the budget social welfare recipients were not given any compensation for the cut in food subsidies.  Therefore, the real percentage increase in social welfare payments will be very much below the percentages announced by the Minister.  The food subsidies were halved last year but, as I have said, social welfare recipients got no compensation for it.</P>
    <P>Another disadvantage to social welfare recipients is that this year the increases have been deferred until July.  The normal time for these increases has been April.  The Coalition in one budget put that back until June.  I cannot understand why the Coalition Government should select people who are in most need on whom to make savings.</P>
    <P>With one hand the Minister increased the value of the fuel voucher for those in need but with the other took the increase back.  That was done in a throughly cynical fashion, because on the day before the budget the price of coal was increased considerably by order of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism. That accounted for most of the £1 granted in the budget.  Then in the budget the Minister for Finance increased the VAT rate on fuel.  The social welfare people who would be entitled to the increase in the fuel voucher will not get it until October.  In the meantime they will have to pay the increase in the price of fuel permitted by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and also the increase deliberately imposed by the Minister for Finance in the budget.</P>
    <P>Of course we know the budget is only one facet of the Coalition's taxation system.  In the past two years the Government have imposed taxes at regular intervals. In many instances individuals become aware of the new levies on their incomes only when they become directly affected by the new impositions.  The public generally remain unaware of them.</P>
    <P>We have had vast increases in the price of drugs for people who are entitled to a rebate from health boards.  The amount <Col N="1141" /> payable by such people has been increased in the last two years from £12 under Fianna Fáil to £28.  That is a penalty on those who are ill.  Medical cards have been withdrawn from many old age pensioners and students, thus increasing their outlay for medical attention, all of it without reference to the budget.  Fares were introduced on school buses, creating severe financial problems for numerous families.  If I were to catalogue all the various impositions and charges decided upon and put into operation by this Government over the past two years which increased the costs for every family but which had nothing to do with the budget, I would have little time left to discuss the matter under consideration here, which is, of course, the 1985 budget.</P>
    <P>Might I make a point in respect of water charges?  I must emphasise that the need for such charges is as a result of a decision by the Coalition Government to make available only a 1 per cent increase in finance to local authorities while the inflation rate is over 7 per cent.  That policy was put into operation by the Minister for the Environment, a Labour Party Minister.  To ensure that the water charges will be levied, the Tánaiste, a Labour Minister when Minister for the Environment, steered a Bill through this House giving power to the county managers to impose charges.  All the Labour Deputies voted for that Bill, Fianna Fáil Deputies opposed it.  I stress this to pinpoint the nonsense of the Labour Party in my constituency stating that they oppose water charges when their own Minister is responsible for the need for such charges and when the Labour Deputies voted in favour of giving the manager the power to impose charges.</P>
    <P>I have a question down to the Minister for Energy asking if he is aware of the feasibility study on the gas industry carried out by Coopers and Lybrand and by Congas Engineering of Toronto which showed that it is viable to pipe natural gas across the Border.  The Minister for Energy informed me some time ago that he had to rethink the position in respect of natural gas coming to County Louth because of the breakdown in the negotiations <Col N="1142" /> between the Irish and British Governments.  May I again make the point that the attitude of the British Government in respect of that matter was absolutely deplorable?</P>
    <P>I have never accepted that we should have to wait for an extension of the pipeline into the Six Counties before a supply of natural gas is made available in my constituency.  Now that the survey has been carried out by reputable people and is available and now that it is agreed that it is economic to bring gas north of the Border, there should be no excuse for not proceeding with the pipeline to County Louth.  I would urgently request the Minister for Energy immediately to have the work commenced.  We need natural gas in my constituency.  There is an industry in Drogheda, Premier Periclase, which uses all natural resources except energy.  The only import in respect of that industry is fuel oil.  If natural gas is made available, then fuel oil will no longer be needed and we will have an industry which uses nothing but our own natural resources.  That is a consummation devoutly to be wished.</P>
    <P>There are problems in Dundalk and Kilkenny in respect of the request for natural gas to be made available in both those towns.  I couple the towns because the same company are involved in each case.  I understand from the newspapers that natural gas is being refused to the town of Kilkenny and that there is a danger of the workers there losing their employment.  Ultimately, the same thing would apply in Dundalk if natural gas is not made availablea there.</P>
    <P>Recently I noted that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Energy met a deputation from Kilkenny who urged that natural gas be made available.  The pipelines pass within about three miles of Kilkenny town.  I understand from recent reports that the gas is not being made available, that the Department state that it is not viable.  It is also being said that the decision not to make the natural gas available is not affected purely by economics but rather by ideological approaches, that the Labour Party are not anxious to make the gas available to this company because it is privately owned.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1143" /> I would be very sorry if that were the case.  One must remember that, apart from any other considerations, workers' employment is now in jeopardy.  The most recent announcement I have heard in respect of this matter seems to indicate that the company in Kilkenny will have no alternative but to close down the gas works there, with a resultant loss of employment.  As I said, it is very difficult to understand why it would not be viable to provide natural gas to a town the size of Kilkenny considering the proximity of the natural gas pipeline.  I would strongly urge that the Minister for Energy and his Department quickly re-consider this matter and make a positive decision to provide the area with natural gas.</P>
    <P>Deputy Carey referred to the record of the 1977 Fianna Fáil Government with regard to employment.  He expressed the view that that Government should not have taken steps to create employment and that such employment was all in the public service.  The reality is quite different. The graph of the 1977 to 1979 period showed a worth-while increase in employment generally, and in my constituency in particular.  I am naturally very pleased to note the very considerable increase in employment at that time. If one were to take my constituency, one could hardly suggest that all the jobs there were created in the public sector, except, perhaps, in the telecommunications sector.  More technicians were taken on and I make no apology for that.  I was responsible for urging the Government to make £650 million available for the development of the telecommunications system which was in a very bad state when I took over as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs.  The Government accepted the proposal I put forward and that £650 million was more than had been spent on the telecommunications system from 1922.</P>
    <P>At that time I forecast that by the end of the five year programme I initiated there would be a dramatic change in the position in regard to the provision of phones and in the efficiency of the telephone system.  What I forecast then has <Col N="1144" /> come to pass.  One only has to look at what the position was like at the time I introduced that programme and consider the telecommunications system today to see the enormous advance that has taken place.  As Minister for Posts and Telegraphs I also decided to take the postal and telecommunications services out of the Civil Service.  I set up the two new boards on an interim basis, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann and appointed people of the highest calibre to those boards. The proof of that is the fact that although we have passed through several administrations since then, very few changes in personnel have been made on those boards.  In the near future I believe we will have one of the best telecommunications services in the world.  I mentioned those facts because I read some fairy tales in the media as to how this happened and I thought it was better to put on record how it really happened.</P>
    <P>Between 1977 and 1979 we created a considerable number of new jobs and I am proud of that but a new problem arose in 1979.  We had to deal with the second oil crisis which was of exceptional severity. It shook the economies of the strongest nations in the world, the US and Germany.  The oil crisis in the early seventies affected us but it did not have much impact on the stronger economies. However, the second crisis affected the strongest economies in the world and naturally, that had a severe impact on our economy, and created new problems.</P>
    <P>With 234,000 people unemployed here the value of any budget must lie in the provision made to increase employment. The budget does not do anything to help the unemployed.  However well presented by the Minister as far as the 234,000 unemployed are concerned, as far as the 8,000 unemployed in my constituency are concerned, the budget has been far from helpful.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is a great deal of point to a budget debate of this nature.  To call it a debate is a misnomer.  Frankly, the person in the street has unquestionably forgotten the <Col N="1145" /> immediacy and impact of the budget.  I suggest that we should consider some more mature and sensible way of discussing budgetary measures.  Having listened to most of this morning's debate I am of the view that a debate on the budget might be classified as a state or place of punishment where TDs who may have sinned have to endure for a period before going on to other things.  I am sorry Deputy Faulkner has left because I am anxious to refer to some of the remarks he made.</P>
      <P>The Government might consider some form of referral to a committee system of the budget statement which would allow for line by line analysis and a genuine exchange of views rather than this irrelevant exchange of prejudices and opinions which now characterise much of what has come to be the debate on the budget.  Invariably it is open ended and, quite candidly, is of very little public interest or relevance.</P>
      <P>I heard two speeches this morning from Opposition Members.  I will not comment on Deputy O'Connell's except to say that I did not have a great degree of expectation in that regard.  I was disappointed in what I heard Deputy Faulkner say.  When I was elected to the House in 1977 he was one of the senior Members.  His hour long speech this morning epitomised much of what is regressive and backward looking in our approach to public affairs and the economic and social development of the country.  There was not one positive suggestion or idea in what he said.  On the contrary it was a list of complaints laced with special pleading about his own constituency although it is reasonable that his own constituency should be mentioned. His speech reminded me of the line from one of the works of Shakespeare when he described the school boy as mewling and puking on his way to school.  It was dreary, forlorn, bleak, depressing, uninspired, negative.  If that is the best vision of the country and the hope we can offer our people then the young people will, if they have not already done so, bypass the House in terms of it having any effect on their lives or offering any hope for inspiration in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1146" /> To classify the efforts of the Government in the tones Deputy Faulkner used was a waste of parliamentary time, a disservice to the House and a disservice to his constituents.  People who have served in ministerial rank and been members of the House for many years are obliged to give us better than we have listened to. It is a sad commentary when one bears in mind that in the last week we heard an inspiring speech from a former member of his party and, apparently, the degree of inspirational effect and the degree of integrity and truth which the speech contained was in direct ratio to the political vulnerability which a person in that party has if he offers an idea which has not been approved by the Fuehrer or by whoever is running the party at the time.</P>

I resent the Deputy's repeated references to the Labour Party and his surprise that the Labour Party would do this or that.  This Government are united in their attempt to resolve some of the difficulties of this country.  The Fine Gael Party have as much concern in the social and economic area as has any other party in this House. In many cases their individual members represent constituents who might, at a passing glance, be said to be represented by people about whom Deputy Faulkner spoke.  That kind of mean attempt to divide, and presumably ultimately to conquer, I resent and reject.  I certainly hope that the people of County Louth can be better served than by a speech which, in net effect, asked, if you do not mind, that County Louth be classified as a disadvantaged area.</P>

      <P>I would hope that the people of County Louth would have a better prospect of success and economic development in the future than a simplistic call that their area be classified as disadvantaged as if, somehow, that kind of nonsense in itself would turn on the lights and make the wheels of industry turn in County Louth.  Deputy Faulkner accused this Government of lack of political will.  The essence of the reason this country is in the difficulty it is in is that his party lacked what I would call political &ldquo;won't&rdquo;, the capacity to say no to a series of vested interests and special interest groups who unfortunately were bought off one after the other out of public funds in recent years.  If that is the kind of political will about which Deputy Faulkner is speaking, responding to every whim and request from some interest groups, then I am very pleased indeed that this Government have the guts and courage to stand up and confront that.  I believe that view would be shared by very many people outside the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not see much point in going over the entrails of the budgetary statement which has now been before the House for weeks.  I believe it has long since passed from the minds of the public and now forms part of political or economic history. Instead I should like to make some suggestions which I hope will be of some constructive assistance to the Minister <Col N="1148" /> and the Government as to the way in which we could handle some of the resources this country has in abundance. In general, despite the economic difficulties with which we are confronted and are experiencing, I feel that when we come through these difficulties, the country will be better, more hardened to endure the inevitable economic difficulties and constraints confronting any modern democracy, will be more resilient, self-reliant, have stronger indigenous industry, will be less cushioned by the kind of protectionism which served us well at a certain time but which is no longer a part of the current, international free trade mentality; in other words, a nation independent and proud, self-sustaining, able to compete, and not one which has to depend for its existence on the begging bowl mentality which we heard epitomised, I might say with respect, in my predecessor's speech &mdash; the hand out for &ldquo;gimmes&rdquo; for this or that industry, having some place designated a disadvantaged area, going to the EC for money.</P>
    <P>That is not the kind of nation of which I would like to be a citizen.  I want Ireland to be able to compete on its merits, to have people who are happy in their work, to have work which is self-sustaining which can compete internationally on its merits and not because it has some artificial wall built around it.  This country has to compete in that environment, we cannot hold back that tide, nor can we build a wall around our country.  Recent events in this country do indicate that in some ways, though not necessarily in the economic area only, there are too many walls and barriers built around it.</P>
    <P>I make these comments in a situation in which it is clear that income tax at least cannot be increased for the PAYE worker, though I do not necessarily accept that tax in general has yet reached its ceiling in some areas, in an area in which it is very difficult for any Government &mdash; impossible for our predecessors but very difficult for any Government &mdash; to introduce systematic and effective controls on the growth of public expenditure or cutbacks in certain services.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1149" /> Within that environment there are possibly one or two other options which have not been adequately examined.  One of these is the realisation of State assets, the bringing into full creativity and the realisation of the full potential of dormant assets.  I want to list a couple of these.  The State could very well consider allowing public participation, full democratic ownership by the public, in asset-rich State enterprises.  By that I mean that the public would be able to buy up to a certain percentage, say 30 per cent &mdash; lest people would fear that control might pass from the State, which does not carry any great problems from my point of view but which might do for some &mdash; in industries and enterprises which would allow for the generation of much needed revenues by the State on the one hand.  It would allow the possibility of reducing certain taxation and would give direct public participation. This might mean that policy in such enterprises would be educated and better informed as a result and the actual cash raised could be orientated towards allowing such enterprises to re-equip or modernise from some of the resources so raised.</P>
    <P>I hesitate to give examples of specific companies but I might be a little provocative in this respect.  There is no reason why companies such as Irish Life, the Industrial Credit Company &mdash; which I think have already got a stock exchange quotation &mdash; Bord Telecom and other agencies at present seen as State or semi-State enterprises, many of them set up with vast amounts of public funds, could not now be allowed to develop their full potential, compete in the marketplace and, therefore, be open to the purchase of equity in them by members of the public.  If that were to occur it would be reasonable and sound economic sense and very good for what I might describe as participative democracy.</P>
    <P>A specific example of an area warranting that kind of approach is housing, at present a vastly uneconomic area.  In 1984 the State spent £620 million on housing. Yet we are told that housing provision lags behind by approximately 6,000 units <Col N="1150" /> per year.  The reality is that the housing finance which we give to local authorities increases continuously &mdash; in the case of my local authority some £70 million this year &mdash; but economically it is creating a millstone.  It is not generally known or perceived that every local authority dwelling has in effect an annual subsidy of £4,500 from the taxpayer.  It is not generally known or perceived that the total rental income from all local authority housing stock does not pay for half of the cost of their maintenance never mind making a contribution to capital costs.  I submit that, for economic and social reasons, such a scenario cannot be allowed to continue.  It cannot continue for economic reasons because the money is not there, and because the taxpayer will not continue to pay it, and some Government some day will simply say: enough is enough.</P>
    <P>It should not be allowed to continue for social reasons because it is creating a certain undesirable social outcome. Economically I submit that the Government &mdash; and I would ask the Minister for Finance to consider this in framing budgetary policy &mdash; could spend the money they are now spending on housing, particularly local authority housing, in creating much more productivity.  The way to do that would be to embark on a very substantial, affordable, joint venture housing scheme, using local authorities as agents.  What joint venture means is that, instead of the average cost of a new local authority house at present representing more than the cost of the average private, speculator-built house, a scheme would be devised whereby a local authority would agree a total package with a developer for the design, layout, house types and selling price and would sell to people from their housing lists or as otherwise agreed.</P>
    <P>The land, one of the dormant assets of which I speak, owned all over the country by local authorities would be turned into realisable potential now by getting the building industry committed to turning that dormant asset into housing rather than waiting for some time in the future <Col N="1151" /> when the State may own it.  The developer should be allowed to build under licence.  We should ensure the availability of very generous loans, perhaps change the mathematical requirements laid down for housing layouts and tackle the scandalous situation of house conveyancing costs.  I have never understood why the same house sold five or six times over a period of years has to have an expensive search done on it every time which, of course, has to be paid for by the purchaser. It is reasonable that a house should have a registration book as in the case of an automobile.  The search should be done once and stamped from then on, taking the first search as being authentic and done with integrity.  This would save the public money although I know that my legal friends will not be enamoured of the idea.  Remembering that approximately 40 per cent of the sale price of each house comes back to the Exchequer, a sensible approach could be adopted in relation to joint venture housing and it would pay enormous dividends.</P>
    <P>I would consider going even further.  I see no reason why the money at present spent in the local authority housing area could not be given in principle to people who need housing by means of 100 per cent loans to buy on the open market as they see fit, subject to certain criteria with regard to the maximum amount of the loan, perhaps a means test and other qualifications regarding those who would qualify for such loans.  The effect of the State detaching itself from construction of houses but facilitating people economically to buy houses would be more housing because the per unit cost is cheaper in the general housing market than for those built by the local authority.</P>
    <P>It would mean speedier housing of people on the waiting list because of the inevitable layer of bureaucracy involved at present which would not arise if private builders were involved.  It would also end the ghetto mentality attached to some local authority development.  We would give people the dignity and self-respect of being able to go on the open market and buy their house anonymously, as it were, thus ensuring that they would not <Col N="1152" /> be seen as part of one category of house buyer.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, it would mean more people housed more quickly for the same money in good housing and that they would be treated the same as everybody else.  As a member of a local authority, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am sure you will agree that when you try to create a local authority housing scheme at present, there is a fair amount of resistance &mdash; quite often from people who have just got local authority houses themselves. There are certain problems attached to that kind of development; this would be one way of dealing with them and we would also get better value for the same money.</P>
    <P>I suggest that the approach I am talking about should be followed through in every area of Government and public administration.  The converting of dormant and potential assets into revenue possibilities should be carried out.  To give an example, about five years ago a group of voluntary helpers and I carried out a survey into derelict sites in Dublin. Extraordinarily, unlike the stereotyped image most of us have heard of derelict site owners as speculators basking abroad in the sun, waiting for the value of their property to appreciate, we learned that approximately one third of derelict sites are in public ownership of one kind or another.  Another third is in private hands and no one seems to know who owns the rest.  Arguably, they could be taken into public ownership also.</P>
    <P>There is an enormous amount of land at present in the hands of local authorities, health boards and Government Departments, which have all been bought with public money.  They are dormant assets and could be turned into potential if we had the will to do so.  We should consider, therefore, not getting directly involved in any area unless we have to.  The whole question of regulation by the State has not been thought through.  This House is cluttered with a litany of Bills controlling every area of activity and they have a financial implication because they are all supposed to be enforced and policed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1153" /> Land banks held by most local authorities are dormant assets and they could be given, relatively inexpensively, to builders for the purposes of building houses for local authority tenants in the context of the ventures to which I referred earlier.  Strict conditions could be applied by the local authorities and the Department of the Environment.  I am really asking: is the best Government perhaps the least Government?  I am not convinced that it is.  All I am saying is that someone should ask that question and that it should be debated.  Minority interests or properties of State boards should be examined with a view to seeing to what extent they are relevant to the essential functions and terms of reference of such boards and whether they could be sold on the open market.</P>
    <P>When I started my career in politics, I wondered why the State was responsible for providing telephones and running buses.  I could not quite fathom why this was so because they are revenue-generating, and sensible commercial enterprises would be able to run them as they do in other democracies.  The establishment of separate boards in the area of post and telecommunications is an indication that that kind of thinking is percolating through but of course the Government and the State &mdash; no matter who are in office &mdash; are very loath to relinquish power.  Examples of such properties or interests which some of these boards have might be buildings owned by such companies; one State company owns hotels and I am not sure what their function is in that regard.  Obviously, in cases where there is a net drain on the State board and public funds, this rationalisation or streamlining should be a priority.  We should consider these options.</P>
    <P>We must look seriously at public expenditure.  I will not delay long on this subject because whenever one mentions public expenditure people's eyes glaze over and I do not blame them for this.  I am Chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditure and occasionally my eyes glaze over when the subject is mentioned. The public do not understand public <Col N="1154" /> expenditure and the politicians make speeches about it but nothing much happens. There is a ticking time bomb contained in the Minister's statement that the estimated current deficit for 1985 is £1,324 million which is 7.9 per cent of GNP.  He said it compared with an outturn last year of £1,039 million, equivalent to 7.2 per cent of GNP as against the original budget target of 7½ per cent.  He also said that the total Exchequer borrowing requirement for the year will be £2,019 million or 13 per cent of GNP which compares with an outturn of 12.6 per cent for 1984 as against the original budget target of about 12¾ per cent.  The total public sector borrowing requirement for 1985 will come to £2,521 million or 16.2 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the implications of the borrowing requirement have been thought through.  I am not clear on how it can be tackled without major economic and social trauma.  In the past seven years the proportion of GNP taken up by public expenditure rose from 45.8 per cent to an estimated 61.9 per cent in 1984.  Last year public expenditure was £9 billion or £2,500 for each person.  What this means is that the Government have increased their direct participation and involvement in the economy in terms of the provision of services and employment and as the creator of economic activity. As has been pointed out on numerous occasions it is not clear that direct Government involvement has brought about the desired effects.</P>
    <P>We must systematically re-evaluate every area in which the State is involved. We must ask two fundamental question. The first is, why is it involved?  If there is not a clear answer to that the State should get out.  The second is, is it involved efficiently and effectively?  Could it have better systems in place to get better value for money?  If the answers are not a clear &ldquo;yes&rdquo; in both cases, then the State should do what is essential.  What that means is that the principle that no matter what happens in the private sector, in the public sector no programme is dismantled or no person is let go has no validity in our present economic climate.  If the State <Col N="1155" /> cannot justify its involvement in an area, it has no function in it and should not be there.  If it is not doing the job more effectively and efficiently than anyone else it should not be doing it.  There is vast evidence to suggest that we have failed to ask those questions.  Perhaps we are afraid to ask them.</P>
    <P>As Chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditure I have been dismayed at the lack of clarity of goals throughout the public service.  There are no plans, targets or objectives in any Department. Civil servants do not have clear job descriptions.  That is not any Government's fault in particular, it is just the way it has happened.  There is no reward for a civil servant with imagination, flair or initiative.  There is no sanction if he does not do his job.  There is reluctance to start a discussion in the public service about such issues.  The public service is one of the great under-utilised resources we have.  We should either turn it on for the good of the people or turn it off.</P>
    <P>There is no point in any Government believing it can continue to frame budgetary strategy and provide for young people and the unemployed by carrying several millstones around its neck.  Our huge borrowing requirement is a tax on future generations.  I do not believe that that public expenditure pattern can continue and I am not confident that we have the reserves of will to deal with it effectively. Until such time as I see a Government dismantling a programme which is no longer relevant I will continue to believe that.  We abolished domestic rates but how many rate collectors lost their jobs? None.  At central Government level we send inspectors from Dublin to Deputy O'Leary's constituency to inspect houses for house grants.  When the work has been carried out we send them down again.  We allow money to be frittered away, without proper controls, on public capital programmes, works and buildings &mdash; reference the last report of the committee to this House in relation to the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>There is no point in our running faster <Col N="1156" /> just to stay in the same place.  In the areas of public expenditure we are going backwards.  Without increasing taxation or making severe cutbacks we could get better value for money than we are getting at present.</P>
    <P>In our approach to economic wellbeing there has been a tendency to over-emphasise the degree to which the budget is seen to be a fiscal statement and a set of figures.  We still have extraordinary poverty.  I am not sure any of us really realise that.  All we have to do is look at the minimum social welfare rates to realise that some payments on which people are expected to live in decency and dignity are lower than the price of a pair of shoes.  I am not blaming any Government in particular for that.  We must galvanise ourselves into believing that as long as there is inequality and injustice we will have the growing urban chaos we are witnessing: crime, vandalism, thuggery, degradation and old people locked in their homes through fear.</P>
    <P>A budget statement is essentially a philosophical statement.  It tells us not so much what we are spending but what our priorities are and the way in which Estimates have been framed.  Unfortunately it does not allow for a fundamental reassessment of our priorities.  We tack on a few per cent to last year's Estimates, not asking if our Estimate is relevant any longer or if it should be doubled. Departments which were set up in the distant past are never subject to the scrutiny of whether they should exist any longer or whether a new Department, reacting to new economic and social trends, should be created in their place.</P>
    <P>Poverty has not been dealt with.  In my constituency of Dublin Central nothing has changed.  Nothing is changing and nothing will change because the culture of poverty and the cycle of crime and poverty in parts of it remain as they always were.  There is no mechanism for dealing with it because the authority does not exist.  The devolution of authority to local authorities who might be able to deal with it does not exist.  The structures do not exist.  I am worried that the generous <Col N="1157" /> funding in the budget to the Combat Poverty Agency might distract us from tackling the roots of poverty in our community. It remains a central commitment of this party and Taoiseach to do something about it.  This is not an inopportune time to remind ourselves of that.</P>
    <P>In terms of developing our trade, industry and commerce much more emphasis should be placed on marketing. One of the major semi-State agencies has two marketing people abroad, both of them in the same city.  There should be more emphasis on multinational marketing, perhaps using local labels and licensing arrangements for our goods.  A product does not necessarily have to be sold into the German market under the Irish name.  The classic example is the drink &ldquo;Irish Mist&rdquo; which unfortunately causes red faces in Germany when it is marketed there because the word &ldquo;mist&rdquo; means something totally different in German to what it means here.  It would be good marketing strategy to use local names, labels and companies franchised by us but we have not developed that.  In net terms to the State the return would be greater than persisting in highlighting the Irish brand name or Irish origin. Instead a local, appropriately tailored, marketing image could be developed with the final printed labels produced in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The food processing area is one that needs a committed approach.  This country should be the food capital of Europe. Some years ago when I was in Luxembourg I went into a supermarket and saw fish marketed and produced, packaged beautifully and attractively and reasonably priced, so far as I could judge, by a country which does not have a coastline. I cannot find the same here though I do not profess to be an expert on the range of goods in supermarkets.</P>
    <P>There was reference earlier to natural gas.  In this regard I consider that freedom should be given to An Bord Gáis to enable them to develop a network of gas pipelines in conjunction with private enterprise especially in the main urban centres.  I trust the Government's attempt to supply natural gas to Northern Ireland <Col N="1158" /> will succeed despite the difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>We must introduce a system of economic rents for local authority housing with simultaneous compensation, where appropriate, by means of family income support to families in local authority housing and do so based on an income index and with means testing.  The net gain in this respect could be of the order of £60 million, though I admit there would be political difficulties involved.</P>
    <P>As a way of saving money I suggest that all those in receipt of short term disability allowances be referred to medical referees of the Department of Social Welfare.  I calculate that the direct saving as a result of that change would be of the order of £100 million and I am basing that on the fact that of the one in four so referred at the moment some 40 per cent fail to present themselves for a second medical but return to work instead.  The implementation of this change would have the advantage of not causing any hardship and it would allay the growing perception on the part of many in the non-social welfare payment categories that they are carrying the burden for those in receipt of benefit.</P>
    <P>Perhaps either in the Finance Bill or in the context of future budgetary strategy the Minister would consider adopting the suggestion that part of the rent paid by flatdwellers be offset by way of income tax.  I have never understood why this cinderella of the housing area should be so neglected.  House owners who convert their houses into flats provide, though this may not be their primary intention, an extraordinary social service without there being one penny by way of public investment involved.  The reason I suggest that flatdwellers be allowed offset part of their rent against income tax is that not only would this recognise a very large constituency in respect of which we do not spend public money &mdash; the only spectrum of housing in which this is the case &mdash; but it would have the major advantage of eliminating immediately evasion of tax by landlords.  Calculations made three years ago by the National Flat-dwellers Association, acting on a <Col N="1159" /> request from me, indicated that there was evasion of income tax of about £100 million in respect of private rented apartments. I would consider it reasonable to give back half of three quarters of such revenue, if realised, to the tenants or landlords so long as the dwellings were being used to facilitate flatwellers.  In that way we would be introducing a radical scheme of grant aiding people to enable them to improve and update such a legitimate element of the housing spectrum, one that is growing in popularity and in strength and which is a common housing mechanism on the Continent. The rationale behind considering such an approach is that if the private rented accommodation sector were to be diminished either in quantity or in quality the public housing sector might very well have to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>Another area in which we might raise money is that of commercial broadcasting. This is an area that will be discussed in detail soon so I shall not delay on it now, but I suggest strongly that minimal criteria, relating especially to the distribution of airwaves, should be introduced by way of control in the area of private radio broadcasting.  Revenue could be generated by issuing licences to all applicants who would accord with such criteria and the licence fee, royalties or share of profits could be paid by such stations direct to the State.  The advantages would be a net income to the State of significant proportions in addition to the meeting of young people's wishes with stations tailored to their needs, a role that pirate stations are more or less fulfilling now. This could be done with the minimum of bureaucratic cost and the simplest possible approach to what, if what one hears is correct, looks like becoming a bureaucratic and political jungle.  Why do we not proceed in the simple way?</P>
    <P>I offer another suggestion, but with a certain degree of temerity.  I am of the opinion that there would be a broad basis of support for considering carefully the possibility of reducing or rationalising some of the expensive Border security depending on the perception of need at <Col N="1160" /> this time.  I do not understand why there should be two expensive rings of steel, one North and one South of the Border. I am not very strongly committed to this view, but it should be considered.  Would not some degree of rationalisation mean that we would spend less money protecting ourselves against a problem which fundamentally is not of our making?  I know that action in this respect could be very difficult, that it might not be popular politically or universally, but perhaps greater co-operation and better use of technology would result in reducing expensive manpower.  I offer the suggestion for what it is worth.</P>
    <P>We could endeavour to reduce our energy import bill by way of the more efficient use of our transport resources &mdash; for instance, by way of taxi services being allowed ply for business at city bus stops. We need also a co-ordinated attempt to develop our transport resources.  Seven or eight different Government Departments each have a little responsibility in the matter; but in an area where there is no co-ordination and no systematic policy we must be wasting expensive energy resources and, consequently, money.</P>
    <P>Installation standards in housing and commercial developments should be improved and enforced.  The Government should do everything possible to ensure that this would be financially viable by way of whatever grant schemes are possible.  Obviously the better we preserve our existing housing stock the less there will be for new housing.  It would be much cheaper to give a young couple money to add an extension to an existing room than to build a new one for them.</P>
    <P>I suggest, too, that district heating schemes using waste heat from power stations be utilised wherever possible.  I ask the Minister to consider putting aside a small allocation for the encouragement of greater utilisation of schools and colleges during the summer months for the purpose of providing elderly poor people with short holidays, people who might have no break otherwise.  Such a scheme could be successful, assuming goodwill <Col N="1161" /> and community involvement.  Schemes of this type are very successful on the Continent and they do not involve very much more expenditure than transport costs.</P>
    <P>The employment area is one of frightening implications.  Apart from the budget, there is much discussion and policy making in other contexts in regard to employment.  But I suggest specifically that there be a re-examination of the employment implications of agricultural re-equipment grants which at present can be interpreted as encouraging an anti-employment approach.</P>
    <P>There should be a review of the PRSI system, especially in regard to labour intensive industries such as the clothing industry.  The present system takes no account of the value added per employee, that is, the total and potential wealth that can be generated by the employee in a sector or in an industry out of which all taxes and liabilities must be paid ultimately. The value added per employee in, for instance, the clothing industry and in banking are totally different, but the employee in each case pays the same rates of income tax and PRSI.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on introducing a budget which shows a fair amount of initiative and imagination.  I hope it succeeds and that he will accept the comments I have made in the spirit in which they are offered.</P>

      <P>Bank debt of State bodies which is not <Col N="1162" /> guaranteed by the State consists principally of short-term borrowing.  The Government have indicated in their national plan <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987</i> that emphasis will be placed on commercial viability and profits in the commercial State body sector.  The fact that the bulk of bank lending is covered by State guarantee, as I indicated in answering the Deputy's earlier question, and the steps being taken to improve financial controls in the State bodies should alleviate any concern on the part of the banks.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has mentioned two points: the protection of depositors and the supervisory role of the bank.  Would he not agree that another very important area is the role of the Central Bank <i>vis-á-vis</i> all financial institutions to try to create a climate for much more effective investment through the financial institutions than is possible at the moment with the various anomalies that exist for historical reasons over the years?  Can the Minister not place at the centre of the scope of his review the bringing of our whole banking financial institution system here in line with the reality not just elsewhere but with the need and potential here at this moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Concerns such as those raised by Deputy O'Kennedy would be covered by reference to supervisory powers.  I take the Deputy's point.  They would be covered under supervisory powers because under that heading the Central Bank would have a function in the matter.  Of course, as the Deputy knows, some of the things he is suggesting could &mdash; I will not say would &mdash; involve an extension of the supervisory powers of the Central Bank of institutions that do not now come under those powers. There is a policy discussion which needs to be followed up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply, but could I encourage him to look on this as the main focal point of the Bill, not just in terms of supervision but in terms of creating a climate for investment? Objective observers will say that our system here is not such as to channel <Col N="1165" /> investment effectively through our financial institutions generally into economic development the same as elsewhere. While I am on my feet, I remind the Minister that he did not reply to the second element of Deputy Brennan's question which was if he would ensure the statutory independence of the bank. I take it from this that the Minister would want to maintain that independence outside the influence particularly of the Minister for Finance of the day, whoever it would be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second point I am in agreement with the Deputy on the importance of maintaining the statutory independence of the Central Bank and it is in the nature of our legislation that that statutory independence in the discharge of its functions should exist and be safeguarded. On the first question raised by Deputy O'Kennedy, as I have said, there is a wider question of the structures of financial institutions.  I have an open mind on the matter.  Numbers of suggestions are floating around as to changes in the structures and relationships between financial institutions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if, in view of the fact that exchange controls did not operate during the two month period of the Central Bank strike, he has any estimate of the continued drain on the economy through the so-called black hole during that period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is incorrect in stating that exchange controls did not operate during the closure of the Central Bank.  The controls, which are administered largely through the commercial banks, continued to operate during that period.  No difficulty is anticipated in identifying the flows under the categories <Col N="1175" /> of the balance of payments statement for 1984 due to be published at mid-year.</P>
      <P>Official estimates of the balance of payments statement are not published on a sub-annual basis.  I would, however, draw the Deputy's attention to the statement in the publication &ldquo;Economic Background to the Budget 1985&rdquo; that the balance of payments deficit for 1984 is estimated to have narrowed to about 5 per cent of GDP compared with about 6 per cent of GDP in 1983.  Hence the overall effect of the external position on the economy was positive in 1984.  I would also point out that the official external reserves stood at £2,101 million at end-1984, representing an increase of £86 million compared with end-1983.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said in reply to the question, balance of payments statement is not published on a sub-annual basis and, therefore, I cannot give the Deputy a categoric answere regarding the outflow. However, I repeat that the operation of the exchange control system was not affected by the strike.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will accept that it must have been affected because it is the exclusive function of the Central Bank to monitor, regulate and control?  During the period in question, for however long it lasted, the enchange control system could not have been in <Col N="1176" /> operation in the same way as it was; otherwise one raises questions regarding the whole function of the Central Bank. Surely the Minister is not suggesting there was no problem in the circumstances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy remembers that much of the detailed day-to-day administration of our exchange control system is delegated to the commercial banks who have authority to clear payments within certain specified limits for a number of different kinds of payments. Applications for permission to export funds not covered by the delegated authorities in the normal course have to be made to the Central Bank. The only change made during the period of the closure was an increase in the limits for the delegated authority already exercised by the banks.  Other applications not delegated to the banks were dealt with by the management of the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>I accept the Minister's reply that he cannot know for some time if there have been any changes in the capital outflow.  Exchange control is one of the major functions of the Central Bank.  That bank was on strike for two months.  Is the Minister saying he is satisfied that the commercial banks, without any supervision from the Central Bank, operated the exchange control system without any changes, leaving no doubt in the Minister's mind that everything was in accordance with Cocker?  There are no statistics available as regards capital <Col N="1178" /> outflow yet, so how can the Minister have confidence that everything is all right?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already answered that question.  As I pointed out, the operation of exchange control under our legislation is delegated on a day-to-day basis by the Central Bank to the commercial banks.  That continued to be the case during the period of closure of the Central Bank, except, as I pointed out, that certain limits within the commercial banks normal work were somewhat wider.  The supervision of the system was carried out during the period of closure by the management of the Central Bank who stayed at their posts.  For that reason I am satisfied that the exchange control system operated as normal during the period of closure of the Central Bank.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of tax paid by those farmers who have other employment and thus pay all their tax under the PAYE system and whose tax free allowances are reduced as a result of farming, for the years from 1974 to 1984 inclusive; and if this figure is included in the amount given as the return of tax from farmers annually.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Presumably the Deputy has in mind the tax paid as a result of the restriction of personal allowances in accordance with the provisions of section 28 of the Finance Act, 1974.  The tax paid under these circumstances is collected with Schedule E tax generally and statistics are not available which would enable the information requested to be given separately.  However, it is tentatively estimated that the total amounts of income tax paid as a result of the restriction were of the order of £1 million per annum from 1974 to 1979 inclusive and £¾ million per annum from 1980 to 1982 inclusive.  The reduction in the yield after 1979 can be attributed to the decrease in the number of persons affected by the provisions of the section as a consequence of the lowering of the rateable valuation threshold by reference to which farming profits became chargeable to income tax.</P>
      <P>Section 11 of the Finance Act, 1983, extended the charge to all farming profits irrespective of rateable valuation and section 120 of that Act provided for the repeal of section 28 of the Finance Act, 1974.  Accordingly, the question of the amount of tax resulting from the provisions of the section in 1983 and 1984 does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The estimated net receipt of tax resulting <Col N="1183" /> from the provisions of section 28 was not included in the estimates of the annual income tax paid on farming profits.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the amount of tax paid by those farmers who are also self-employed in other trades or professions for the years from 1974 to 1984; and if this figure is included in the amount given as the return of tax from farmers annually.</P>

      <P>Income tax on farming profits is collected with Schedule D tax generally.  Accordingly, separate figures are not available for tax on farming profits.  However, I can give the estimated amounts of income tax in respect of farming profits which were paid in each of the years mentioned by farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession and which are included in the estimates of the annual income tax paid on farming profits:</P>

    <P>(1)Income tax payable in respect of 1974-75 assessments, the year of commencement of the charge on farming profits, was not due for payment until 1975.</P>
    <P>(2)The increase in the estimated receipt in 1980 is due mainly to a change in the payment dates so that the 1980 figure represents 1½ years' tax.</P>

      <P>There has been a lot of controversy about taxation of farmers over the years but the annual figures given relating to the amount of tax collected from farmers never gives an estimate of the tax collected from farmers under other headings.  Would the Minister not feel that in future years when he announces the figure as being the amount <Col N="1184" /> collected from farming taxation he should add those figures as well in order to give an idea to the general public as to the real amount collected from people in the farming area?</P>

      <P>Will the answer in the form of a tabular statement disclose that the excise duty from petrol for instance hardly increased at all in 1984 over 1983 and that this marginal increase in real terms would be a very significant decrease? Will the Minister acknowledge that he is dealing with diminishing returns and that despite the extra level of excise duty the actual amount accruing to the Revenue was almost the same as it was in 1983 which was not much more than it was in 1982?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the basis on which a figure of £50 million is calculated as a saving in departmental balances in the Budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The basis on which the departmental balances figure of £50 million was calculated in the 1985 budget was the standard basis used each year. The departmental balances figure in question is based on the difference between the amount issued by the Exchequer to departmental accounts in 1984 and the amount reported by Departments in their end-year expenditure returns, received in my Department in mid-January 1985, as having been spent in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that not suggest that, if the Minister's projection for departmental balances in 1985 was the extraordinary figure of £50 million, the calculations in 1984, on which he based the 1985 figure, were entirely unreliable, that any calculations that could have a cleavage of that order are unreliable and therefore that the work has not been properly done by him or by his colleagues?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is simply not the case. The balances represented the differences between amounts issued to the Departments in 1984 and the amounts that they actually spent.  The outturn figures for <Col N="1193" /> 1984, published in the pre-budget document and since, represented a clear and accurate picture of the amounts expended.  It might be interesting if I were to point out that the budget day deduction for departmental balances in 1980, which I think was presented by Deputy O'Kennedy, had a figure for departmental balances of £40 million.  At that time it represented 1½ per cent of net current supply services.  The saving of £50 million which I had in my budget this year represents 0.9 per cent of net current supply services.  I suggest that, rather than becoming less reliable as the Deputy suggested, the clear evidence is that they are becoming more reliable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In the year to which the Minister referred is the Minister not aware that the balances turned out to be accurate, as estimated?  Does he not realise that he was the one who last year presented the figures for 1984 and that the £50 million balances call into question his projections for 1985?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1980 the budget day deduction for departmental balances was £40 million.  The actual balances which emerged when the appropriation accounts were published amounted to £31.1 million, a difference of about £9 million.  In 1984 the budget day deductions amounted to £25 million, one half per cent of net current supply services. The actual balance which emerged when the appropriation accounts were published was £18 million.  The percentage difference in 1984 seems to be much smaller than in 1980.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the cost in 1985 of leaving VAT on new houses at 5 per cent and of reducing VAT on new houses to zero.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not possible to forecast with precision the cost of maintaining VAT on new housing at the 5 per cent VAT rate or of reducing VAT to zero <Col N="1194" /> per cent.  However, it is estimated that the cost in 1985 of maintaining the present 5 per cent rate on new housing could be of the order of £18 million.  The cost of reducing the rate to zero per cent from 1 March 1985 could be about £42½ million.  These figures take account of the deferment of the VAT increase for private housing to 1 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it the figure of £18 million for maintaining the existing level is the gross cost.  Will the Minister accept that that gross cost, which will probably be reduced to £12 million net, would be a very desirable amount having regard to the impact of the extra 5 per cent VAT on the building industry, unemployment and captial investment? Would he reconsider this position in the Finance Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>In recent statements the Minister has said that the increased cost per new house will be between £600 and £1,000.  In view of the terrible state the construction industry is in would he consider the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter which I have considered over some quite considerable period.  I do not see a compelling case to make any further changes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and the revenue which would accrue if any number of those were contributing by taxation and PRSI, surely there must be a very strong case for some reactivation of this whole construction area, especially when one is <Col N="1195" /> talking of £7,000 million of expenditure and the Minister really is talking of something of the order of £15 million to £20 million at the end of the day?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am tempted to say that Deputy MacSharry has anticipated some of the remarks which I intend to make to Deputy O'Kennedy in connection with Question No. 23 on today's Order Paper. In putting together the budget, I have taken full account of all the buoyancy aspects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister telling me that not just the building industry but those who in one way or another depend on that industry and those employed in it, for the sake of an extra £12 million net, which is what I think it would reasonably amount to, will get a flat refusal to be given any reconsideration?  Would he not accept that, having regard to the level of unemployment generally and the impact of the building industry generally on employment &mdash; in this instance, on unemployment &mdash; this is a matter he should seriously consider?  He would probably get even the same revenue in view of buoyancy and activity in the economy as he now will be confined to because of this very shortsighted imposition on the building sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The only answer that I can give on that is that the Deputy's figures are wrong.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the sum total of concessions made since the budget, in particular the deferment of the 5 per cent VAT increase on new houses and the modification of the composite tax on the building societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Since my Financial Statement of 30 January last, I have, in the <Col N="1196" /> light of detailed discussions with the interests involved, decided on a number of adjustments which, while minor in the context of the total budgetary picture, are nevertheless of considerable importance to the sectors concerned.  The total cost in 1985 of these adjustments as compared with the budget estimates is estimated at £10½ million out of a total tax revenue forecast at £5,704 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Even confining it to those adjustments, the projection now for the budget deficit instead of being £1,234 million will be £1,244 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not agree.  I would not propose at this stage to take any specific steps to offset those changes since I take the view that our inspection monitoring of overall budgetary trends through the year will allow me to keep the current deficit broadly within the kind of figures that I set out in my Budget Statement.  I am confirmed in that view by our success in doing this for the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Minister uses general terms like &ldquo;broadly within a kind of deficit&rdquo;, is this in line with previous Government commitments where they were very specific?  In his Budget Statement he specifically said that his deficit was up to £1,234 million.  Now we are dealing in generalities &mdash;&ldquo;broadly within the kind.&rdquo;  Having regard to the extra £10½ million to be added now and to the extra provision that he will have to make, over and above the provision in the budget, for unemployment payment which is based on an average of 217,500 as distinct from 234,000 now, is it not clear to anyone who wants to look at reality that the budget deficit is just an imaginary figure at this point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not at all clear.  In fact, in 1983 and 1984 the budget deficit as set out on budget day became, in fact, far less a creature of the imagination than the budget deficits had been during the period of office of the gentlemen opposite.</P>

      <P>Please do.  Would he also tell me, when I sit down, where the extra provision for unemployment benefit over and above what he provided in his budget at 217,500, which is now 234,000, will come from to keep within his budget figures?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the second part of the Deputy's question, this is a separate question but I can deal with it in the same general way.  I do not accept his allegations, in any case.  I have told the Deputy that I do not expect that it will arise in the way that the Deputy claims.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time what I am saying is that, while I have made these adjustments amounting to about £10½ million for this year, at this point I am quite confident that, given the systems which we have in operation for monitoring expenditure and the changes in budgetary aggregates during the course of the year&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I would remind the House that the budget deficit last year &mdash; for the first time in, I think, six years &mdash; came in as an outturn at a figure less than the deficit which had originally been forecast on budget day and that in the previous year, 1983, the budget deficit was within a whisper, necessary adjustments being made&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not altogether meaningful to speak of receipts from the European Regional Development Fund being spent in a particular area.  Receipts from the fund accrue to the Exchequer as partial reimbursement of expenditure already made through the public capital programme and are used to increase the overall level of resources available for regional development through the public capital programme.  Since the fund was set up in 1975 a total of IR£13.961 million has been allocated from the fund in respect of expenditure in County Kerry under the public capital programme.  The amounts for 1981, 1982, 1983 and 1984 were IR£0.671 million, IR£1.818 million, IR£2.150 million and IR£5.795 million respectively.  The portion of the total since 1975 allocated for industrial development was IR£3.121 million.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to what Deputy Keating said at the start <Col N="1211" /> of his contribution to the budget debate. He stated that the provisions introduced in the budget have long since been forgotten by the public.  I can assure Deputies that the electorate will not forget the provisions of this budget for a long time.  I should like to make my contribution covering briefly each of the following fields and to make positive suggestions to the Minister regarding job creation.  I should like to deal with the effect on the less well off areas of the absence of regional policy.  The Government are not operating any regional policy.  I shall refer to the need for a decentralisation programme and the need to do more for the tourism industry. I shall refer to the necessity for positive planning in regard to agriculture and horticulture.</P>
      <P>Will the Minister state what the Government intend doing to bring to an end the dismantling of the health services that is taking place?  I will be referring to the failure of the Government to combat poverty later and it is my intention also to deal with the state of the construction and footwear industries, to the sorry state of the fishing industry and the fact that very little has been done to help those living in Gaeltacht areas.  It is my intention to make some suggestion regarding the financing of local authorities.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that the budget will not do anything to solve the major problems facing us, particularly the serious unemployment problem and the unacceptable level of youth unemployment.  The budget will not do anything to curb imports of agricultural by-products or horticultural produce.  It is sad to see in 1985 such commodities as cabbage, potatoes and many vegetables being imported.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well known that more than 240,000 people are registered as unemployed despite the fact that emigration is increasing at an alarming rate, particularly from the west and south-west.  I have seen people queuing on Sunday nights in Killarney for a bus to take them to Rosslare en route to London.  Any Member in <Col N="1212" /> touch with his constituents will realise that emigration is rampant in our provincial towns.</P>
    <P>Many jobs could be created if our farmers were encouraged to get involved in an intensive form of agriculture and horticulture.  I suggest that the Government make grants available to farmers to get them involved in such enterprises. Food processing plants should be set up. Those schemes should not be run by State or semi-State organisations but operated by co-ops or public companies where farmers, management and employees would have shares.  I accept that there would have to be supervision and control by a central marketing board.  I put that suggestion forward in 1983 and 1984 but it has not been acted on.  It is my view that between 8,000 and 10,000 jobs could be created in Cork and Kerry alone within a few years of the commencement of such a scheme.</P>
    <P>The failure of the Government to put forward regional policies has cost the less favoured areas a great deal of money because they have not been able to avail of grants from the EC Regional Fund.  I estimate that the absence of a regional policy here has resulted in Ireland losing between £20 million and £30 million per annum.  There is no reason why the Government cannot produce a regional policy.  If such a policy was in existence EC money could be paid directly to local authorities.  Some months ago I read in a report of the proceedings of the European Parliament where Commissioner Richard said he would prefer to see money from the EC Regional Fund being paid direct to local authorities for the benefit of less favoured areas than to Departments of Finance because he was convinced that the money would be put to better use.</P>
    <P>If the EC adopted such a policy the west and south-west would benefit greatly.  Such a change would be a boost to south-west Kerry, the Ring of Kerry and east Kerry.  One must ask if the Government are serious about a regional policy having regard to the fact that they abandoned the programme of decentralisation of Government offices.  The <Col N="1213" /> absence of a proper decentralisation policy has caused many of the serious social problems we have in Dublin.  There is an obligation on the Government to give a lead in regard to decentralisation. The decision to abandon the programme of decentralisation was a bad one.  If carried out efficiently a programme of decentralisation would help to eliminate many of the environmental and social problems in Dublin.  It would ease the housing and traffic problems and would make it less expensive for the Government to provide some services.</P>
    <P>It is well known that the east coast is top heavy compared to the west and south-west.  There is a tendency to concentrate on the Dublin or east coast area in relation to tourism and commercial and industrial activity generally.  One need only look at our ports giving access to trade, commerce and tourism to recognise that fact.  The Government have failed to provide an adequate car ferry service into Cork to service the south-west region while there are major points of access on the east coast, with traffic travelling through Rosslare, Dublin Airport, Dublin Port, Belfast and other ports in the Six Counties.  There is nothing being developed by way of provision for adequate transportation in and out of the west region.  It is well known that business people from England or the Continent will not drive long distances from Rosslare, Dublin or elsewhere to the south-west, the west or north-west if they can conduct business at nearer points of access.</P>
    <P>Tourism is our most decentralised industry which has, and should have, a major impact on every parish and town-land, each having its attractions or amenities sited nearby to encourage tourists. The immediate future looks good as far as package holidays are concerned.  That is all right for hotels geared to package holidays but probably it is not a good idea for all hotels to be dependent solely on package holidays.  It is well known that hotels must cut their prices and be most competitive in the package holiday area. We must bear in mind that generally the hotel industry base such competitive <Col N="1214" /> charges for package holidays on the assumption that holidaymakers will partake of evening meals at their hotels, will probably then resort to the bar or to cabaret functions where they will spend money in a general way within the confines of their hotel.  With the new trend in the tourist industry, with couriers and bus drivers tending to take holidaymakers to other places of entertainment or amusement nearby some hotels are experiencing great difficulty being as competitive as they must be in order to attract package holiday groups.  There is no point in filling bedrooms and having full dining rooms for breakfast if there is no money to be had in it at the end of the day.  Compared with the motoring tourist the package holidaymaker does not benefit the bed and breakfast, guesthouse or farmhouse holiday business, particularly in the west and south-west.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the lack of a car ferry service into Cork is detrimental to the whole tourism industry in the south-west regions.  It is a well known fact that very few GB or continental cars were seen on the Ring of Kerry or around west Cork in the last tourist season.  It appears that the same could obtain this year because of the lack of that service.  I would ask the Minister for Finance to make the requisite finance available &mdash; I understand that it is not a great deal &mdash; to ensure the provision of this car ferry service for 1986 because it is obvious that it will be non-existent this year.  I attended a meeting in August last organised by the Cork Harbour Commissioners at which confidence was expressed that a car ferry service would be available into Cork for the 1985 tourist year.  It was interesting to note that the Swansea port authorities were prepared to put up a substantial amount of money for the provision of this service, having regard to the amount of business it would bring into Swansea, as were the local council in Swansea.  The Cork Harbour Commissioners were also prepared to put up a certain amount of money, because it was they who were promoting the idea, as were Cork Corporation, Cork County Council and Kerry County Council.  Its <Col N="1215" /> provision failed mainly because of lack of encouragement at Government level and particularly on the part of the Department of Finance.  I am appealing to the Minister and to the Government to ensure that the proposed car ferry service for 1986 is established in good time so that its existence will be well known before the publication of Bord Fáilte's literature for the 1986 season within the next seven or eight months.</P>
    <P>More money should be allocated to Bord Fáilte in order that they can encourage hoteliers to maintain and renovate their hotels, rendering hoteliers in a financial position to do so and to refurbish their hotels where necessary.  I believe Bord Fáilte should be completely revamped, that they should receive a much greater annual allocation.  They might also operate a scheme to ensure the availability of winter working capital for hotels at a subsidised interest rate.  This suggestion was made to me by a number of hoteliers in Kerry recently.  It is well known that it has now become difficult for hoteliers to get winter working capital, a commodity which is very necessary because the winter months are very lean for that industry.  If they are to retain the nucleus of a good management and general workforce for the following tourist season they must have available to them working capital to pay their overheads during those winter months.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our greatest industry and I am not satisfied with the handling of the super-levy by the Government and the Minister for Agriculture.  Every weekend I meet farmers who inquire as to how they stand in regard to the quantity of milk which they will be allowed to supply to the creameries this year without incurring a penalty.  Many of them are very worried because they do not know what they will lose on milk this year as a result of indecision on the part of the Government, the Minister and the EEC.  This matter should have been cleared up long ago in the interests of our dairy industry. To add to farmers' problems, there are now no agricultural grants for farm buildings. Many farmers were badly caught <Col N="1216" /> out as a result of the sudden abolition of the scheme of farm building grants by the Government in 1983 as many farmers had committed themselves to heavy expenditure on farm buildings in anticipation that the grant scheme would continue.  They completed their buildings but many of them owe considerable sums to banking institutions which they will find very hard to repay.  The Government and the Minister should do something positive in relation to helping farmers in serious financial difficulties and who could be regarded as hardship cases because of the effects of the abolition of the scheme.</P>
    <P>It is now virtually impossible for farmers in the west and south-west to get grants under the western drainage package to drain their land or for joint landowners to drain streams or small rivers. This is not good for the agricultural industry, the west or south-west and it militates against employment in these areas.  If cattle prices were not so good at the moment the agricultural industry would be in a very bad state.  Of course the only reason for the high prices at present for cattle and sheep is because the dollar is so strong against the punt. The strength of the dollar plays a vital role in relation to farm prices nowadays.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that no special provision was made in the budget to assist the health boards who are now in serious financial difficulties.  The Southern Health Board had a debit balance of £9.7 million in 1985 and I am surprised that the Government did not make special provision to alleviate their plight.  The effects of this on hospital services is very serious.  We are now witnessing the dismantling of hospital services.  This week, the Southern Health Board closed hospital wards and have removed hospital beds from other wards which are not being closed altogether.</P>
    <P>There is a long waiting list for urgent medical treatment in Cork Regional Hospital which is the principal hospital for specialist treatment in Cork and Kerry.  I was approached by quite a number of people over the past few months who told me that members of <Col N="1217" /> their families are on waiting lists to receive radium treatment and we all know how serious a delay can be in such cases.  It also causes great distress to their families.  The reason given is that the health board are forced to operate only two or three units at a time for radium treatment where previously they operated five such units at a time.  Persons who can afford to do so come to hospitals in Dublin and receive treatment on a private basis by paying the full cost of same and also paying for professional services rendered.  To complicate matters further, the Government allowed the Voluntary Health Insurance Board to increase their charges again, which means that many families will now drop out of that scheme. I know that the board would like to keep their charges to the minimum but they are also faced with increased charges by health boards and private hospitals as a result of Government policy in this area.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Health should make a clear and positive statement to clear the air regarding rumours that seven or eight psychiatric hospitals will close within a short time.  There is panic among staff in some psychiatric hospitals at present because they do not know what the future holds.  There is also panic among relatives of patients in these hospitals because they do not know what will happen.  There is a suggestion that St. Finian's Hospital, Killarney, is to close and we should like to know if this is true.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the increase of 6 per cent for social welfare recipients from 1 July covering a six month period this year could be equated with a 3 per cent increase over the year.  This will not help the less well off sections of the community who are dependent on social welfare benefits.  Prices are increasing daily despite what we are told about the level of inflation.  I am very concerned regarding the long delay experienced in deciding applications for unemployment assistance. It has come to my notice that in a large number of cases the period for deciding applications for unemployment assistance is getting longer and longer.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> The reason for that is the number of social welfare officers has not been increased although the number of applications has increased considerably.  It is very hard to explain to people who apply for unemployment assistance why their applications have not been investigated. It may be necessary to employ more social welfare officers to decide on applications. The Department should have a deciding officer or officers in every county.  It should not be necessary to submit cases to Dublin for decision.  That power should rest locally.</P>
    <P>The appeals system is ridiculous.  I understand there are between 4,500 and 5,000 appeals from the west, north west and south west under consideration at present as a result of smallholders having payment of their unemployment assistance substantially reduced or discontinued. There are only a few appeals officers to deal with all the appeals.  In the vast majority of cases the applicants request an oral hearing.  This will not be possible due to the inadequate number of staff in the appeals section.  There should be one appeals officer in each county.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating referred to the extraordinary poverty which exists. There is poverty in certain areas in south Kerry, in my own constituency and my town, Killarney.  There are people living and rearing families on incomes which are well below the breadline.  I have had experience of parents coming to me seeking my help to enable them to get supplementary welfare allowances because they cannot afford to pay their bills and feed and clothe their families on what they get in social welfare payments.  This has put undue pressure on health boards.  They are considering a high number of applications for supplementary welfare allowance at present.</P>
    <P>The whole social welfare code in under severe stress and strain at present.  It is inadequately financed and requires urgent reorganisation.  That is of paramount importance.  I know of families who cannot pay their ESB bills or meet the rent on their local authority houses. <Col N="1219" /> It is very difficult to put up cases continuously to community welfare officers for people seeking supplementary welfare.  If it was not for charitable organisations such as St. Vincent de Paul in some provincial towns there are many families who would have their electricity supply disconnected and who would be in serious trouble with their local authority.</P>
    <P>Many people buying houses are under the false impression that they are entitled to the supplementary grant of £750 announced in the budget.  This scheme will not come into operation until 1 May when VAT on building materials will increase to 10 per cent.  It is also well known that the grant of £750 will only cover approximately 50 per cent at most of the increased cost of materials for new houses.  I cannot see the logic behind increasing VAT to 10 per cent and giving a new grant which will be the equivalent of only 50 per cent of that cost.  It will impose further strain on the construction industry and on employment.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed to see VAT imposed on footwear as this will prove disastrous for the industry.  There is great concern in Killarney among those working in Tuf about this.  There are fears for the industry there as a result of this decision.</P>
    <P>I should like to see an overall development plan prepared by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry for our fishing industry.  We seem to be concentrating on continuous negotiations in the EC in relation to problems arising with regard to fishing.  If we took a positive view and prepared an overall development plan for this industry it would be well worth while. There are serious problems facing those who are anxious to get into the industry or those who want to buy or build new boats in regard to grant aid and loan facilities.  It is well known that it is almost impossible to get grant aid from BIM. This is a sad reflection on the attitude of the Government towards the fishing industry.  This industry provides employment and contributes significantly to the economic development and survival of areas along our seaboard.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1220" /> I have been in touch with the Minister with a view to having a development plan prepared and implemented in relation to Valentia Harbour.  I invite the Minister either to come down himself or to send senior officials of his Department to speak with the interested parties there so that a proper development plan for Valentia Harbour can be devised and implemented.  The area is rich in natural resources.  There is good fishing off the south and south west coasts.  Valentia Harbour should be developed properly. If necessary, the Minister might seek a meeting with the county development team in this respect.</P>
    <P>The Government appear to have lost all interest in the development of the Gaeltacht areas.  No money has been provided specifically for roads in the Gaeltacht in the past few years.  The job creation programme in those areas is very disappointing having regard to the resources at the disposal of Roinn na Gaeltachta and Údarás na Gaeltachta. Relatively speaking, there is very little happening in the Gaeltacht.  The lack of interest on the part of the Government in the development of the Gaeltacht coupled with the loss of unemployment assistance to smallholders in these areas may very well mean that they should be designated total disaster areas rather than severely handicapped areas which is their designation in so far as the various EC schemes are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is a good deal of concern regarding local authority financing.  Local authorities are short of money and cannot therefore undertake some very desirable schemes.  Fianna Fáil are opposed totally to the present system of local authority service charges.  When we are returned to office we will repeal the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act, 1983. In order to enable local authorities to provide a given service for a local community, they should have some power to raise finance locally.  It is Fianna Fáil policy to introduce new legislation to bring to a conclusion the present unsatisfactory position in local authority financing. It is our intention to introduce reform in the system of financing local <Col N="1221" /> authorities.  Our legislation will provide that local authorities receive a guaranteed statutory contribution from the Exchequer.  That is very important. Second, we will provide that local authorities be empowered to impose strictly limited charges in order to finance a local amenity or service but we would provide that any such charge be imposed only by elected members.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil would run away from anything like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>We would propose also that any charges be related specifically to the cost of the service in question and that the money be used only to supplement the statutory grant from the Exchequer as opposed to being substituted for any part of that grant.</P>
      <P>That type of legislation would eliminate the present uncertainty whereby we cannot anticipate what level of grant they are to receive from central funds.  This results very often in county managers having to impose an exorbitant level of service charges and to do so against the wishes of the community and of elected representatives.  In this year, for example, the Government have left local authorities in an impossible position by allocating grants from the central Exchequer which represent a mere 1 per cent increase on last year's allocations. This is at a time when the anticipated rate of inflation is 6 per cent and when an average increase of 5 per cent is being granted to central Government Departments. The result of this is that county managers will have to impose prohibitive charges on local communities, an imposition that is bound to be rejected by the community.</P>
      <P>Fianna Fáil recognise fully the difficulty for members and officials of local authorities in providing a satisfactory level of services in present circumstances but we are convinced that further large increases in local charges this year will cause widespread public resentment which can only have the effect of damaging the entire system of local government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1222" /> A very serious situation exists within county councils particularly as a result of the state of county roads.  It seems to be in order for Government speakers to say that some county councils are receiving up to £6 million this year for road works but the greater amount of these moneys will be spent on improving national primary and secondary roads.  This leaves very little for the maintenance and improvement of county roads.  The position in Kerry is so serious as to render the county council unable to undertake any improvement works on county roads. The engineers and officials are engaged in organising the carrying out solely of urgent repairs on these roads and it will not even be possible to carry out urgent repairs on all county roads.  This is very serious, especially in view of the high level of taxes being paid by motorists and others who are liable for road tax. Neither is it fair to those generally who are paying high service charges, taxes ahd rates.</P>
    <P>The Government must take positive steps to finance a crash programme so as to restore county roads to a proper standard and to provide a base from which they can be improved.</P>
    <P>The budget is an indication that the Government have little concern for the west and south-west.  There is a failure to provide funds for the various services so as to enable them to be provided satisfactorily. We know what is happening in relation to agriculture, to tourism, to the promotion of industry and commerce, to transport and to social services apart from the difficulties arising from the proper financing of local authorities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been debating the budget since 23 January.  One wonders if a debate of this kind has any relevance at this stage.  In the past 45 minutes Deputy O'Leary has been telling us to spend perhaps several hundreds of millions of pounds, most of it in Kerry. It amazes me to think that Fianna Fáil have all the answers in Opposition.  They have been in Government for a far longer time than either Fine Gael or the Coalition with Labour, yet the whole economy <Col N="1223" /> has degenerated to the extent that it has. A great deal of the blame for that must be laid at their door, irrespective of what forecasts they make in relation to another election year.  When they make their budget speeches they are condemning local authority charges already.  Perhaps it is expedient for them to do so to gain an extra seat or two at local authority level, but in the long term interests of local authorities it is damaging to enter into that type of promise campaign.</P>
      <P>This is my third opportunity to speak at budget time since I came into politics. In 1981 I felt that there was a need for a change in the direction in which we were programming events for ourselves.  Not knowing the difficulties and intricacies which are part and parcel of the annual budget, I felt it essential to carry out deliberately certain programmes relating to the finances of the State.  The Taoiseach when he spoke on this budget put the whole situation in perspective.  He said that it marked the end of a period of rising taxation and falling living standards forced on our people by the need to pay belatedly for the vast increase in public expenditure that occurred between 1977 and 1981 and which has now been brought to a halt.  Therein lies the problem, and we must never allow ourselves to forget that.  We borrowed heavily for purposes and projects that yielded nothing by way of return of jobs or wealth creation, and several years later the total income tax take went out of this country to foreign bankers.  The task which faced this Government from 1982 is not necessarily complete &mdash; indeed it is far from complete.  I do not share the Taoiseach's optimism in this regard.  Nonetheless, in the context of research into the economic plan and the work put into it on behalf of the Government and their advisers, it is most important to feel that at least there might be a ray of hope for our children if we continue along that course rather than run away from our responsibilities as politicians in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the years we have seen various attempts to balance our books and lately we have had a far greater level of success <Col N="1224" /> than heretofore achieved in the last 10 or 15 years.  This year for the first time we have spent less than we budgeted for at the beginning of the year, and that is a significant achievement by any standards. Therefore, I hope that gone are the funny money days that Deputy Reynolds referred to when he was contributing to this debate on 31 January, the morning after the Budget Statement was delivered to the House.  I suppose it was not difficult to predict the trend of the budget because all of the homework and spadework were done in the economic plan.  One might say that the plan has many critics, that it is not ambitious enough, it does not target sufficiently for job creation or prudent reflation of our economy.  I do not know what that means.  Perhaps in political jargon it means something and in economic jargon it may mean something else, but it sounds all right to the general public.  The point is that politicians, if they are to run the affairs of this State with any degree of integrity, must face the fact that we are spending more than we can afford to spend and generating less wealth than we are capable of generating, and as long as we go on in that vein the job situation will not improve.</P>
    <P>At least we can say in this budget that the deficit is more or less along the lines projected in the plan.  There is a slight increase of £6 million.  I know that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle has heard all of this before, probably many times, in the debate so far.  Nonetheless, I think it worth repeating and recording.  The borrowing requirement is slightly off target, not very much, more or less in line with what was projected.  At the same time we must be concerned that in 1982 the budget deficit was £988 million.  Perhaps in real terms today it may not have increased greatly; I will not go into that, but in this budget that will increase to £1,234 million or 7.9 per cent of GNP. That is about 2 per cent over the 1984 figure or £200 million more.  Therefore, we are still a prisoner of the economic situation that we have created for ourselves during the last seven or eight years and we are finding it exceedingly difficult to emancipate ourselves from it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1225" /> The Exchequer borrowing requirement is 13 per cent.  It is far too high, and as long as it remains as high as that we will not have the competitiveness to create jobs in manufacturing or any other sector that this country so urgently requires. The public sector borrowing requirement this year will be 16.2 per cent of GNP.  Nobody can tell me that that is a realistic figure.  It is realistic in so far as nothing else is achievable but it is too high and we must work towards reducing it.  We talk of debt.  Looking back I thought that the debt of this State in the fifties was enormous.  Compared in figure terms with today's debt it was very small, but perhaps we are no worse off in real terms.  The Government's record in their short term in office has been exceptionally good, in fact excellent.  I say to the Government, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance that in the longer term their approach will be appreciated. Perhaps in the shorter term people will find a measure of dissatisfaction with the Government.  They can reflect that dissatisfaction in the local elections in June, although I hope they will not.  I am confident they will appreciate the difficulties the Government are experiencing.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to speak in debates in this House.  It appears it is the preserve of a select few.  Even today I had to wait all day to get an opportunity of contributing to this debate.  I should like to contribute to most debates and I know many of my colleagues feel the same, but there is something radically wrong with the system and it urgently needs change and modification.  To most of the people outside this debate is irrelevant but at least it allows an opportunity to backbenchers on the Government side and the Opposition to put on the record their views for the benefit of their constituents.  That is important from a political point of view. I am sometimes told that I do more talking at weekends than I do during the week, and I am sure my colleague across the floor has also been told this.  However, the opportunity to speak in this House does not present itself very often. There is also a fair amount of committee work to be done.  I was extremely <Col N="1226" /> annoyed when I saw a report in a magazine that backbench politicians do not contribute to debates.  Some of us are not even known to the people who write such articles.  What they say is slanderous, downright undignified and is totally and utterly misleading and inaccurate.  I hope those responsible will think before they make such ridiculous statements in relation to Members of this House.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley in the past week has fallen foul of the party to which he has contributed so much and it is my personal regret that that happened.  I listened to his speech last week and I considered it the best political speech I ever heard.  It was accurate and to the point and I felt I was on the same wavelength as the Deputy.  I have thought for some time about all the matters he raised.  I hope he is not on the way out of politics because this country needs such people to stand up and say such things.</P>
    <P>In 1981 the then Government brought in a budget that was 81 per cent off target in respect of current expenditure.  They did not even do their homework.  In 1982 they corrected it a little and brought it down to 45 per cent overspending.  By 1983 we had almost a full year of Fine Gael and the Labour Party working together as a team in Government.  Irrespective of what may be said, they have worked together as a good team in the interests of the country.  They did a good job and nothing should undermine their capacity to continue with that work.  Last week was an indication of their willingness to serve all the interests of the State, irrespective of any pressure that was brought to bear on them.  I was very pleased with the result last week.</P>
    <P>Last year the Government underspent and that is something of which we can be proud.  Despite that however this year our debt repayments will be of the order of £2,000 million and that means all the income tax raised in 1985 will be required to service that debt.  That is the disheartening aspect, that we do not seem to be able to come to grips to any appreciable degree with that problem.</P>
    <P>Members were under no illusions <Col N="1227" /> about the situation that existed before the budget.  There was a deep and growing crisis in respect of unemployment, there was spiralling foreign borrowing and everywhere we heard an almost insatiable demand for tax reform.  That was the background against which the Government and the Minister for Finance found themselves when introducing the budget.</P>
    <P>What were the Minister's options?  We could borrow some money, have higher spending and increase the deficit but inevitably that would lead to a higher level of taxation.  We could borrow less and cut the deficit, but then we were told that would lead to higher unemployment.  We were trapped in this economic malaise out of which we find it exceedingly difficult to extricate ourselves.  What was the view of the voters?  They maintained taxes were too high, spending too high, borrowing too high and unemployment too high.  I say they were right on all counts and they must get full marks for their perception.</P>
    <P>What was the compromise achieved in the budget?  There have been small cuts in taxation levels even though the taxation &ldquo;take&rdquo; remains more or less the same overall.  There has been a commitment to the indexation of taxation and in future years this will yield a greater reward in terms of real taxation cuts.  There has been a very small increase in the size of the current deficit and there has been a small pay rise for the public service. Perhaps it was higher than the Government would have liked but it proved extremely difficult to secure a &ldquo;no pay rise&rdquo; arrangement in the public service. Like every other sector they think they are entitled to a small pay rise also.  Many people in that sector are not well paid.  I accept they have secure jobs but a person also needs to have something in his pocket at the end of the week.  There has been a considerable improvement in respect of public service pay and I am sure it will have the effect of reducing overall taxation levels in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>The most difficult matters is with regard <Col N="1228" /> to unemployment.  Much of the criticism from the Opposition and in some newspaper editorials is not based on constructive thought or opinion.  Everyone knows it is a dreadful waste of human resources to have so many unemployed, but it seems to be impossible to reduce the numbers.  We have embarked on a campaign to tackle this problem but we have to bring public finances under control first, irrespective of what economists or politicians say or what stories are told to households with two or three people unemployed.  It is most demoralising to be unemployed with no possibility of getting work.  Therefore we should work together to help solve this problem.</P>
    <P>In 1977 some people said it was possible to solve our unemployment problem and at that time there were about 70,000 people unemployed.  That number increased to 150,000 by the time the Government of the day left office and now that figure has quadrupled.  We do not appear to be able to come to grips with this problem.  The national plan set out guidelines, and if this Government deviate from that policy there can be little doubt but that higher unemployment will result.  No matter what way we look at it, extra spending in 1985 means extra debt, which in turn must be paid for in 1986 by increased taxation.  That is why it is so important to control Government spending and borrowing.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Leary was calling for additional millions of pounds to service the needs of the health boards.  No sector has attracted a greater share of taxpayers' money over the last ten years than the health boards and the health sector.  I am not saying that this was not necessary or that a great deal more money could not be utilised if it were available, but the health boards must be more realistic. They are making all kinds of statements in the press and on television saying that the Minister is crucifying them, that he is penalising them and that he is not looking after the interests of the patients.  This is completely wrong.</P>
    <P>This budget, and the national plan on which it is based, are not just about bookkeeping. The plan contains many provisions <Col N="1229" /> for schemes aimed at the underlying causes of unemployment.  The problems of unemployment are many, ranging from the work ethic, the attitude of the employer, the relationship between the employer and the workers, the attitude of the workers, efficiency, productivity, costs and so on.</P>
    <P>Entry to the Common Market promised much which did not materialise, but we are not the only EC country with unemployment problems.  We have to find new products.  We must acquire new skills and new marketing techniques.  We must educate our young people, and industry will have a role to play here. Since 1980 the number at work has fallen by 41,000.  In the same period young people seeking employment has risen by 15,000 per year, adding another 60,000 people looking for work.  This accounts for our increase in the unemployment figures.  The Opposition say they can solve the unemployment problem, but they said this in 1977, 1979 and they are saying it again now.  I do not believe they have a solution because if they had they would have implemented it over the years.</P>
    <P>There is a world recession and yesterday and today there was a big drop in the strength of the dollar.  I heard economists predict with a degree of certainty that the dollar would fall in 1985 after the American Presidential election, but that has not happened yet.  The level of borrowing in America in terms of GNP is even higher than it is here and they continue to borrow.  There is going to be a collapse some day if that trend continues. Perhaps they have a stronger base than we have, but that looks like a possibility. I do not believe we should worry unduly about the strength of the dollar.  Yesterday's increase of 4 cents, 5 cents or 6 cents in the pound against the dollar meant £40 million of taxpayers' money would not have to go out of this country.  There is what I would call a financial game going on all over the world.</P>
    <P>What is the situation as regards jobs? The greater the skill acquired by young people the greater the possibility of getting a job.  As an educationist for 21 years <Col N="1230" /> I cannot but promote the need for additional expenditure in the vital area of education.  We talk about our great resource, our young people, yet we are pulling back on the level of expenditure in this area.  Within a year of leaving primary school, without any further education, about half these young people find employment.  If they finish group certificate level, about one-third do not find employment.  If they finish second level education, about one-fifth do not find employment and of those who complete university and third level education, about nine out of ten find a job within a year.  These are the statistics.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are crying about the number of people emigrating but the number who emigrated last year was extremely low.  It is no cause for alarm. Many more people left the country when Fianna Fáil were in office, but they came back over the last few years.  I am convinced that rising unemployment is being halted by the policy being pursued by this Government.  In 1983 there was an increase of 27,000 people on the unemployment register, in 1984 an increase of 17,000 people and the projected figure for 1985 is 3,500.  We seem to be coming to grips with the problem.  The plan makes a projection for five years and adjustments can be made as we go along. We should have had such a plan years ago rather than fooling along from year to year not knowing where we were going and finding ourselves overspending at a rate of 81 per cent in some years.</P>
    <P>The budget has announced a social employment scheme for the long term unemployed and no better scheme has come to my notice.  People who were unemployed for three or four years whose morale was at a low ebb have been given a ray of hope by the scheme.  I congratulate the people who thought out this programme.  It might not be the absolute but at least it gets people away from the house and back to work.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that all the jobs that people claim could be created in the construction industry under Fianna Fáil would have come on stream were they in power.  Nonsensical claims have been <Col N="1231" /> made that because Fianna Fáil have always supported the construction industry and the construction industry supported Fianna Fáil that the Coalition Government are not interested in it.  The Coalition Government are interested in creating an atmosphere for jobs and in generating wealth.  No Government no matter how admirable or high minded they are can create jobs; they create the atmosphere, they generate the climate, but it is up to the people to take advantage of the situation.  There has been a change in the promotion in schools of the traditional safe civil service, public service jobs.  We have to put more money into vocational type subjects and through the youth employment scheme we have created an opportunity to develop this area.  The Government have been criticised for taking money from the youth employment levy for educational purposes. That should be done if it changes the traditional direction of education to cater for manufacturing type skills so as to create jobs and wealth for the future. We tend to create bureaucracies and the people in control want to hold on at all costs.</P>
    <P>The construction industry have been very concerned about the increase in VAT.  It will not make any difference to the builders.  There is still the possibility of a decrease in the cost of housing.  The cost of a house about 15 years ago was £4,000 or £5,000 but today it costs £45,000.  Young people could not even contemplate buying a house.  That situation will have to be remedied.  The £1,750 is a very generous increase in direct grants to new house purchasers as is the £5,000 grant for local authority tenants of three years standing.  There is the possibility of jobs in the construction industry.</P>
    <P>My colleague who is just leaving the Chamber campaigned vigorously for the reduction of VAT on betting tax and I suppose he got the loudest cheer in the House when it was announced.  I was pleased at that because more people will legitimately pay their share of tax when they take a bet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating, Deputy Faulkner and <Col N="1232" /> others referred to our natural gas resources. I thought that when natural gas came on stream we would ensure that it would be brought to every area in so far as it was economically possible.  The gas pipeline from Cork to Dublin runs three miles from Kilkenny city and the people there are crying out for natural gas.  The Kilkenny Gas Company of 150 years standing is about to close down unless the Government commit themselves.  The Minister and the Government should not look at this in terms of theoretical economics. They should look at it in the wider sense.  Many more people in Kilkenny can use gas.  It is a growing city.  An advantage of natural gas is that from the point of view of pollution there is nothing cleaner in the form of energy than gas.  If we have the resources we should use them.  I appeal to the Minister to bring a spur from the pipeline to Kilkenny.  It will create additional jobs in the area and Kilkenny will not be found wanting when it comes to doing its share for the economy. Whilst the decision has been postponed I hope it will be the right one on 12 March.</P>
    <P>The greatest disappointment I had in 1984 was to see the closure of the Clover Meats factory in Waterford.  Something must be done to protect the creditors in industries so that the lending institutions cannot move in to put a company into liquidation.  From what I heard recently there was hardly a basis for the closure of that group.  A lot of jobs were lost there.  I heard Deputy O'Keeffe last week decrying the situation of the bacon industry here.  Some day there will be Danish bacon in Dáil Éireann &mdash; and we are talking about creating jobs in the agricultural sector.</P>
    <P>There was a crying need for reform of the taxation system.  I am glad that the Minister has recognised that we cannot continue penalising the PAYE sector.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for having allowed me, belatedly, to raise this <Col N="1233" /> matter of the apparent helplessness of the Garda in the matter of joyriding on the roads.  This matter is most urgent.  I am not given to emotion or over-expression but this has so worsened in the last two days that I regret it was not possible for me to direct the attention of the House earlier to the fact that in Ireland at the moment the State is failing in its constitutional requirement to protect our citizens.  I will quote Article 41.2º of the Constitution:</P>
      <P>2º The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.</P>
      <P>The State is not protecting the citizens.  I say in all sincerity that there is a state of emergency in the country, particularly in Dublin.  Last week the Minister for Justice brought before us a Bill referring to matters to contain subversion.  The Minister had been told that money might have been made available to certain organisations known to subvert law and order and the Constitution.  We took him on trust that that was the case and in a matter of hours we gave our approval and authority to proceed against those who held that money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the course of my short contribution, I hope to establish that I have evidence, not theory, to prove that all around us in Dublin the laws of this State are being disregarded blatantly.  People are being murdered, maimed and disfigured but the Garda, that agency through which we give protection to our citizens, have turned their backs on it, not of their own volition but because they have instructions to turn their backs on it.  I know as a fact that last Tuesday at 4 p.m. when the Garda were pursuing these gangsters and murderers they were given an order to withdraw.  They were giving <i>carte blanche</i> to those people to proceed to murder and to maim, to do what they liked.  I would not like to use the phrase &ldquo;a laughable situation&rdquo; but the hound has now become the pursued, the hare is now chasing the hound.  Those young gangsters <Col N="1234" /> and murderers in their cars have told the Garda, &ldquo;We are taking you on&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>A night or two ago in the constitutency of the Minister of State a Garda squad car had to turn off its lights and hide from those young gangsters who were pursuing them in BMWs or other powerful cars.  If it were nothing more than what people describe as joyriding we would not be too alarmed, but we know those people could not care less whether they kill or maim or injure.  Then it becomes a national emergency.  I say as a responsible TD that my party in Government was probably as negligent as this Government in the matter of providing laws for the protection of the people.</P>
    <P>There is an obligation on us to move immediately on this.  I said earlier that I know the Garda have turned their backs on those murderers because they have been told to turn their backs.  In this House in the last year we had the Garda being up as the Aunt Sally of the State with everybody throwing abuse, with all classes of accusations being hurled at them.  Of course, they did not have the backing of the politicians here.  They did not have the backing of their own superior officers or of the Attorney General or of the courts or of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We indulged in refined expressions of concern that the Garda had captured those people, that they had discovered that crimes had been committed.  That is what they got here rather than congratulations on their achievements.</P>
    <P>During the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill I said I was concerned about the £250 million of citizens' money that we invest in the Garda in the hope that we would get protection.  At the same time we were encouraging any sensible garda to say: &ldquo;I will get my salary at the end of the month but I will not do something that will put me in danger&rdquo;. We know that the balance is weighted slightly in favour of the Garda but we have people running in here to suggest that a garda did not do his duty in the way he should have.  It was said that he was not obliged to have a commitment to his duty but rather to safeguard himself; <Col N="1235" /> and if and when a criminal was brought to court, out of moneys provided by the State, that person could employ the best legal brains in the country to demonstrate that the unfortunate garda had been remiss in the manner in which he discharged the letter of the law.  The nature and the degree of the crime seemed to become irrelevant.</P>
    <P>Why would any self-respecting garda put up with that?  Why would he put up with the things that were said here on this Bill about lack of trust and of faith and confidence in the Garda, when he could accept that until such time as we introduce new laws we will not be given the protection which we had got when the Minister of the day and the superior officers and the Attorney General had faith and confidence in the Garda.  In those days the balance would always weigh in favour of the garda who carried out his duties.</P>
    <P>If I am a driver of a squad car and anything happens to me while I am speeding trying to capture one of these robbers or murderers there will be no compensation for me.  If I step out of the car to chase a criminal and if I scale a wall and I fall off and break my leg or my neck there is nothing for me.  If I injure the fellow whom I am chasing, there is something in it for him.  We have brought the responsibility and duty of protecting our citizens to the point of nonsense, nurtured and encouraged all the time by the legal profession, whose bonanza it is to sit in their gowns wasting time down in the Four Courts discussing ridiculous points of law.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of law no longer has any relativity to justice.  We cannot afford that nonsense any longer, especially in the circumstances to which I refer.  A lady shopping in Rathfarnham saw some fellows at her car in which her young son was waiting for her to return from shopping.  She took them on as best she could and they left her with one finger gone.  A schoolteacher friend of mine from my area, returning from an innocent card game, was run straight into by some fellows thinking, I understand, that it was <Col N="1236" /> a squad car.  He was sent to his eternal reward and his family are left mourning. The Minister of State present sympathised with me and with that family.</P>
    <P>These are cases with which we are all familiar every day.  These fellows are sitting back laughing at us.  We are concerned all the time about fellows who are subverting the State through the use of guns, and nobody condones that &mdash; that goes without saying.  Here are fellows who are doing it through the mechanism of stolen cars.  The Garda apparently have received instructions to close their eyes to it.  They are told that it is dicey and there is no protection for them.  If in circumstances where they are pursuing these people something happens, it might be awkward for the prosecution to defend it down in the court.  The Attorney General or somebody in his office might be mildly embarrassed.  The Commissioner or some high ranking member of the Garda Síochána might not be able to sustain the case.</P>
    <P>In this country at the moment everybody is watching the Garda.  They cannot put a foot astray.  If that is the luxury that we think we can afford, so be it. However, let us not cod the citizens who are contributing out of their hard earned money what is required to afford a protection. Let us call in the Army who are better equipped, it would appear, to deal with this.  There is no point in our pretending that this does not happen.  I do not want to anticipate what the Minister of State will say in defence of this, but I am asking her to accept that everything that I say here is true and, if she wants confirmation, I shall refer her to any of the papers.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I did not hear until late in the afternoon that I would have the opportunity of dealing with this matter here.  I did not collect all the latest references from our papers, but I have one here from the <i>Evening Herald</i> of 26 February 1985.  It is stated:</P>
    <P>Gardai were the targets of a seven-hour city-wide rampage by car thieves in Dublin today.</P>
    <P>In the most co-ordinated attack yet <Col N="1237" /> by teenage gangs, a convoy of three stolen BMW cars were used throughout the night to face on-duty Gardai with a direct challenge.</P>
    <P>During the rampage, the gang of masked car thieves rammed three garda patrol cars; tried to run down a foot-patrol officer; hurtled stones and rubble at another garda and used the stolen cars to stage a break-in at a city-centre amusement arcade.</P>
    <P>This is not a Disneyland fantasy; it is not from any outlandish film on the television.  That is a factual report from the <i>Evening Herald</i> of last Tuesday.</P>
    <P>The <i>Sunday Independent</i> carried a litany of sorrows arising from those incidents. The <i>Evening Press</i> yesterday or the day before also reported on it.  What are we doing?  Are we going to sit with our usual sophisticated &ldquo;tut-tutting&rdquo; regard for statistics and do nothing about it?  When it comes to our own doorstep we would say that we knew it was happening but, as always happens with death, we thought it only referred to our neighbour. We did not think it was going to come our way.  &ldquo;It happens with robberies, with murder.  I did not think it would ever be my case.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This is the position.  Perhaps my regard for the members of the Garda Síochána has been overstated, but I do not think it has.  I think that the Garda, men and women, are the finest body of people that we have and I want this House to accept it.</P>
    <P>I want the House to accept from me that, with any group of people whether politicians, press, doctors or dentists, teachers or anybody else, inevitably you will get the manifestation of weaknesses that exist in mankind.  All in all, we have a body of people who are conscious of their position and anxious to discharge their duties.  &ldquo;All great and worth-while things happen at the mart&rdquo;.  For me, any garda who lives entirely by the regulations is useless.  If he takes refuge in the regulations, he might as well stay at home. If he goes about on the street only concerned about seeing what he wants to see, something which will not get him <Col N="1238" /> into trouble, I do not blame him one bit, because that is the atmosphere and those are the conditions that we have created.</P>
    <P>We know that even in cases where action is taken against gardaí that people who should be supporting them and rallying in behind them will run away and leave them to fight their corner.  That is the worst type of recognition, the worst type of motivation that we can give to anybody, where we should be saying &ldquo;You are there, charged with that responsibility.  We know that in pursuing it you are dealing with people who are devious, who have available to them the best legal advice in the country, but we will protect you because ultimately, as far as we are concerned, the whole <i>raison d'etre</i> of laws and regulations and the Oireachtas is to provide, as is indicated in our Constitution, protection for our citizens&rdquo;.  The day we stop doing that is the day we should hand over to somebody else.  The day we stop recognising that this emergency is with us &mdash; not imminent &mdash; is the day that we are failing in our responsibility towards the people who sent us here.</P>
    <P>I am asking, for God's sake and the sake of those suffering people, that the Government which are charged with the responsibility at the moment will not talk about what did not happen in the past but will apply themselves to it now, to recognising it for what it is &mdash; as great a subversion of this nation as ever happened before.</P>
    <P>It gives me no pleasure to say that the House can be sure that it will happen again within the next 24 hours.  If plans are not there already, I hope that the Minister of State will take back to her Minister from this House the message that there is an urgency, an emergency, that unless we change in our attitudes towards those proven men and women who can do it if we respect them and give them the wherewithal, we must look to some other agency to bring, or attempt to bring, peace and tranquility to the people whom we represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to reassure <Col N="1239" /> the Deputy that I would not dream of attempting to defend the incidences of hooliganism which he has described.  The extent to which vehicles are being stolen and used for and in the commission of crime and acts of vandalism is a matter of justifiable public concern and is of particular concern to myself, the Minister for Justice and the Garda authorities. People are generally referring to this form of crime as &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; but in my view there has never been a less appropriate or more inapt expression.  It is a complete misnomer.</P>
      <P>Apart from the fact that people's property is being stolen and damaged there is the ever more serious consideration that a number of these &ldquo;joyriding&rdquo; escapades have led to loss of life and injury not alone to joy-riders themselves but to members of the Garda Síochána and also to innocent road users.  The Minister is determined to do all he can to ensure that this situation will not be allowed to continue and I can assure the House that the Minister is joined in that determination by the Garda Commissioner and, indeed, by the whole Garda force.</P>
      <P>Measures to deal specifically with the problem of stolen cars have been and continue to be under examination by the Garda authorities.  Special attention is being paid to devising acceptable methods of pursuing and stopping speeding vehicles and more suitable Garda vehicles for this type of work, such as vans and cars of higher engine capacity, are being made available as far as possible in areas most prone to this type of crime. Other aspects of this problem are under consideration and a high level task force has recently been appointed by the Commissioner with a view to making further recommendations aimed at curbing the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot agree with the Deputy that the Garda are helpless in this matter. A special task force was set up by the Commissioner of the Garda Síochána on 15 January last which comprises members of the serious crime task force augumented by gardaí from a number of Dublin districts.  As a direct result of this <Col N="1240" /> task force 104 persons were charged under section 112 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961, as amended &mdash; this is the offence of unauthorised taking of a motor vehicle &mdash; in the past six weeks.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that this represents a fair measure of success.</P>
    <P>There are, however, difficulties.  As I am sure the House will appreciate, the primary concern of the Garda must be to ensure that whatever action is taken by them does not create further serious risk to life.  In recent times some people, notably some Members of the House, have demanded that the Garda should resort to using spiked chains or other similar objects for stopping stolen cars. There has been some reference in the media to the availability of spiked mats that are capable of deflating tyres slowly so that blow-outs do not occur.  The Garda are not aware of any such equipment and, while I do not pretend to be a technical expert in this area, it seems doubtful that it would be possible to have an object of this sort that would be capable of puncturing a new or almost new tyre and at the same time not cause rapid deflation.  However, in all this matter one thing must be borne in mind.  If the Garda used equipment of this sort and if a blowout occurred with the consequent loss of life of, for instance, a 14 or 15 year old what would be the reaction of the general public?  I think the general public would be outraged, and rightly so.</P>
    <P>There are other ways of tackling this problem which do not have the same dangers and these are being implemented. For instance, one of the measures taken to strengthen the Garda hand in this matter and to provide a greater deterrent was to make the offence of the unauthorised taking of cars an indictable offence.  This was done in the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1984, which increased the maximum penalties which can be imposed by the courts in respect of the unauthorised taking of motor vehicles. The maximum penalties which can now be imposed on summary conviction is £1,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment. The Act also makes the offence triable on indictment with a maximum <Col N="1241" /> fine on conviction of £2,000 or five years imprisonment or both.  There is also a provision in the Act which makes the unauthorised interference with the mechanism of a vehicle an offence whether committed in a public place or on private property.</P>
    <P>The effect of making unauthorised taking of motor vehicles an indictable offence carrying with it a penalty of up to five years imprisonment will be to bring it within the ambit of the Criminal Justice Act which was recently passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The central provision of that Act confers power on the Garda to detain, for a period of up to 12 hours, a person arrested without warrant on reasonable suspicion of having committed a serious offence. During this period of detention the Garda are being empowered to carry out certain forensic tests on detained persons and to fingerprint them.  The Garda do not have such powers at the moment except where the Offences Against the State Act applies.  The fact that they do not have these powers means that they are greatly hampered in their investigations of serious crimes, including the one now under discussion.  There are many instances at present where the Garda know, or at least have very good reason to suspect, particular individuals of having taken cars for this so-called joy-riding.  However, they may have no concrete evidence on which to charge these individuals and they have no power, as I said, to detain with a view to getting the necessary evidence.</P>
    <P>This situation will be remedied when the relevant provisions of the Criminal Justice Act are brought into force.  Unfortunately, there will be some delay in this because, primarily in response to requests in the House to postpone the operation of these provisions until certain safeguards, which many people believe are necessary to the operation of the provisions, could first be implemented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the position as far as the legislation is concerned.</P>
      <P>Apart altogether from Garda measures there are preventative measures which can be taken to lessen the incidence of car thefts.  It is hard to escape the conclusion that this particular activity is so attractive to young hooligans because of the relative ease with which they can steal cars. Motor manufacturers seem to have paid very little attention to the problem of making vehicles more secure from theft. In this era of advanced technology it is difficult to believe that more effective security systems cannot be devised for cars.  However, I know that this problem of vehicle security is attracting increased attention at an international level and I would hope that progress will be made in this area in the near future.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I want to say that I share the concern that prompted the Deputy to raise this matter.  The Garda have been doing all they can to deal with the problem and they are now urgently considering what new initiatives are open to them. We must not over react or push the force into any panic measures because of the inherent dangers.  Already the force has had a good deal of success and we must have a planned response.  I am confident that they will eventually surmount this problem.</P>

      <P>The person concerned has been in receipt of disability benefit since 17 October 1984 and payment is being made at regular weekly intervals.  Invalidity pension is payable in place of disability benefit to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  In order that a person may be considered permanently incapable of work, it is necessary for him to, <i>inter alia,</i> have been continuously incapable of work for a period of one year.  Therefore the earliest date on which the claimant can qualify for invalidity pension is 17 October 1985.</P>

      <P>Where an appeals officer decides to hold an oral hearing, every <Col N="1207" /> effort is made to deal with the claim as quickly as possible.  It is not possible in present circumstances, however, to ensure that oral hearings are heard within a specified time.</P>
      <P>Disallowances of disability benefit claims on the grounds of the claimant not being incapable of work are decided in the light of the results of an examination of the person concerned by a medical referee of the Department.  Where a person appeals against the decision and continues to claim that he or she is incapable of work, it is normal procedure to have the person examined by another of the Department's medical referees.  In the event of the person being again found capable of work by this examination, the case is then submitted to the appeals officer.  Apart from this, delays are occurring in the processing of appeals because of the very large increase in the number of appeals of all kinds which have arisen in recent years as a direct consequence of the growth in the numbers claiming social welfare payments.  These increases in workload have resulted in lengthening of the times being taken to process claims and appeals of all kinds.  Everything possible is being done to control the situation and to keep delays to a minimum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a condition for entitlement to disability benefit that the claimant must be incapable of work due to illness during the period of the claim. The Department, as part of its statutory responsibility for the control of social welfare expenditure, has a responsibility to ensure that benefit is paid only to persons <Col N="1208" /> who are entitled to it.  In the case of disability benefit, this includes a responsibility to ensure that the claimant is not at work for any period during the course of the claim as this would invalidate the persons entitlement to benefit for the days in question.  As part of the exercise of its normal control procedures, the Department from time to time inquires from the employers of claimants if the persons were absent from work during the particular periods when they claimed benefit.  The Department is careful to ensure that no personal or medical details are disclosed to the employers.  This practice is considered to be an essential control procedure in the processing of claims.</P>

Since no application has been received in my Department from an employer wishing to employ either of the persons concerned I am not in a position to say whether or not work permits would be issued in respect of the employment of the individuals concerned.
