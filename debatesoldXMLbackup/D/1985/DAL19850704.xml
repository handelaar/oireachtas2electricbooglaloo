      <P>Before dealing with the financial details, Deputies, I am sure, will want to hear of the developments that have taken place in the intervening 12 months as regards the Government's programme for improvements in and development of the public service.  The House can be in no doubt as to the Government's, or my commitment and determination to provide for an efficient, effective and modern public service.</P>
      <P>I have prepared a draft white paper, and a general scheme of a Bill, outlining a comprehensive programme for the development of the public service.  My Department have completed a very full process of consultation with other Departments about the proposals contained in that document and it has now been submitted to Government.</P>
      <P>These proposals will provide a worthwhile and broadly based programme which, I am confident, will enable the Civil Service and the wider public service to perform their functions in the most effective manner in the difficult and rapidly changing times which face us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I cannot comment in detail on the contents of the White Paper because my proposals must first be approved by the Government, I can say that it will spell out in greater detail the Government's decisions on the public service contained in <i>Building on Reality.</i> It will deal with proposals for new, more accountable systems of management, <Col N="544" /> proposals to free Ministers from the details of day-to-day administration of their Departments, staff mobility and co-ordination across the public service.</P>
    <P>Much, however, has already been accomplished in the past 12 months.  As Members of the House will be aware, I have constantly pointed to the need for systems of accountable management in the public service and such a new system has been in operation in my own Department for the past year.</P>
    <P>It was developed with the intentions of promoting a more cost-conscious approach to management and of generating a greater sense of personal responsibility among individual managers for the efficient use of the resources allocated to them.</P>
    <P>The system is based on a departmental plan which takes a methodical view of the overall aim and objectives of the Department.  For this, clear statements of the programmes being carried out to achieve these objectives, and their cost, were prepared.  Within these programmes, the personal objectives and budgets of individual managers down to principal level were identified.  These features facilitated a complete review of the Department's activities by the Management Committee towards the end of 1984.</P>
    <P>Following this review, the system has been refined and the departmental plan for 1985 has now been completed.  The system has also been expanded to include personal objectives and budgets for assistant principals.  The intention in this is that responsibility within programmes, and for resources used, should be delegated as far down the management structure as possible, thus giving individuals a more challenging and rewarding role in the Department's activities.</P>
    <P>Work is also progressing in financial aspects of the system.  The intention is that the total costs involved in any of the Department's activities will be identified with the relevant programmes and objectives of individuals.  In this way a &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; attitude towards the Department's activities is being increasingly cultivated. The benefits derived from a particular programme can be viewed <Col N="545" /> more readily in the light of the cost of that programme.  It is intended that the preparation of the Department's Estimates for forthcoming years will rest on this programme basis, taking greater account of the activities for which funds are being provided, who is administratively responsible for them and what is expected to be achieved with them.</P>
    <P>Some development work remains to be done.  When this has been completed, the system will be extended to all other Departments.  I am well aware that conditions vary from Department to Department due to differences of size and functions being carried out.  Therefore a rigid adherence to the type of system developed in my Department cannot be imposed.  Departments will be invited to view the system which is operating, to assess the many benefits which it has to offer and to adapt it to cater for their own needs.</P>
    <P>Another significant development now in place for almost 18 months, is that of the Top Level Appointments Committee which allows for a new, more merit-based system of making appointments to top levels in the Civil Service.  Under the scheme all appointments to posts at the level of assistant secretary (including departmental and professional equivalents) and above are now made following consideration of a recommendation of the committee.</P>
    <P>To date, 30 vacancies have been filled through the new arrangements, including seven secretaries of Departments.  Nine of the appointments involved movement between Departments.  This represents a major breakthrough in the Government's policy to encourage lateral mobility in the civil and public service.</P>
    <P>As part of the new arrangements the tenure of office of secretaries of Departments was changed to provide that secretaries appointed under the new arrangements would serve for not more than seven years.  Secretaries of Departments appointed under the new system must retire from such posts at the age of 60.  However, officers aged 55 or over on the date the new scheme started (i.e. January 1984) continue to be eligible for <Col N="546" /> appointment as secretary but, if appointed, will have to retire after five years and, in any event, on reaching the age of 65.</P>
    <P>The scheme has widened promotional opportunities throughout the Civil Service for officers at principal and assistant secretary levels, including departmental and professional equivalents.  The underlying thrust of the scheme towards greater mobility and more competitive systems of promotion is reflected in developments relating to other Civil Service promotional schemes at middle and senior management levels.</P>
    <P>This is reflected in particular in the recent introduction of an interdepartmental scheme of promotion to the grade of principal and certain related grades. This scheme provides that one in three of all existing posts and all new posts will be filled by interdepartmental competition. Half the vacancies arising at assistant principal level and half the vacancies at higher executive officer level are now filled by interdepartmental competition. The net result of these changes is that competitive interdepartmental promotion schemes now apply to at least all general service management grades in the Civil Service.  These provide that different proportions of vacancies at different levels are filled by interdepartmental competition.</P>
    <P>Effective appraisal schemes are an essential component of any system of management based on personal responsibility and of any system of promotion based on merit.  They also provide an invaluable mechanism for identifying the training and development needs of staff. Schemes are now in operation for all grades from executive officer upwards in the general administrative stream, for all posts coming under the Top Level Appointments Committee, and for certain other departmental grades.</P>
    <P>Arising out of decisions of the Government Task Force on Employment, schemes of career breaks and job-sharing have been introduced in the Civil Service. Under the job-sharing scheme, serving civil servants may opt to share equally the duties and responsibilities of a particular <Col N="547" /> post in return for half pay and other benefits.  All vacancies, including those occurring at recruitment level, are filled, thus providing additional job opportunities in the Civil Service for new recruits. Up to the end of April 1985, there were 297 applications for job-sharing, of which 150 had been granted at that time.</P>
    <P>In addition to introducing job-sharing for serving civil servants, arrangements have been made to recruit a total of 180 staff, comprising 90 clerical assistants, 60 clerical officers and 30 executive officers, on a job-sharing basis during 1985.  Job-sharing recruits will be offered full time employment after a minimum of two years' service.</P>
    <P>Under the career break scheme, the majority of civil servants will be eligible to apply for a career break which will consist of special leave without pay for a period of not less than a year and not more than three years.  Career breaks may be used for a wide variety of reasons including domestic responsibilities, further education, setting up a business, or any other reason.</P>
    <P>Vacancies arising when serving officers take career breaks will be filled, as will consequential vacancies including those at recruitment level.  This increases job opportunities in the Civil Service for new recruits.  Officers returning after a career break will be assigned to vacancies as and when they arise.  Up to the end of April 1985, there were 766 applications for career breaks, of which 751 have been granted.</P>
    <P>It will be seen that the net effect in the first year of operation of both the job-sharing and career break schemes is that some 800 or 900 additional people have obtained employment in the Civil Service, in addition to the benefit which has been obtained by the participants in the schemes.</P>
    <P>In view of the success of the schemes in the Civil Service the Government decided to extend them to other areas in the public sector and a commitment to this effect is given in the national plan. Government Ministers have been asked to have the schemes promoted in all State <Col N="548" /> agencies attached to their Departments. Career break schemes have already been introduced in the local authority and health areas and negotiations on schemes for the teaching area, for the Garda and for the clerical and administrative staff in the VECs are well advanced.</P>
    <P>It is hoped that the success which the schemes have enjoyed in the Civil Service will be replicated in the wider public service. All necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the schemes are promoted vigorously throughout the public sector.</P>
    <P>In order to give staff fresh experiences and more challenging tasks, as well as to introduce new ideas, the Government are determined to arrange for a significant number of temporary exchanges between the Civil Service, the rest of the public sector &mdash; particularly Departments' own agencies &mdash; and the private sector. Although a scheme of exchanges was agreed in 1979 the number of staff involved to date has been very disappointing, despite a Government directive to Departments in July 1983 which required 56 exchanges in all, of which nine were to be with the private sector.  In fact, there has been particular difficulty in relation to the number of exchanges between the Civil Service and the private sector.</P>
    <P>While 24 exchanges have taken place within the Civil Service and with semi-State bodies since July 1983, only five private sector firms or organisations have exchanged staff with the Civil Service since the scheme began in 1979 &mdash; Guinness, Irish Cement, Stokes Kennedy Crowley, the Federated Union of Employers and the Bank of Ireland.</P>
    <P>Because these exchanges are designed to develop the individuals who take part, to provide an intake of special skills and to improve communication and understanding between the public service and the private sector, and added impetus has now been given to the scheme by the appointment of a senior officer in my Department with specific responsibility for ensuring that more exchanges with the private sector take place.  There have been very encouraging indications recently from several of the large private sector firms and I hope to be in a position <Col N="549" /> next year to report considerable progress in the development of the staff exchange scheme, especially in relation to movement between the private and public sectors.</P>
    <P>A scheme of Anglo-Irish exchanges also exists.  As well as contributing to the development of British and Irish civil servants, the scheme is intended to improve mutual understanding between the two countries.  Exchanges can be for periods of six months to two years and about three exchanges &mdash; each way &mdash; are envisaged at any one time.  Despite unhelpful comment at the time of the announcement of the scheme, I am pleased that its implementation has already begun.</P>
    <P>A radically revised staff suggestion scheme, INPUT, has been introduced in the Civil Service to encourage initiative and creativity.  It offers prizes of from £50 to £1,000 for suggestions from civil servants on how to do things better, how to cut costs or how to avoid waste.  Prize winners are determined by an interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of an officer of my Department.</P>
    <P>The Government are determined to continue their programme of increased utilisation of information technology to improve the efficiency of public service administration, to increase the effectiveness of management and professional staff and to make access to services more readily available to the public.  The widespread use of modern technology is essential to deliver an increasingly complex range of services at a time when we are committed to further reductions in Civil Service numbers.  During the past year we have strengthened the organisational arrangements for the management of information technology in the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Much of the work which was previously carried out by the Central Data Processing Services (CDPS) of my Department has been decentralised in order to give local management greater responsibility for, and control of, their own information processing.  The major impact of this decision has been the transfer of a large number of CDPS personnel to the <Col N="550" /> Departments of Social Welfare, Justice and Health.  It has also strengthened the recent trend of providing for new systems through the installation of local computors rather than through the expansion of the CDPS mainframe capacity.</P>
    <P>Central support, co-ordination and control of such widespread development is important if the momentum is to be maintained and resources used to best advantage.  For this purpose CDPS has been restructured into three separate functions within my Department.</P>
    <P>A Central Computing Service (CCS) has been established to develop and support common and service-wide applications.  The CCS will also support smaller Departments which have not as yet established systems development services. Both Departments and the CCS will make the fullest use of the most modern systems development aids and will make use of off-the-shelf and turnkey solutions whenever they are available and justifiable.</P>
    <P>The second new function is an Information Management Advisory Service (IMAS) to advise and assist Departments with the development of plans and to co-ordinate plans between Departments. During the coming year all Departments will be required to produce plans for the utilisation of information technology and this planning process will be the vehicle for ongoing review and co-ordination of progress in this area.  The plans will identify clear objectives for the use of technology, specific projects to address those objectives, and the resources necessary to implement them.  These plans will ensure that investment decisions are based on the best possible information in relation to the costs, benefits and overall impact of proposed projects.</P>
    <P>The advisory service will also undertake research into areas of information technology which are of particular relevance, e.g. 4th generation aids, networking, etc., and will formulate guidelines and standards for the acquisition, introduction and use of these.</P>
    <P>Growth in the capability of microcomputers has been remarkable in recent years and we are establishing within <Col N="551" /> IMAS a microcomputer support centre to demonstrate the potential of this particular technology in a Civil Service environment and to support users in identifying uses for it.</P>
    <P>The third function to be exercised centrally is one of control on expenditure and monitoring the achievement of results.  While we are committed to more extensive usage of technology it is important that expenditure on it should be as tightly controlled as all public expenditure at present.  In future this function will be administered by the vote control section of my Department.</P>
    <P>In parallel with the above developments to encourage more active progress at Departmental level, we are conscious that individual applications of technology sometimes depend on the availability of central infrastructures.  One avenue which we are actively considering is the extent to which an interdepartmental communications network would facilitate the development of trans-departmental information processing services.  This is an exciting and interesting area for exploration and I have recently invited a number of firms of consultants to tender for a consultancy project related to this initiative.</P>
    <P>Members of the House will be particularly interested in two proposed developments of direct relevance to their work as public representatives.  The proposals of the Leader of the House in relation to the use of technology in the business of the Houses of the Oireachtas are progressing and we would expect to see the introduction of some facilities this year. I have also commenced a study of the potential improvements which information technology could bring to the administration of Ministers' private offices and we expect to commence implementation in some offices this year. I hope that the introduction of that technology will, as well as being of benefit to the Department, result in an improved standard of service in handling queries from public representatives and members of the public addressed to individual Ministers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="552" /> Our policy and action in relation to information technology are based on continuing review of the latest developments and best practices in this rapidly evolving and critical area.  We will continue to promote and expedite its effective utilisation as an essential feature of developing public services to meet modern requirements.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman's first year in office was a busy one as his annual report, which was recently published, reveals.  The report shows that a total of 2,267 complaints were received.  These were received from every county in Ireland and involved almost all of the Government Departments and offices subject to investigation by the Ombudsman.  The majority of the complaints were in the areas of social welfare, taxation or telecommunications. The nature and extent of the complaints received clearly underline the need for the office and fully justifies its establishment.</P>
    <P>There have been a number of important developments recently concerning the Ombudsman.  A major extension of his remit took place on 1 April last.  In addition to Government Departments and offices, the Ombudsman is now empowered to investigate complaints relating to health boards, local authorities, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann. Deputies will also recall that the Ombudsman Act, 1980, was amended last November to provide that orders altering the Schedules to the Act require a positive motion of approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>Members of the House were thus fully involved in the decision to extend the remit of the Ombudsman and I am pleased to say that this extension was heartily approved by all sides.  The Schedules to the 1980 Act have also been updated to take account of a number of bodies which have been established since the original legislation was enacted.  This is a major expansion of the Ombudsman's remit and it means that the actions of an additional 100,000 public servants approximately fall within his jurisdiction.</P>
    <P>The Estimates being discussed today reflect that expansion, and in particular <Col N="553" /> the broadening of the Ombudsman's role in relation to the health boards, local authorities, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  A total amount of £655,000 is being provided this year which is a major increase over 1984 when the Estimate totalled almost £244,000.  Staffing costs are of course the major element in the Estimate for the office.  I understand that a competition to recruit 12 additional investigators has also been completed.  I would like to take this opportunity of wishing the Ombudsman and his staff every success in their important work.</P>
    <P>A reduction in the numbers in and cost of the public service has been a prime concern of the Government.  There are two main reasons for this.  Because of the extra numbers taken into the public service up to mid-1981, often with little or no regard as to whether these staff were necessary or could be gainfully employed, we were satisfied that there were substantial reserves of staff in public service organisations generally which needed to be shaken out.  Secondly, we have been concerned at the sheer scale of the public service pay bill &mdash; £2,464 million for 1985 &mdash; and the budgetary problems associated with providing for expenditure of those dimensions.</P>
    <P>In general, our aim has been, and still is, to reduce the size of the public service to a level more in keeping with the country's requirements and the capacity of the taxpayer to sustain it.  And so we have continued various restrictions aimed at reducing public service numbers and are committed to maintaining that approach over the period of the national plan.</P>
    <P>In the Civil Service the embargo on the filling of two out of every three vacancies continues.  Since 1981 the number of Civil Service posts has been reduced through this method by 2,800 or 8.3 per cent.  The embargo is not, however, applied blindly. Exceptions have been made, for instance, in relation to vacancies arising from career breaks and job sharing schemes.  Such vacancies are filled in all circumstances so that the potential of these schemes to create employment openings can be realised.  Also where <Col N="554" /> special difficulties were acknowledged to exist, e.g. in relation to the Department of Social Welfare and the Revenue Commissioners, extra staff has been provided by redeployment from other Departments. The operation of the embargo is being supplemented by reviews of Departments and of schemes and programmes. The overall result will be a slimmer and fitter Civil Service more suited to our national needs, and to our national pocket.</P>
    <P>Elsewhere in the public service the curbs on numbers are being applied mostly indirectly through control of cash allocations.  In this way management will be provided with an added incentive to review its projects and procedures and to streamline its services and provide them in the most cost-effective way possible. While allocations will be limited and numbers employed will fall, I am satisfied that sufficient resources will be available to ensure that with good management and direction a satisfactory level of services will be maintained.  Over the period of the national plan the target is that the public service numbers will fall by 5,000 of which the Civil Service will provide 1,500.</P>
    <P>The underlying purpose of many of the changes introduced in the public service is to improve its efficiency and effectiveness, its value for money and its courtesy in dealing with the public.  I have taken a number of specific initiatives designed to impact directly on the interaction between the public service and the general public.  Some examples are as follows. A major advertising campaign was run in press and on TV to publicise the Government decision that civil servants must give their name when using the telephone, must clearly indicate their name and designation in all correspondence with the public and must wear a name badge if they deal regularly with the public.  Major improvements were carried out in a number of public office areas to pilot the type of improvements which can be made in such areas in all Departments. The State Services entry in the telephone directories (Parts I and II) was <Col N="555" /> redesigned and now includes an easy-reference alphabetic listing of services together with the normal Department-by-Department entry.  It is printed in pages of a different colour from the remainder of the directory.  A special Forms Design Unit has been established. The unit is equipped with modern computer-aided design equipment and has as its objective the improvement and simplification of the presentation and layout of Civil Service forms.</P>
    <P>On the general question of public service pay policy, the basic policy is set out in some detail in the national plan which indicated that achievement of the Government's public expenditure targets requires that the growth in the pay and pensions bill be severely restricted over the years 1985 to 1987.</P>
    <P>I have previously suggested in this House that if individual Deputies or members of the public come across examples of badly designed, misleading or upsetting public service or Civil Service forms I would be very appreciative if they would bring them to my attention, pointing out the areas where the public have difficulty in comprehending the complexity of the types of answers being sought.  Again, I ask the House for co-operation in bringing details of such forms to our attention.  There are still some 30,000 forms being used by the public and it is self-evident that there will be many forms which were not designed to the highest standard and some of which we have yet to come across.</P>
    <P>The underlying philosophy is that in order to avoid severe reductions in staff numbers, which could cause a sharp deterioration in public services and increase unemployment, it is necessary to curtail the growth in average pay per head over the period of the plan.  The cash limits specified in the plan permit payment of special pay increases committed or sanctioned at the date of the plan, including payment of phases yet to be implemented under the terms of the 1983 PSPA.  It is not possible, however, to provide for any further special increases over the period of the plan.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="556" /> Last year the cost of Exchequer pay and pensions increased by 7.4 per cent to £2,337 million.  The provision for 1985 has been increased by a further 5.4 per cent to £2,464 million to meet the cost of implementing the 24th round pay increase in the public service, the carry-forward cost of the second phase of the 1983 Public Service Pay Agreement and the cost of special increases which were sanctioned or committed before the publication of the plan.</P>
    <P>I now turn to some of the financial details relating to this group of Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Estimates for Vote 19 &mdash; the Office of the Minister for the Public Service &mdash; is £7.4 million, which is an increase of £1.106 million on the 1984 outturn.  The Vote covers the day to day running expenses of the Department and comes in the main under four broad heads, three of expenditure and one, Appropriations-in-Aid of income.  Pay of staff amounts to £4.870 million which is 66 per cent of the total Estimate.  This provision reflects the transfer of 68 staff to the Departments of Social Welfare, Justice and Health during March/April 1985, arising from the implementation of the Government decision on the Report of the Review Body on computerisation in the Government Services.</P>
    <P>The second item of major expenditure is £900,000 for the purchase, leasing, renting and maintenance of computer equipment used by the Department's Central Computing Service.  A provision of £1.068 million has been provided by way of a grant-in-aid for the Institute of Public Administration.  This grant-in-aid is a contribution towards the general expenses of the institute and includes the corporate subscriptions on behalf of Government Departments.  The institute is involved in the training and education of public servants, in promoting and undertaking administrative research and in publishing sources of material on public administration.  Appropriations-in-Aid on the Vote are expected to come to £1 million in 1985.  These arise mainly from receipts in respect of computer services provided by the Central Computing <Col N="557" /> Service for bodies other than Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The second vote is Vote 20, the Civil Service Commission.  The cost of running the Civil Service Commission and Local Appointments Commission in 1985 is estimated at a net amount of £1,140,000. This amount is required to cover the cost of salaries, wages and allowances of the staff of the two commissions, the cost of the competitions run by them and various other expenses.  The gross cost comes to £2,060,000 but revenue received will reduce this by £920,000 to £1,140,000.</P>
    <P>The third Vote is Vote 22 &mdash; Superannuation and Retired Allowances &mdash; which requires a net amount of £43.442 million. The Vote covers payments of pension and retirement lump sums to established and non-established civil servants, to their widows and widows of the Judiciary. The increase on this Vote compared to the 1984 outturn is due to the increase in the number of pensioners and the revision of pensions in line with pay increases.</P>
    <P>As regards Vote 49 &mdash; Increases in Remuneration and Pensions &mdash; this Vote provides £108 million to meet the cost to the Exchequer of implementing the decision announced in the budget to make provision for a 24th Round settlement in the public service based on the terms of the arbitrator's finding for certain civil servants.  The arbitrator recommended a seven month pay pause followed by a 3 per cent increase from 1 January 1985 and a further 3 per cent from 1 July 1985.  The provision in the Vote will be distributed to Departments and the State bodies later in the year when the full extent of excesses on departmental provisions for pay can be assessed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>The functions and the importance of the Department of the Public Service are not always recognised by this House.  While many of us have often asked if the Department have any real function or whether they should be part of another Department, the officials have been of great help to the Minister over the last year.  I will not deal at length <Col N="558" /> with the report of the Committee on Public Expenditure because we will be dealing with it later, but in that report Mr. Murphy, Secretary of the Department, set down what he thought were the five main functions of the Department.  They show clearly the importance of the Department in the overall running of the public service in its broadest sense.  Sometimes people tend to think of this Department as being just another Department without any relationship with the rest of the Civil Service and the public service.  The functions of that Department as set out in the report were, first, to allocate functions and responsibilities between different Departments and different parts of the public service in the best possible way; second, to help the Departments or organisations to organise themselves in the best way, to have effective top management systems, a proper allocation of responsibility and adequate information systems, computer systems and other systems; third, to recruit the best people, to put them in the right places, to promote them and motivate them, and that was described as their manpower, planning and personnel policy; fourth, to look after pay, conditions, pensions and all the control and regulatory work of the Civil Service and the public service; and, fifth, to bring about fundamental changes by standing back and looking at the public service in a much more objective way.  When we are discussing the annual Estimate of this Department we must consider these five points, which are the functions of the Department as set down by the Minister and his officials.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept what the Minister said about job creation, career breaks, job sharing, the Top Level Appointments Committee and so on.  All are helping in some way. Some are effective and some are a cause for disappointment &mdash; for example, the job-sharing and other schemes.  But I welcome the Minister's promise to broaden the career breaks and job-sharing schemes into all sections of the public service because anything that will create <Col N="559" /> jobs in the public service is better than the present position of stagnation.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the Top Level Appointments Committee is to be welcomed. It appeared to outsiders that promotion in the public service was on the basis of seniority and not always ability. From my 15 years experience in the public service promotion under the old system seemed to be on seniority.  It did not seem logical that a person of 40 or 45 years could not become a secretary or an assistant secretary of a Department.  It always appeared that such a person was around 60 years of age but under the new system that has dramatically changed.  I hold the view that the Top Level Appointments Committee appear to be doing the job properly.</P>
    <P>I could read a litany of the number of times &mdash; and he did it again today &mdash; the Minister promised to give us the facts about the reform of the public service. Since November 1983 he has promised in this House, and more often elsewhere, that the White Paper would issue shortly. I will not read out the number of times this has been promised because it would be a pointless exercise.  The Minister has been in office for two and a half years and there has been great talk of reshuffles and changes, but we still have no White Paper.  The Minister said this morning that the White Paper is now with the Government.  If it suffers the same fate as the Broadcasting Bill we should see it in two to three years' time.  We can talk <i>ad nauseum</i> about reform, technology and changes of emphases, but until we have the White Paper clearly showing what reforms are intended and what is likely to happen, we will never know what this Government are thinking in the area of public service reform.</P>
    <P>It is very disappointing for all those who rushed to make submissions in 1983 that this White Paper has not yet issued. We were told that this paper would issue in 1983, then Easter 1984, then autumn 1984, Christmas 1984, spring 1985, Easter 1985, summer 1985 and now it is with the Government.  I hope there really is a White Paper and that some day we <Col N="560" /> will see it.  Like the spokesman on Labour, I am in a very frustrating situation because we have been promised a White Paper on manpower authority for the last two years and my information is that we might get it in 1986 but that it is not even with the Government yet.  We should be thankful for small mercies.  I meet groups and discuss what might be in these documents, but this is very frustrating because we do not know what they will contain.  If these delays are not the Minister's fault, it must be equally frustrating for him that this White Paper is still not available.  It is fruitless to bring out a White Paper in the dying days of a Government.  In my view this is a major disappointment and a failure on the part of the Department and the Minister.</P>
    <P>The national plan set out the guidelines of what would happen in the public service pay area over the next three years. As is normal with this Minister, there was tough talk and he said there would be no arbitrator.  There was a long battle about the appointment of an arbitrator and whether he would have any say in the matter.  At the end of the day there was an arbitrator and he issued his independent findings.  Overnight the Government accepted his findings and all the hard talk and all that was written in the national plan was for nothing.  Perhaps the success from the Government's point of view was that they achieved something by saying that they would give nothing, that civil servants might be made redundant and that there might not be enough money to pay pensions.  We were given the impression that the arbitrator would be intimidated and would give a smaller percentage than he would have otherwise given.  But I do not believe that happened, nor does anybody else believe it.  I believe the arbitrator reached his decision independently and that the Government caved in.  I assume that what we read in the national plan has gone by the board and perhaps the Minister would tell us if these decisions will be made by the arbitrator over the next few years and that whatever he decides in the area of pay increases will be given.</P>
    <P>In my opinion it is vitally important <Col N="561" /> that the Government bring their case to arbitration.  They should fight their case and get the best advice possible from Finance and elsewhere to show that the public service is a heavy cost factor on the State, that money does not grow on trees and that they have to be very careful about the amount of money they give. The correct way to do this is to set out your case at arbitration and not attack and beat down everybody else and at the end of the day give in.  When you do that you create ill-feeling with people saying things they do not mean, threats of public servants going on strike and then the day before the strike appointment an arbitrator who is allowed to make an independent report.</P>
    <P>People who do not consider the matter too deeply say there must be an &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; situation, that there must be a tough public service and so on.  We see a new approach in the public service unions.  I do not believe these militant people would have been leading the unions in earlier days.  In some cases these people are using political influence, something which did not happen in the public service at one time.  I believe this is happening because people believe they have to show strength, because if they do not sort out this &ldquo;bully boy Minister&rdquo; he will walk all over them, they well get nothing and there may be redundancies. This may not be as the Minister sees it, but this is what people are saying.  People in positions of authority in the unions are using those tactics.</P>
    <P>It is easy to see the reason for their success in the last few years.  One does not have to go to any particular Department to see why they are so successful and so organised.  Perhaps there is a problem, because responsible unions and associations such as the Association of Higher Civil Servants whose membership would be made up of politically impartial people never being involved in corruption and always serving well politicians of all parties, are beginning to ask what one has to do to win battles and to wonder should they become more organised and more militant.  That is a bad step for our Civil Service.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="562" /> Decentralisation has always been regarded by my party as an important part of Civil Service reform.  Literally nothing has been done about it by this Government.  The Minister should tell the House whether he totally disagrees with plans for decentralisation, or if he feels that the policies which were there in the past are just nonsense.  I put forward the alternative view that the growth of urbanisation around Dublin throughout the sixties has not necessarily been a good thing and it has not helped the public service to have all the national schemes and services for the public based in the Dublin area.  What services should be moved out is a matter for the Government. I strongly contend that there must be many services which could better serve the people for whom they were set up in the first place if they were based in the rural parts of the country or in other cities.  Fianna Fáil in Government had plans and went a long way down the road to fostering that scheme of decentralisation. Does the Minister consider the matter dead and of no future value?</P>
    <P>There has been much talk, particularly in the Committee on Public Expenditure, about the funding of pensions.  I noted that the Minister did not say much about that.  Is the proposal put forward by that committee that adequate examination be undertaken to ensure that the necessary funds are available to look after our future liabilities and their costing and monitoring being considered?  This is a matter causing concern to other Governments and other administrations. People should not make wild statements that pension schemes can no longer be funded and that certain pensions have to be eliminated.  Some have attempted to highlight just a few pensions, to make a public controversy about them.  It makes good reading but the purpose behind it is beyond me.  I ask the Minister to assure the House on this point and to cost the future pension liabilities.  If there is a problem, let it be brought into the open. If it is impossible to continue to fund pension schemes for the public service at large as at present we might as well know that.  Anyone in the private sector <Col N="563" /> will tell you that it is almost impossible to buy a pension scheme which would equate with that of the public service.  It is a perk and I have said that in the past to some of the groups of civil servants whom I have met.  When they say that they have lost out compared with manufacturing industry and other sectors, they must also remember the element of their pension scheme which is a huge cost to the State and a huge perk to them.  They like to forget about this, but they must take it into account.  They are in a privileged position in that regard.  The Minister must ensure that we are not told a pension scheme is being funded when, in effect, it is not.</P>
    <P>From my early days of working in a hospital in the city I was involved with CDPS in a large way.  It was a headache for me for many years, but was of great benefit to my workload later on.  I have great respect for the people in the CDPS but, I wonder have they moved with the times.  When one visits the commercial industries abroad and sees the present capabilities of computers and the progress made in the commercial world of computers, I am not so sure that the CDPS, for one reason or other, have managed to keep up.  They had established themselves in the mid-seventies to do great things, but I am not convinced that they have continued to make progress. Perhaps it is lack of resources, or their ability to hold on to key people.  The major problem always was that once a person was trained he or she went to the outside world, to the world computer industry.  They were robbed of many of the better people.  For a long time I have considered that key people should not be paid on a graded structure, but on merit. The State loses the best brains in computers and technology after their preliminary years of training in the central computer agency.  When they become of benefit to the State, they go out into commercial enterprises.</P>
    <P>When any Member of this House goes into any Government Department as against going into banks, insurance or commercial life, the first thing noticed is <Col N="564" /> the lack of modern technology.  There seems to be a block to using automation and technology as used in other areas. The public service have failed very badly to get people to use these new techniques. Whether the problem is that of convincing people to use them or the unions to adopt them or of retraining staff, we have moved very slowly.  The Civil Service in this regard are in the same position as the banks and insurance companies were ten years ago.</P>
    <P>The amount of paper work still clogging Government Departments and the massive delays in numerous Government Departments show that we have not moved away from manual systems.  Far too much work is still being attempted manually which could be done much better by computers, as in the whole area of recording.  So much of the work is repetitive and standardised that it could not be more ideal for computerisation. If banking, insurance work, complicated stock exchange control, ordering and purchasing systems can be computerised, as is being done in almost any small business employing 20 people, it is amazing to find large Government Departments with several hundreds of staff where even a micro-processor or a hi-tech typewriter is a rare item.</P>
    <P>To find typing pools in 1985 puts the Civil Service back in the Victorian age. That is sad in the age of computers, particularly as this country is probably exporting a high proportion of the best computers manufactured in the world today.  Irish people are involved in their manufacture and in training programmes. I do not believe that computerisation of the public service, with the use of videos in information offices and quick feedback, cannot be brought in in less than 12 months' time.  If the people at present involved are expected to make this change, it may probably take that long, but I think it would be worth the investment.</P>
    <P>The Minister said his own aims for his Department are efficiency, effectiveness, value for money and courtesy in dealing with the public.  Nobody should put it better, but can he do that, with heaps of <Col N="565" /> files on floors and 19th century cabinets, when all that paperwork could be microfilmed?  It can be done by a few people on 12 months training courses. Perhaps it is in a few areas in the public service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>While the Deputy was absent from the House I said whatever the objection &mdash; even if it is an objection by the union &mdash; the matter should be brought out into the open.  It is incomprehensible that we should continue on in this inefficient way.  The Association of Higher Civil Servants have said that they have no objection to computerisation. They point out that their association made a lengthy submission to the Minister and they maintain that the content of that submission should set aside once and for all the caricature of the Civil Service so often put forward by Ministers and journalists that they are opposed to all changes in structures and practices.  They point out that they are willing to be involved in consultation regarding modernisation and technology.  The Minister can tell the House the facts of the matter.  I agree with Deputy Kelly that we should find out those facts once and for all.  The Minister has set out his commitment to have efficiency, effectiveness and value for money in the public service.  We have thousands of civil servants going around with files, biros and pencils, gathering information, duplicating work day in and day out.  All I ask is that the necessary changes be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the House recently the Minister for Health, Deputy Desmond, said that Fianna Fáil had stated they would do away with the embargo on their return to office.  That was the first I heard of it. The only commitment given in regard to this matter by Fianna Fáil was that we <Col N="566" /> would look more sympathetically at areas where it would be of benefit to the State to relax the embargo.  In my view the system of filling one in three vacancies tends to be too arbitrary.  It is used within Departments to reduce certain grades of staff while other grades protect themselves. In most Departments there is a shortage of messengers and ushers but in the senior grades there are not many vacancies.  If we are to have redeployment in the Civil Service it should not be done in such an arbitrary way.  If people are recruited on the basis that they will be employed by the Civil Service at a particular location and if they are then sent somewhere else, I do not understand why that system does not hold throughout the service and not just for some people. I welcome what is being done by the Top Level Appointments Committee and the fact that there has been so much movement within Departments.  It should happen in all grades.  At the moment the staff in the tax offices are overworked. The embargo is affecting them severely; there is far too much overtime and the staff are under pressure, but in other Departments there are people twiddling their thumbs, although perhaps not to the same degree as in the past.  When money can be collected by the State to help our balance of payments and to make our tax system more equitable, the embargo should not be applied too arbitrarily. There is considerable dissatisfaction among the staff in the tax offices.  One has only to look at the people who represent them to realise the way they are moving in Irish society.  The embargo has created much frustration in that area.</P>
    <P>What is the difficulty about redeploying in the public service?  This matter is dealt with in the committee that was chaired by Deputy Keating and I am sure we will have an opportunity at a later date to discuss their recommendations. That committee stated that the Department of the Public Service should incorporate into their manpower planning systems procedures to identify surplus staff in order to facilitate their early redeployment.  I should like to know why that has not been done.  We must <Col N="567" /> question how we can get around the embargo where this is necessary by using the mechanism of redeployment.  The lack of planning in this area is to be regretted.</P>
    <P>We have had many debates in this House on the office of the Ombudsman in the past 18 months.  In his 1984 report the Ombudsman said that while his office cannot impose their findings on the public service, they can inform the Oireachtas of any failure by a Department to respect his recommendations.  Throughout the world recommendations from the office of the Ombudsman are accepted by Government Departments.</P>
    <P>The Ombudsman referred to many problems that are the cause of much concern to our citizens.  They relate to social insurance, law of domicile, deserted husbands, various tax anomalies affecting widows, trade disputes where people are locked out and delay in the payment of benefits.  If a person cannot pay the Revenue Commissioners for five or six years he is charged a penal interest rate but that does not apply to a Department where an old age pensioner is deprived of a pension for many years.  When the pensioner eventually gets the money after many years the civil servants very carefully work out the interest rate obtaining at that time.  This is in sharp contrast to the attitude adopted by the Revenue Commissioners. A Government cannot have it both ways.</P>
    <P>I realise that to deal with many of these matters requires amendment of our legislation.  The Ombudsman has just issued his first report and the Minister has it in his power to take the necessary action with regard to the recommendations made.  I have always supported the establishment of the office of the Ombudsman.  I pressed for the employment of investigators and extra staff.  If the office costs £650,000, so be it.  I submit that Ministers should be instructed in the next budget or when they next bring a Bill before the House to eliminate the anomalies that have been pointed out. We should not allow them to build up until we next have a major Bill which <Col N="568" /> may take ten or 20 years to deal with the matter.  Mr. Mills and his staff are people of high integrity and I know they would not be interested in just issuing reports and findings that are not implemented.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister mention the prize system now operating in the Department of the Public Service.  Staff must be given some incentive.  If a person thinks he is just one in thousands of a workforce he will have no interest in putting forward new ideas.  Often civil servants are considered to be procrastinators but I should like to see them being given some incentive to become initiators of new ideas.</P>
    <P>One thing that appals me in the public service in general and not just the Civil Service is the way people are happy to be late and to count sick leave as being in addition to annual leave.  I have been criticised before for saying that.  In industry employees are given bonuses for coming into work on time.  Some reward should be given to dedicated civil servants who for years and years turn up for work in time and give of their best.  I am sure a scheme could be devised by the Department whereby an extra day's leave could be given to people who do not abuse their sick leave or turn up for work late.  Some civil servants ask what is the point in not taking the seven days uncertified sick leave when there is no reward for those who turn up for work when they are not feeling well.  The Minister should try to give incentives to lowly paid civil servants and there are very many of them.</P>
    <P>The public image of the Civil Service is that at times it tends to be unresponsive to the public needs.  Time and again we hear people complain that they went to office A and were sent to office B by a shabby looking girl in jeans.  When they got there they were told to go to office C and then they were told that they should have gone to the second floor in office A in the first place and not the top floor. That kind of thing should not happen. When one goes to the AIB one is not told to go to the Bank of Ireland.  Why does this happen every day?  Why do we have <Col N="569" /> to deal with young people who do not understand the system?  It appears that once a person becomes familiar with the system they are no longer left to deal with people over the counter.  Why do we not have public offices in the city where people could go and talk to competent staff who could help them to fill in their forms or direct them to the relevant sections for help?  Why should it be so difficult to do that?</P>
    <P>There are many forms to be filled and they are all complicated.  There are many people who are not even able to follow simple forms.  Many people who get forms to fill out for free electricity or for free transport do not understand them. People tend to become confused by forms and would much prefer to deal with a qualified person in an office and ask them a few basic questions.  Staff should be competent to deal with the public.  This would cut down the amount of work in Government Departments and would save people from having to go to their public representatives to get help.  The public view is that the Civil Service is full of bureaucracy, delays, frustrations and inaction.  There are unnecessary costs as a result of the way people are treated.</P>
    <P>It should be very easy to minimise the flow of paper and to use videos.  In 1977 I did a party political broadcast on our manifesto which dealt with simplification of language in the social welfare forms.  I know some of the staff who deal with the property tax form.  The people filling up the forms should be in good jobs but no one seems to be able to follow the form and the errors that are in the returned forms are unbelievable.  Many problems could be solved if information offices were based in key areas where people could ask questions and get simple, civilised answers.  At present that is not possible. I will not generalise about civil servants but people find it difficult to communicate with them.  Many people find it difficult to deal with the staff who man the counters.  That is a fact and not a sweeping statement.  Everyone knows it.</P>
    <P>I thank the officials of the Department for the way they have co-operated with <Col N="570" /> me during the year.  I regret that we do not have a White Paper.  The Minister sets himself up as a hard man and as a result some of the things which he set out to do have not materialised.  He may find it difficult to bring to light some of his reforms and initiatives.  Sometimes it is easier to talk and to give and take.  One often gets some of the things one wants in that way rather than by trying to browbeat and hammer everyone in sight.  That kind of attitude catches up with one and one does not get the co-operation one needs.  Perhaps during the autumn or in the recess the White Paper will be issued but there is not much point in having a White Paper if it is left lying there.  There are massive problems in the public service. The cost of it is enormous.  It is vital that reforms should have started yesterday and not wait for months to come.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his battle to get the White Paper through the Cabinet and before the House so that we can have some action on it at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the efforts of the Minister in trying to push for reform and progress in the public service.  It is obviously clear that when the Government appointed a separate Minister for the Public Service there was an unprecedented degree of commitment to reform and improvement in that area.  No one should underestimate the size or nature of the challenge.  It was truly gargantuan in its scale.  The reform of the public service is one of the major challenges facing us.  If the plans and aspirations of the Minister and the perceptions of a wide variety of commentators in a number of agencies and bodies do not become a reality then unquestionably the present trend of the growing burden of cost and less than totally efficient use of human potential in the public service will continue and will become an albatross around the neck of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are some 30,000 non-industrial civil servants in the State involving a pay bill of the order of £330 million.  In addition the Department of the Public Service <Col N="571" /> function in relation to the entire public sector which numbers some 300,000 people with a total pay bill of about £2,500 million and this is increasing all the time.  Therefore, the Department of the Public Service have a key role in ensuring not only that we get good value for money which is an economic issue but, more important, that the full potential of the public service is unleashed to deliver to the country the kind of benefits that can accrue from the excellence that is latent in public servants.  But in many cases public servants are hamstrung by lack of clear objectives, by disincentives for initiative or imagination and by lack of any encouragement other than by way of traditional models for recruitment, promotion and transfer though, as the Minister outlined, there is some evidence that that old and accepted model is beginning to change.</P>
    <P>While I cannot speak for the Minister I would suspect that he, too, would agree that in some cases this change is frustratingly slow, perhaps for very good reasons but that is how it is seen from the point of view of the public.  The major challenge then is to unleash this latent potential.  In the context of the economic difficulties we have been experiencing in the past number of years, the public service may have suffered unduly in terms of the bad image it has got.  In some cases the public service has become the whipping boy for political omissions.  The way in which civil servants do their job and the lack of clarity of the targets and goals each individual has in the work-place, are a product of neglect by successive Governments in attending to bringing on stream the full potential of the public service.  There is no point in blaming Departments for being what they are. Each of them has had a succession of political masters who in many cases were too preoccupied with temporary short term political concerns and with living on people's wants rather than on national needs.</P>
    <P>If one were to put a simple question to anyone in the public service as to what exactly his job was, one would not receive <Col N="572" /> a clear answer.  We should be slow to blame individual public servants, though I would not exonerate some of the senior civil servants who have a responsibility in this respect.  Ultimately the buck stops with the Government of the day and successive Governments, understandably perhaps, have relatively speaking reneged on their responsibility to ensure that the public sector becomes the dynamic in Irish society that it must become, first for the sake of the public servants themselves who are entitled to an environment which is conductive to their giving of their best and, secondly, and perhaps principally, because the public can no longer tolerate the incredible tax burden which arises from the growth of the public sector.</P>
    <P>Even the Department of the Public Service since their inception have had an incredibly large recruitment picture. Their numbers have continued to grow. That would be understandable if there was a concomitant reduction in staff in other areas but that has not been the case.  The embargo, admittedly a blunt instrument though effective in some respects, has tended to keep the lid on to some extent but there has been no fundamental review.  Can anyone recall when there was last a dismantling of a Government programme because it no longer was deemed to be relevant to its purpose?  Ireland must be the only State that could abolish domestic rates and still have a situation in which all those engaged in rate collection continue to occupy the same jobs.  The same applies to the time when tax on cars was abolished. Was there then any proportionate reduction in staff anywhere?  There was no such reduction.  The staff were redeployed or re-absorbed.  Ultimately the test of public service reform is a test of political courage and someone somewhere must say that enough is enough.  If we cannot win that battle we must accept, as the Public Service Advisory Council put it so colourfully in their 1984 report, that the concern with public sector reform is enthusiastic but Augustinian, in other words we are in favour of it but not just yet.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="573" /> I take the view that the public sector has major latent potential.  On any occasion on which I have spoken to public servants in this context I have been impressed by their depth of commitment, their level of ability and their downright trustworthiness.  Public servants have rendered excellent service to the State through many generations even during times that were shaky politically.  But I was impressed more than anything else during those conversations by the depth of frustration on the part of many public servants in trying to do their work.  I spoke with young civil servants after they had given three or four years service and I found that the overriding maxim in the environment in which they worked is in relation to any action they deemed to take for which the criterion always was whether there was a precedent for such action.</P>
    <P>I was employed in the public sector for a short period and I recall that if one dictated a letter, for instance, it had to accord identically with precedent.  There was no room for development, imagination or new ideas, though that is changing. We must acknowledge the efforts of the Minister to bring about change in this area.  Attempts to ensure mobility between the public and private sectors have been disappointing to some extent though I am sure that is not due to any fault of the Ministers.  Attempts to have promotion on factors other than simply the capacity of someone to stay in the service long enough are good signs but we must ask whether they are sufficient. Many members of the public, and of this House, too, would hold the view that the pace of change must be improved dramatically and that while accepting the clear and urgent commitment of the Minister for the Public Service in this respect, the Government must accept that there are fewer greater economic or social challenges to the country than the challenge as to how the public sector is to be utilised, developed and used to full potential in the coming years.  If we fail in that respect not only will there be economic problems created but the social fall-out will be incalculable.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="574" /> It is worth putting on record that this House &mdash; and this is not just lip service &mdash; owes a major debt of gratitude to the public service since the foundation of the State.  When the Committee on Public Expenditure engaged in discussions on the &ldquo;value for money&rdquo; end of the Department of the Public Service I had an opportunity to endeavour to acquaint myself with other public services throughout the world, reading how they perform, how they work.  I have to say this, I do not remember any series of incidents of any significance, of fraud, deception or subversion in the public sector here despite the relatively turbulent history we have had in this century. That has to be said.  It is important that, in our discussions, in our efforts to motivate, mobilise and bring on stream the potential of the public service, we do nothing to diminish or damage morale in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Indeed, in that context, I would say that the very least that should happen is that there should be some clear formula or mechanism devised to ensure that the public sector has the capacity to answer for itself when under attack, very often justified attack, but I have no doubt, in some cases, unfair attack.  The image of the public servant as being all absorbent, mute and silent is perhaps outdated.  It is right and proper that the public sector should be able to give an account of itself and should be able to answer when it is subjected to unjustified criticism, because some criticism in recent years has been that and has been particularly misplaced because it should have been directed at those of us in this House who have some modicum of responsibility for ensuring that policy is carried through in that area.</P>
    <P>Much of the problem arises from a lack of clarity of goal and objective in the public sector.  I have no doubt at all but that a cosmic change, a quantum leap forward would take place in the public sector if one were able to ensure that every public servant had clearly in his or her mind &mdash; preferably in writing on his or her desk, back pocket or wherever <Col N="575" />&mdash; a clear indication of what precisely was his or her job. I know that progress is being made in that respect.  The sooner that system is in place the better because only then can one become accountable. The Minister, in a speech in October 1983, made very clear that the question of management accountability and personal accountability was very close to his heart. It is in that context only that, first of all, one can be accountable from a corporate point of view but perhaps, more importantly, that one can be accountable from a personal point of view which is ultimately what we should strive at &mdash; people giving of themselves, achieving tangible and obvious targets, deriving unprecedented job satisfaction and public appreciation out of reaching for and achieving such targets.  That to me is a primary goal.  It is not principally cost-related. It is not about quantities; it is about the quality of a service.  It is about how we can put in place an appreciation in respect of each person of their function which is the basis for meaningful existence for any one of us: what exactly is our role on this little planet?</P>
    <P>I have seen train loads of young people decanted after a weekend in rural parts into this city less than totally motivated or enthusiastic about facing into their offices in the public service.  On some of these journeys, having perhaps attended a meeting in the country, I have discussed with them how they perceive their job. Frankly, most of them see themselves as punching in time.  From their point of view the overriding benefit of their job is that it offers, the magic word, security.  I have often come away feeling that it is extremely sad that we cannot somehow set these young people psychologically on fire with an enthusiasm for their work. That is the direction in which we must move &mdash; clear targets.  I believe that the departmental and sectoral targets should not merely be clear but should be publicly available, open to public discussion and exchange of views so that all of us can have an input into whether or not the targets which sectors of the public service set themselves are appropriate.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="576" /> I would say this in relation to the Minister's remarks this morning &mdash; a great deal of it has to do with internal mechanisms and administration which, I suppose, is appropriate to an Estimates speech.  But surely the real emphasis should be on the fact that when a Department is all dressed up where exactly does it go, what is its function? Dare one say it: are there Government Departments which no longer have any function?  Are there Government Departments the weighting of which is now totally disproportionate to similar Departments which occupy similar places around the Cabinet table?  There should come a time in the history of any State, perhaps regularly, when such departmental structuring should be reviewed There have been one or two relatively cosmetic changes, movements of one section to another in recent years.  Apart from that I do not recall anybody asking the fundamental question: is there any need any longer for some of these Departments? Perhaps, when viewed on their scale, by the passage of events, the growth of technology, the growth in agriculture or trends in any given area in the economy or society, they may no longer be relevant when they may have been essential at an earlier stage.</P>
    <P>If that lack of clarity exists at a corporate or sectoral level what hope have we for ensuring that individuals now in place in offices all over this country can know exactly what is their job and, if they do not know what is their job, there is no way in which they can be doing the best job possible.  All else is subordinate to that. In that context I am sure the Minister was and is conscious of the extraordinary situation relating to grades in the public sector.  I gather there are approximately 1,000 grades in the public service &mdash; incredible for a country with three and a half million people, the whole population of which could be lost in a borough in London. Frankly, I can only say that it staggers the imagination that such a situation can be allowed to obtain.  I am sure there are good historical reasons for it but that simply must cease.</P>
    <P>I know from my own brief experience <Col N="577" /> that one of the most frustrating aspects of people working in the public sector must be the absolute lack of any clear reward for extraordinary effort.  A particular effort, initiative or work above and beyond the call of duty does not seem to warrant particular appreciation.  I remember on one occasion saying to an individual in a Department that I thought he had done an excellent job.  His reply was that he had been in that Department for 23 years and that was the first time that any public representative had ever said that to him.  In itself that speaks volumes about the way we treat people in the public service, about the way we see them as human beings and as people with potential.  Ultimately, it is not about systems, sectors, Departments, it is about people being allowed, facilitated and encouraged to give of their very best. That is the environment that has to be created.  Ultimately such Departments, and particularly the Department of the Public Service, must be seen to be the repository of excellence in ensuring that their effect in galvanishing the structures of the State is of the highest possible order.</P>
    <P>That is one aspect that troubles me slightly about the present functions of the Department of the Public Service.  It is far from clear to me whether or not, even with their best efforts, they can have what I might describe as a salutary effect on other Departments when the distilled wisdom of the Department of the Public Service eventually emerges.  When they proffer systems to be put in place, when they proffer models of management, or models of accountability to other Departments, the fact is that such other Departments can simply say: that is very nice, thank you very much, we will look at that and we will let you know.</P>
    <P>If the Department of the Public Service is to be effective and taken seriously it should be seen, not just to have a salutary and chastening effect on other Departments, but perhaps its writ should be mandatory when it offers such administrative models, when it offers advice in an area in respect of which it is presumed to be, is perceived to be, is hoped to <Col N="578" /> be, and was created to be the essential repository of excellence and high standards. There is at present some degree of overlap, duplication and fuzziness about the effects of the Department of the Public Service on other Departments. That is a pity.  If there is a monitor for getting the best out of the system, which undoubtedly there is, and if there is a monitor for evaluating the expenditure, which undoubtedly there is, then the Department of the Public Service should know about it and other Departments should take it as law.</P>
    <P>Sometimes we in this House can be immersed in our work and lost to public scrutiny.  From the point of view of the layman the image of the public sector and of the Civil Service is bad, perhaps unjustly bad.  I am convinced that a lot of it has to do with the question of motivation of staff.  One of the curses of political life is the nonsensical representations in which we get involved day in and day out, few of us having the courage to dispense with them because there are two or three others in our constituency whom we believe will more than assiduously fill the vacuum.  They feel the same as us.  The reason for these representations is undoubtedly the preception that public representatives by their nature are totally immoral and will use any inside track which they are perceived to have, but which very often they do not have, in pursuit of any end regardless of its moral content, in pursuit of what might be seen to be some political advantage in three or four years' time.  It is all nonsense.</P>
    <P>If I had my way I would legislate against such representations, such seeking of preferment or advancement or advantage for an individual on spurious grounds.  It is immoral and unethical that that should be pursued, but it is.  In fairness to this Minister, on his coming to office he sent us all a very clear letter which indicated that certain kinds of representations would be accepted in a certain way and would be detrimental to the interests of the people about whom representations were being advanced. That is one reason why people come to public representatives.  I am not even sure <Col N="579" /> it is the main reason.  The main reason is because of the failure of people to elicit from the public service, a public service, a response appropriately due to them. Time and time again people's letters are not answered, their phone calls not returned, and there is no record when one wishes to pursue the matter.  Listening to this Minister I am sure that peoples names are at least emblazoned on their fronts as a help in that respect.  Would the Minister consider going further? Whoever devised the system in the planning law as operated by local authorities whereby an application for planning permission had to be decided upon within eight weeks was extremely far seeing. I do not know how that provision got through the bureaucratic labyrinth of the time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take an informed guess that it was because the English have a similar provision in their legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>That was a wise provision which has worked quite well.  It has not been that people have failed to get decisions. They got decisions and there have not been any pleas about understaffing or about difficulties in understanding submissions. There is a form whereby the local authority can request further information on something.  The system works. Any one of us knows that if we apply for planning permission we will get a considered decision within eight weeks.  We cannot write a simple letter to any Department and be sure that we would ever get an answer, even an acknowledgment. That is not good enough. Could not a system be devised to ensure that people are automatically entitled to an answer within a certain period.  It might be difficult to administer but in spirit it is essential.  There should be a clear understanding that it is the public who foot the bill and they are entitled to a public service.  They are the masters. The psychology in many quarters is the contrary.  The public are a bloody nuisance to be humoured.  They pass the buck, saying it is somebody else's responsibility and send them to another floor.  That is the frustrating, tantalising, <Col N="580" /> mind boggling perception of many people of the public service.  Some of this is totally unjustified.  I have met public servants who have gone to inordinate lengths to try to be of help and who I am sure are bad mouthed by members of the public who ultimately did not get something to which they were not entitled anyway and who should not blame anybody but themselves.</P>
      <P>Time and again the Order Paper is cluttered up with nonsensical questions to the Department of Social Welfare, for example, not because anyone believes it will advance the cause of the claimant in any way but because the Department are unable to answer their correspondence. Other Departments are similarly affected.  That is the mechanism which smart Deputies have decided to use instead of making normal inquiries.  If we outlaw a lot of the representations and galvanise the public service by the regulation I mentioned, or some permutation of it, to ensure that people get replies and service we would be doing a good job for the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The responsibilities of the Department of the Public Service were outlined to the Committee on Public Expenditure by the secretary and his officials when they came to talk to us. That is contained in our report which will be discussed later on this evening.  Those responsibilities are in many cases stated generally.  I am heartened to note that the Minister is at present and has been for some time developing a clear crystallisation of those global and general objectives into specific areas of accountability and action in respect of each section of his own Department and each Department in Government.  In a debate of this nature it would be wrong not to refer to the report from the Public Service Advisory Council, a body of voluntary people who have tried to suggest recommendations as to how the public service could be improved.  I had the pleasure of meeting them recently and I gathered that they were quite dispirited at the lack of attention to their regular reports.  Their 1984 report says, in relation to the council, that it seems as if little notice was <Col N="581" /> taken of their observations or recommendations and that the apparent indifference by the decision makers did not enhance the role of the council.  I have gone through this report and a summary of recommendations contained in their previous reports.  They offer not just food for thought but precise areas of the Department of the Public Service needing attention.  They make a point which was reflected in some ways in the Minister's speech this morning when he talked about the creation of functions and the allocations in the Department.  They make a point about restructuring in the Department:</P>
    <P>The only apparent result of this restructuring is a significant increase in the number of personnel employed in the departments concerned.  The rearrangement of functions has the cosmetic effect of giving the impression that something is being done.  It does not necessarily result in a more efficient and effective administration.</P>
    <P>That has a point.  Perhaps people busily engaged in reorganisation can lose sight of the overall objective, which may need a totally different approach.  It points out a paradox which I am sure the Minister for the Public Service must grapple with in his work.  They said:</P>
    <P>The paradox of the Public Service is that on the one hand it is a unity implementing Government policy and on the other it is an amalgamation of autonomous and semi-autonomous units each seeking a greater allocation of resources and each endeavouring to extend its influence.</P>
    <P>It is remarkable that the success of a Minister is quite often based on public perception of how much taxation he can levy implicitly on the heads of those who are deemed to benefit, how much one can fight for at the Cabinet table regardless of what one does with it.</P>
    <P>The council deserve the thanks of this House for their work.  As far as I can judge, they have worked hard and honestly trying to put forward a variety of views, many of them very significant.  In <Col N="582" /> one of their reports they refer to the point I have mentioned about the reform programme needing clear targets.  They make the point in their report No.2 that there should be an acceptable system of appeals against the decision of public servants. Perhaps the Ombudsman's office will help to deal with that, although I must say that the excellent report from the Ombudsman, which was presented in a uniquely clear style, had as its most underlying note the somewhat demented and frustrating appeal which many public representatives and members of the public have when they hope that change will come about in anomalous systems and situations which they have come across.  May be the Ombudsman should be given yet more power to insist in some way that the findings are in due course given mandatory effect.</P>
    <P>In their report No. 6 the council make a very important point which I commend to the Minister's attention.  They said that the citizen should be better educated about the public service and they developed that in detail in their report.  It is extraordinary that in our education system as yet the root of a Latin verb is still deemed more important than a knowledge of our institutions or our public service and that there is no automatic formal element in the education curriculum which emphasises the vast areas of institutional, corporate systems with which the citizen and the school leaver when he grows to adulthood come in regular contact with.  It is incredible that we do not talk to people except in the context of the famous civics course. As a former teacher of civics along with other subjects, I know how importantly that is rated in the school curriculum and in the perception of the Department of Education and of many parents when it comes to examination time.  No, we are concerned principally with trigonometry and other more important esoteric subjects. The Minister for the Public Service might consider the possibility of nudging the arm of some of his Cabinet colleagues and insisting that one way of helping the public to understand the extraordinary size and scale of the public sector might <Col N="583" /> be to educate young people to understand what it is all about at that stage so that later on it will not become, as it is in many cases, little more than a bewildering monolithic maze.</P>
    <P>The Public Service Advisory Council, chaired by Liam St. John Devlin, should be thanked.  They were given the task of monitoring reform in the public service and there is need to redress what seems to be a note in their reports that perhaps their remarks are not receiving due attention. Their latest report is in some respects an indictment of the lack of progress in the reorganisation area since the publication of the Devlin report in 1969. They have a contribution to offer and should be hearkened to and they deserve the thanks of the House.</P>
    <P>I want to refer briefly to one or two points in the Minister's speech.  I am pleased to see the Minister pushing ahead with his proposals for new and more accountable systems of management and the intention implicit therein of reforming the necessary legislation to allow for accountability by public servants.  At present a Minister is deemed to be responsible for the last nut and bolt of decisions taken way down the line.  That will be put aside as anachronistic and not in accordance with facts.  That accountability should not be misinterpreted.  It is not simply about placing blame.  It should also be about giving credit, and the excellence of many decisions by public servants would have to be respected and regarded in that context.</P>
    <P>We have extraordinary trustworthiness, great maturity and fine potential in the public service.  We can trust them to do the right thing and to do it very often. Therefore, we should devolve responsibility, and that means also that when things go wrong those who have made the decisions will have to accept the responsibility rather than some unfortunate Minister coming in here and being expected to carry the can for something about which he knows nothing at all. Possibly he had no hand, act or part in taking that decision.  Ultimately, the cream would rise to the top and people <Col N="584" /> who have standards of excellence will be recognised and acknowledged in that context.</P>
    <P>The question of mobility and trying to have an exchange of public servants with the private sector is an initiative which, even though fraught with some difficulties and with the problem that it has not taken off in the way we all hoped, should nevertheless be persisted with.  It is a good idea and I hope that there will be no discouragement of it.  I want to raise one small point in passing about the scheme of career breaks and job-sharing. Career breaks are notionally a fine idea, the idea being that a public servant will have an opportunity of refreshing himself in some other area of work, perhaps gathering further information, taking on domestic responsibilities and so on.  However, the Minister should look at the number of career breaks being taken for the setting up of private companies by people in the public sector.  There is nothing wrong in that and I would encourage it.  However, there is a grey area of overlap where some public servants have been engaged in developing business concepts and in some cases business models and organisations while still engaged in the public sector and have taken the career break as an opportunity for hedging their bets.  If the business works, then that is the last we see of them; if the business does not work, there is always a job to fall back on.  That is not what the career break was intended to do and, even though one cannot legislate against human nature, there are and have been abuses and serious abuses where people have utilised experience, information and data garnered by their experience in the public sector to establish a base for private companies outside, and the lines of demarcation have been anything but clear.</P>
    <P>That should be covered in legislation, and I am sure that the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism would have something to say about that, but let me give an example.  As late as yesterday morning I received a letter from a senior officer of a local authority because I had made inquiries about how a <Col N="585" /> contract was placed and why a particular company was not considered.  I was told <i>inter alia</i> that one of the reasons that this company were not considered was that the two main directors of the company were full-time employees of a semi-State company and were doing a nixer &mdash; that was his word, not mine.  I do not want to go into detail, but what I am saying is that the career break is a refreshing, exciting opportunity, but if there is a whiff of abuse it should be attended to.  There has been more than a whiff of abuse in a number of cases and I am quite happy to tell the Minister, as I have told one of his colleagues, of one or two examples that have come to my notice.  I suppose as long as human nature is what it is somebody will always try to bend the rule and in this House we are no different from anybody else.  But if the problem arises we should try to deal with it.</P>
    <P>All of us should congratulate the Ombudsman, Mr. Michael Mills, and his staff on the immediate integrity they have brought to their job and the clarity of their report.  The implications of that report should be listened to by Government and perhaps there should be some system whereby its recommendations would be considered formally in this House in deference to the Ombudsman's office and the wisdom to be distilled from the report.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the Minister for the Public Service is concerned to ensure that the objectives we have spoken about are pursued.  I take this opportunity to mention a matter which slightly irritated me yesterday.  Many semi-State bodies and Government Departments issue commissioned reports and others.  I often wonder whether Members of the Oireachtas are excluded from the ambit of circulation of such reports.  Yesterday I was asked to make some intelligent comment on a report relating to the possibility of local property taxation.  I did not have the report; neither do I have it today.  I never have these reports until perhaps a week or two later.  If he thinks the point is valid, the Minister might nudge those in positions of authority in Government Departments and semi-State bodies to <Col N="586" /> ensure that Members of this House, who by their agreement fund such bodies, will at least be afforded the courtesy of getting such documents at the same time as members of the public.  It would help us in our responses.</P>
    <P>I wish the Minister well in his work and look forward to the impending White Paper.  I hope it will assist him to bring into full flower the potential of the public service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to recall to the House, with all the talk about public service reform, that it is by no means a new subject.  It is now almost of &ldquo;draining the Shannon&rdquo; vintage.  Long before I came into either of these Houses public service reform and improvement was something which Governments, at least on the surface, made signs of being interested in.</P>
      <P>It is now 20 years since the Public Service Review Group were set up under the chairmanship of Mr. Devlin and they reported about 1966 or 1967.  I can remember all the excitement and talk about the Aireacht concept, the idea of splitting Departments so that the more gifted personnel, political and official, would be able to think out policy over the long term in a glass-domed penthouse without being bothered by the nuts and bolts of dealing with correspondence and so on.  Down the line there would be the purely executive part of the Department whose job it would be to put into practice &mdash; and they would feel honoured to do so &mdash; the solutions which the Aireacht devised and passed down the line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember the late Deputy Colley talking ceaselessly, it seemed to me, about the Aireacht concept, how everything would change when we got that concept into place and how the structures &mdash; that word was coming into vogue &mdash; which the Civil Service would adopt would revolutionise and streamline everything.  This was the era when words <Col N="587" /> such as &ldquo;evaluating&rdquo;, &ldquo;co-ordinating&rdquo; and &ldquo;monitoring&rdquo; began to be used to describe even the most ordinary functions which every businessman, even the humblest cobbler or candlestick maker, automatically discharges without being conscious of them, such as watching what he is at and calculating profit and loss.  It was an era in which there was a great deal of talk and new vocabulary, but in which nothing really seemed to change.  I could almost sense that the people working in the public service who had spent all their lives there did not for a second experience the flutter of a heart beat or allow their blood pressure to go up by a point on account of the revolutionary changes and monitoring, restructuring, evaluating, co-ordinating and dividing between Aireacht and executive which were being promised.</P>
    <P>That whole chapter in public administration and the mechanics of Government would be quite reasonable material for a Ph. D. thesis from someone who had managed to escape from the world of the Aireacht.  An enormous amount of time and fuss and paper and ink can be wasted on something from which very little comes.  The only analogue to this I can remember anywhere else was the amount of time wasted in the years 1967, 1968 and 1969 on the proposed merger of the two university colleges in Dublin.</P>
    <P>Time moved on and the Government changed in 1973.  One of the first acts of the new Government was to set up a Department of the Public Service under Deputy Richie Ryan, who was simultaneously Minister for Finance.  Liam Cosgrave's Government felt they did not need to apologise for merely having a Front Bench of members of the Government plus seven Parliamentary Secretaries. They did not have a battery of 15 Ministers of State with three times the supporting staff.  They did not seem to mind doubling up Departments and Deputy Ryan was in charge of two Departments.</P>
    <P>Those years rolled by.  The oil crisis and trouble in the North of Ireland tended to overshadow many things.  In due course <Col N="588" /> that Government went out of office and in 1977 Deputy Lynch was re-elected Taoiseach and sat where the Minister for the Public Service, Deputy Boland, is now sitting.  On 5 July he made a short acceptance speech.  I said many a bitter thing to Deputy Lynch in my time but I never thought he was blasé or self-important about the eminence he reached.  He is personally a very modest man.  It cannot, therefore, have been merely the sense of taking the whole thing for granted or being bored which led him to make a fairly short acceptance speech which is reported in volume 300 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>We in the Opposition were lying flattened from the defeat he had inflicted on us and it was quite open to him to speak for 25 columns of the Official Report about the North of Ireland, the EC or anything he liked.  He did not do so.  He placed in the centre of his short speech public service reform.  He did indeed make the mistake of supposing that merely to create a whole series of new posts at ministerial level by retitling Parliamentary Secretaries as Ministers of State was a significant step in public service reform.</P>
    <P>I well remember the pitiful excuses given for that move when it was eventually promoted here by Deputy Colley.  It was said that Irish Parliamentary Secretaries going to meetings abroad tended to be cold shouldered or downgraded by foreigners who did not understand that a Parliamentary Secretary in this State was a genuine ministerial office-holder.  They tended to mix it up with mere official grades in their own countries.  Of all the pitiful things I ever heard, that must be in the short list for the prize.  One could nearly contrive a few lines from a children's primer to describe the condition of the newly uptitled Parliamentary Secretaries going to Brussels or Strasbourg: &ldquo;Pat is on the mat, Pat has a new hat, `See my new hat', says Pat.&rdquo;  Merely because the Belgians did not understand that a Parliamentary Secretary was a Ministerial office-holder we had to change the title of the office and that was public sector reform.  That was the only <Col N="589" /> public service reform I could see, and a very negative one it was, implemented by Deputy Lynch and Deputy Haughey and we have kept it on.  There is no use in making a party point out of this.</P>

      <P>The smoke has cleared away after some years and, instead of Parliamentary Secretaries, we have now 15 Ministers of State supported by three times the staff which the seven wretched Parliamentary Secretaries enjoyed, discharging roughly the same quantum of work and costing six to seven times as much compared with what there was when Deputy Cosgrave left office and now.  It will be exactly eight years tomorrow since Deputy Cosgrave left.  The only public service reform I can see is that the second line Minister row has risen from seven to 15, that the total establishment in numbers has trebled and that the total expense has sextupled.  If that is the kind of example allowed to the public service, it is no wonder they say to themselves that these idiots are not really serious about public sector reform and they do not worry about it.  The only step they take is to increase their own numbers and to bow to the kind of junk journalism which talks about putting a couple of half cars into Leitrim or throwing four or give whole cars across the Shannon.  They attributed Deputy Cosgrave's defeat in 1977 to the fact that he did not put enough State cars over the Shannon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is still a lot of talk about public service reform.  We now have a Committee on Public Expenditure under the most active chairmanship of Deputy Keating but I cannot see any serious reform except the reform which the <Col N="590" /> Minister in his characteristic, hard nosed way has insisted on carrying through, namely a very substantial reduction for the first time in the history of this State of public service numbers.  If Deputy Boland &mdash; the Lord between him and all harm &mdash; were to be hit by a thunderbolt leaving this Chamber, his reform will stand as a significant achievement. Indeed, I suspect that in 1977 Deputy Lynch had the same idea in the back of his mind when he said that he considered public service reform to be of fundamental importance for the effective discharge and implementation of the programmes of national renewal and development upon which his party were then embarking.</P>
    <P>We have said enough about the programme upon which he then embarked and I am not going to repeat it. Underneath his silken expressions, there was a determination to get better value from the public service and to make sure it delivered a certain quantum of service that cost a great deal less.  That is what it is all about because the cost mentioned by Deputy Boland a couple of hours ago is now running at £2.5 billion.  I think the Minister merely referred to salaries, let alone pensions or future liability for pensions which is a cloud looming over the State.  In 25 years most of us will be gone from the House and that is when the cloud will settle because of the age structure in the Civil Service with which we are now dealing and are pushing off from year to year.  Therefore, the sum of £2.5 billion is for salaries, one-third of the whole national budget.  That does not take into account the cost of premises, typewriters, expenses, allowances, equipment and plant of all kind.  The mere paying of the public service costs one-third of the entire budget.  A further one-third of the State's revenue &mdash; I know that the Revenue and the budget are unfortunately no longer co-extensive &mdash; goes on paying interest on debt and these two items are strongly related to one another.  If we had not recklessly expanded the public service in Deputy Lynch's time &mdash; although he is not entirely to blame because it had been <Col N="591" /> happening all through the seventies, to be fair &mdash; but it happened with particular explosiveness in the era of Dr. Martin O'Donoghue who thought that we had to compare the State to a lot of covered wagons in the mid-west surrounded by whooping Indians, that we only had a certain amount of ammunition left and that we had to break out of the circle now or never.  He made his break and the Indians are still whooping.  They are getting closer, we are still inside and the covered wagons are fewer in number. Some of the older people have fallen over their rifles and everything is a great deal more dangerous.  These two phenomena are related; the recklessness of the public service and the astronomical growth of the public debt belong together because everybody worries about the current budget deficit.  That deficit, which apparently with the best will in the world cannot be got down, is directly related to the number of people on the payroll of the State.</P>
    <P>Everybody knows that I have strategic differences with the Taoiseach and his team in regard to coalition and other matters but he and the Government are as committed to trying to get down the current deficit as they were in 1982 and before then.  They cannot do it and it looks as if it will be as bad this year, if not a shade worse.  That lends a particular urgency to the question of the size of the public service and getting value for money.  I want to repeat what Deputy Keating said about the public service in regard to my own experience of it.  It is a most dedicated public service of the highest quality and, long before I came into politics, I held that opinion.  There may be exceptions but I never found as a private citizen that I was being shoved from Billy to Jack by the public service and I always found that a polite inquiry received a polite response and that if you treated those working in the public service reasonably you were treated reasonably and helpfully.  I have no complaints in that regard and my stint as an office holder convinced me that I was right in the perception.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="592" /> The public service, by and large, consists of very high principled, dedicated people, none of whom would willingly do anything injurious to the State or none of whom would do anything reckless in regard to the State's welfare.  However, no matter how well motivated and dedicated somebody is, when he is administering a system and spending money which is not his own, he will necessarily have less instinctive appreciation of what waste is and what value is than somebody dealing with their own money.  We need not waste time on that proposition because it is very obvious.  It is only an application in one sphere of the old maxim that everybody's business is nobody's business.  The public service, which means the State in the context we are talking about, spends more money in the sense that it chooses the wrong things to spend it on or even when it chooses the right thing to spend it on, it spends more than a private individual would.  I have no doubt about that.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to watch the State in all its manifestations, even the newest and humblest of them.  Even the Committee on Public Expenditure, over which Deputy Keating presides so effectively and where I am not a model attender, had absorbed the services of a certain number of public servants.  Not only do they churn out a huge amount of paper every week, but we are now into consultants. This committee is supposed to control public expenditure, not add to it.  I do not want to make a point about that committee because obviously a committee cannot work on a shoestring, although my belief is that shoestring operations are usually best, but it seems that no matter what the State does it leaks money as it moves along.  I remember a phrase from Shakespeare's Henry IV or Henry V when describing Falstaff abusively, referring to his size, as &ldquo;lards the lean earth as he walks along&rdquo;, a most expressive phrase suggesting he was so fat that the grease and tallow dropped from him at every step and literally larded the ground beside him.  That is an image which could be applied without difficulty to the State.  It cannot do anything but it <Col N="593" /> costs money of a kind that the private citizen or private company would avoid.</P>
    <P>When I was around ten or 11 years of age I remember reading a story, I think it was a William book, where they set up entertainment and charged a penny entrance but whenever a person wearing spats approached or a person dressed in a way which suggested membership of the upper middle class, the whisper went round the children &ldquo;It's double for toffs&rdquo;. Somebody dressed like that was charged double, if not ten times the rate an ordinary child would be charged.  In the same way it seems the State in all kinds of ways recklessly pays out without the same kind of foresight or prudence an ordinary householder would be obliged to apply.</P>
    <P>One does not have to go beyond the confines of this House to see examples of this.  This is not a debate on the Houses of the Oireachtas but I have complained about this often enough.  Money is thrown away in this building under our eyes, not in huge sums because there is a limit to what you can waste in a single building, albeit one populated by 168 people with a high opinion of their own importance and needs in regard to services and attendance by others.  If the sort of thing we see going on in this building is replicated elsewhere in the public service, then the truth of what I am saying will be evident.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister mentions substantial reserves of staff in public service organisations generally which need to be shaken out.  It takes guts to use an expression like that but what he means is that there are too many people with no work to do, with not enough work to do or with no sensible, useful or meaningful work to do.  That kind of plain speaking is rare with the Minister.  Later he says &mdash; and I agree with this &mdash;&ldquo;in general our aim has been, and still is, to reduce the size of the public service to a level more in keeping with the country's requirements and the capacity of the taxpayer to sustain it&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>How was the public service ever allowed to get to a level which was out of keeping with the country's requirements and which was beyond the capacity of the <Col N="594" /> taxpayer to sustain?  I am not trying to score a political point, because I know part of the answer was the reckless expansionism of 1977 and 1978, and our side probably has been at fault in this regard too, but this has to stop.  This Minister is determined to roll back this encroachment of over-employment and overcapacity in the public service.  This is the most important problem in front of us and the only one in which any serious economy can be made in the short or long term.  That determination may not be headline-worthy but it is the most important dimension of the Government's efforts today.  I see nothing more important in front of them than that.  The Minister, who seems to thrive on having people annoyed with him, is the right man to put that into practice.</P>
    <P>It is true, and I am sure it will be said by the people who feel obliged to stand up for every situation as it is, that the size of the public service relative to our population is not excessive compared with the population of other EC countries. It is only a bit more generous than the public service of any other country in the EC except Greece.  The point is we have structural problems which reduce our capacity to afford a public service of that luxuriance.  One of them is the enormous number of people who are below or above the working age.  The proportion of both our old people and particularly young people is far greater than any other European country.  That makes demands on us in regard to the provisions of schools and health services and has implications for transport, infrastructure and so on of a kind which imposes both visible and hidden charges on us which we gladly accept but which oblige us to trim our cloth more stingily in other directions, and the only direction in which we can economise is in the size of the public service.</P>
    <P>There is no point talking about the proportion of public servants in Holland and Germany because the Dutch and the Germans have higher industrial and agricultural productivity than we have and they have a far lower dependent population. Perhaps they can afford the luxury <Col N="595" /> of a very plentifully staffed public service but we cannot.  Leaving aside Knock Airport, Whitegate and so on, I believe this is the one matter which has driven us out on a limb more than any other &mdash; the reckless taking of people onto the public payroll and the pretence that this was defensible job creation.  We may create what appears to be a job but at a horrible cost for future generations.</P>
    <P>I want to refer to a few suggestions the Minister made.  He gracefully admitted that his Department have overall responsibility for expenditure control in the public service.  If it is true that is only right.  They should have overall responsibility for expenditure control particularly since their own numbers have kept growing quite substantially.  They should have dimensions of expenditure and the rate at which it grows at their fingertips.  I hope this is not a mean point to score, but last May I put down a question which was answered on 29 May.  I asked the Minister for the Public Service if he would state in tabular form the total sum spent by each Department on outside professional consultancies of all kinds in each of the years from 1970 to date.  That was a tall order and obviously there had to be a very long tabular statement given in reply, but to my astonishment, even though I had asked the Minister for the Public Service for the reply, I got 17 replies.</P>
    <P>I am told that it costs not less than £40 for a Department to answer a question. Obviously, that figure can be greater depending on the complexity of the answer.  I should be surprised if the answer to the question I asked could have been supplied by any Department, however much on the ball of a DPS kind, for such a small expenditure in terms of staff time as £40.  However, eventually what I got was 17 answers or in money terms, 17 times £40.  The format in each case is a little different but the figures are in respect of the amounts spent by the various Departments on outside consultancies in the past 15 years.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to inquire in <Col N="596" /> the Department why they have not kept track of the growth of outside consultancy expenditure in the public service. Surely it is not beneath his dignity to keep a file on consultancies as a phenomenon. We are used to such matters as tax consultancies, business consultancies and so on, but nobody seems to note or to make much fuss of the degree to which outside consultancies are beginning to be retained by the public service, big and expert though it is.  The public service is supposed to have all the answers but it seems as if the number of questions it has answers to diminishes with the years and that the number of matters on which outside people are asked to advise on seems to grow.  This is an amazing factor especially in the light of all the technological aids which should tend to reduce mechanical automatic repetitive operations. Despite the Aireacht concept and all the very high powered policy-shaping people at the top, the degree to which in money terms many Departments are apparently forced to seek outside private consultancy service and advice is growing.</P>
    <P>The figures given in the Dáil on 29 May, and which appear in the Official Report, do not show a clear pattern in every Department in the way, for instance, that inflation increases might be shown from year to year.  Instead, these figures tend to vary from year to year but the overall trend is clear.  I do not wish to bore the Minister but I shall read the figures concerned.  I have been comparing the figures for the first year in question, 1970, with the last complete year for which figures are available, that is 1984. In 1970, of the 17 Departments from which I have replies, seven or nearly half of them, reported nil in terms of consultancies. In other words, not a penny was spent by these Departments in that year on outside consultancies.  The Department of Energy had not been established then.  Consequently, I have no figure for the early year in that respect and four other Departments reported that they had not kept separate figures for the pre-1976 years and that it would be disproportionately expensive to provide the figures now.  As a result, I do not <Col N="597" /> have figures for 1970 for the Departments of Justice, Finance, Education and Labour and the only money figures I have got in respect of 1970 and 1984 are as follows.  In 1970 the Department of the Environment, then known as the Department of Local Government, spent £192 on consultancy services and, in 1984 the corresponding figure was £21,580.  In 1984, too, the figure for the Department of Justice was £31,703.  In 1970 the Department of Social Welfare spent no money on consultancy services while in 1984 the figure spent in this respect was £492,619.  I must add that this includes the provision of computer software.  The 1970 figure in respect of Fisheries and Forestry was £1,500 while in 1984 it was £30,438.  The Department of the Public Service had not been established in 1970 but in 1984 they spent £200,859 in this respect.  That was the amount they spent in respect of consultancies on the dimensions of the public service.</P>
    <P>There is no separate figure in respect of the Department of Finance for 1970 but in 1984 the amount was £48,123.  In 1970 there was a nil expenditure in the Department of Foreign Affairs in this respect but in 1984 the amount spent on consultancy services was £20,760. Obviously, the expenditure for those years for which there are no separate figures was negligible.  In 1984 the figure in respect of the Department of Education was £21,141.  The Department of Defence incurred no expenditure in this regard in 1970 but in 1984 the amount spent was £146,028.  The Department of Health spent £55,400 on outside consultancies in 1970 and the figure for 1984, which includes for provision for software, was £767,784.</P>
    <P>In the earlier year the figure in respect of the Department of Communications was £27,835.  That figure is referable too, to the old Department of Transport and Power.  In 1984 the figure which includes Posts and Telegraphs amounted to £221,859.  In 1970 the then Department of Industry and Commerce spent £313 in this respect while in 1984 the relevant figure was £323,359.  The Department of Energy were not in existence in 1970 but <Col N="598" /> in 1984 they spent £530,677 on consultancies. There was a nil expenditure by the Department of Agriculture in this area in 1970 but the expenditure in 1984 amounted to £23,589.  In 1970 there was a nil expenditure on consultancies in the Taoiseach's Department but in 1984 the figure in that regard was £21,477.  In the earlier year the Gaeltacht figure was nil while in 1984 they spent £56 on consultancies. Molaim iad as an méid a choinneáil chomh íseal sin.  One wonders what humble little consultant only charged that amount for his advice to the Department. The figure in respect of the Department of Labour for 1984 was £16,833.  Allowing for the fact that the figures for the Departments of Health and Social Welfare include provision for material which apparently cannot be dissociated from the advice, the global consultancy figure for 1984 was £2,918,885, with almost £300,000 of that having been spent by the Department of the Public Service who are supposed to know all the answers. Where is the justification for that sort of expenditure?  The public service are supposed to be expert by way of experience and of their self recruiting of specialised grades of advisers.  The public service is full of people with specialist qualifications.</P>
    <P>I wish to emphasise also, that these figures do not include fees such as architects' fees.  That is a separate matter to which the committee chaired by Deputy Keating are giving attention.  Neither do these figures include such amounts as the £12 million spent by way of architects' fees in respect of projected prisons of which not one brick has yet been laid.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to look at the whole consultancy picture and ask his Department to open a file on consultancy so that we need not to get 17 answers to a single question.  I ask him to call the <i>ad hoc</i> lads of his Department together upstairs into the glass dome on the top of the building one morning and ask would they like to devote their brainpower for a moment or two to finding the reason for consultancy developing such a dimension in the public service and asking was Deputy Kelly wrong in describing the <Col N="599" /> public service as comparable to a Falstaff larding the lean earth, because that is £3 million which has gone into private pockets.  I do not begrudge people money for their work and wish all the best to consultants, whoever and wherever they are, but £3 million is some larding.</P>
    <P>I repeat an appeal I made here before that the Minister or his Aireacht might look at a suggestion which I previously made that there should be, even if only experimentally, some system for introducing a private sector financial comptroller &mdash; let it be a consultant, if he wishes &mdash; into the bowels of the Department and keeping him there for three years with only one remit &mdash; to sweat down that Department's expenditure. After that three years, his remit or commission would be again up for grabs and, if he had not given substantial value, it would be given to somebody else.  The private sector would be genuinely interested in this and the function I would give such a comptroller &mdash; I have previously called him a resident Scrooge &mdash; imported from the private sector would be no other job but to watch ha'pence and to ask why this carpet is being laid on the stairs, why four officials are accompanying this Minister of State to Nairobi, why this or that is happening and why the need for this.</P>
    <P>I accept that a private sector accountant or management consultant put into a job like that would be a very severe irritant.  He would irritate me if I worked in the public service, possibly leading me to resign if I felt that my life was being made impossible by him.  It would be a matter for a good deal of thought, but an Aireacht should be well up to that, to decide the exact guidelines for such a consultant, who would have got his contract in a particular Department after competitively tendering with other such persons, in order not to pre-empt or usurp the policy-making of a Department.  Clearly, such a consultant has no business deciding on policy.</P>
    <P>If a Minister decides, let us say, that there should be a free school transport system, it is not the consultant's business <Col N="600" /> to say that that would cost us more than we can afford.  That is a political decision for the Minister and the Government to defend.  However, it is open to the consultant to say, in regard to putting into place a free school transport system, how that can most cheaply be done and he has a say there.  I have said this here and outside and in writing to the public service's own house journal, <i>Seirbhisí Poiblí.</i>  I must thank the editorial staff for giving me that platform and not showing any sign of offence at my doing so.  I accept that this would be a foreign body in any Department and therefore do not say that it should be applied in every Department as from tomorrow morning.</P>
    <P>The Minister might seriously consider introducing that element into one Department, purely as an experiment.  If it is a disaster, he can call it off.  As I have often said here before, one of the saddest things about all Governments, of whatever colour, is that they are afraid to experiment and to admit that something has gone wrong, but there is no shame in that.  Everybody has to have that experience and why politics and Government should be an exception to a general rule of existence, I do not know.  What is wrong with trying this in one Department and, if it does not work, saying that they will have to try something else?</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will not be put off by any occasional sarcasms of mine in this regard, but I urge him to see whether that element of private competition would improve matters.  This consultant would be in competition with others in a couple of years' time for a renewal of this commission.  Let the Minister see whether the injection of a private sector element and private sector criteria in regard to wasting and saving money would not have a beneficial effect.  This Minister has shown by the way he has sweated down public service numbers, that he has the guts to attempt such a thing.  I would be grateful if he would give a great deal of time to considering its feasibility.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Deputies who have participated in the <Col N="601" /> debate for their contributions which I found interesting and at times, I must say, entertaining, and I hope, in all respects helpful to our work.</P>
      <P>Deputy Ahern spoke at some length about the absence of a White Paper on a more modern public service, with a degree of justification.  It is no cause for joy to me that the White Paper has, as yet, remained unpublished.  I do not think anybody under-estimated the degree of consultation necessary for what has now turned out, in any event, to be a very major document.  That consultative process was long, arduous and sometimes, I must confess, wearying.  I have referred in the past to those who will always be in any organisation, who are firmly and absolutely rooted in their opposition to any change.  Sometimes they happen to be in positions where, through procrastination and the raising of various other issues, they can delay change longer than one might like.</P>
      <P>However, as I have said, the draft White Paper is now before the Government and I am pleased to tell the House that the Government have set aside a special meeting on 17 July in order to discuss it, with a view to seeing its publication in the immediate aftermath of that discussion.  Tongue in cheek after earlier indications &mdash; and on one occasion at least an undertaking &mdash; with which Deputy Ahern reasonably had some fun this morning, I say hopefully that the publication of that White Paper will be later in this month.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of points have been raised by various people which I might best try to deal with as they were enunciated. Deputy Ahern appeared to be somewhat at odds with himself regarding public service pay policy and the Government attitude towards it.  It appeared from some of his remarks that he berated or chastised the Government for the fact that the public service pay bill Estimate is now some millions in excess of the amount provided for in the national plan.  On the other hand, he appeared very critical of the Government because of the fact that there was not an immediate appointment of a public service arbitrator, or an early <Col N="602" /> hearing of the 24th round claim for the public service.</P>
    <P>I say, in the gentlest way possible, that the Opposition cannot have it both ways. One cannot complain, on the one hand, about the size and cost of the public service pay bill and on the other demand that public servants get immediate and large increases, as the media indicated was his party's demand.  His party were reported last year as indicating at a meeting with the Council of Trade Unions that they were opposed to a pay pause and were in favour of a public sector pay increase in line with the cost of living. In fact, the agreement I secured in the ultimate involved a seven months' pay pause and if I had not done so, the public service pay bill for this year would have been substantially higher.  It is understandable that points like this are raised in debates on Estimates, but parties must get their priorities right and decide what their policy is.  They must decide whether they want to spend more money on public service pay and charge the public more tax in order to pay for it.  If that is what they want to do, then that is what they should tell the public.</P>
    <P>The Government are firmly committed to containing the cost of the public service pay bill in pursuit of a commitment to taxation reduction.  The Opposition want to see the public service pay bill increased, and they enunciate that clearly, but they must set beside that the additional cost to the taxpayer.  If we are going to disagree let us disagree on policy lines rather than have a variety of debating points.</P>
    <P>Various references were made to technology. The principal Opposition spokesman, having spoken about his knowledge of CDPS, wondered if the Civil Service were falling somewhat behind in the area of technological changes, perhaps to some extent because of the loss or wastage of staff who are inclined to go to more highly remunerated areas.  Technology has changed at a dazzling rate in the last few years and I am not sure if any organisation has kept fully up-to-date with that rate of change.  I have said several times that I am certain that the rate <Col N="603" /> of adaptation to technology, in particular information technology, is slower here than in other European countries. Europe is somewhat behind America and America is vying with Japan.  In the context of large bureaucracies, I do not think the Civil Service is any slower than other large organisations here.</P>
    <P>As I said in my speech, a number of important initiatives have been taken. We have set up the information management advisory service, we have hived off the centralised computing service in CDPS to Departments and we have set up a micro computer centre to encourage civil servants to be aware of what is available in that area.  Technology now forms an integral part of every training course for every civil servant and, irrespective of the purpose of the course, there is an element in it that is designed specifically to encourage the greater use of technology.  There is the challenging concept of the advantages of networking to which I referred in my speech.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern asked for a clear definition of decentralisation.  He said it had been the policy of his Government to favour decentralisation but I have to say that is not so.  There was an abuse of the word &ldquo;decentralisation&rdquo; and its meaning in the suggestion by a previous Fianna Fáil administration that they would transfer individual Departments or offices from Dublin to other locations throughout the country.  That is not decentralisation.  Decentralisation is identifying decisions and areas of work that have been centralised and which might better be dealt with on a devolved decentralised basis locally.  That is what the Government are committed to do.</P>
    <P>In the past few months there was a major announcement regarding the commitment of the Government to decentralise to local authorities functions that are carried out at present by Departments. That is real decentralisation and it will lead to additional jobs in the regions as the centralised Departments are slimmed down and the work and the staff are shed to the local authorities.  That was an <Col N="604" /> announcement of fundamental importance to the future of the country which went largely unnoticed and uncommented upon in this House and in the media.  The fact that as many services as possible will be administered by the local authorities and that only where it is necessary will services be administered by the central Departments will have a fundamental change on Irish life and on the public service.  I am pleased that recently the Government asked me to chair a committee to oversee the implementation of that programme and to identify the areas that are administered centrally at present and which might better be administered by the local authorities.</P>
    <P>We should not try to fool ourselves on this matter.  There is no point in putting the Department of Fisheries in Killybegs just because that would suit the Killybegs fishermen.  It must be realised it would not suit fishermen from Schull or Dunmore East and it would be just as disadvantageous for them as having the Department in Dublin.  However, there may be certain functions in the Department that could better be administered by the county councils in Donegal, Waterford or Kerry.  That is what real decentralisation means.</P>

      <P>The proposal was published and a document explaining the matter is available from the Department of the Environment.  I should have thought it would have been circulated to all Deputies.  I realise the Deputy may have been busy with other things at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ahern was concerned, with justification, with regard to the size of the public service pension bill and the fact that it is unfunded.  That is a problem. The size of the public service liability will be a problem in the year 2010 or 2015.  It is a problem that is not peculiar to this country but is facing other countries at a much earlier stage.  Recently I read that two of the more advanced democracies will have a public service pension liability <Col N="605" /> at the turn of the century that is in excess of their total present income from income tax.  Very many pension funds, both private and public sector, are under-funded at present.  There are downstream consequences for a number of the major funds that have serious implications, and sometimes implications of a more immediate nature than the Civil Service system which is unfunded.  I am not sure if there is any particular difference in that context.</P>
    <P>I was interested to hear the remarks made by Deputy Keating.  However, some of them were contradictory.  He is somewhat misled in his suggestion that the Department of the Public Service have continued to grow in size.  Figures were supplied to him in his capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Public Expenditure and I am surprised he made that mistake.  I have shown clearly that numbers in the Department have fallen from 480 to 360 as at last March.  This has happened in the past two years and it is a sizeable reduction.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keating suggested that the embargo has kept the lid on the growth in the Civil Service.  Deputy Kelly's remarks were in contrast to that.  He explained how effective the embargo had been. There has been a fall of 2,800 in the size of the Civil Service since 1981, that is, a fall of over 8 per cent.  It is a little less than generous to describe that as keeping the lid to some extent on the size of the Civil Service.</P>
    <P>I am always interested to listen to public representatives embark on forms of self-flagellation.  It intrigues me to hear them complain about clientism and about making representations in the knowledge that they have not the right or the authority to influence decisions while, at the same time, they embark on that course on a daily basis.  If a Deputy is not interested in clientism then let him get out of it.  He should not complain about the matter publicly in this House and then privately send me bundles of letters asking me to get jobs for people when he is not entitled to do that.  I am not going to get jobs for people: they will only get them on merit.  Members should not <Col N="606" /> come into this House and proclaim one thing publicly while adopting the opposite course in a private capacity.</P>
    <P>As usual, Deputy Kelly was interesting and informative.  He was generous enough to praise the effects of the embargo, although he was a little ungracious in suggesting that he thought that was the only reform of the public service that had taken place.  In the last two years we set up the office of the Ombudsman and appointed an Ombudsman.  We radically changed the system of appointing senior civil servants with the introduction of the top level appointments committee.  We created open competition at all administrative and managerial levels from HEO upwards.  There are interdepartmental promotion mobility schemes and virtually every second post is now available for filling through interdepartmental schemes.  We introduced job sharing and career break schemes which despite the embargo have allowed for the appointment of 800 new people. We introduced performance appraisals so that people will receive promotion based on their ability and their performance on a daily basis.  We introduced new technology training.  We have given considerable emphasis to improving service to the public at the point of contact.</P>
    <P>These are considerable achievements. I hope that when the White Paper is published in the near future I will be in a position to advance that change to a marked extent.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £21,577,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and of certain services administered by that Office, including certain grants-in-aid.</P>
      <P>As is customary, I propose that the Vote for Foreign Affairs and the Vote for International Co-operation be debated together.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, will speak later on his area of responsibility.</P>
      <P>The sum proposed for the Vote for Foreign Affairs is £21,557,000.  Most of this provision is required for the salaries of staff at headquarters and at 39 missions and offices abroad.  Provision is also included for travelling expenses and communications and Post Office services, for repatriation and maintenance of Irish citizens who get into difficulties abroad, for cultural and information services and for North-South and Anglo-Irish Co-operation.</P>
      <P>In presenting the Estimate for the Department of Foreign Affairs, it would be useful if I were to try to do three things.  First, to speak about some striking features of the international situation at present; secondly, to examine the implications for Irish foreign policy particularly with regard to the European Community and European Political Co-operation; and, thirdly, to review the current and evolving situation with regard to Anglo-Irish relations and developments in Northern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In speaking about the international situation generally or in reviewing developments and future trends it is seldom easy to avoid a discursive and apparently abstract account which may give rise to the impression that international relations and its content and conduct are removed from the average person and his or her daily concerns.  In an effort to illustrate some of the concrete realities of international relations and their impact <Col N="609" /> let me read a list of names: Jean Donovan, Yvonne Fletcher, Anthony Berry, Fr. Niall O'Brien, Aidan Walsh, Fr. John Kingston, Allyn Conwell and Robert Stethem. Some or all of these names will be familiar to Deputies but it would be useful if I were to put each in context and point to their relevance to the subject matter of today's debate.</P>
    <P>Jean Donovan was a young American girl and a student of UCC who was murdered in EI Salvador in 1980 together with a number of American nuns and lay workers.  Yvonne Fletcher was the young woman police constable who was shot dead outside the Libyan Embassy in London last year.  Anthony Berry, a British politician, was one of the five victims who died in the Brighton bomb incident of last year.  Fr. Niall O'Brien was and is a familiar face and voice which came to be known throughout the country during the period of his detention and trial in the Philippines.  Aidan Walsh is an Irishman working with the United Nations Relief and Work Agency in Lebanon who was abducted and later released.  Fr. John Kingston was abducted by the rebel UNITA forces in Angola and also thankfully released.  Allyn Conwell was the man whom his fellow prisoners elected as their spokesman during the recent hijacking incident in Beirut and Robert Stethem was the US Navy diver murdered by hijackers in Beirut and dumped onto the tarmac.</P>
    <P>I have listed these names because each is that of a victim of what seems to have become an increasingly dangerous feature of international life &mdash; the extent to which international anarchy threatens order and terrorism threatens political dialogue, negotiation and compromise.</P>
    <P>In essence, the basic issues in international relations today, behind all the complexity and apparent contradictions, can be starkly stated.  Which is to prevail &mdash; international anarchy or international order, the rule of force or the rule of law, might or right, confrontation or co-operation, the terrorist and the tyrant or the elected representatives of the people?</P>
    <P>For Ireland and for Irish foreign policy under every Government there has never <Col N="610" /> been the slightest doubt about where we stand, where our interests lie and what the people of this country wish to see their Government and their representatives abroad uphold and promote.  We believe in the rule of law, in co-operation and international solidarity not merely from a conviction that these ideals and aims are the foundation for a stable and decent international order and desirable in themselves as ends.  We believe in them also because for a small country with a vulnerable and open economy, a young and growing population and an historic conflict on our island and between us and our nearest neighbour to resolve &mdash; international stability, respect for the rule of law, co-operation and dialogue are the necessary means and the only means by which we can and should defend and promote our interests and achieve our aims nationally and internationally.</P>
    <P>I have made these points at the outset not only because I believe they are a relevant backdrop to what I wish to say in detail about our international relations over the past year and in the period ahead but also because they may serve to illustrate the spirit and purpose with which these relations are conducted by the Government, the Foreign Service, Development Aid officers, Irish troops in peacekeeping and truce observation missions overseas and the hundreds of Irishmen and women working abroad as volunteers and aid workers and missionaries. The day to day work of these Irishmen and women, whether in our Embassy in Beirut or Tehran, in UNIFIL in South Lebanon, with UNDOF on the Golan Heights, at the UN in New York or in the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, in development aid projects in Africa or in negotiations in Brussels or London are part and parcel of a consistent effort by this country to play a useful role among the nations.</P>
    <P>In speaking about the general international situation and the main activities of the Department of Foreign Affairs over the last year I begin by recalling that about this time last year, when the <Col N="611" /> Estimates for my Department were presented, Ireland was about to assume its Presidency of the Council of Minister of the European Communities.  The principal concern of our foreign policy, therefore, during the latter part of 1984 was to conduct our Presidency effectively and efficiently.  Our aim was to try to ensure that when we handed over the job to Italy the tasks which we had undertaken had either been brought to a positive conclusion or to a point where their successful completion could be prosecuted by the succeeding Presidency.</P>
    <P>By and large we discharged our responsibilities comprehensively and well.  I would like to single out three particular issues in the political field which I regard as important achievements.  The first of these related directly to the problem of terrorism.  In September last, in the wake of a number of incidents, including that which occurred at the Libyan Peoples' Bureau in London, to which I have already referred, the Ten agreed on concerted measures to deal with the growing problem created by the abuse of diplomatic privileges and immunities for terrorist ends.</P>
    <P>Recently, we have seen new outbreaks of international terrorism, hijackings of aircraft, most notably the TWA aircraft held in Beirut, the abduction and holding hostage of passengers and crews, the murder of a passenger as well as the bombing of the international airports in Frankfurt and in Tokyo.  In the latter instance, the bomb concerned might well have exploded on board an aircraft with devastating consequences.  It is Ireland's intention and that of its partners to continue to co-operate fully with international efforts to deal with this growing menace.</P>
    <P>We should be in no doubt about the threat which air piracy, hijacking and terrorism impose.  Nor should we have any compunction either in insisting that the taking of innocent hostages and their use as bargaining counters cannot be condoned in any way.  The remaining American, French and British hostages held in <Col N="612" /> Lebanon must be released unconditionally and without delay.  Ireland together with its partners will do all it can to contribute to this end.</P>
    <P>We must also be willing to face the truth about terrorism summed up in the saying: &ldquo;Those to whom evil is done do evil in return&rdquo;.  It should therefore be acknowledged that the phenomenon of international terrorism will never be fully extirpated unless the substantive political issues and injustices which too often are at its roots and cause it to grow and flourish are themselves addressed.  This is true in the Middle East, in Central America, in Southern Africa and, indeed, nearer home.</P>
    <P>A second major task of the Irish Presidency was to prepare and organise, on behalf of the Ten and the Community, a meeting in Costa Rica of 21 states comprised of five countries of Central America &mdash; Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua &mdash; the four Contadora countries, Colombia, Mexico, Panama and Venezuela, the ten member states of the Community, and Spain and Portugal.</P>
    <P>The Costa Rica meeting was an unprecedented encounter between Central America and Europe.  Its essential aim was to try to give effect to the basic approach of the Community countries to the problems of the region, that is, to help to create conditions in which the conflicts in the region can be resolved peacefully and its manifold economic and social problems tackled on the basis of co-operation and international solidarity. That meeting was successful, not only in emphasising the Ten's support, and that of Spain and Portugual, for the peace process but also in preparing the way for negotiations aimed at the conclusion of a co-operation agreement between the Community and the countries of Central America.</P>
    <P>I hope that a follow-up ministerial conference, at which a co-operation agreement could be signed, will take place before the end of this year.  I know that the Contadora process has experienced severe difficulties but I remain convinced <Col N="613" /> that the approach embodied in the Contadora process continues to offer the best hope of reaching a solution to the problems of the region.  We hope that the Central American and Contadora countries will redouble their efforts to arrive at a comprehensive agreement.  We will continue to do whatever we can to support these efforts.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, it fell to Ireland to organise and host a second important political &mdash; economic dialogue during our Presidency &mdash; that between the ASEAN countries and the Ten and the Community which took place in Dublin last November.</P>
    <P>Both the Ten and the ASEAN countries were pleased with the successful outcome of this meeting too.  South-East Asia is a region assuming increasing political and economic importance.  It is, therefore, of interest to the Ten and the Community to develop an institutionalised and co-operative dialogue with that region.</P>
    <P>Last year, at this time, Ireland and its partners in the Ten were emphasising the urgent need for a resumption of the strategic and political dialogue between the Soviet Union and the United States. Ireland and its partners have continued to emphasise the need for dialogue, and wherever and whenever possible to work themselves in their contacts with Eastern European countries and the United States to this end.  As the House knows, the strategic arms talks between the Soviet Union and the United States resumed earlier this year in Geneva in a new and complex form embracing negotiations on outer space, intercontinental strategic missiles and intermediate range nuclear forces.</P>
    <P>It is far too early to say whether these negotiations can be brought to a successful outcome.  Nonetheless, we must welcome the fact that they are taking place and earnestly hope that they will be pursued with patience and perseverance with the manifest aim of succeeding.  The political dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union is also showing some hopeful signs.  Yesterday the long awaited summit between President <Col N="614" /> Reagan and President Gorbachev was set for November next.</P>
    <P>The dialogue and relationship between these two great powers is crucial to the success of a whole range of international negotiations and activities.  Even if we do not participate directly or indirectly in the negotiations between the superpowers, each of us has a stake in their outcome.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, negotiations between East and West in which Ireland has participated.  In Stockholm, we are involved in the painstaking and patient work of the Conference on Disarmament in Europe.  Earlier this year in Ottawa, we took part in a forum on human rights in which the implementation of the provisions of the Helsinki Final Act was reviewed and efforts made to promote greater respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms throughout Europe.</P>
    <P>Later this year, in September, we shall participate in an important review meeting on the functioning and future of the Non-Proliferation Treaty.  Ireland has long been an advocate of non-proliferation and it will be recalled that the original United Nations Resolution proposing the Non-Proliferation Treaty some 20 years ago was an Irish initiative.  There are now more than 120 parties to this treaty, which is a clear demonstration that the majority of non-nuclear states continue in their commitment to refrain from the acquisition of nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>It remains our view that the nuclear powers and, in particular, the Soviet Union and the United States have a special responsibility to curb and reduce nuclear armaments and to lead the way towards nuclear disarmament.  Moreover, their commitment to implementation of the non-Proliferation Treaty is a prerequisite to progress towards more stable foundations for international peace and security.</P>
    <P>I wish to speak briefly in regard to a number of regional conflicts and our approach to them.  The Middle East continues to be a major source of international conflict and tension.  Ireland, not least because of the presence of our <Col N="615" /> troops serving with UNIFIL, has followed closely the rapidly changing situation there.  Despite the immense difficulties and tragic circumstances which afflict large numbers of people in that part of the world, there are grounds for some optimism for the future.  In the past few weeks Israel has completed the withdrawal of its troops from Lebanon though it continues to maintain military advisers in a zone in Southern Lebanon.</P>
    <P>Along with our partners in the Ten we have taken a consistent position in favour of the restoration of the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Lebanon.  Regrettably the occasion of the Israeli withdrawal has not led to major improvements in the internal affairs of Lebanon.  The country is more than ever torn by internal conflicts and to a certain extent constrained by external pressures from its neighbours.  As a result the solution of the Lebanese crisis cannot be divorced from an overall settlement of the Middle East question.</P>
    <P>The intercommunal violence which has beset the country in recent months has further polarised an already deeply divided country.  Ireland, in common with many other countries, has appealed to the Lebanese Government and the other authorities in Beirut, for restraint and a return to the search for a peaceful solution of the problem.</P>
    <P>On a broader plane recently there have been developments in the search for a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict which give grounds for hope of real progress. The current intensification of activity dates particularly from the signature of the PLO-Jordan accord in February. Building on this agreement President Mubarak of Egypt and King Hussein of Jordan have actively canvassed international support for the opening of negotiations between Israel and a joint PLO-Jordanian delegation.  The formulation of these proposals and their development have required courage and have entailed risks for those involved.</P>
    <P>In discussions among the Ten we have supported the argument that the latest developments deserve a positive <Col N="616" /> response.  The increasing interest of the PLO in a negotiated settlement, as evidenced by the PLO-Jordanian accord, is a most helpful development. Our belief is that these latest moves can pave the way for meaningful negotiations between the parties concerned which would, in turn, lead to the kind of compromises which such a deep-rooted problem as the Arab-Israeli conflict requires.  Ireland's wish is to see a fair and durable peace established between the Arab states and Israel and a just solution of the Palestinian question.  We remain convinced that the principles set out in the Venice Declaration of 1980 are essential for such a settlement.</P>
    <P>The war between Iran and Iraq continues with no sign of a let up.  The duration, ferocity and scale of casualties bring to mind the horror and stalemate which characterised the First World War.  Yet despite the enormous losses in human life and the mediation efforts of many organisations, and countries, the international community has so far failed to put an end to this war.  We have publicly stated on many occasions our desire to see a ceasefire, withdrawal to internationally recognised frontiers and a negotiated settlement of the conflict.  We have also indicated our support for peace efforts on these lines and in particular for the efforts of the UN Secretary-General. At a practical level we have contributed officers to the United Nations Investigation Teams set up in 1984 with the agreement of both belligerents to monitor attacks on civilian population centres.</P>
    <P>The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan continues to exact a heavy toll on the population within the country, and in view of the large exodus of refugees, an increasing burden on neighbouring countries. The Government welcome the negotiations which are being conducted by the UN Special Representative aimed at finding a peaceful solution to the conflict.  But we cannot be overly optimistic about the outcome.  Ireland believes that any solution to the Afghanistan conflict must create conditions whereby the Afghan people can exercise their rights to self-determination and must <Col N="617" /> respect the independence, sovereignty and non-alignment of that country.</P>
    <P>South Africa continues to control Namibia in clear defiance of international opinion and the United Nations.  Most recently it has been condemned by the Security Council for setting up of an unrepresentative internal interim administration for the territory.  We will continue to work towards a peaceful negotiated settlement leading to independence for Namibia in accordance with the provisions of UN Security Council Resolution 435.  The Government remain willing to assist as appropriate, peace efforts in accordance with this plan.  We are prepared to provide a contingent of Garda for service with the proposed UN Transition Assistance Group to help prepare Namibia for independence.  We are also prepared to supply military observers and support personnel if requested by the Secretary General.</P>
    <P>In South Africa itself the regime has been shaken by an explosion of political violence among the majority black community. Hundreds have died since the latter half of last year as result of this violence, in clashes with the police and in incidents in black townships across the country.  The appalling and indiscriminate shooting of protesters by police near Uitenhage in March was condemned by Ireland and her Community partners. The South African Government in recent months have announced reforms ostensibly designed to improve the condition of urban blacks, but they have shown no serious intention of making any fundamental alteration in the basic structure of the apartheid system, nor have they engaged in political dialogue with leaders of the black community.</P>
    <P>South Africa has continued, moreover, to flout international opinion by its aggressive and destablising activities in neighbouring states.  Despite its announcement that its troops were to be withdrawn from Angola, activities by South African forces continue to be reported there.  Recently South African commandoes attacked the capital of Botswana, a country heretofore free from the strife which has affected the region, <Col N="618" /> killing, among others, a six year old child. Despite the 1984 Nkomati Accords, under which South Africa undertook to curb its support for the rebel MNR movement, the situation in Mozambique continues to be serious.</P>
    <P>These activities both within and beyond South African borders have strengthened international opinion against South Africa as never before.  Ireland welcomes this development as we have long advocated a stronger international line against South Africa.  The Government will continue to work, at the United Nations, for the adoption of further mandatory sanctions against South Africa, such as an oil embargo, a ban on new direct investment and a strengthening of the existing arms embargo.  Within the European Community, in the framework of European Political Co-operation, we shall also continue to press for the Community to use its economic and political influence to persuade South Africa to end apartheid.</P>
    <P>This year the UN celebrates its 40th anniversary.  This year too, Ireland marks the 30th year of its membership of the world organisation.  During those years the UN has faced many crises and has contributed in no small measure to their resolution.  Nevertheless it is clear that the UN is not functioning as it should and that the high hopes and aspirations which greeted its foundation have not been met. This is a matter of grave concern.  Any weakening of the UN as an organisation weakens respect for the rule of international law and weakens the instruments for conflict resolution.  As a small country with limited ability to influence international developments but critically dependent on international stability for trade and investment, Ireland has a crucial interest in the maintenance of an international framework based on co-operation and the rule of law.  We are consequently concerned at the continued erosion in the authority and standing of the UN organisation and at the unwillingness or inability of states, including the major powers on the Security Council, to make the system work.  We have pledged ourselves to work with the Secretary <Col N="619" /> General and other like-minded states to improve the functioning of the organisation and to restore it to its central place in international life.</P>
    <P>A practical way of contributing to the aims and ideals of the UN has been our participation in UN peacekeeping operations. We celebrate this year the 25th anniversary of Ireland's involvement in the UN peacekeeping force in the Congo. Today we participate in the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO); in the UN Inspection Teams in Iran and Iraq; in the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP); and we provide a large contingent to the UN Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL).  It is appropriate that I pay tribute to all members of the Irish Defence Force who have participated in the UN peacekeeping operations.  By their efforts Ireland has built for itself an international reputation in peacekeeping of which we can be justly proud.  We must be aware, however, that our personnel may not always be free from the dangers inherent in international peacekeeping operations.  We have seen examples of this most recently in incidents involving UNIFIL and the Israel defence forces and Israeli-backed militias in southern Lebanon.  I can assure the House that every effort will continue to be made to minimise the risks to Irish personnel serving with UNIFIL and to ensure that UNIFIL will be in a position to implement its mandate.  The Government, in addition, will continue to monitor developments in southern Lebanon; to co-ordinate with other troop contributing countries; and to evaluate our contribution to UNIFIL in the light of the recommendations of the UN Secretary General.</P>
    <P>The second topic which I wish to discuss today is the European Community. Last year was a particularly significant one for the European Community. The Stuttgart Summit of June 1983 had committed the member governments to a relaunching of Europe.  Such a relaunch could take place only on the basis of a reassessment of the progress made in achieving that &ldquo;ever closer union among <Col N="620" /> the peoples of Europe&rdquo; to which the Treaty of Rome commits us.  And this work could only effectively begin following substantial progress in resolving the immediate problems which had long preoccupied the Community.  The progress achieved during the French, Irish and Italian Presidencies in resolving the problem of the British budgetary contribution, in agreeing an increase in the Community's own resources &mdash; a decision of considerable importance to Ireland &mdash; and in bringing the accession negotiations with Spain and Portugal to a conclusion allowed the Milan European Council to concentrate on the issue of further European integration.  The conclusions of the Summit will have direct and important bearing on a number of issues concerning the further development of the community which I should like to discuss.</P>
    <P>I should first recall that the outcome of the enlargement negotiations with Spain and Portugal was a fair and balanced one. Let me take this opportunity to welcome the signature of the Treaties of Accession in both countries.  We look forward to their full membership on 1 January 1986.</P>
    <P>In the key area of fisheries the agreements reached are very positive in terms of the protection and further development of the Irish fishing industry.  Not only will Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels be excluded for ten years from fishing in the 50 mile Irish box zone around our coast, but after 1996 only 93 Spanish vessels will be allowed fish in the Irish box area.  Enlargement also presents this country with opportunities arising from the early opening up of the hitherto highly protected Spanish market.  Spanish and Portuguese industrial tariffs will be progressively dismantled over seven years.  Moreover, the abolition of quantitative restrictions from the date of accession should be of assistance to Irish exporters, some of whom have encountered difficulties in the past in gaining access to the Spanish market.  The opening of the Iberian markets will likewise provide opportunities for the development of agricultural exports to these countries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="621" /> Apart from the question of enlargement the issue which has been to the forefront of Community affairs in the past year has been the question of further progress towards European Union.  The <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs, the Dooge Committee, which was set up by the European Council in Fontainebleau in June last year, reported to the European Council last March.  The report of the committee was the principal basis for the discussions on the further development of the Community at the European Council in Milan last weekend. The Taoiseach has already reported in detail on the Milan Summit.  However, I should like to make some brief observations on the proposals from the Milan Summit regarding the future development of European Political Co-operation. These proposals are contained in the draft treaty proposed by France and Germany, which will be the main basis for efforts to strengthen the commitment, broaden the scope, and improve the functioning of European Political Co-operation.</P>
    <P>The text agreed in Milan as the basis of further work in this regard has a number of elements of particular importance for this country and for the approach which successive Governments have taken towards the further development of the scope and content of European Political Co-operation.  I would like especially to mention three points.</P>
    <P>First, it has always been our view that the interests, particularly of the smaller member states, are best protected if the extent and nature of their commitments and their rights within the Community are clearly and precisely defined. Consequently, it is of advantage to us that the commitments, obligations and rights of member states with regard to the process of political co-operation should be incorporated in a juridically precise and binding form.</P>
    <P>Second, the Franco/German draft agreement explicitly sets out important distinctions, to which I have referred repeatedly in the past.  The most significant of these, already referred to in his speech on Tuesday by the Taoiseach, is <Col N="622" /> the provision by which the draft treaty places consultation and co-operation on security matters other than their political and economic aspects, that is to say, matters with operational defence implications, firmly outside the framework of the proposed political co-operation arrangements.  Such co-operation on security and defence matters will be the province of the Western European Union which Ireland has no intention of joining.</P>
    <P>Third, Ireland has consistently argued that the further development of political co-operation must be firmly linked to developments in the Community framework. In this regard, the approach adopted by the Milan European Council is advantageous since it clearly implies that progress within European political co-operation will be part of an overall advance towards the creation of a genuine community of economic interests.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, a few words on a subject which might aptly be entitled &ldquo;Irish neutrality and political paranoia&rdquo;.  We have heard a great deal lately both inside and outside this House about sinister moves and plots to undermine Irish neutrality. The weavers of these fantasies it seems expect the public to believe that, by some combination of art and guile yet to be explained, Ireland can be smuggled into a military alliance unbeknownst to herself. However, as usual, no evidence has been produced to substantiate these dark imaginings.  Perhaps we might be permitted to hope that for some time to come at least, the outcome of the Milan Summit and the clear acceptance and understanding of Ireland's position will serve to spare us all from the pervasive and ultimately pernicious rumour-mongering about the imminent danger to Irish neutrality.</P>
    <P>The Government believe that European Union must rest on a solid economic foundation.  There is a danger of regional disparities becoming even more pronounced in the enlarged Community. The Government have accordingly pressed for more effective action by the Community to reduce regional imbalances. The promotion of genuine economic convergence was an important aspect of the <Col N="623" /> Government's approach to the work of the Milan European Council and will remain a priority objective in our approach to the deliberations and decisions arising from Milan.  At our urging, the Milan European Council decided that the objectives of harmonious development and economic convergence should be given due weight in the pursuit of the Community objective of developing a single free market.  Moreover, the Milan European Council invited the Commission to submit to the European Council meeting next December a detailed report on current inadequacies as regards growth and employment in the European economy compared to those of its major competitors and on the new strategies that could be implemented to remedy the situation.</P>
    <P>The pursuit by the Government of the objective of genuine convergence will involve, among other things, efforts to exploit such possibilities as may exist for greater concertation of the economic policies of member states, notably to combat unemployment; support for increased resources for the structural funds and, to the extent that this may prove necessary, for assigning a greater proportion of these funds to the regions most in need, including Ireland; support for strengthening the European Monetary System; and, most pertinently, advocacy of the need for a further increase in the Community's own resources.</P>
    <P>This country has benefited substantially from the structural funds, receiving some £1.05 billion since our accession.  In 1984 alone we received approximately £198 million from these three structural funds.  The increase in the Community's own resources from 1 per cent to 1.4 per cent next January should help to ensure that the resources available to the structural funds will be adequate to meet the demands placed on them in the short term.  However, the Government will work to ensure that any new pressures devolving on the structural funds as a result of enlargement do not lead to a reduction in transfers from the funds to meet this country's needs as a member of <Col N="624" /> the Community.  Indeed when the European Council at Brussels last March reached decisions on the financing of integrated Mediterranean programmes, designed to cushion the Community's Mediterranean regions against the impact of enlargement, we were successful in having the European Council agree that the use of structural funds money to help finance these programmes would not adversely affect transfers from the funds of other less prosperous and priority regions of the Community like Ireland. This provision has since been written into the legislation governing the operation of the integrated Mediterranean programmes.</P>
    <P>The international economic situation in recent years has not been conducive to expansion or to a recovery in employment. The outcome of the Economic Summit in Bonn in May must be seen as inadequate when seen against the realities of the existing situation.  The suggestion that certain of our partners would expand their economies in order to give some stimulus to the world economy was dismissed.  Accordingly we have been active in every possible forum in drawing attention to the huge number of people who are out of work, particularly in the Community.  The European Council in Milan asked the Commission to prepare a detailed report on current inadequacies as regards growth and employment in the European economy compared to that of its major competitors amongst the industrialised countries and on new strategies that could be implemented to remedy the situation.  We see the preparation of this report, which is to be ready later this year, as recognition of the case that we have consistently been making.  We will continue to make this case and to stress the urgent need to intensify the struggle against unemployment particularly at the Community level.</P>
    <P>The international economic situation is of very great importance to a small open economy such as ours where a high percentage of our gross national product depends on international trade.  The international economy continued to grow <Col N="625" /> in 1984 for the second year of world recovery after a long period of recession. However, it is not certain that this rate of economic growth &mdash; which is dependent largely on the US economy &mdash; will be sustained.  In this uncertain international context our national performance in exports has been especially commendable. Last year exports grew by 17 per cent in volume terms, a record figure for Ireland and the highest in the European Community for last year.  This rate of growth has continued during the first half of this year.  However, foreign earnings and investment take place today in an increasingly competitive environment and this means an even greater national effort.  My Department gives priority to supporting this national effort and through their offices abroad fully assists individual businessmen and exporters and the State agencies involved.</P>
    <P>I shall turn now to my third and final topic &mdash; developments in relation to Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations. The most important development over the past year in this regard has of course been the follow-up to the agreement between the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister at Chequers in November last that there should be negotiations between our two Governments. The Taoiseach and the Prime Minister agreed that:</P>
    <P>the identities of both the majority and the minority communities in Northern Ireland should be recognised and respected; and reflected in the structures and processes of Northern Ireland in ways acceptable to both communities; and that the process of government in Northern Ireland should be such as to provide the people of both communities with the confidence that their rights will be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>The negotiations which are continuing are aimed at incorporating these two central principles in new structures in this island.  The acceptance by the British Government of the requirement that these two principles should be at the heart of our negotiations marks a considerable <Col N="626" /> step forward in Anglo-Irish understanding. The <i>London Times</i> in a recent editorial recognised, as we do, that these two principles are of the essence of the analysis of the problem of Northern Ireland as outlined in the report of the New Ireland Forum.</P>
    <P>In our negotiations with the British Government, the position of the Irish Government is based rigorously and undeviatingly on the Forum report.  The structures and processes of Northern Ireland have hitherto failed to recognise, respect or reflect the identity of the nationalist section of the community in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>For my part, and quite apart from the current Anglo-Irish negotiations, I have used every opportunity open to me to protect and foster the interests and the identity of the Northern Nationalists. Whether our negotiations succeed or fail, I shall continue to do this.  What is that nationalist identity?  The Forum itself provided a succinct answer to this question. Among the major realities which it identified in paragraph 1 of Chapter 5 of its report is the definition that:</P>
    <P>The nationalist identity and ethos comprise a sense of national Irish identity and a democratically founded wish to have that identity institutionalised in a sovereign Ireland united by consent.</P>
    <P>Our job now &mdash; and it is a very difficult job for both Governments &mdash; is to accommodate that identity in new structures.</P>
    <P>Of course our primary concern is for the well-being of the Nationalist people of Northern Ireland, whose identity has hitherto been neither recognised nor accommodated, but we are also deeply and genuinely concerned to secure the dignity and the well-being of the Unionist people.  The Forum report also defined their identity:</P>
    <P>The unionist identity and ethos comprise a sense of Britishness, allied to their particular sense of Irishness and a set of values comprising a Protestant ethos which they believe to be under threat from a Catholic ethos, perceived <Col N="627" /> as reflecting different and often opposing values.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government are determined to recognise and respect the sense of Britishness as well as the particular sense of Irishness and the set of values of the Unionist people and to ensure that they also are reflected in new structures and processes in this island.</P>
    <P>As the Taoiseach said recently, we cannot at this moment predict the outcome of these negotiations.  We can say that both Governments are making a serious attempt to find new common ground.  I have no doubt that the British Government realise, as we do, that failure would seriously damage the hopes and the well-being of all of the men, women and children in Ireland and particularly in Northern Ireland.  On our side we seek neither a cosmetic success nor a triumphalist outcome to these talks.  We seek real and lasting progress to peace and stability.</P>
    <P>We in this House speak for Ireland and the Irish Government act on our behalf. Those who murder our brave gardaí, those who plan to plant bombs intended to murder ordinary men, women and children in British holiday resorts are the enemies of the Irish people.  They do not speak for us.  They do not act for us.  We reject them utterly.</P>
    <P>Ours is an Irish nationalist Government. For us, as for all the parties in the New Ireland Forum, a unitary state embracing the whole of Ireland achieved by agreement, and accommodating all Irish traditions, is the preferred solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  The Irish Government subscribe fully to the following commitment which the Fine Gael and Labour members, along with those of Fianna Fáil and the SDLP, gave in the Forum report:</P>
    <P>The Parties in the Forum will continue to work by peaceful means to achieve Irish unity in agreement.</P>
    <P>This is our goal and we are proud of our commitment to it.</P>
    <P>It is a fact that the British Government <Col N="628" /> are not now prepared to establish a unitary state in Ireland.  We must face that fact and its implications.  We have, as I have frequently said, a fundamental choice here.  That choice lies between on the one hand continuing to call for a unitary state solution to the exclusion of any intermediary progress and on the other hand pressing for progress now without abandoning or in any sense concealing or diminishing our commitment to our preferred form of Irish unity.</P>
    <P>The Forum report made that choice for constitutional nationalists in the following solemn commitment which comprises paragraph 10 of Chapter 5.</P>
    <P>The Parties in the Forum also remain open to discuss other views which may contribute to political development.</P>
    <P>I am profoundly convinced that we, the Nationalists of this sovereign State, which incorporates our identity fully, have no moral or political right to say to the Nationalists of Northern Ireland that we will refuse to take part in common efforts to accommodate their identity and their rights in new political structures just because the British Government at this time refuse to establish at one stroke a unitary state in Ireland.  To say this to the Nationalists of the North would be to condemn yet another generation of the nationalists people to exclusion, hopelessness and conflict.  I am sure that no one in Dáil Éireann would wilfully wish such a fate on those long suffering people.</P>
    <P>This Government, if we succeed in the current negotiations with Britain, will seek no political advantage from that success: neither over the Opposition here nor over the Unionist people of Northern Ireland.  That is not what we are about. Let me again make our position crystal clear.  First, the Irish Government are totally committed to Irish unity and we will continue, without fear or favour, to work for its achievement by peaceful means and in agreement.  Second, we are determined to transform the condition of the Northern Nationalists and to do so now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the <Col N="629" /> Minister for Foreign Affairs one must surely query whether we have a coherent foreign policy.  We are spending £21.5 million this year on our diplomatic service, a service which has not only been spared cutbacks but received a substantial increase in resources in 1984 which it managed to hold on to after the Presidency had passed.  Indeed, since 1982 the gross expenditure of the Department of Foreign Affairs has increased by 29 per cent.  This compares with an increase of 19 per cent in the gross Estimate for Health, 25 per cent for the Garda Síochána, 20 per cent for primary education, a 23 per cent increase in Agriculture, and so on.  It is clear from these figures that the Department of Foreign Affairs are in a favoured position under this Government with regard to cutbacks.  It would be instructive if the Minister were to set out more fully the reasons the Department of Foreign Affairs have fared better than other Government services since 1982.  The Presidency in 1985 should, of course, no longer be a factor.</P>
      <P>I am asking the Minister what the strength of the diplomatic establishment is as compared with 1982.  Has the public service recruitment embargo affected the Department less than other Departments? I know there has been a 50 per cent increase in the budget for information services since 1982.  Naturally, I wonder where the extra money is being spent and what is its purpose.</P>
      <P>Our foreign service is staffed by able and dedicated personnel and is an important and valuable instrument if put to the right use.  Indeed, it is a valuable asset to any Government if used properly.  It has an important function in relation to trade, a supportive role in relation to investment and a major role in relation to the negotiations on the operation of EC policies including grants and subsidies from which Ireland may benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was very disturbed, as were many other Members of this House from all parties, at an attack by a member of this Government on our diplomatic service during the course of an address given by the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Deasy, in Germany not so long ago.  The <Col N="630" /> report of the incident, carried in the <i>Irish Independent,</i> said that a Government Minister had taken on the Irish Diplomatic Corps in a war of words over the promotion of Irish produce abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say that our embassies and ambassadors abroad are not doing enough in the commercial field and accused the diplomatic corps of a preoccupation with a solely protocol presence in other countries.</P>
    <P>He called for radical changes in the role of embassies and ambassadors abroad and urged them to get involved in a more commercial role.  He said that the Department of Foreign Affairs could direct their resources to help our trading abroad at a time when State bodies had less funds to promote Irish products. These remarks were made at the Berlin Green Week and it is reported that they were understood to have annoyed our ambassador to Germany, Mr. Campbell, and others of his staff who were present. Deputy Deasy's speech was delivered before numerous German dignatories and Irish representatives involved in the trade fair.</P>
    <P>Of course the Minister for Agriculture may criticise the operations of the diplomatic service.  Of course he may wish that their role be examined and changed, if necessary.  Surely the place where these suggestions should have been aired was not in public in front of the Irish ambassador and representatives from other countries at this trade fair but rather at Government level, if the Minister wanted to take it that far, or with his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  This type of off-the cuff attack on our diplomatic service and personnel was totally uncalled for and a public apology is due to the persons concerned from Deputy Deasy.  In the diplomatic world people could be forgiven for referring to him as someone who shoots from the lip, but that is not good enough since it causes embarrassment.</P>
    <P>I am not saying that the role of our diplomatic representatives should not be examined but certainly I would condemn a public examination.  If we can get a greater return for our nation for the <Col N="631" /> investment in this area, then naturally we will all be pleased.  I would welcome a comment on this matter when the Minister for Foreign Affairs is replying because I believe it was a dreadful political and diplomatic blunder by the Minister for Agriculture.  I am quite satisfied that the foreign service is a very valuable asset to the Government and that it plays an important function in relation to trade and investment.  This I know from my experience not just in Foreign Affairs but in watching the extremely valuable assistance they give to the IDA, CTT, Bord Fáilte and industrialists who might feel it incumbent on them to call to embassies and consulates for advice, particularly in the United States.  One example of which I am reminded is Shannon Airport, which has never looked back since the Aeroflot agreement negotiated under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1980.</P>
    <P>Having regard to the resources devoted to the Department over the past two-and-a-half years, I would have hoped that better results might have come from them.  Naturally one must query the reasons these results have not come.  The view has to be held that the fault clearly lies with the political direction or absence of direction.  This Government do not have a coherent foreign policy or clear foreign policy objectives.  We certainly have no clear policy on Northern Ireland or on our relations with America.  Our policy towards the EC is confused and the clear profile which we had three years ago on disarmament has been dissipated. Our distinctive approach to many of the major problems in the Middle East, Southern Africa and Latin America has not been very much in evidence lately.</P>
    <P>The broad foreign policy position of any Government should be publicly known and capable of being clearly articulated and understood at home and abroad.  Certainly secrecy may legitimately apply to tactics, but not normally to broad objectives.  Policy on the Northern Ireland problem and on relations with Britain has always been a key element of Irish foreign policy.  Yet no one knows <Col N="632" /> what the Government's policy is, what their objectives are, or what they are trying to achieve.  There is no secrecy on the British side as to their broad position. Mr. Hurd, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, and to some extent the Prime Minister, Mrs. Thatcher, have made numerous public statements which set out clearly what they want to achieve, what their priorities and their parameters are.  Today's edition of the <i>Daily Telegraph</i> reports Mr. Hurd as saying only yesterday:</P>
    <P>Ulster's constitution does not involve the Dublin Government.... executive power isn't going to be transferred or shared.  The Prime Minister has made that very clear.</P>
    <P>There is no corresponding clarity on the Irish side.  The public do not know what is going on.  Our friends in America do not understand what the Government are trying to achieve and even the British Government may not be altogether clear on what the Irish Government want.  Why all the secrecy?  Are the Government ashamed of what they are trying to do and frightened of public reaction here? They know that what they are trying to do is not compatible with the Forum report.</P>
    <P>One Government Minister, who shall be nameless, was in the North recently and I am reliably informed that he told a group of people that Irish unity could not be afforded, that what the Government were aiming for was an internal settlement and that they would come up &mdash; he and his colleagues in Government, if they are still there &mdash; to visit the people there from time to time and see how they were getting on.  The same Minister was in America recently and told a group of Irish Americans that we had to get away from the dreams and visions of the past. One of those Americans thought to himself: &ldquo;This is a Minister of a State which itself was once a dream and a vision&rdquo;. &ldquo;Mutual incomprehension&rdquo; was the phrase used to describe the meeting between the Cardinal Archbishop of New York and the Taoiseach recently&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The breakdown in relations between the Irish in America and the Government is a potentially serious development.  Indeed, a point was made that the Taoiseach and some of his Ministers would qualify for honorary membership of the British diplomatic service in terms of the negative message put across in the United States.  No positive vision is offered for Irish Americans to rally round and indeed a valuable source of help is spurned and told that it is not wanted.</P>

      <P>The James Connolly Memorial Hospital has an approved complement of two consultant anaesthetists. One of the consultant anaesthetists resigned on 15 May 1985 but had indicated that he was prepared to provide locum cover until his replacement took up duty. However, it emerged that for personal reasons this consultant was unable to provide locum cover and he terminated his commitment to the hospital completely.</P>
      <P>The second consultant had planned to take annual leave from 15 June to 30 June 1985 and he was not in a position to alter his arrangements.  It was not possible to secure alternative anaesthetic cover until 25 June.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The hospital has now resumed normal services.  The hospital authorities have made the necessary arrangements to fill the vacant post of consultant anaesthetist <Col N="638" /> on a permanent basis as quickly as possible. In the interim the hospital authorities hope to be able to appoint a locum.</P>

      <P>The Minister has kindly explained the circumstances which led to the extraordinary situation where a hospital closed its casualty unit and had to refuse to admit any new patients.  That was a cessation of services in a major hospital in the capital city.  Could the Minister explain if this was due to management problems or to lack of staff generally?  Surely there would be a pool on which the hospital could draw in a crisis?</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There were no accident or emergency services provided in the hospital between 15 and 25 June. During that period the hospital had to withdraw also from the coronary care ambulance call and it was necessary to close the theatres and the intensive care unit.  No at-risk patients were admitted. Between 25 and 30 June theatre work was resumed and the intensive care unit was opened.  The hospital was on call on 24, 25 and 26 June and 28 people were admitted.  The hospital had to withdraw from the rota system on four occasions &mdash; ironically on 19-20 June, 24-25 June, 29-30 June and 30 June-1 July.  I can assure the Deputy there is no restriction on this hospital in terms of consultant anaesthetist posts.  I regard it as highly unsatisfactory that that situation should have been permitted to develop.  I take a rather dim view of what happened.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an application before the Department for a third consultant post but that post has not been cleared at departmental level.  The hospital has two consultants and adequate cover.  It should have been possible in this major hospital which serves a large part of Dublin to <Col N="639" /> have had an anaesthetic cover during that period.  As the Deputy is aware, a furore was caused particularly in the week prior to the local election, and people locally exploited the situation in a disgraceful manner, notably people from the Opposition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>That is an extraordinary statement.  First the Minister implied that there is ample cover and that the hospital could have got an extra anaesthetist in time and, secondly, there is an implication that the hospital was closed for political reasons, to embarrass the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister if he is seriously suggesting, and if he has any evidence, that this hospital was exploiting a political situation prior to the local elections in order to possibly gain extra staff or something of that nature. Is he saying it was unnecessary to close down the hospital for those ten days?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In fairness the Eastern Health Board made a major effort to ensure that alternative cover would be provided but that was not successful.  One of the consultants resigned on 15 May. Admittedly he indicated he was prepared to provide locum cover but then he was unable to provide that cover and he terminated his contract with the hospital. The second consultant decided to go on annual leave from 15 to 30 June and he was not in a position to alter his arrangements and the management of the hospital were not in a position to do anything <Col N="640" /> about obtaining cover.  That is what happened.</P>
      <P>As I say, I am being charitable about this situation but a major hospital, particularly a hospital on the accident and emergency rota in Dublin, should have made every effort to provide these services and I have no option but to accept that it did this.  The board, on which there are a number of prominent Opposition Members, were prepared to exploit this situation.  This had nothing to do with me.  That shows what people will do to get votes.</P>

      <P>If the Minister has finished perhaps he would resume his seat, because I never know when he is finished.  Is it not a fact that politics had nothing to do with this closure?  Is it not a fact that the James Connolly Memorial Hospital had a shortfall of £1.5 million this year?  It is not a fact that about 60 beds have been closed?  It is not a fact that the management have not been able to open an orthopaedic unit in that hospital? It is also not a fact that they should not be providing an emergency service without these beds?  This closure is the result of inadequate funding by the Department.</P>

      <P>The James Connolly Memorial Hospital has adequate funding for 1985.  There was no shortage of money in 1984.  It got an increased allocation for 1985 and was not short £1.5 million.  I am concerned about the fact that locally the role of the hospital was exploited for political purposes during the local elections, I stress not by the management staff but by certain board members and certain local politicians.</P>
      <P>I am the first Minister for Health who is trying to spend a great deal of money improving the outpatient department of that hospital which is very tiny.  I have provided substantial additional moneys, for example, for the pathology end.  I got expensive equipment for that hospital from Technicon to help in the work being done in that hospital.  A great deal has been done deliberately by my Department to upgrade and develop Blanchardstown hospital but unfortunately people were determined to exploit the role of the hospital at local level for political purposes.  I very much regret that there was a lack of anaesthetic cover in that hospital but it had nothing to do with my Department or with the budget. I very much regret this coincided with the local elections, but, as I said, I am charitable in my reaction to that happening.</P>

      <P>The cost of drugs refund scheme provides that all expenditure, in excess of £28, on drugs prescribed for use in a calendar month is refunded by health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am satisfied that an unrecouped expenditure of £7 per week for drugs does not generally constitute hardship for persons whose income is such that, despite their medical expenses, they do not qualify for a medical card.  I am also aware that health boards give very sympathetic consideration to all applications for a medical card in cases where any hardship may be experienced due, perhaps, to a particularly high and persistent level of expenditure on doctors' fees and on prescribed drugs.  I would suggest that any person who is experiencing difficulty <Col N="643" /> in this regard, despite the availability of the cost of drugs refund scheme, should apply to their health board for a medical card.</P>

      <P>I agree.  The number of claims generally has declined and it should be possible to have a more effective system of administration in operation.

Of course there will be need for residential facilities of various kinds.  I have, however, serious reservations about proceeding with very large residential centres and have directed a fundamental review of certain projects now before my Department, including Loughlinstown.</P>

I am quite convinced that, even in the Dublin area, with little expenditure <Col N="646" /> of money but taking more account of climate and role, which is far better than the large institutional structure, that type of service could be brought on-stream rapidly.

      <P>I am aware that some hospitals have closed or intend to close hospital wards, especially during the summer months.  Some of these closures are being made as an economy measure, but it has been a traditional practice to close wards in the summer months when patient demand tends to be at a lower level than at other times of the year and consultants and other hospital staff are on annual leave.  Consequently, such closures are justified on the grounds of efficiency and economy and they are also necessary to enable hospital authorities to carry out essential repairs and maintenance at minimum inconvenience to patients.</P>
      <P>These closures may mean that some patients will have to wait a little longer for elective admission to hospital, but I can assure the Deputy that in all cases adequate arrangements are made for the treatment of emergency cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot share the Minister's delight with the results of our period of the Presidency in that the real results have not measured up to expectation. It is with regret that the saga of the super-levy was a diplomatic fiasco beginning with the Taoiseach's total misreading of the situation in Stuttgart and ending with the Minister for Agriculture's inexcusable and unbelievable muddle over figures.  Those involved in the dairy industry are reeling from the effects of the super-levy and many of them face ruin having regard to the limits on milk <Col N="678" /> production imposed on them and the heavy investment which they made in an effort to achieve full development of their operations.</P>
      <P>Our Presidency ended with a resolution of the wine lake problem which did not advance one single Irish interest.  The Dooge report contained a number of veiled threats to Irish interests but few positive features.  Ireland did not put forward any proposals for the intergovernmental conference.  In this morning's <i>Financial Times</i> there is an article which underlines the thinking put forward in our contribution to the debate on the Dooge report last week.  The article states:</P>
      <P>If Europe has reached a dead end after the failure of the Milan summit, it is only because the Common Market took a wrong turning more than 10 years ago....  The Community chose to concentrate on extending the Common Market in geographical magnitude, and, cautiously, in the coverage of macro-economic policies which were being harmonised.  In the process it neglected efforts to unify around the most essential function of a modern sovereign state-macro-economic policy....</P>
      <P>The key difference between America and Europe is that expansionary macro-economic policies applied to a huge continental economy with a single currency, do not produce balance of payments problems nearly as quickly as they would in small independent countries....  It is because of Europe's macro-economic fragmentation that sensible reflationary policies to deal with unemployment appear impossibly risky for any individual government....</P>
      <P>People resent the Eurocrats because they intrude in everyday life; yet when it comes to great political challenges like unemployment, inflation or arms control, Brussels seems impotent and irrelevant.  A Euro-initiative on unemployment or nuclear disarmament would probably command much more public support than a programme to harmonise insurance regulations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="679" /> I agree with that.  One of the biggest failures of the Dooge report is the failure to get that message across.  There is obvious resistance to that message in many quarters.  Internationally we have opted for a low profile.  No initiatives have been taken in Ireland in relation to disarmament and the Taoiseach turned down an opportunity to be associated with an initiative by six non-aligned and neutral countries at the summit of 1984, even though he was invited to join Olaf Palme, the late Mrs. Gandhi and others. We hear very little of the Government's attitude to events in Latin America.  Perhaps he would clarify whether we still recognise at the UN as the legitimate Government of Kampuchea the appalling Pol Pot regime who were responsible for genocide.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that there is a great disillusionment in this country with regard to our membership of the EC particularly when we know that no initiative has been taken that has been of any benefit in dealing with the most prominent problem affecting nearly a quarter of a million of our people.  We have had summits and reports at various times on matters that are far removed from the everyday problems of the people.  In time, political union may be achieved but that will not be until such time as there is a proper economic base within the Community.  When we joined the EC our unemployment figure was between 65,000 and 68,000 but now there are more than 230,000 people unemployed.  The Minister must know and the Taoiseach should know that there is an unbelievable level of cynicism towards the Community as a result of the failure of the leaders of the member states and their foreign Ministers to tackle this problem seriously.</P>
    <P>It is important for us as a small nation that the Community succeed.  Conversely, it is vital for the success of the Community that the people give it their support.  About 12 months ago I expressed my disappointment at the low poll in the European elections held around that time.  Before those elections, in an effort <Col N="680" /> to increase interest in them, to help people participate in them and to help them understand what was involved, I urged that the local elections be held at the same time but the Government decided otherwise because they feared the wrath of the electorate in the local authority elections.  One lesson I learned in Government is that there is no good day for making tough decisions and that a situation is never eased by postponing the day of the difficult decision.  Is it not very obvious now to the members of the Government parties that the decision they took 12 or 14 months ago regarding the local authority elections was not a good decision even from the point of view of themselves.  The results of the recent elections could not have been more unfavourable to the Government.</P>
    <P>Regrettably there is a growing cynicism and scepticism towards Europe.  Recently I have met people who are well versed in what is happening in Europe, well versed enough to query why the energies of the Government and the Taoiseach should be directed towards political union rather than towards economic recovery.</P>
    <P>I was somewhat upset and concerned this week to hear the Taoiseach, in the course of his statement on the Milan European Council, talk about the people's Europe, about how important it was that we should have a people's Europe, that the essence of the problem was being attended to by the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on a People's Europe.  The Taoiseach went to a lot of trouble to tell us that the report of that committee and I quote:</P>
    <P>contains concrete recommendations on the right to vote in elections to the European Parliament, on strengthening the right of petition to the European Parliament, and on a possible role for a European ombudsman; on co-operation in television production; on setting up a European Academy of Science, Technology and Art and</P>
    <P>lo and behold:</P>
    <P>on the feasibility of a Euro-lottery to finance cultural projects;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="681" /> The Euro-lottery is taking off.  We had a promise of another lottery in a certain document produced by the Government no so long ago.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach continued:</P>
    <P>on voluntary work camps, exchanges between schools and universities and the organisation of Community sporting events, Community teams and combating violence at sporting events; on the organisations of volunteers for development work in the Third World; on provision of a Community emergency health card, easier access to medical treatment when travelling in the Community, greater Community co-operation in combating drug abuse; on twinning of towns and cities; and on the adoption of a Community flag and anthem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach told us that these recommendations were approved and member states were requested to implement them within their respective competences. He said the Foreign Ministers had been asked to report on progress at their next meeting in December.</P>
    <P>Those are all laudable objectives.  I say to the Minister, and through him to the Taoiseach, that the army of unemployed in this country would see their priority as the possibility of employment.  Of course we all subscribe to the adoption of a Community or European flag and anthem but surely the attention of the member states of the Community should be directed to the economic stagnation obtaining within the Community in an effort to deal with this horrific problem of 230,000 or 240,000 people out of work. I cannot put a figure on the number of young people who have emigrated. Whereas none of them might disagree on a Euro-lottery, the financing of cultural projects, voluntary work camps and the like, they would prefer to have the wherewithal to buy a decent meal for themselves rather than take the emigrant ship or join the dole queues.  I say that because it appears to me we are still motivated by the concept of political union irrespective of the cost or consequences of the economic stagnation obtaining.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> I should like to see the Foreign Ministers being asked to report to their Prime Ministers at the next summit on how best member states can help each other to get their economies going in an effort to do something in that area.  We may fool ourselves on the importance of the matters I have just mentioned &mdash; the Community anthem, the twinning of towns and cities and the Euro-lottery &mdash; but surely the Minister would accept that the real problems facing people &mdash; and people are the Community &mdash; is that they want food to eat, somewhere to sleep and to be gainfully employed.  I appeal to the Minister to do something about that in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>I might move briefly on to something that was said &mdash; and I would not want the Minister to think I was misreading or was not listening intently to what he said &mdash; but I am not sure if he mentioned the famine situation&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of his statement the other day the Taoiseach noted that two-thirds of the 1.2 million tonnes of cereals, or their equivalent, which were committed at the last meeting of Heads of State in Dublin in December last, had already reached their recipients or were en route to Africa.  I may be at a disadvantage now in that I will not be able to comment on what the Minister of State will have to say but I want to repeat that a fresh approach to the whole question of famine in Africa is urgently required.  We were all staggered to see on television, via satellite, the tragic and dreadful circumstances obtaining in these famine countries on the African Continent. As Irish people we can say that we reacted as best we could in the circumstances to help our fellow human beings who were starving to death and dying of disease.  But that sort of reaction is not good enough, it is not getting to the root of the problem.  Much more has to be done in an endeavour to deal with the root cause of the problem, to ensure that, <Col N="683" /> in a world where food surpluses are an embarrassment in many countries, where good wholesome food is often destroyed in an effort to maintain its price levels, we, as human beings &mdash; who can send people to the moon &mdash; cannot do something about the famine and drought problems that exist within a couple of hours flight from where we stand this afternoon. Those with special expertise in this area must be given greater support by the leaders within the Community.  They must be given greater finances to get worthwhile projects under way.  We can feel rightly proud of our voluntary organisations, their efforts, and hope that they will be helped to an even greater degree than in the past.  I shall listen with great care to what the Minister of State will have to say in this regard.</P>
      <P>This debate provides us with an excellent opportunity to comment on the success or lack of success of Community policies.  One policy I want to raise and comment on is the regional policy. Unfortunately the European Regional Policy has failed to live up to our expectations. Far from reducing the gap between the Community's rich and poor regions and nations it has failed to prevent an increase in regional disparities.  I am alarmed at this trend.  I fear that, if it continues unchecked, Community cohesion could be jeopardised.  I have always argued and held the view that regional policy must be one of the pillars of Community policy.  It is the only Community instrument which specifically sets out to reduce unemployment through job creation. Tragically its resources remain totally inadequate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regional policy accounted for only 4.8 per cent and 5.2 per cent of the overall EC budget in 1982 and 1983 respectively. I am convinced that these sums are derisory. I propose that a significant increase be made in the Community own resources to permit essential additional expenditure on regional policy.  Some recent developments in the regional policy have given rise to some concern, such as the implementation of the new regulations which came into force on 1 January of this <Col N="684" /> year.  While I welcome the basic thrust of the new regulations I regret that the Council were unable to address themselves to the fundamental problem, namely lack of resources.  I welcome the intention to concentrate some aid on the Community's weakest region and to provide more assistance for small and medium sized businesses.  I would like to think that disadvantaged countries such as Ireland and Greece will be able to take up their full quota entitlement.</P>
    <P>I also welcome the move towards programme financing and the greater involvement of local and regional authorities in their decision making process.  I would have preferred this to have been taken a step further, having advocated that payments should be made directly to regional authorities in preference to the national exchequers.  We are one of the Community members who have payments made to the national Exchequer. This is a mistake not only by the Commission but by the national Government. The commissioner has acknowledged that local authorities are better equipped and are more knowledgeable about areas and regions, to prepare a proposal for the Commission, and that they should be permitted to make it directly to the Commission.  In the same way payments should be made directly to these local bodies where they would be far more beneficial not only to the local communities concerned but to the EC and its image abroad among the member countries.  When they are made through the national Exchequer it is very difficult to identify the benefits that have flowed from a grant from this Regional Fund. To do it in the way in which I suggest, the Commission should press member states not already doing it in this way to start direct payments and then it will be easy to identify where the money from the Regional Fund is going.  People in the Community areas concerned will at least be able to acknowledge that definite benefits are coming to those areas from the Community.  This is very important when one considers the low poll in member countries in the last European election.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="685" /> We are all familiar with the haggling that went on with regard to increasing the 1 per cent VAT and we know the difficulties that were encountered by member states who were opposed to increasing the 1 per cent VAT and how attitudes were taken up not having regard to the future of the Community and to the welfare of the Community but for purely nationalist reasons in an effort to score &ldquo;successes&rdquo; or &ldquo;victory&rdquo; for the member state concerned.  Now we have the increase coming up shortly but very few if any Members in this House would accept that the new level of 1.4 per cent will be sufficient to finance the new Community having regard to the additional membership of the Community of Spain and Portugal bringing approximately 60 million people extra into the Community. There can be no doubt but that as it was we were struggling from one financial crisis to another and some of us are genuinely worried that the type of schemes which would benefit our country and others like us will not be financed as they should be.  Certainly if they are not financed it will defeat one of the main ideas held by the founding fathers of the Community, the idea of convergence. Much more effort should be put into it now that we are enlarged to ensure that enough money will be there to finance the fund.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach in his statement referred to the fact that the total of the Community budget is only 2 per cent of public expenditure in the member states. Indeed rather more than that is lost each year through frontier delays and far more than that is lost through our failure to exploit the advantages of a unified market of nearly 300 million people for the new high technology industries.  A great effort has to be made by the leaders, the heads of Government at their summit meetings to deal with the problems.  I am talking about the frontier delays.  Reference has been made to it but much more can be done and should be done to insist that we have no waste of resources.</P>
    <P>The Minister stressed rather strongly in the introductory part of his speech the fact that this Government are committed <Col N="686" /> to the rule of law.  I and my party are equally committed to the rule of law and will support whatever actions are necessary to ensure that those who flout international law either by hijacking or terrorism are dealt with.  None of us condones the type of atrocity we witnessed in recent days.  I am thinking of the Indian Boeing that was blown out of the sky off the south west coast of Ireland a few days ago.  Nor would we condone the terrorism for whatever reason that almost caused a similar type explosion which could have killed everybody on board the plane that landed in Tokyo Airport.  If the civilised countries of the world can agree on a worthwhile programme to defeat those who will try to use hostage taking or hijacking to further their aims, we will be doing a worthwhile service for the community generally.  I say to the Minister that we will support the Government in any initiatives they take in dealing with the growing tendency to terrorism for the purpose of achieving aims or ideals held by small groups of people who are representatives of nobody other than themselves. Any help we can give with regard to this we will give.</P>
    <P>Let me talk briefly about the United Nations.  We have always helped and supported the UN as a body since we became members of it approximately 30 years ago, and it needs more support now than ever if it is to continue as an organisation. I know that I do not have to push the open door because the Minister is as interested in preserving the strength of the UN as I would be and I say to him that we should do more to help in that regard.  It is a pity that some of the greater world powers who are members of the UN cannot see their way to understanding the problems within the members of the UN or to dealing with these problems perhaps more patiently than they are being dealt with and helping the UN as a body to get over its difficulties with regard to its role, where it is going and its finances.</P>
    <P>I was taken aback somewhat a couple of years ago when in discussion with some officials of the State Department of the US in Washington I experienced a type <Col N="687" /> of hostility to the UN, a type of irritation with the UN in that perhaps attitudes and approaches of the greater nations were being questioned by the smaller states. We in Ireland can understand that readily.  As I understand, it, part of our role in the UN over the last 30 years has been, is and I hope will always be to stand up at any time and question any nation on their policies and attitudes and approaches to problems.  Because we are not party to any bloc of world power we are there as a small independent nation, and that is the most effective way we can try to help as regards world peace.  I only hope that the larger nations can help.  I cannot recall straight off what sort of moneys the USSR still owe the UN but I gather that the figure is colossal, and if you are going to starve the UN by denying it moneys that are rightfully there as a result of commitments freely entered into by member countries, that is one way of weakening the organisation and its role and rendering it somewhat ineffective, certainly more ineffective than we would like to see it.  I understand that the total debt by the USSR to the UN is in the region of £28 million.  I cannot say for certain but it is very great in comparison with the budget and it causes a financial problem within the UN.  We have always been very proud of our membership of this great international forum and that we have played a very noble role on all occasions with regard to problems that this organisation has had to deal with. One of the highlights of our participation in the UN in recent years was the role played by Ambassador Doran who was our permanent representative on the UN while he was also a member of the Security Council during a very difficult time.</P>
    <P>The UN is very much involved in many of the troubled spots throughout the world trying to do a most difficult job to bring peace to warring factions and communities, warring for different reasons many of them difficult for us in this part of the world to understand. Many of us have great difficulty in keeping up with the situation because of changes that occur almost hourly, never <Col N="688" /> mind daily, weekly or monthly.  As the Minister said, people here are very much aware of the situation in the Middle East, having regard to the fact that we have a large contingent of Irish men and some women serving with the UN forces in the South Lebanon area.  Of course, we are supportive of them and we must and should be so.  We approve thoroughly of their presence there and we support them in what they are trying to do, which is to keep peace between peoples who are not able to agree with one another or to live side by side in peace, and I say that with very great regret.</P>
    <P>I tell the Minister that the people of Ireland are very conscious of the difficult role that our troops out there have to play together with personnel from other troop contributing countries.  The people here are very concerned about and very pleased with the role being played out there by General Callaghan in the difficult task he has to perform.  Here in this part of the world we must be careful about how we form opinions because we have the media on one side playing up the side they are interested in and playing down the other side, while on the other side we have the same process reversed. We must be calm and cautions in our assessment of the situation there in the hope that our presence there will continue to help in a bad situation and that peace can be restored there sooner rather than later.  It is difficult for us, living on a small island as we do, to image the position that exists out in the Middle East.  Somebody described Lebanon to me geographically as a State not much, if any, bigger than the counties of Cork and Kerry put together with a small population. Yet news comes from there of atrocities of one sort or another which make world headlines on television and in the newspapers on practically a daily basis.  I say to the Minister that the party that I represent here will do everything we can to support and help him in this area, having regard to the terrible tragedy taking place there.</P>
    <P>The Lebanese problem cannot be taken on its own.  As the Minister said correctly, the ongoing war between Iran <Col N="689" /> and Iraq is now going into its fifth year and again people are being slaughtered in hundreds of thousands and we are told that young boys of 14 and 15 years of age are being pushed to the front lines and are nothing other than cannon fodder. Unfortunately, the great powers have been unable to help with regard to bringing about peace.  All initiatives to date have failed.  I was saddened recently to hear some self-styled expert say on a radio programme that perhaps it was a good thing that the war is continued.  I could not participate in the radio discussion but I tried to question myself about his motivation for saying that.  Anybody who can, for any reason, try to justify having a war of such proportions, having regard to the brutal cost of that war, shows a new form of lunacy about which we should all be extremely careful.</P>
    <P>I was glad to hear the Minister talk about the situation in Afghanistan.  It was sad news when we were enjoying the festivities of Christmas four or five years ago to learn that Russia had invaded Afghanistan and the mighty bear had trampled on its smaller neighbour for its own reasons.  It is a tragedy that continues today and there is an obligation on us in the free world to highlight this tragedy at every opportunity.  We should not allow it to become the forgotten invasion.  We should speak out about it and condemn it, nothing the consequences of the invasion on the population of Afghanistan, the destruction and chaos that exists there and the destabilisation of neighbouring countries as a result of the flood of refugees.  We should always remember to stand up for these people on the far side of the world.  When those who in this House or elsewhere try to tell us about other systems of government and the idealistic philosophies and dogmas they try to hide behind, we should tell them to ask their fellow travellers what they are doing in Afghanistan and urge them to get out.</P>
    <P>In recent times there has been a greater number of outrages in South Africa than ever before.  Hundreds of people have been killed as a result of political violence there.  We have seen on our television <Col N="690" /> screens police committing atrocities which we did not think could ever be committed and which certainly could not be condoned.  The way in which protesters were gunned down by the police last March was rightly condemned by Ireland and the partners in Europe.  I urge the Minister to do his utmost to convince our partners in Europe to take greater steps against the regime in South Africa and put greater pressure on them to bring about a reasonable position there. Having regard to the fact that we are supposed to have a trade embargo with such countries, what member states of the Community are still engaged in large-scale trade with South Africa?  We are trying to force that Government to adopt a more reasonable and balanced approach to the problems in that country, which are spilling over into neighbouring countries as well.  The Minister should inquire from his colleagues in Europe about the position in relation to trade and ensure that we make a greater effort to help those who are not in a position to help themselves.</P>
    <P>Whereas we welcome the Spanish and Portugese into the Community, the Minister must accept that there is genuine concern, particularly within the fishing community, since our fisheries are likely to be severely affected &mdash; indecently assaulted &mdash; by the Spanish fishing fleet, even though the Minister has said that the Spanish and Portuguese will be excluded for ten years from the 50-mile zone around our coast and that from 1996 only 93 Spanish vessels will be allowed to fish in that area.  This is what the Minister envisages will happen but it would be unwise to believe that up to the present we have been able to keep the Spaniards from fishing illegally in our waters.  They are doing so almost continuously.  Snámh in aghaidh ar easa dúinn é b'fhéidir iad a choimead amach nuair a bheidh cead acu teacht isteach.  It will be exceptionally difficult for us to police our waters after 1996 and up to that date.  I hope the Minister will be able to convince his colleagues in Government that a far greater investment will be necessary in the fishery protection service if we are to have any <Col N="691" /> hope of realistically policing our fishing grounds.</P>
    <P>Central America is an area which causes all of us very great concern.  The atmosphere there has been reported to us by an all-party committee of this House which went to observe elections there and came back with such stories that it is difficult to understand.  When one studies the attitude of the Congress of the United States to White House and State Department policy, the scenario becomes even more confusing.  We are further confused by the report of the Catholic bishops of the USA.  The European Community, Governments and foreign ministers are keeping in touch with the situation there and I hope progress can be made.  During his time as President of the Council of Foreign Ministers the Minister played a leading role in trying to improve the situation there.  I should like to hear a little more on the position as he sees it in that part of the world, although I appreciate that the Minister may not have an opportunity to deal with it in his reply.  I have here a document which I have prepared in conjunction with people advising me which runs to about 25 pages.  We are aware of the history and extent of the problem and the efforts made to try to deal with it.  We support the Minister in his efforts on behalf of the Government, in conjunction with the member states, to bring peace to this part of the world.</P>
    <P>I would urge the Minister to oversee the development of a Community policy on forestry.  After oil, forestry products represent the single biggest import category of the EC accounting for over 11,000 million ECUs per annum.  There is no Community policy on forestry, which is surprising.  I know that the IDA were involved in reporting on the development of the Irish timber industry for the eighties.  They produced a worthwhile report which said that forestry, unlike agriculture, was not covered by the Treaty of Rome and that, therefore, it is difficult for the Commission to implement a full forestry policy.  They said that there would be difficulties obtaining <Col N="692" /> agreement and means of support for forest development, in obtaining a consensus on an industrial development strategy for the industry and that there would be problems in altering the situation where concessions on timber imports are used as a bargaining position in trade negotiations with timber exporting countries.  The report concluded that because of these factors it was considered unlikely that any timber industry development strategy would be agreed and implemented in the immediate future.</P>
    <P>It would be very much to our benefit if we could devote our energies to the creation of a forestry Community policy and it would certainly be of great value and would have very sound economic benefits.  I urge the Minister to do his best to make sure that this is not put on the long finger because, unfortunately, all Governments have, to some degree, neglected the development of forestry.</P>
    <P>Perhaps I have gone on long enough although this is an area where one could talk for a very long time because there is so much to be dealt with.  The international problems are great.  Communities are tearing the heart and soul out of each other in different parts of the world but I never allow that to depress me because during the first half of this century we had two world wars with European countries strangling each other at the drop of a hat practically on a continuous basis; many millions of lives were lost and yet, since the creation of the European Community about 30 years ago, we now have peace in Europe.  I am sure that nobody here would take a wager that that peace will not continue through what is left of this century and well into the next.  This was part of the aim of those great people in Europe who came together from a war torn Europe which had destroyed itself and brought many parts of the world into destruction because they were sucked into those wars.  I am not without hope because the peace which we now take so much for granted, despite the horrific problems which exist in Northern Ireland, the only part of the European Community in which there is trouble, would not have <Col N="693" /> been dreamed of in the middle or late forties.  It was achieved as a result of the vision which great people, small in number, had.</P>
    <P>Their economic dream still has not been achieved, their ideals have not been realised and we are a long way off from convergence and from balancing the standards which exist in different member states of the Community.  We should not allow member states who have recently joined Europe &mdash; some who joined as recently as ourselves &mdash; to change the rules and regulations of the Community to suit their own needs.  I urge that we remain true to the ideals of the Treaty of Rome because I am satisfied that it is in our interests that that should be so and that nothing is watered down.  If we allow that to happen we will not be protected as was envisaged at the time the people decided by an overwhelming majority to become members of the Economic Community.</P>
    <P>There is a very great responsibility on the Minister, his colleagues and us to try to ensure that there is a better understanding of Europe among the people. He should make a greater effort to let them know what is involved and we must list and explain to the younger generation in particular, why the Community was formed.  We should look at our civics classes to see if we could make a greater effort in bringing home the idealism, the concepts and the vision which were held by the founders of the Community.  I know that Europe is not the answer to all our problems.  I have said publicly on occasion that Europe owes us nothing. We must work hard for whatever we achieve within the Community and it is to our advantage to be good Europeans.</P>
    <P>It is vital for us that the Community succeeds and it will only do so if there is a greater realisation and understanding of the basic problems within the Community. We should make it an economic Community and, if we deal with the economic problems and ills which affect the members of the Community states, we can then advance to other levels.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am <Col N="694" /> pleased to have the opportunity of intervening today in the debate on the Votes for Foreign Affairs and International Co-operation.</P>
      <P>The proposal included in the Vote for International Co-operation is to provide just under £23 million &mdash; to be exact £22.957 million &mdash; in respect of certain parts of Ireland's Official Development Assistance (ODA) to the Third World, and in respect of Ireland's contribution to certain international organisations.  I should perhaps emphasise at the outset that the Official Development Assistance (ODA) provided for in this Vote is only part of the overall ODA provision for 1985, which amounts in total to £38.357 million; the balance of this expenditure is provided for in other Votes and in allocations from the Centural Fund.  The funding proposed represents a 20 per cent increase over last year's level for the same items.  I am confident it is a proposal which will commend itself to the House.</P>
      <P>By far the greater part of the funding involves allocations of assistance to developing countries, and my remarks today will relate mainly to these allocations, for which I have particular responsibility as Minister of State.  In addition, provision is made for the contribution of Ireland's share of the running costs of certain international organisations.</P>
      <P>It will thus be seen that the proposed allocations involve Ireland's participation in the cost of maintaining essential parts of the infrastructure for the conduct of international relations.  It is obviously most important that Ireland should be prepared to play its part in facilitating in this way the conduct of international relations on a satisfactory basis.  Indeed, as a small country which is strongly influenced by the international environment, we have a definite interest in doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The combination, within the same Vote, of provision for these contributions to international organisations, together with provision for assistance to developing countries, may be thought to be interesting because it helps to emphasise the <Col N="695" /> integration of development policy with foreign policy generally.  To a significant degree &mdash; and arguably to an increasing degree &mdash; our participation in international contacts relative to the position of developing countries helps to define our role as a nation in international affairs generally.  The predicament of the developing countries is one of the most pressing and challenging questions facing the international community and one which raises principles which are central to our view of our own role in the world.  It is also increasingly being realised that there is some truth in the cliché that &ldquo;everything is connected to everything else&rdquo; and that the persistence of desperate circumstances in the Third World is sure to lead to a deterioration of the international environment which will injure all countries, including industrialised countries, and certainly not excluding Ireland.  For these reasons, it is important that we should have a well-devised and fully integrated foreign policy and that development policy should be a key aspect of that overall approach.</P>
    <P>Appropriate financial provision for development assistance is an important part of our approach not only because of the direct, practical value of the measures financed but also because, as the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries has usefully pointed out in its report for 1984, &ldquo;the degree of moral authority a country can bring to international discussion and negotiations relative to the interests of developing countries is influenced by the level of Official Development Assistance that country provides&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the House will be aware that the provision for Official Development Assistance (ODA) to developing countries in 1985 reflects the Government's commitment, set out in the national economic plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, to continue to expand Ireland's assistance to the disadvantaged countries of the Third World, and to do so on a planned basis.  In accordance with the provisions of the plan, the allocation for Irish ODA is £38.357 million in 1985, as <Col N="696" /> compared with estimated expenditure of £31.865 million in 1984; it will grow further to about £44 million next year, and to about £50 million in 1987.  Expressed as a percentage of GNP, ODA is set to increase from 0.23 per cent in 1984, to 0.245 per cent in 1985, 0.260 per cent in 1986 and 0.275 in 1987.  It should be noted that this represents an increase of 25 per cent in the proportion of national income allocated to ODA over the period concerned. The provision for the current year should thus be seen as part of a structured programme of expansion which facilitates the orderly development of Ireland's assistance to developing countries.</P>
    <P>The effect of these allocations is that Irish ODA will continue during the period of the plan to grow at the same rate as that achieved during the period 1974 to 1984, although public spending is being curtailed.  In fact, the rate of growth planned for ODA is three and a half times faster than that planned for public spending generally.  The fact that ODA received such relatively favourable treatment in the course of the fundamental reappraisal of the economy and public finances which underpinned the plan is an indication of the Government's acute awareness of the problems of developing countries and of its readiness to do what it can to contribute to a solution to those problems.  Moreover, it is also provided in the plan that the Government will give consideration in the light of changing economic and financial circumstances to implementing the even higher rate of growth of ODA previously envisaged.</P>
    <P>In comparison to aid provided by the governments of other developed countries, the Irish ODA has grown steadily in recent years.  In 1983, which is the most recent year for which full statistics are available, the level of Irish aid, expressed as a proportion of GNP, was equivalent to 61 per cent of the level of the main donor countries, whereas in 1974 it had been only 15 per cent.  In other words, relative to other donors, Irish aid has grown fourfold during the period; and this trend seems likely to continue as a result of the provisions of <i>Building on <Col N="697" /> Reality.</i>  The pattern revealed by this figure is that Irish Governments have continued throughout the recession to increase ODA steadily although the performance of donors generally has lagged.</P>
    <P>The Government fully accept, of course, that it is always necessary to endeavour to do more, in view of the severely straitened circumstances of the developing countries.  For this reason it will continue to keep under review, in the light of changing economic and financial circumstances, the possibility of implementing the faster rate of growth previously envisaged, with the ultimate aim of reaching the United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GNP as ODA.</P>
    <P>The Vote for International Co-operation provides in its subheads B to H, inclusive, for part of the moneys required to discharge our ODA commitments this year.  The balance of the moneys required for this purpose is provided for in the Votes for various Government Departments and in expenditure from the Central Fund.  The particular aid activities which it is proposed to fund from the Vote before the House today are the following:</P>
    <P>Subhead B provides for voluntary contributions of £2.110 million to the United Nations development agencies this year as compared with contributions of £1.815 million last year.  The House will be interested to know that, in addition to the traditional contributions to the United Nations Development Programme, the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, and to various funds for refugees and for the victims of apartheid, there is provision this year for the first time, for a contribution of £20,000 to the United Nations Voluntary Fund for Women in Development.</P>
    <P>Subhead C provides £2.100 million for the Agency for Personal Service Overseas, to further its programme of facilitating service in developing countries by persons from Ireland.  This compares with a grant of £1.800 million last year.</P>
    <P>Subhead D provides £629,000 for the relief of disasters in developing countries, as compared with a provision of £300,000 last year.  In the case of this subhead the <Col N="698" /> provision is merely indicative, as actual expenditure depends on developments during the course of the year which are, of their nature, impossible to foresee with precision.  In fact, last year the amount initially provided for this purpose was augmented during the year in response to the urgent need for assistance to ameliorate the effects of the famine in Africa, to the extent that the eventual level of expenditure was more than three times the amount initially provided.  It is probable that this year also the amount allocated for this purpose will be augmented during the course of the year.  One type of assistance funded from this provision is support for refugees, who are a group of people particularly badly affected by the famine in Africa &mdash; Sudan, which I visited is particularly badly hit.  Recently we announced a grant of £100,000 towards the relief programmes operated in that country by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.</P>
    <P>The question of the admission, reception and resettlement of refugees in Ireland, coming here by virtue of Government decisions taken in response to crises such as that of the &ldquo;Boat People&rdquo; a few years ago, is also a subject to which I have been giving attention in recent weeks.  Following a series of consultations with other interested bodies, both governmental and non-governmental, I hope to be in a position to bring forward recommendations for action in the near future.</P>
    <P>Subhead E provides £12 million for the bilateral aid programme administered by the Department of Foreign Affairs, a significant increase over last year's level of £9.437 million.  This programme supports efforts aimed at the long-term development of developing countries, with a view to helping to address the underlying causes of under-development and famine.</P>
    <P>Subhead F provides for a grant of £75,000 to cover the administrative expenses of GORTA, the Freedom from Hunger Council.  The equivalent grant last year was £66,000.</P>
    <P>Subhead G provides £3.4 million &mdash; the same amount as last year &mdash; in respect of <Col N="699" /> the Irish contribution to the European Development Fund, EDF, which is the main financial instrument of the Lomé Convention, and to the International Fund for Agricultural Development, IFAD.</P>
    <P>Subhead H provides £100,000, as compared with £90,000 last year, in respect of the operating expenses of the Advisory Council on Development Co-operation, ACDC.</P>
    <P>In total, the allocation for the activities funded from these subheads is proposed to be £20,414 million this year, representing an increase of about 20 per cent over last year's level.  This proposed allocation reflects the continuing commitment of the Government to the particular activities concerned and, more generally, to the principle of helping the developing countries in their efforts to overcome the problems facing them.  It is also worth noting that these activities benefit, in particular, from the stable planning framework provided by the provisions of <i>Building on Reality</i>, as the persons and organisations involved in implementing them now have, for the first time ever, a guaranteed level of funding for a number of years into the future.  This is an even more important consideration in the case of these particular activities, which for the most part are implemented directly and fully funded by Ireland, than in the case of the other parts of our ODA programme, which for the most part involve contributions to international programmes in the case of which the Irish share is only a part of overall funding.  It is this stability, as much as the significant real increases involved, which provides the basis for the planned further development of our assistance to developing countries in the coming years.</P>
    <P>The House can be assured that the Government will continue to do everything they can to assist that development, with a view to ensuring that our policies and programmes in this area are as effective as possible.  The Government are also pleased to note an increasing role for Members of the Oireachtas in this regard <Col N="700" /> including, in particular, the work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries, under the able chairmanship of Deputy Nora Owen, whose report for 1984 and whose recent fact-finding visit to African countries supported under the Bilateral Aid Programme, have made a valuable contribution to the development of our approach in these matters.</P>
    <P>I should like to avail of this opportunity of assuring the House that I will continue to do everything in my power to facilitate the strongest possible role for the Oireachtas in the formulation of public policy in this important area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with two areas referred to in the Minister's speech.  I sat through some of Deputy Collins' speech and it was sad to hear him putting forward views without specifying areas or individuals and rehashing gossip on a serious issue like Northern Ireland. He spoke about people saying things they heard about other people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not gossip.  It was reported by people who were in the company of the Minister when it was said.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>No names were mentioned and no areas were specified but&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the people specifically asked that they be not named, but they were present when the remarks were made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will have an opportunity to put this on the record some other time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If the names could not be mentioned, the Deputy should not have said anything.  I, too, have been in the United States and friends told me they heard Fianna Fáil spokesmen talking on the Irish problem and they could not differentiate between them and some of the Provo spokesmen.  I do not think we should get into that area now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I met a delegation representing victims <Col N="701" /> of the supergrass trials earlier this year. I want to put on the record my appreciation of what the Minister has done in that area.  He has done a great deal to reduce that problem considerably, but unfortunately the principle of being innocent until proved guilty has been abandoned in the North and we must do our utmost to have eliminated that unjust system where people can be detained and convicted on the word of a criminal.</P>
    <P>We must continue our efforts to reduce the alienation of the minority community in Northern Ireland and expose areas and incidents of discrimination.  Platitudes by senior British politicians about bringing the communities together fall flat when specific incidents of discrimination are allowed to continue without any political check.  Such a check could be very useful.</P>
    <P>Recently I spent some time in Nicaragua with three of my colleagues &mdash; Deputy Hyland, Senator Ross and Senator Higgins &mdash; and I was in El Salvador with Senator Hyland for the elections last Easter.  We hope to publish a report next Tuesday on the elections in El Salvador. Therefore I will not refer to that area in detail because it would pre-empt the publication of that report and it would be unfair to Deputy Hyland who is not here today.  Having visited Nicaragua last November I have tried to follow what is happening in Central America, specifically Nicaragua, and tried to follow the United States policy in that area.  I fully support any measures which would propose a negotiated solution in these countries. I am sure I speak for some of my colleagues who have been in that area when I say I am very concerned about some of the policies of the Sandinista Government.  I believe United States policy relies too heavily on the military and will make a solution more difficult to achieve.  For this reason I hope our Government and our Minister for Foreign Affairs will continue to oppose the covert funding of the Contra forces in Nicaragua which the United States Congress and Senate supported in recent times.</P>
    <P>The Minister said the basic approach of the EC countries to the problems of <Col N="702" /> Central America is that they want to create conditions in which the conflicts can be resolved peacefully and that the many economic and social problems in that area can be tackled on the basis of co-operation and international solidarity. I welcome this approach.</P>
    <P>I am glad the Minister said there will be a follow up to the ministerial conference, the Costa Rican Conference, and that this meeting will be held before the end of this year.  He said he expects a co-operation agreement will be signed at that conference.  That is welcome and very important news.</P>
    <P>The Contadora forces have experienced many difficulties, but I agree with the Minister's belief that the approach embodied in the Contadora process continues to offer the best hope of reaching a solution to the problems of the region. I hope the Central American and Contadora countries will make renewed efforts to arrive at a comprehensive and just agreement as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>However, a key to any agreement is that the United States must be willing to participate in regional efforts to find a solution and should be prepared to listen to the suggestions of her friends in Europe.  I am including Ireland as one of those friends because, like Deputy Collins who said he detected hostility at times when approaches were made to United States officials, I too detected a certain hostility when I spoke to certain officials of the United States administration.</P>
    <P>The impression I got was that Europe was a very long way from Central America, that that area is in the sphere of influences of the United States and that we have no role to play in what is happening there.  Nothing is further from the truth.  We have a big role to play there. Like many of the Central American countries, Ireland was the subject of colonial domination for many centuries and many of the Central American countries now find themselves in the position we were in in the twenties and thirties when we faced external and very strong economic pressures.  These threatened the very existence of this nation.  There is a link between this country and countries <Col N="703" /> such as Nicaragua and we must have sympathy with the position in which the people of that country find themselves while, at the same time, identifying and appreciating many of the sinister forces operating in such countries.</P>
    <P>The major fault of any attempt at a military solution in this region is that it fails to address the social and economic conditions which have caused so much hardship and instability there down the centuries.  US economic assistance in commercial policies must play a major role in alleviating these social problems. Otherwise, they will continue to fester and create conditions which are easily exploited by other agencies, countries and systems alien to the western hemisphere and to our society here.</P>
    <P>Having spoken to many people about the problems in Central America and shared a platform with a number of US officials at a recent seminar in Washington, I believe that the United States do not understand or appreciate the deep concern felt in Western Europe about US policy there.  They do not realise how this unwise policy might affect their relationship with their friends in Western Europe.  Their policy, which in part contradicts international law, will in time seriously harm the international image of the United States.</P>
    <P>Recent developments in the United States, such as the funding of the Contra forces and the economic embargo which has been set up by them against Nicaragua, are undermining public confidence in United States leadership in the western world.  This is doing and will continue to do great damage to the security of the western world in time to come.</P>
    <P>Shortly after returning in 1984 from Nicaragua, I spoke in this House on a number of points and shall not repeat them today.  However, I should like to refer to some which I did not mention but which are still very relevant today. One matter overlooked in the Nicaraguan elections in 1984 was that 32 per cent of votes cast went to the opposition parties, which clearly indicates that Nicaragua is not a totalitarian State, although <Col N="704" /> the confidence and courage of those elected and those in opposition will determine whether democracy becomes a reality or whether the country ends up in the control of a single party regime.</P>
    <P>In this connection, the national dialogue which was opened before the election between the various political, social and religious movements and parties there and the positive developments resulting from the initiatives of the Contadora group to which I referred earlier, formed the essential basis for a solution acceptable both to internal public opinion and opinion in the outside world, thereby avoiding military escalation and any sharpening East-West confrontation over Central America.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the attitude of the present United States Government, especially with regard to support for the Contras, does not leave the parties involved within Nicaragua sufficient margin for manoeuvre.  More forthright recognition of the rights of the people there to self-determination will deprive the extremist elements in the Sandinista leadership &mdash; and there are very extreme elements there &mdash; of the alibi they are now using of the threat of aggression and intervention.  Removal of this threat could, and I believe would, give the more moderate elements in the Sandinista Government a chance to open constructive dialogue with the opposition parties.</P>
    <P>Recent information coming from Nicaragua is that the continued threat of military aggression or intervention and economic embargo is weakening the position of the moderate elements within the administration there.  All the political parties, even those which did not take part in the election of 1984, agree that it is essential to preserve as many as possible of the achievements of the revolution, to take them and progress with them further.  This applies not only to agrarian reform but to the campaigns for literacy and health care and the fight against extreme poverty.  In fact, national reconciliation and the end of the Contra campaign, which is funded by the United States, would make it possible to redirect military expenditure, which currently <Col N="705" /> devours up to 50 per cent of the country's budget, towards the objectives I have just mentioned.</P>
    <P>Economic pressure, uncertainty and the obstacles to inter-regional co-operation might disappear and this could happen in a very short time because of the determination of the people there &mdash; a determination which always exists after a revolution &mdash; to make life better within that country.  If this objective is to be attained, it is absolutely essential for a wide cross-section of political opinion to tolerate it.  Indeed, the same applies to the maintenance of the mixed economy which guarantees private property and also to the policy of non-alignment. These three objectives form the basis for a national pact which was signed by all the political parties shortly after the revolution. Today it still represents the essential basis for the success of the national dialogue which is taking place and is under threat because of the isolation of moderate opinion within Nicaragua, due to the unfortunate ham-fisted approach of the US administration.</P>
    <P>The European reaction to the US trade embargo, even though at times muted, reflects the serious and growing divergence in informed opinion between the United States and Western Europe on the appropriate policy towards Central America.  In fact, the United States believe that we should not interfere at all, as I said earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred earlier to the Costa Rican meeting.  By including Nicaragua in the proposed aid package for Central America, the European Foreign Ministers' meeting in San José, with the Minister, Deputy Barry, as President, acknowledged that the crisis in Central America cannot be reduced to a mere question of political confrontation between the super powers, that social and economic factors are very important keys to explaining the upheaval which is happening in the area.</P>
    <P>The United States trade embargo which was announced since that meeting, in my opinion and that of most people, violates a number of international charters and the embargo can only aggravate <Col N="706" /> the regional conflict and further distance the day when we will get peace in the region.  The embargo is likely to have a similar effect on Nicaragua as the embargo on Cuba had over 20 years ago. It will make Nicaragua more dependent on the Soviet Union.  That dependence will be most undesirable but it is being forced on that country.  At the very least, we are giving the extremist elements in the Government the excuse to become more dependent on the Soviet Union.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately United States policy is designed to promote a self-fulfilling prophecy. It is achieving what it set out to prevent.  Not only does it threaten the capacity of the Government in Nicaragua to implement their economic and social policies but it weakens the private sector in that country.  It has also been condemned by the conservative Opposition in Nicaragua.  It is appropriate to note the views of Colombia, Venezuela and Mexico.  They have made it clear that the embargo is incompatible with furthering the Contadora process.</P>
    <P>The very serious consequences of the embargo can be reduced only if western countries increase their aid to Nicaragua. It is good to see that in May of this year in Caracas the Latin American countries not only condemned the embargo but, even more effectively, decided to set up a package of economic measures to help Nicaragua to counteract the embargo.  If western European countries are in favour of a non-aligned Nicaragua they should not only oppose the embargo but be more realistic and effective by adopting a policy consistent with the San José declaration and follow the Latin American lead.</P>
    <P>Not only do I advocate the doubling of EC aid for the Central American region but I advocate that within this package there should at least be a doubling of aid to Nicaragua.  I support present EC plans to contribute to regional agreements which further political dialogue, assist development and increase economic integration.</P>
    <P>Due to the embargo Nicaragua will have need for preferential access to European markets for their exports such as <Col N="707" /> coffee, cotton, bananas, beef, fish and sugar.  More importantly, they will need financial facilities to enable them to import machinery, spare parts, chemicals, insecticides, oils, pharmaceutical supplies and hospital supplies.  I spent 11 days in the country and I visited hospitals in the rural areas.  I could see the urgent need for that kind of aid.  Quite honestly, if we do not supply that aid, where will Nicaragua go?  They will go to eastern Europe and to Russia &mdash; in fact, they are doing that.  Unless we make some early decisions about supplying the essential items I have outlined we will force countries like Nicaragua into the eastern bloc.</P>
    <P>It is also a fact that Nicaragua has not received any development aid from the World Bank since 1982 and it was the only Latin American country not to receive IDB money in 1984.  Yet, their record in implementing and completing aid projects is one of the best in Latin America and that has not been contradicted by anyone.  Apart from Nicaragua, all countries in Central America, and in particular El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Costa Rica, have received huge amounts of aid from the United States both in military and economic assistance. For the current year the relevant department in the United States is requesting for El Salvador the sum of £483.4 million; for Honduras £246.15 million; for Costa Rica £190.75 million; for Guatemala £87.5 million and zero for Nicaragua.</P>
    <P>The relatively small European contribution by comparison will only begin to compensate for the imbalance in the United States figures.  Therefore, I ask our Foreign Minister to ensure that the circumstances surrounding the Nicaraguan case be considered at European level.  Having spoken to the Minister, I know he has a sincere and deep interest in what is happening in that country.</P>
    <P>The Vice-President of Nicaragua was in this country earlier this year.  Since his visit the Contra campaign has been stepped up.  We see weekly reports of killings, of the destruction of property and the planned wrecking of the economy, which is fragile at the best of times. <Col N="708" /> When he was here he made a very modest request.  He asked us to advocate to the United States the resumption of bilateral talks and he asked, as a symbol of our good faith, that we would consider sympathetically opening up at junior level some diplomatic connection with Nicaragua. I ask the Minister to consider that matter also.</P>
    <P>Even though we have limited resources we are rich in experience so far as agricultural technology is concerned.  Our people have the know-how and the education to undertake small projects that would bring about immediate and direct benefit to the population in Nicaragua. I was told by the Deputy Minister for Agriculture that there are more than 2,000 small co-operatives operating in the country in private ownership.  The majority of these people received land and are waiting for adequate finance and expertise to enable them to start operations. They need finance and technical expertise if they are to survive.  I saw in a rural part of Nicaragua a project in which Trócaire have an interest.  If the project got the benefit of more technical aid from Ireland it would be of major benefit to the region.</P>
    <P>We could invest our technical expertise to help with the production of milk and meat.  There is malnutrition in Nicaragua and there is evidence of children being under-nourished.  With a small investment of technical expertise we could bring about an improvement in milk and meat production.  We could adapt our methods to those of the peasants but we could also teach them about cattle raising, the production of cheese, yoghurt, poultry, eggs and chickens.  Nicaragua is a fertile country that just needs to be irrigated and developed.  With some of our technical people working with the small groups in the country we could strengthen economically the intermediate groups between the individual and the State.  In my opinion, this leads to the formation of authentic democracy.  Since we are known for our expertise in this matter we have a role to play.</P>
    <P>I will sum up the points I made.  First, we should set up diplomatic contacts with Nicaragua as soon as possible, even at a <Col N="709" /> low level.  I know we are giving continued political backing to the Contadora group. We have a duty to call for the disarming and the disbanding of the Contras who have wrecked the economy and have killed the population in Nicaragua.  We should look for a substantial aid programme for all Central America from the EC which should be conditional on human rights being maintained and protected in those countries.  We should insist that international financial institutions such as the World Bank deal fairly with all the countries in that region.  We should use our influence and special relationship with the United States to further the peaceful resolution of the problems in that region.  We should press the EC and European countries individually to use their financial and commercial resources to encourage stable relations with Central America.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not spoken for too long but having spent taxpayers' money going to Central America I felt I should put my views before the House.  If the problems in the region are not tackled in a realistic way it will become an area of major confrontation in years to come.  We have many missionaries there.  I was honoured to meet a group of Franciscans in a remote part of El Salvador on election day.  We were deep in guerrilla country and I was proud to meet people from Limerick, Dublin and Cork.  We have development workers out there and there is an obligation on us to protect not only the rights of the Irish people who are there but the investments they have made in time and money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>A large poster sponsored by Trócaire was erected on Harold's Cross Bridge which stated that constituents should write to their local TD about the problems in the Third World. I received the total sum of one letter while at the same time I received 70 or 80 letters about some controversial legislation in which the bishops had more than a passing interest.  That sums up the interest there is in what is happening outside of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a lack of interest in foreign <Col N="710" /> affairs both in the House and outside and it is probably due to the fact that we are an island and have our own internal difficulties.  With the exception of the Minister and the former Minister we feel we do not have a role to play.  We have an important role to play.  We are probably one of the 15 or 20 liberal democracies which remain in the world.  We should be very proud of that.  We have a major contribution to make in a non-aligned way.  If we want liberal democracies to continue and develop in other parts of the world we must be seen to be interested in the problems they face, particularly in the Third World and in Central America.</P>
    <P>I have two proposals to make.  I should like to see a UN information office opened in Dublin.  That would cost the State £40,000.  It would help to promote an interest in foreign affairs and in the difficulties people face abroad.  It would be another source of information apart from the helpful information which is available from the Department.  It would reflect well on the Government and on the House if we included a provision of £40,000 to open such an information office.  The child with the extended stomach and the bulging eyes in the sub-Saharan continent is every bit as much our responsibility as if he or she lived next door.  We cannot turn our backs on that.  The public have been ahead of the State in regard to the amount of money they have contributed per head of population relative to GNP.  It is heartening to see that reaction from the public.  However, in a formal way we should develop our interest, and persuade our colleagues in the EC to do the same, in what is happening in the sub-Saharan continent.</P>
    <P>I propose that the Minister or Deputy Collins introduce a foreign affairs committee. The Overseas Development Committee is a start but it is very limited in the area it can examine.  It would be in the interest of the House and the State if we had this committee.  From ripples come waves and from waves come change.  We have a small but significant contribution to make.  If Deputies were members of such a committee they would <Col N="711" /> take a greater interest in the nuclear holocaust which could descend on all of us, in East-West relations and in what is happening in the sub-Saharan continent and in Central America.  I ask the Minister to bear those two suggestions in mind.</P>
    <P>When we go out of office we will be remembered for the innovations we introduced.  People will ask what we did when we were in Government.  They will look at our record.  There are significant contributions we could make and two of those would be to open a UN information office and to set up a foreign affairs committee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is somewhat disappointing that the debate attracted only five speakers but in view of what is happening throughout the country this evening it is understandable because that other job, too, is a very important part of the democratic process and of the work of public representatives.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mitchell has said, a debate on foreign affairs is extremely important. In the early part of my speech I indicated that foreign affairs is not some kind of ivory tower subject that is the concern only of the Opposition spokesman and myself but that it has a real relevance to ordinary people.  I will take up the suggestions offered by Deputy Mitchell and will endeavour to act on them.</P>
      <P>The affairs of other countries, be they big or small countries but especially the bigger ones, infringe on the lives of the people of this country.  That is a factor we should not lose sight of.  We have a role to play in international affairs and we have the fora in which to play that role.  We wish to preserve liberal democracy, the tradition that has become more and more part of what the building of this State was about.  We wish to export that tradition, to promote it in other fora.  Our role is small.  We are an island off the mainland of Europe but we have an independent voice and we are listened to.  We must continue to use that voice at the UN, in the EC and at any other bodies of which we are a member.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="712" /> Deputy Mitchell, too, expressed the view that there is a lack of interest in foreign affairs but I do not think that is correct.  When I came to this House first, questions to the Department of Foreign Affairs usually numbered two or three and the subject of foreign affairs was debated only at the time of the Estimates. This Department now attract many questions from Deputies on both sides and all of these questions are extremely intelligent and searching.  I am glad to receive those questions and to be able to respond to them at Question Time.</P>
    <P>The new format for Question Time will suit my Department very well because the questions put to me usually relate to matters that are topical and urgent.  In the past number of years a period of three or four months would be likely to elapse between the times the Minister appeared in the House to answer questions.  That was not suitable to those kinds of questions because the questions are usually designed to probe the Government's attitude to various current events around the world.</P>
    <P>A period of five and a half hours during which time five speakers have contributed, is not a true reflection of the interest in foreign affairs.  If it were not for the election taking place today of chairmen to local authorities more Deputies would have contributed.  One thinks immediately of Deputy Owen and some independent Deputies who have a great interest in foreign affairs, also Deputy Hyland who would probably reflect the views expressed by Deputy Allen in relation to Central America and Nicaragua. Both these Deputies have become experts in this field and there are many other areas, too, in respect of which Members of the House have become expert.  We should have the opportunity of hearing the views of those Members more regularly.  A limited debate once yearly on the Estimate is not sufficient. Last year I promised that we would have a full day's debate on the Estimate.  I kept my promise but time could not be found to allow for a debate of similar duration on this occasion.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="713" /> My speech was divided into three sections and I shall endeavour to respond on that basis.  The three sections were international affairs, the EC and Northern Ireland.  First I should like to dwell on a couple of points made at the outset by Deputy Collins.  He referred to a remark made by the Minister for Agriculture in Berlin at the opening of Green Week.  Deputy Collins must have forgotten that he had already tabled a question to me on that matter.  My reply to his question is to be found at column 1254 of the Official Report for 12 June, 1985.  I replied adequately but not apologetically so far as the Minister for Agriculture is concerned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy made the point also about some remarks passed by a Minister in Belfast and in New York.  I understand Deputy Allen has responded to that so I shall not bother with it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins said I had not spelled out the Government's position on world affairs, on Northern Ireland or on European affairs, but these are the subjects my speech was about.  We have been fortunate in that there have been a number of debates in the Dáil in the past 12 months on European affairs and of course the reports of the EC are debated here every six months so that we have the opportunity of contributing regularly on that section of foreign affairs.</P>
    <P>In addition, there are the summits following which there are statements in the House as happened on Tuesday after the Taoiseach's return from Milan.  Apart from his statement, there were replies from the Leader of the main Opposition party and from the Leader of The Workers' Party.  If Deputy Collins would read my speech again he would find that I set out precisely and clearly the position of the Government in respect of the three areas he mentioned.</P>
    <P>The Deputy referred also to the increase in the Vote for Foreign Affairs between 1982 and 1985.  As he says rightly, that increase has been of the order of 29 per cent.  Votes in respect of other Departments have increased by more than 20 per cent but there is an element for my Department which is not <Col N="714" /> present in other Votes and that is that a considerable portion of the Vote for Foreign Afairs is not in IR£s and therefore the translation into foreign currencies, particularly the dollar which evaluated by 30 per cent in that period, means that the cost to the Department is much greater than is the case in other Departments.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins is right when he says that the aid section of the Department has been the subject of significant increases.  That is something we are proud of but our pride is tempered by the fact that the increase is totally inadequate to meet the needs of the world.  However, in the national plan we have undertaken in precise terms to increase this aid and to repeat that increase in 1986 and 1987. Consequently, at the end of the period of the plan, our contribution under this heading will be significantly higher than the level it was at when we came to office.</P>
    <P>Regarding the effect of the embargo, the Department of Foreign Affairs have lost 43 posts.  There is a limit to what one can do because when a post becomes vacant in a three man mission abroad and is not refilled it becomes impossible to run the office.  Such vacancies must be filled if such offices are to be kept open. This limits the degree of the effect of the embargo but nevertheless we have lost 43 posts out of a total of 800.  That does not represent the figure of 8 per cent the Minister for the Public Service quoted this morning as being the average but it is slightly more than 5 per cent.  Therefore, the record of my Department is good in that respect and our co-operation in the operation of the embargo is good also.</P>
    <P>The EC occupied a large proportion of Deputy Collin's contribution and rightly so because the Community is very much part of our foreign policy.  Our decision to join the Community was one of the most significant since we achieved our independence.  Our membership has changed the country totally.  I would not wish to see that decision being either diluted or reversed.  As Deputy Collins said, there is a reward for being good <Col N="715" /> Europeans.  I believe strongly in that view.  We should not at any time seek to be clever and to vote with people whose interests may coincide temporarily with our own.  We should take the longer view and think of what we can do to build up the Community so that it becomes the vibrant force it was intended to be.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Collins that the history of the past two years in relation to the Community will not be written in gold letters.  There has been a significant faltering in the advancement of the Community. This was brought about in the first instance by the effects of the two oil crises and by the resultant unemployment and recession which those factors induced throughout Europe.  It is very depressing, worrying and challenging because it demands a response from the Community with which I am very dissatisfied, with 14 million people unemployed in the EC and another three million to be added when Spain joins the Community on 1 January next, and some more from Portugal.</P>
    <P>The policies necessary to reverse that situation of growing unemployment have been put forward very forcibly by Ireland at the last three Summits, and at every Council meeting we attend &mdash; whether it is a Foreign Affairs Council, Internal Market Council, an ECO/FIN Council &mdash; our constant theme is that to talk about anything at present bar relaunching this Community so that the 14 million people, soon to be 17 million, who are unemployed will find jobs, while not a waste of time, is not ordering one's priorities correctly.  I was in Milan last Friday and Saturday with the Taoiseach.  He must have made that point half a dozen times during that two day summit.  We were talking about political co-operation, which is important, because it constitutes another pillar towards the unification of the EC.  But it is not what European people feel at present is the number one priority and we must react to that.</P>
    <P>The fact that the Commission have been instructed to bring forward as early as possible, certainly for the next summit, an analysis of what has gone wrong &mdash;<Col N="716" /> why these people are unemployed &mdash; plus proposals for relieving this level of unemployment and for getting people back to work within the Community is a move in the right direction.  People may say it is too little too late.  We can judge the &ldquo;too little&rdquo;.  I for one, think and the Taoiseach shares this view strongly, as do some of our partners, including I am glad to say the present Presidency, Luxembourg &mdash; that we must concentrate on getting our people back to work as well as doing all the other things that are necessary like the improvement of decision-making, political co-operation and the enlargement process which is now completed. We must bring about a convergence of economies which is written into Article 2 of the Treaties.  We cannot say we accept Articles 500 to 600; we want those implemented. We want all the Articles, including the one which talks about bringing about convergence of economies, implemented. We believe very strongly in that.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins was critical also of the agreement reached on fisheries and allowing Spanish trawlers to fish here after ten years.  This argument has been advanced fairly frequently in this House, in EC debates.  The argument seems to contend that ten years is not sufficient because, after that, the Spaniards will rampage through our waters, scooping the fish out of the sea.  This was illustrated by the Deputy in question who said: &ldquo;Look at what they are doing now; they are rampaging through our waters and scooping the fish out of our seas.&rdquo; It does not really matter what agreement is reached if one believes they will do it anyway.  I do not believe that.  I believe that the Spaniards will respect the agreement. It is a bit too much to hope that there would be 100 per cent respect. Unfortunately our own boats do not respect the common fisheries policy 100 per cent, nor can we expect 100 per cent respect on the part of Spanish fishermen.</P>
    <P>I believe that the Spaniards will obey the rules of the common fisheries policy and the terms negotiated for their entry under the Fisheries Chapter.  I believe we will be able to police our waters, ascertaining whether the common fisheries <Col N="717" /> policy is being respected after ten years. As I said in my initial remarks, we are talking about 93 boats only after the ten years.  There is a total ten-year ban from 1 January 1986 to 31 December 1995 on Spanish or Portuguese fishing boats in the Irish Box 50 mile zone.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins also spoke about a better understanding among young people about Europe.  I agree with that. The Heads of State and Government at the Council of Europe meeting in Fontai-nebleau also agreed with that because that was one of the reasons that the <i>ad hoc</i> committee on a people's Europe was established.  Many of the suggestions made by that committee were intended to help to make Europe more real to people within the Community.  I hope it will work; I believe it will.</P>
    <P>As regards the regional policy I accept fully what Deputy G. Collins said.  The regional policy has not grown at all at the rate it should.  It is one of the most important policies as far as we are concerned. But there has been an adjustment of the figures which affords us the possibility of getting more from the Regional Fund in the future than the controlled amount we received to date.  This is a move in the right direction.  But we must push for an increased, realistic regional policy.  We must also push very strongly for an increase in own resources.  The level of 1.4 per cent VAT from 1986 onwards to cater for existing policies, enlargement and new policies which are so necessary in so many fields is an inadequate amount.  We must keep on pushing to get this figure increased.  Indeed we proposed last year, when this was being discussed, that a more realistic figure from everybody's point of view would be 2 per cent, again a point made by Deputy Collins.</P>
    <P>I take Deputy Collins' point about forestry. Certainly I shall think about proposing a common forestry policy.  There is much work we can do at home without any common forestry policy.  I certainly take his point and shall see what can be done in that regard.  Deputy Collins also said no initiative had been taken to deal with unemployment.  I think I have dealt <Col N="718" /> with that and I referred to it also in the course of my remarks earlier today.</P>
    <P>Deputy G. Collins also asked about Kampuchea and whether we recognised the Pol Pot regime there.  Of course we do not.  Neither do we recognise their Vietnamese-backed invasion of Kampuchea, and we have not recognised them at the United Nations.  He also said &mdash; as I said myself in the course of my remarks &mdash; that some of the larger countries were not giving the full support he would wish to the United Nations.  That is correct, regrettably.  The United Nations have been a force for good in the world for 40 years.  I would hope that their fortieth year will bring home to many people who are not giving the support that I and Deputy Collins would wish the necessity for having a United Nations organisation in the world where problems can be solved that have the potential to lead to far greater disasters.  The United Nations have performed that role very well.</P>
    <P>I am sorry to say that Deputy Collins is totally wrong about the amount of arrears owed by the USSR.  It is nearly ten times what the Deputy said; it was £200 million at the end of last year.  I do not think any further comment is needed in that respect.</P>
    <P>Deputy Collins also said that the Taoiseach had turned down an invitation to participate in an initiative of six States concerning disarmament.  The Government were not approached to join that initiative although we endorse the goals of that initiative&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I will conclude on Northern Ireland. Let us be quite clear about this.  I want to repeat what I said.  Deputy Collins said <Col N="719" /> the Government's intentions and policies on Northern Ireland were unclear.  I recounted what we were trying to do and what we hoped to achieve in the North of Ireland, that this Government are a nationalist Government who believe in a unitary State which is not available at the wave of a hand at this moment.  I will just quote the last paragraph of my opening speech again:</P>
    <P>This Government, if we succeed in the current negotiations with Britain, will seek no political advantage from that success; neither over the Opposition here nor over the unionist people of Northern Ireland.  That is not what we are about.  Let me again make our position crystal clear.  First, the Irish Government are totally committed to Irish unity and we will continue, without fear or favour, to work for its achievement by peaceful means and in agreement.  Second, we are determined to transform the condition of the Northern nationalists and to do so now.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="720" /> That Dáil Éireann takes note of the Report of the Committee on Public Expenditure: Review of Department of the Public Service.</P>
    <P>As this is the second time today that we have had an opportunity to explore the issues relative to the Department of the Public Service I do not intend to cover ground that we have already covered.  I offer the House this report as the fruit of many months work by the committee of which I have the honour to be chairman.  It contains 34 specific recommendations which I trust the Minister or his representative will consider and take note of and, I hope, implement in due course.  Our approach to the work dealt with the need to ensure that the public service and the Civil Service would work in pursuit of clear objectives and targets, departmentally, sectorally and for each individual within that service. Secondly, we hoped for appropriate management systems to be put in place so as to be able to assess whether or not the public were getting value for money.</P>
    <P>The difference between this morning's debate and this mini-debate is precisely that our concern this evening relates to questions relating to value for money. At present there are some 30,000 nonindustrial civil servants with a total pay bill of £330 million.  In addition, the DPS have functions in relation to the entire public sector numbering 300,000 people with a total pay bill of something of the order of £2,464 million, a gigantic sum. The questions my committee addressed were whether or not those figures were justified, whether or not the State got value for money and whether or not the Department of the Public Service, as the motivator and the central dynamic in pursuit of better value for money, were doing the best job possible.  In our lengthy and often turgid but at all times interesting discussions with officials from the Department of the Public Service, many of us felt that it was very difficult for any of our guests at those hearings to state absolutely that the State was getting the best value for money, quite often because <Col N="721" /> systems were not in place in order to be able to give such answers.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that in the last two to three years, perhaps because of the appointment of a Minister with exclusive responsibility for the public service, there is a new emphasis and focus on getting the public service into a situation where they act as the dynamic which they can and must become.  I understand that the Minister will not be here this evening but I gather he will be represented by one of his Cabinet colleagues.  Our recommendations are designed to assist in achieving that dynamic and we specifically homed in on a number of areas to which I will refer.  As far as we were concerned the essential thing was to embark on an examination of a Department where it is very difficult to evaluate precisely how much progress is being made or what effect they are having on other Departments. When the Department of the Public Service was created 13 years ago out of a limb of the Department of Finance they were designed to become a dynamic in bringing on stream the full potential of the public service.  Many feel that that has not happened.  Obviously the Government felt the same when they appointed a Minister with exclusive responsibility in that area.  Since then significant progress has been made.</P>
    <P>Our report points to precise and specific areas where further progress can be achieved.  We should remember that we in this House represent the public who are not at all convinced that the public service are what their name suggests, a service for the public.  It can often happen that instead of being a public service the public are often shunned and avoided by some of the Government Departments with which they have to deal.  We spend in the order of £2,500 million annually on the pay bill of the public service for 300,000 people employed there.  When one looks at any assessment of any individual agency or State organisation it is evident that we could get a percentage improvement.  My colleagues on the committee agree.</P>
    <P>Any of the inquiries or investigations carried out by us over the last couple of <Col N="722" /> years would indicate that there is substantial room for improvement not just in systems that should be in place for getting value for money but in the area of setting down clear targets and pursuing those targets and getting rid of superfluous programmes and superfluous personnel.  I am saying &ldquo;getting rid of&rdquo; where appropriate, rather than deployment.  As the Department of the Public Service are the Government agency charged with responsibility, to a greater or lesser extent, for those areas the committee are convinced that the performance and effectiveness of the Department is the key to success or otherwise of the management and performance in other areas of the public service.  When members of the public are reflecting on this report I would ask them to consider, in conjunction with it, the detailed minutes of evidence which have been published and which gave a verbatim account of our discussions with the Department of the Public Service which were subsequent to a very comprehensive set of questions which were forwarded to the DPS and answered by them, and which were dealt with in detail over those meetings.</P>
    <P>These meetings were followed up by consultants acting on our behalf who explored every possible aspect of those replies.  The committee's recommendations all of which are set out in the report are important but I will just refer to a number of them.  Essentially, some of the key recommendations include the following: my committee are convinced that significant productivity improvements can be achieved in the public service. That is demonstrably evident from the work we have done.  My committee feel that the Minister for the Public Service should give priority to projects which have high prospective benefits, and studies and assessments should be carried out of any programme or project with which the DPS are involved to ensure that those which have high prospective benefits and clear tangible results in terms of effectiveness and efficiency should get priority.</P>
    <P>The level of investment in training for senior personnel throughout the Civil Service should be increased substantially <Col N="723" /> and we accept that that means more money, but we see that as a short term investment for a medium to long term yield.  Any investment in training will pay major dividends and if we are engaged in the business of trying to bring to full potential a whole public sector with the kind of logistical implications I have referred to, an increased investment in training will pay dividends.</P>
    <P>The capability of the advisory units of the Department of the Public Service should be improved.  There should be a review of the overall organisation of the DPS management services unit, the operations research unit, the personnel assigned to the structural reform programme and the advisory services of the Central Data Processing Service.  In a report the Public Service Advisory Council, a body set up to assist and advise the Minister in that respect, refer to the need to have a careful assessment of such reorganisations and realignments within the DPS, and they point out that sometimes reorganisation and realignment of those systems can simply present an impression of activity without any improvement in efficiency or effectiveness. Their exact words in their 1984 report are that the rearrangement of functions has the cosmetic effect of giving the impression that something is being done but does not necessarily result in more efficient and effective administration. Therefore, a serious review of overall organisation is what my committee are talking about.</P>
    <P>We suggested a detailed external review of the operations section of the DPS.  Further, the DPS should be obliged urgently to establish the real cost of all programmes for which they are responsible including such elements as premises and pension costs.  It is lamentable and remarkable and not all that forgivable that it is not possible for the DPS on their own admission at this time &mdash; the Department who are concerned and charged with responsibility for ensuring value for money in other areas of the public service &mdash; to establish to their satisfaction or the satisfaction of my committee, and presumably to the <Col N="724" /> satisfaction of this House and the people who are paying the bill for all of it, the real cost of programmes which they have in place at present, including the cost of premises, pensions and all other related costs.  I will not dwell on it except to say that that is a fair indicator of the state of events.</P>
    <P>We suggest that charges should be made in all cases for services provided by the DPS and that Government Departments should pay out of their own budgets for all that they utilise or consume in the course of their work, even if this means that the budget of Departments be adjusted upwards in order to cope with a corresponding decrease in the DPS budget or the budget of the OPW or whatever appropriate Department may be involved.  We recommend further that Government Departments should seek competitive quotations for such services from external organisations.  In short, the old days of a Department ringing up a central sister Department and saying, &ldquo;We should like 20,000 more square feet of office space furnished in this way and designed this way, the following telephone installation and the following staff resources&rdquo;, and they getting that in due course are over.  That is a nonsense because no cost consciousness element is built into it.  A Department should be given a budget and allowed to spend it, within reasonable safeguards, in whatever way they wish; and if they wish to acquire or consume further items of expenditure let them do so but pay for it themselves.</P>
    <P>There is nothing more salutary and chastening for people engaged in expenditure then being obliged to spend their own money, although even in this case that is to some extent a misnomer.  How can we expect Government Departments to be cost-conscious, to be effective in this area, to be concerned about public expenditure, when not one of them could understand the price of any of the consumables which they devour daily in the course of their work?  That change alone, in my view and that of my committee, of all the recommendations, would if implemented, effect a very substantial saving <Col N="725" /> of public money without any deterioration or drawback in the quality of public service.  We are convinced that if the Minister listens to that suggestion, puts it in place and says, &ldquo;from tomorrow or next year onwards you have your budget, you can spend it as you wish and if you want further items of expenditure, so be it, but out of your budget it comes&rdquo; that would be enormously helpful and advantageous.</P>
    <P>We draw attention in some detail to the effect which the currently unfunded pension liability will have on public expenditure.  It should be quantified and appropriate action should be identified, and we suggest that the Minister undertake an immediate study of the full liability in which the State is engaging and contracting for day after day every time it employs a public servant.  We are suggesting, obliquely enough in view of the circumstances which are known to many of us, that there is massive under-funding and that unless in due course proper arrangements are put in place for ensuring that there are adequate funds to meet public service pensions, then in a short number of years there will be a major problem relating to the possible inability of the State to pay for pensions which it has obliged itself to pay.  There are various estimates about the amount of funds necessary to be put aside for that purpose, but the present fund is inadequate. I am aware of semi-State organisations who are walking the tightrope in this respect and who have not made adequate provision and if tomorrow they were to be faced with collapse or being liquidated or wound up they would face major problems.  There would simply not be enough money to pay for legal obligations which the State had entered into. To put it charitably, we have had a whiff of that already in the Irish Shipping case. We draw serious attention to that problem.  We do not want it ignored that we will come back to it in due course if it is ignored.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service should reduce dramatically, substantially and immediately the number of grades in the public service which we gather to be <Col N="726" /> of the order of 1,000 &mdash; an incredible, multi-tiered, multi-faceted complex of bureaucracy within which bureaucratic, stangulated maze I do not know how people can work or operate or expect to be rewarded for effort.  It would not happen in any other country.  There are companies which have a bigger GNP than this whole country has and they would not tolerate that state of affairs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not rewarded for effort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not rewarded for effort, but even the environment which 1,000 grades implies obviously is conducive to nothing but the opposite, and that is a problem.  I know that it is not easy to effect these changes.  I suppose there would have to be protracted discussions with trade unions and so on, but we believe that with the way this country is proceeding dramatic action may be necessary and certainly that the number of grades should be reduced substantially.</P>
      <P>The DPS should tighten up procedures to identify surplus staff which we believe exists, so as to facilitate what we call in our report, being as constructive, helpful and charitable as we can, their early redeployment. I have remarked today that it is somewhat remarkable that if we include the local authorities in the public sector, we were able to abolish the domestic rate and car tax and not one person lost his or her job, indicating a degree of benevolence by the State which I am not sure the country can afford any longer.  In essence we are saying that the procedures for identifying surplus staff should be tightened up so that we can at least redeploy them if there is an opportunity for them to be redeployed usefully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We suggest that a study be undertaken to establish whether cost savings or improvement in effectiveness might result in a reallocation of some of the functions at present performed by the DPS and a number of related Departments. It is time that Government reviewed the departmental structures <Col N="727" /> which they have at present in place.  Perhaps some functions of the DPS could be handled better by other Departments, although we do not say that categorically because we have not undertaken that study.  For that matter perhaps there are aspects of services provided by other Departments which could be handled better by the DPS.  There seems to be no overall review in that respect.</P>
    <P>We believe that the total cost of programmes and the total value of output should be reconciled to the overall Vote expenditure for the DPS.</P>
    <P>In general the committee concluded that within the Department of the Public Service the fundamental task of establishing objectives and assigning responsibilities is well advanced and being advanced. Credit should be given to people engaged in that task now.  Unquestionably much of that has happened relatively recently. We believe, however, that a substantial amount of work remains to be done particularly in relation to day to day management, deployment of resources and achievement of objectives.</P>
    <P>In many areas the achievement of these objectives is dependent on external factors, most notably good working relationships with other Departments.  The remit of the Department of the Public Service does not have a mandatory role in terms of the advice offered to other Departments and this might be reviewed.  It is pointless to have a Department which is expected to be the repository of standards of excellence in regard to achieving value for money when the advice they offer can be blithely ignored by other Departments. That should not be the case.</P>
    <P>The report makes clear the committee's view in that respect.  The committee are firmly of the view that advisory services should not exist unless it is clear that adequate levels of benefit arise.  We are concerned that the current level of resources being devoted by the Department of the Public Service to their objectives may not be justifiable due to known difficulties in achieving progress in certain areas and weakness in the internal management systems of the Department <Col N="728" /> of the Public Service which make it difficult to demonstrate value for money in the area.  The taxpayer and this House are entitled to know as a certainty that before money is committed in pursuit of public policy the public are getting value for money.  That cannot be stated unless there is a system in place to show it is the case.  Regardless of how difficult it is, economies, other public sectors and other systems manage to have those systems in place.  We should not allow the prevailing situation to operate.</P>
    <P>The committee also noted that opportunities for staff reductions may exist in every Department but there is no systematic procedure to remove excess staff. This obviously suggests weaknesses in manpower planning and control procedures. My committee believe that implementing the recommendations of this report will enable management in the Department of the Public Service to identify opportunities for improving the effectiveness of their services.  The DPS should then be able to demonstrate that they have made proper arrangements to achieve value for money in those areas for which they are responsible and that the benefits achieved are sufficient to justify the resources made available.</P>
    <P>The committee, as part of their deliberations on the review of this Department, studied the report of the Public Service Advisory Council chaired by Dr. Liam St. John Devlin and given the task of monitoring reform in the public service. We noted with concern that members commented in the 1984 report as follows:</P>
    <P>It seems as if little notice was taken up to this of their observations and recommendations.</P>
    <P>The council identified the Committee on Public Expenditure as having great potential for supporting reform in the public service and my committee would certainly see themselves as having a role in that regard.  We acknowledge the helpful comment of the council.</P>
    <P>The council's latest report is, unfortunately, an incident of lack of progress in reorganisation and reform in the public service since the publication of the Devlin <Col N="729" /> Report in 1969.  The question has to be asked: why has there been such little progress in public service reform?  One of the answers is that it is not perceived as a very high political priority by either the public or the politicians, but leadership and statesmanship are about ensuring that national needs are delivered, regardless of whether they are at all times perceived ones.  It is because of a lack of commitment from the centre or are managements in Departments not convinced of the benefits to be gained from the recommendations for change? Do such managements in some cases resist change when it may in some way threaten the republic or the empire over which they have domain?  Whatever the cause, the DPS must be seen to be the primary source and catalyst for a more efficient and effective public service.  I know that I am at one with the Minister in that respect.</P>
    <P>When we produce our next annual progress report in September-October we will specifically refer to the action taken on all observations and recommendations of any of our reports to date, including this one, and we also intend to look at the degree of implementation of the recommendations contained in the reports of the Public Service Advisory Council.  We would be happy to be able to report to the Dáil in due course that progress was made.</P>
    <P>The report which we present to the Dáil for consideration is basically concerned with finding out whether the DPS, which has grown considerably since its establishment and continues to grow inordinately &mdash; it is numerically larger than other Departments &mdash; has developed the expertise to meet modern challenges and the major objectives set down for the Department over the years.  We concentrated on the following main areas of activity: productivity improvement, DPS advisory service, overall project management, achievement of benefits, available skills and expertise within the DPS, co-ordinating computing expenditure, staff organisation, development and utilisation; Central Data Processing Service, charging for services, manpower <Col N="730" /> planning and control, relationships with other Departments and internal resources management by the DPS.  There are 34 recommendations set out on pages 45 to 52 of the report.  The verbatim minutes have been published separately but should be read in conjunction with the report.</P>
    <P>I thank all those who helped to make this report possible, including staff within the DPS and our consultant, Mr. David Algeo from Craig Gardner, and the staff of the committee who have at all times been excellent in the help they have given.  I hope that the report will be interpreted as a constructive attempt at assisting the Government.  I stress the all-party nature of that report and the all-party support for the recommendations.  The purpose is to ensure that Government have less opportunity than they might normally have to be tempted to shelve this report or any of the all-party reports. I am not suggesting that they would wish to do that but sometimes the pressure of other priorities might cause it to happen. I expect and hope that it will not happen on this occasion.</P>
    <P>We take the view that we have a very fine public service who have given great service to the State over the years.  We are worried lest any aspects of this report might in any way damage morale or cause difficulty in the public sector.  Morale is often unfairly dented.  That is not our intention or desire.  Our desire is to help to nudge towards progress in creating an environment in which every individual in the public sector, from the clerical assistant to the secretary of a Department, sees himself or herself as having an opportunity to contribute to the national wellbeing in an environment conducive to giving of their best and in which they will be rewarded accordingly. Our 34 recommendations are significant contributions in that respect.  I commend them to the House and I thank my committee for their help in producing the report.  I hope the Minister will be kind enough to accept the report in the spirit in which it is offered.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for the Public Service, <Col N="731" /> Deputy Boland, unfortunately cannot be here to reply and has asked me to reply on his behalf.  I do so with some pleasure because I return to a Department with which I had some association some years ago.</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Public Service welcomes the report of the Public Expenditure Committee which he finds to be supportive of the task assigned to him as Minister for the Public Service, which is, in short, to ensure an effective and efficient public service.  He is having the recommendations of the committee examined and evaluated in the context of the forthcoming White Paper on the Public Service which is now before the Government.</P>
      <P>Many of the report's findings mirror the Minister's thinking and, indeed, that of the Government.  Others represent the view from a slightly different angle and provide an additional insight into the problems of the public service today.  A few are, perhaps, a bit wide of the mark but, on the whole, the document is a worthwhile contribution to the process of administrative development.</P>
      <P>Any shortcomings which the Minister has found in the report are, perhaps, a result of the circumstances of its production. It was the result of an examination carried out between April and September 1984, a period during which the Department of the Public Service was itself, at the Minister's instigation, undergoing a major self-evaluation and overhaul and was just settling into a new distribution of functions, as well as developing a new system of accountable management.</P>
      <P>Furthermore, since that time there has been a complete reorganisation of the resources devoted to computerisation and information management involving the creation of new structures within the Department and the devolution of some functions to other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition, this was the first major survey of a Department by the Public Expenditure Committee and, since the functions of the Department of the Public <Col N="732" /> Service affect every other Department of State, the committee may wish to modify their observations in future years when they have examined the operations of these Departments.</P>
    <P>Finally, the committee mentions that the objective of the Department of the Public Service in relation to pay policy was excluded from its scope.  As industrial relations are a major element in the brief of the Minister for the Public Service, they influence almost everything done by his Department.  In that context any report which fails to examine the vitally important remuneration and conditions division of the DPS cannot claim to be anywhere near being comprehensive. The Minister would like to take this opportunity to record his personal appreciation of the dedicated and often unacknowledged work of the staff in this division.</P>
    <P>Before I come to the main thrust of the report, I would like to say a few words about the question of the skills available in the Department of the Public Service; I fear that the report may do less than justice in this area.</P>
    <P>For example, the report states that &ldquo;in the Management Services Unit, there is not one cost accountant, one economist or one computer systems expert&rdquo;.  It is true that there is no cost accountant in that unit but the deficiency in commercial accounting skills in the Civil Service is one which will be attended to under the provisions of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>There was, however, an economist in the unit and the economic skills there have been increased by the addition of an officer with a higher degree in economics. As regards computer systems experts, there were, and are in the unit, two former systems analysts, one of whom holds a degree in computer science.  In addition to this the resources of the specialised computer area of the Department are fully available to the management services unit.</P>
    <P>A substantial list of skills in this area could be furnished, such as administrative science and psychology.  In the associated operations research unit, there are four officers with mathematical <Col N="733" /> qualifications, two at higher and specialised levels.  Because of the policy of mobility in the interests of both spreading skills throughout the public service and of career development, it is inevitable that people with particular skills will move in and out of various units in the Civil Service.  There is some conflict as suggested in paragraph 48 of the report between providing adequate experience and specialisation and providing for mobility.  It is a matter of balance and, in spite of short term problems, the Minister for the Public Service is convinced that the best interests of the service lie in a system of mobility which will ensure that skills, talent and merit flow to where they can best serve the public.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in this report deal with three major themes and a number of lesser though still important matters.  The first theme is that of productivity. The Minister is glad to note the emphasis on the responsibility of individual managers in Departments for the achievement of increases in productivity. His Department have constantly pushed for such improvements by surveys, by staff numbers control and by the improvement of methods and the use of technology.</P>
    <P>In the past few years the embargo has forced Departments to achieve an improvement of some 9 per cent in productivity and probably much more when account is taken of new services and improvements in existing ones; further improvements are promised in the national plan and will be delivered.  The Minister is not sure if the rules of thumb implying the possibilities of enormous increases in productivity put forward in paragraph 25 of the report can be justified without examining individual Departments. He is convinced, however, that increases productivity is possible and is seeking it in two main ways.</P>
    <P>First, through rigid control of numbers and management surveys, we are ensuring that there is a steady improvement in productivity.  The much criticised embargo is the means by which this productivity has been translated into concrete terms.  We must now rationalise its <Col N="734" /> effects between the deserving and the less deserving areas.</P>
    <P>Second, there is the opportunity for major increases in productivity arising from the new technology.  A major reorganisation of the computer services in the Department of the Public Service has already taken place to meet the challenge. Responsibility for computer systems has been assigned to the larger users and to a new central computing service.  In addition, and perhaps of major importance, a central information management advisory service has been set up to guide the developments in technology which will revolutionise the administrative systems we know today.</P>
    <P>The Department are exploring, as practical possibilities in the near future, such concepts as an electronic network-linked public administrative system, office automation and the elimination of time wasting and inefficient practices and procedures.  The possibilities are, quite frankly, glittering but we must change and train people for those possibilities. This is being done through expanded training programmes in the Civil Service training centre but it also requires the active co-operation of the staff concerned.</P>
    <P>While some reduction in the inflated numbers in the public service has been necessary for budgetary reasons, in general, the fruits of the new technology will be used less to reduce numbers than to improve the quality and the range of services available to the public.</P>
    <P>The second of the main themes running through the report is that of management. The report quotes from a speech which the Minister for the Public Service made in October 1983 in which he described the principles of a new system of management then being developed in his Department.  It goes on to make the comment that, while the fundamental tasks of establishing objectives and assigning responsibilities are well advanced, a lot of work remains to be done.</P>
    <P>This comment was based on the committee's knowledge of the development of the system almost a year ago.  The substantial progress made since then in <Col N="735" /> the procedures for managing the Department is not, therefore, reported.</P>
    <P>In the past year, the systems designed to ensure value for money in the Department's programmes have been greatly streamlined and developed.  There is a greatly increased emphasis on programme management; much clearer statements of the expected outputs and costs of each programme have been set out with the minimum of paperwork. Every programme is scrutinised, as part of a continuing process of management review, and its performance compared with the detailed plans as regards both results and budgets.</P>
    <P>This process had led to the discontinuance or amalgamation of programmes and the reallocation of staff resources to better effect.  The report points to the danger that the scale of programmes operated by the Department could be determined by the size of the available budget rather than by the value of the output.  The system of management now in use in the Department provides a safeguard against this danger.  It has also been an essential management aid in enabling the Department of the Public Service to achieve their objectives despite the restrictions on staffing which apply to the whole Civil Service.</P>
    <P>The Minister would like to say that he regards systems such as this as being necessary in all Departments.  As indicated in <i>Building on Reality</i>, it is the Government's intention that management in all Departments will be geared more systematically than before to achieving results and reducing costs.  He believes that, while this will involve some extra effort and a strict discipline for Civil Service managers, it will also give them the incentive to achieve the most they can with the maximum economy of resources.</P>
    <P>The third major issue is that of superannuation and pensions.  Recommendation (22) from the committee is to the effect that an exercise should be undertaken to determine the effect which the present unfunded pension liability for <Col N="736" /> public servants will have on public expenditure and to identify appropriate action. It is clear from the body of the report that the committee are anxious that the accuracy of the figures used for estimating the cost of superannuation should be established.</P>
    <P>The Minister for the Public Service would not take issue with the general thrust of Recommendation (22).  He shares the committee's concern about the long term Exchequer costs of public service pensions.  He accepts that an up-to-date consting exercise on the lines suggested by the committee would be of assistance to his Department and to the Department of Finance, which of course are also involved in this area.  He is arranging that such an exercise will go ahead.</P>
    <P>While he does not think it would be appropriate to enter into a detailed discussion of public service superannuation terms on this occasion, there are two points the Minister would like to make. First, it will, he hopes, be appreciated that the problem of long term superannuation costs in respect of the public service is not one which lends itself to any single, simple solution.</P>
    <P>Secondly, there are differences in the factors applicable to public service pension schemes and private sector schemes which may, at the end of the day, make it preferable to adhere to the pay-as-you-go formula in the public service rather than to adopt a funding procedure.  However, the first step is to carry out the costing exercise recommended by the committee and the Minister is, as I have said, having that put in hand.</P>
    <P>A number of other matters are raised in the report and, while all will be considered, the Minister would like to refer briefly to some of the more important. He fully agrees that the resources for training for higher management and training in programme management generally should be increased.  Furthermore, there will be an increasing need to train people at all levels in the use of the new technology.</P>
    <P>All this will require increased resources. It is an observed fact internationally <Col N="737" /> that, in difficult times, expenditure on items like training has been among the first to be cut.  This, of course, is a false economy and he is determined that training to meet the challenges of the future will remain a priority in the public service.</P>
    <P>Job exchanges, rationalisation of grading and manpower planning are other matters where the report recommends intensified or extended efforts.  The recommendations in these areas will all be favourably considered; in fact, the report is pushing an open door as our efforts are already being steered in the same direction.</P>
    <P>A last item that the Minister would like to mention is the recommendation on charging for services provided by the Department of the Public Service.  He has always thought that it would be a good idea if interdepartmental services were charged for.  However, he understands that the whole question of what are known as allied services in the annual Estimates is governed by strict accounting procedures and change would require the consent of the Committee of Public Accounts.  It might be worthwhile for the two committees to get together to see what changes are desirable in public accounting practices which may now be outmoded.</P>
    <P>The Minister commends the report to the House therefore as a valuable input to the process of public service renewal. There is much to be done and the ideas in this report will contribute to the development of an improved public service. Yet a considerable amount has been done already.  The runway increase in numbers has been halted and reversed; the principle of merit in advancement has been established and we are gearing up to meet the challenges of technology.  We can and will build on these foundations and ensure that we have an effective and efficient public service to serve the people of this country into the next century.</P>
    <P>I should like to reply to a comment that was made since the notes were prepared. The DPS have not continued to grow inordinately.  Since July 1981 the numbers have fallen from 486 to 360.  That takes <Col N="738" /> account of the transfer of 68 of the computer staff from the Department.  The impression was given that numbers had increased whereas there has been a considerable decrease.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to support the recommendations and congratulate the chairman and members on the amount of work they put into it.  I have read the minutes of the meetings which were issued with a great deal of interest. They gave a great insight into the Department of the Public Service and the Civil Service generally.  This morning when debating the Estimate for the Department we touched on most of the points referred to in the report.  The committee set out to look at the public service, and the Civil Service elements of it, and try to identify areas where savings could be made and the service made more effective.  Whether the committee succeeded is another matter.</P>
      <P>Mr. Kevin Murphy, Secretary of the Department, when he was interviewed by the committee last summer gave as one of the Department's objectives, bringing about &ldquo;fundamental change&rdquo;, by &ldquo;standing back and looking at the public service in a much more objective way&rdquo;.  I agree with a lot of the comments in the report but they are similar to the phrases put forward in reports issued by consultants and management teams.  The cliches, some of which may be relevant, are contained in most reports about productivity, management, technology, modernisation and training.  If one looks objectively at the public service, as the Secretary and his officials try to do, one will see a huge bureaucracy in a small country.  The services built up over 60 years rarely changed.  They may have been amended.  During those years different buildings have been procured and new Departments formed.  There have been internal wranglings and halfhearted attempts to reform the public service.  Some efforts were made, such as in the Devlin Report, but they only got half way before the Department of Finance got involved in rows with other Departments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="739" /> As the Secretary says, some section of the Civil Service should be allowed bring about fundamental change by standing back and looking at themselves.  That would be good.  I do not believe anybody ever looks at such things objectively.  The speech read by the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, is similar to ones read ten years ago when Members spoke about reform in the public service.  With a few changes, it will be used again in ten years time.  At that stage there will be a little more about new technology but that is all.</P>
    <P>I do not know anything about the inner workings of the Department other than what I read but I do not see what is wrong in giving a management section permission to call in outside consultants. Deputy Kelly gave us a homily today on the cost of consultants and seemed to imply that the employment of them was a useless exercise.  If consultants help to improve the public service all the better. Reading the report of the committee one can conclude that the Department are not being given sufficient staff.  There has been a decline in staff numbers in that Department.  A lot of the matters dealt with by the Department such as pay, superannuation and so on are not what the Devlin Report envisaged for it.  That report suggested that the DPS should help other Departments introduce good management systems and encourage them to be motivators and not procrastinators. It suggested that the DPS should establish planning and finance units in the various Departments and try to organise Departments in such a way that officials would be answerable for the budgets allocated to them.  The Devlin Report was issued in 1969 but nothing has happened since.  In fact, we have gone back.  There is a lot of talk about accountability and responsibility but that does not occur.</P>
    <P>When I was sitting at the Cabinet table as Government Chief Whip, Minister of State at the Departments of the Taoiseach and Defence and when I was spokesman on Youth and Opposition Chief Whip, I met more public servants than most.  I got files on everything, lists <Col N="740" /> from COs, EOs, AOs, HEOs, Assistant Secretaries, Secretaries and Ministers.  I got copies of various agreements typed on expensive paper.  It made me wonder how much we have achieved over the years.  I do not think we have achieved very much.  When times are bad in industry and agriculture, people suggest that the public service is the rope around the country's neck.  It is only that because all other sections are failing.</P>
    <P>The public service would be working well if industry was doing all right and if we did not have such high borrowing.  It would be wrong to say that because of mistakes made by the Department of the Public Service agricultural output has decreased, unemployment has increased, the rate of inflation is high, our external and internal borrowings have reached an all time high, and so on.  That argument has been put forward too often for my liking.  It is true that our public servants have pension security nobody else has, but it is wrong to say they are inefficient, because generally they work extremely hard using out-dated equipment and are as efficient as staff numbers allow.</P>
    <P>I accept that some Departments are over-staffed and I support redeployment in the public service.  If a person is recruited to the Civil Service as a clerical officer or executive officer, he should be allocated to a Department by the Civil Service Commission.  He has no right to say which Department he stays in.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Civil Service and the public service are as bad as they are made out to be, but that is not to say that they cannot be greatly improved by up-to-date technology and machinery.  If one wants to lash out at the public service, one could attack every section.  We have seen that private enterprise have made a hash of thing in recent years.  Certain individuals in Irish Shipping were given power to enter the commercial world, and look what they did.  Many semi-State companies are losing billions of pounds. Last night I spoke in this House about Irish Steel who have been losing money because of circumstances outside their control &mdash; the price of scrap, world market prices and so on.  I do not see why <Col N="741" /> we have to have reports and attacks on our public service.</P>
    <P>This morning I dealt with technology, redeployment and so on, but the thrust of some of things said in this report tend to be unfair.  It is sad that the Minister boasts of cuts in the public service because of the embargo.  The effect of this embargo is that millions of pounds are outstanding.  People are playing ducks and drakes with the tax system because the people in the tax offices are overworked and overburdened.  People refuse to fill up forms.  Under the old system a tax form would have to be filled in by the sixth of the month, and the money would have to be sent to Revenue, but all those things are gone.  Who gains from that? The so-called capitalists and the semi-criminal element who are involved in the black economy.  The Minister says they will save a few hundred jobs and the numbers employed in the public service will be reduced by 8 per cent, but if we were to take into account the cost-effectiveness of the Civil Service we would ask ourselves if it would not be more profitable if that 8 per cent were working in the right Departments helping to collect the hundreds of millions of pounds outstanding through VAT, PAYE, PRSI and other taxes.  That would be a greater help for our balance of payments than the money we are saving by reducing the numbers employed in the public service.  Most of these people are in the lower grades &mdash; those who open doors and clean the lavatories in the Departments, not the people on high salaries.  This is a bit of a con game.  It is not an embargo we want, but a proper redeployment in the Civil Service.  I cannot understand why the trade union representatives cannot see that, why they do not try to do away with the embargo and have their workers redeployed.</P>
    <P>There is no easy solution to the pensions problem but it should be costed. This information will be needed for future financial projections.  This is a massive cost and, as the Minister said this morning, the year 2015 will bear the brunt of it.  I believe if you want to get more out <Col N="742" /> of your public servants and civil servants, productivity, management and technology will help, but bashing them will not. Down the years these people have given an excellent service to the State and we should try to think of more effective ways to encourage people who work hard.  Perhaps we could give an extra day's holiday to those who do not con the system.</P>
    <P>Public servants are not paid very well. People in senior posts might be earning £25,000 or £30,000 but a good insurance salesman selling policies around the city could earn that amount.  Yet we are asking senior civil servants to serve a busy Minister, to monitor and control large staffs, to be responsible for millions of pounds and to work for the same salary as a tradesman &mdash; it often happens that a tradesman is better paid than an administrator. Higher civil servants have been asked to carry the can and they have done it very successfully.  They deserve a lot of praise.  I have criticised them at times but they should be seen to want change; perhaps they do, but I have not received the reports from the various associations and I do not know who is holding up the publication of the White Paper.  I will not go into that again this evening but the sooner we get this White Paper the better.</P>
    <P>The people who represent Civil Service staff should come forward and say they are prepared to accept the following &mdash; they want change and they want to get away from the &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; attitude.  I say to these representatives, they as much as the Minister, keep alive the &ldquo;us and them&rdquo; attitude.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I put down a question asking how the embargo affected every grade.  The poor official asked to prepare the information rang me and told me he would be working all Saturday and Sunday through the night preparing the reply and he asked if it would do in a few weeks.  I withdrew the question to give him time to get this information and I am sure he worked every night, including Saturday and Sunday, to get it because, as Deputy Keating said, there are about 1,000 grades involved.  We have a population of three million and 1,000 grades in <Col N="743" /> the public service, all kinds of nonsensical and silly grades.  Why not just have one name and keep them all happy because as far as I can see that is all it is about.</P>
    <P>There are lists on page after page of people involved in agriculture and industry with peculiar titles which they, perhaps, do not even understand themselves. That is total nonsense.  Anyone who tries to stand over such a system should not be allowed to work in the public service, or any other job for that matter.  There are certain recommendations in this report which the Minister should implement.  The degree of technology available here in small companies should be readily available in the public service.</P>
    <P>One still hears of typing pools in 1985, but word processors would probably do away with the lot of them.  One sees files all over the place, with ten people having to countersign the paperwork and all that could be eliminated.  The only way to combat this is to take a section in the public service, with consultants and whatever other assistance is necessary, and send them off to some hotel in Connemara for the summer or the next 12 months and let them ask themselves what they really want to do with our public service.  Let them streamline it, cut lines through it, issue a report on how they see progress in the public service in terms of value for money, effectiveness, efficiency and improving their own image.</P>
    <P>Here we have a Minister talking about organisation and productivity but who today criticises the report, effectively, for leaving out the most important heading which he includes, that of pay levels. However, pay levels are a different matter.  They are determined in the Department of Finance and, if people think otherwise, they are fooling themselves. The Minister for Finance determines the money available for any Department.  There may be a section in the Department of the Public Service which would be dealing with data, but this would be true also of, say, the Department of Agriculture.  This is just <Col N="744" /> monitoring of reports and that is the function of the Department of Finance in a small country like ours.</P>
    <P>I have said before when you are honoured to sit at a Cabinet table you see the differences in Departments.  I shall not name any Ministers, but there is one who effectively has almost nothing to do.  He is rarely brought into this House to answer questions.  There is never a Special Notice Question down to him and if anyone bothers to put down a question to him, when he reads the answer nobody listens. On the other hand, the Minister for Finance comes in with about 15 files, with briefs of about 100 pages.  He was in to brief his colleagues about major decisions which will put hundreds of millions of taxpayers' money on the line over the next few years.</P>
    <P>There should be a once and for all review of all our services and all our Departments.  Some were set up years ago and could be sub-Departments of a major Department.  They do not require a full ministry.  There are other Departments which badly need full ministries, or two or three Ministers.  Finance and Industry are Departments where that is imperative.  There are 15 Ministers, five working themselves and their public servants into the ground and the other ten under-worked and under-utilised.  If they are busy, it is not doing important work that Ministers should be doing.  That is a reform that I would make before any of the other recommendations in this report.</P>
    <P>I welcome the report, but one must look at the public service in a much more objective way.  I do not believe that that has been done in this report, or that it will be done.  If the Minister for the Public Service was really interested in reform, he should have brought forward a White Paper.  He should set up a small unit, give them the expertise and resources and let them carry out reform.  As Opposition spokesman.  I would support them in that. In the meantime, people are saying that they go along with reform, but do not intend doing so.  Ministers are promising efficiency and effectiveness, but not doing anything about it.  People in this <Col N="745" /> House are talking about it, but have not got the desire to carry it through.</P>
    <P>As chairman, Deputy Keating has put a great deal of work into this Committee on Public Expenditure and has tried to do an extremely difficult job since many people are not interested.  As he said, they are interested only in services which give them something, and after that they just want to criticise.  Public service reform is important.  I do not believe that we are really facing up to it and, until we do, I remain a sceptical cynic, sitting on the sidelines.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the Committee on Public Expenditure, I was involved in the fairly exhaustive review of the Department of the Public Service and I am glad to have this opportunity to contribute to the debate on this very important subject.</P>
      <P>One of the first things I would like to say is that I have been generally impressed by the calibre and performance of all the officials from Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies who have appeared before the committee since we began out review work in 1983. It must not be forgotton that all of the staff in the public service reached their present positions through highly competitive examinations and interviews.  The fact is that public sector jobs have become highly desirable and sought after and the Civil Service Commission and the other agencies have succeeded in obtaining people of top quality at all levels of the service.  I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to the dedication of all the civil servants who are implementing Government policy and also to the employees of the State-sponsored bodies who are equally performing valuable work on behalf of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope I have made it clear that the committee were not in the business of deliberately seeking to criticise the Department of the Public Service during the course of this review.  We are, of course, obliged within our terms of reference to <Col N="746" /> review the justification for and effectiveness of on-going expenditure of Government Departments and the noncommercial State-sponsored bodies and to recommend cost-effective alternatives and eliminate wasteful or obsolete programmes.</P>
    <P>As we stated in our report, the Department of the Public Service were set up in 1973 as a separate Department from the Department of Finance and specifically charged with reorganising the public service through increasing efficiency and effectiveness and improving standards.  The committee set out to establish to what extent any or all of those aims were achieved.</P>
    <P>The secretary of the Department, Mr. Kevin Murphy, and his senior colleagues were very helpful to the committee in responding to our questions, some of which I am sure were fairly searching and were perhaps being asked for the first time in a structured way.  The secretary answered all our questions in a forthright and honest manner and defended the role of his Department in an able and constructive way.  Having said that, the committee found that some of the five main objectives of the DPS which are outlined at paragraph 20 of the report have not been achieved.  We found that despite the existence of the Devlin Report since 1969 and the setting up of the DPS 11 years ago, little or no progress has been made in certain key areas.  We would have to say that our review revealed weaknesses in the reallocation of functions between Departments and the setting up of better information and management systems.</P>
    <P>The committee in this report are essentially asking the question: why has progress in public service reform been so poor?  On the one hand, we have highly educated and well-paid staff who are recruited to carry out specific tasks.  On the other hand, there seems to be a lack of direction and perhaps commitment to change, along with a degree of poor motivation or morale in many areas of the service.  Again, one must ask the question: why is this so?  The committee identified the fact that there are major structural manpower problems within the <Col N="747" /> Civil Service, including minimal promotion prospects and poor levels of training and advisory services.  These need to be radically improved.  Our report sets out clearly how those problems might be analysed and overcome.</P>
    <P>The Department of the Public Service have the potential and the means of greatly improving their own performance and this should have far-reaching consequences for the entire public service.  No doubt the Minister in his forthcoming White Paper on Public Service Reform will spell out the steps to be taken in achieving the major goals implicit in this area.  The committee would be concerned to ensure that changes are implemented through an orderly but speedy process. No one could justify waiting for years to see these reforms achieved.</P>
    <P>We can sympathise with the Public Service Advisory Council who expressed disappointment at the very poor response to their observations in their annual reports to the Minister for the Public Service.  We on the committee will be very disappointed if the very positive recommendations in our report are not taken seriously and implemented as quickly as possible. I look forward to the Minister's response on this specific point as this will signal to us if our review is going to be followed through in the near future.</P>
    <P>I should like to pay tribute to our consultants who were very helpful to us in this, our first major review of a Government Department.  Their experience and insight on what was essentially a difficult area of public expenditure in terms of identifying actual services proved very useful to the committee.</P>
    <P>Before concluding I wish to refer to two other areas which I regard as essential to a modern and efficient public service.  First, I will mention computerisation.  We heard evidence that there are weaknesses in the overall computer service provided under the aegis of the DPS and we have recommended how this important area can and must be improved.  There is no point in having highly expensive computer equipment throughout the public service unless it is <Col N="748" /> properly planned for, justified and controlled. We have made it clear in our report that changes should be made in all cases for ongoing services as this would force Departments to act responsibly when applying for new computer and other equipment.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I am convinced that there should be more professional accountants and staff with financial expertise throughout the public service.  If we are serious about reform and the more effective use of public expenditure, then it is vital that we have an adequate number of people with the right skills.  I am not advocating an overall increase in staff numbers, but I am certain major savings can be achieved if we have expert advice available. This assumes that senior management in the service accept the need for such advice and see the benefits that can be achieved.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to note that in his speech this evening the Minister said that the deficiency in the commercial accountanting skills in the Civil Service will be attended to in the White Paper.</P>
    <P>I believe that the report of the committee will be an important contribution to an improved public service.  I ask the Minister and his officials to accept it as a constructive document aimed at helping the Department and the wider public sector to become more efficient and to provide the taxpayers with a service to which they are entitled as a matter of course.  I am not despondent about the matter as Deputy Ahern appeared to be. I will be very interested to chart during the coming year the progress of the recommendations contained in our report.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself speaking for the third time today on the Department of the Public Service.  I am tempted to believe it is on the basis that one cannot have too much of a good thing but I think it is probably more related to the fact that county council selections are on throughout the country today and that the more esoteric issues attaching to that are probably keeping the Deputies otherwise involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="749" /> I wish to thank the Minister for a remarkably sympathetic response to our report.  Of all the reports we have presented to date, no Minister has greeted a report from our committee with as much enthusiasm and co-operation and I thank him for that.  I should also like to thank Deputy Ahern and Deputy Doyle for their contributions.</P>
    <P>In a postscript to his speech the Minister referred to the question of numbers in the DPS.  The best way to put this matter into perspective is simply to quote the facts as the committee understood them.  Paragraph 23 of our report is very clear on the matter.  It states:</P>
    <P>The committee examined in detail the growth of DPS staff numbers since the establishment of the Department. The members were informed that over the period 1974 to 1983 the numbers in the DPS, excluding the Central Data Processing Service (CDPS) went up by 34 per cent.  In the CDPS they went up by 123 per cent and the overall increase was about 65 per cent for the Department as a whole.  Other increases in the same period included 8 per cent in the case of the Department of Defence, ...and 17 per cent in the Department of Finance staff.  Within the DPS the number of Assistant Principals and more senior personnel has increased by 65 per cent since 1974 ...</P>
    <P>I make that point simply to say that whether one accepts the adjective &ldquo;inordinate&rdquo; is not important: the facts show that there has been a significant increase in staff numbers in a Department, one of whose objectives is to try to ensure that staff numbers are kept as low as possible.</P>
    <P>The background context has to be borne in mind.  A vacuum was created in the Department of Finance when the rib that was to become the Department of the Public Service was removed from it in 1973 but this was very swiftly healed and the numbers were built up.  I remember in the evidence given to the committee one feature that came to our attention, namely, that staff who were on career breaks or on leave of absence <Col N="750" /> found that the DPS seemed to utilise that absence as an opportunity for recruitment to temporary posts and we referred to that in our report.  That was what I would regard as a kind of backdoor recruitment. In net terms in the years from 1974 to 1983 there was an increase of about 65 per cent for the Department as a whole.  It has to be said there has been a numerical decrease in the past year or so but that was largely facilitated by the removal of the CDPS from the Department of the Public Service.  That simply meant moving figures from one column to another.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed to imply that our report failed to examine the vitally important remuneration and conditions division of the DPS and that, therefore, it might be less comprehensive than would otherwise be the case.  We considered the question of pay and conditions during the hearing of evidence and if that evidence is read and analysed that fact can be borne out.  However, we decided that the question of pay policy should be outside the ambit of the report.  First, we wanted to concentrate on productivity improvements, on the control of numbers, advisory services, management and on those areas that have an impact on the quality, efficiency and effectiveness of the public service.  We also felt it was appropriate to exclude it from the report because it was difficult for us to judge arrangements for achieving value for money without access to Government papers and a knowledge of the advice given to Ministers. However, I do not think that exclusion detracts from what is in the report.</P>
    <P>While we recognise the vital importance of public sector pay policy, we decided to focus attention on issues relating to productivity and effectiveness.  I need hardly say to the House that the public sector pay bill would not be a problem if public sector organisations were sufficiently productive and effective.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister quoted our report as stating that in the management services unit there is not one cost accountant, one economist or one computer systems expert.  Admittedly it is <Col N="751" /> true there was no cost accountant.  The Minister said that the deficiency in commercial accounting skills in the Civil Service will be attended to under the provisions of the White Paper.  He went on to indicate the degree of skill which is in the public service.  To a large extent we accept what he said.  Our purpose was to indicate that in relation to the magnitude of expenditure and the number of staff overall, the DPS should ensure that an adequate number of skilled staff were available in the sections where they would be of most benefit.  The committee are very much in favour of staff mobility but are convinced that expert advice should be available in key areas on a permanent basis.  The report states that in the management services unit there is not one cost accountant, one economist or one computer systems expert, although a number of the personnel have an appreciation of these subjects. I note the comments of the Minister in this respect and welcome the addition of an officer with a higher degree in economics, which does not necessarily mean that one has a particular skill.  There is room for a further increase in the range of skills available and increasing the average level and depth of experience of individuals within that area of the Department and the Department as a whole.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of productivity.  I admit that a global assertion about possible productivity improvements over a period of from five to ten years might appear to be a little glib, but after due consideration we assert that it is right and proper that the Department should have productivity targets.  The targets we advanced are sustainable and achievable.  Significant productivity improvements can be achieved within ten years, more or less in line with the projections we outline.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned the rigid control of numbers and management surveys and also the implications of new technology. The committee were concerned with increasing efficiency rather than with the question of staff reductions although the question of redeploying or controlling <Col N="752" /> staff numbers is important.  For political, social and economic reasons one of the best ways to achieve progress is to get more out of people where there is a latent potential for that kind of possibility. Rigid control of numbers involves difficulties. Deputy Ahern made a valid point when he referred to the blunt instrument which the embargo is and in some areas it is arguably illogical to control numbers where there is an obvious benefit to the State in allowing a greater number of staff to be recruited.  We should look again at the embargo and see if there is room to consider the degree of arbitrary bluntness which accompanies the manner in which the embargo applies.  The rule applies regardless.  It was an emergency measure and a sudden and dramatic attempt to do something about numbers but the time may now have come to see if we can refine that and use a little more wisdom in the way it is applied.  The point made by Deputy Ahern is valid and I hope the Minister will take that on board as well when he gets an opportunity to consider the report in detail.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister is satisfied that progress in the area of technology is being made quickly enough.  Perhaps in due course he might let us know to what extent he intends to avail of outside advice from the private sector, including consultants who might be able to help him in this regard.  I would like to know if the central computing service differs from the CDPS.  We were not happy about aspects of the capacity of the CDPS to respond to today's demands and we wondered why there was a great turnover of staff in the CDPS.  Is it due to better pay elsewhere or is morale bad in that area?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to management. In fairness we must acknowledge that there have been positive developments in the CDPS since our review was initiated. We are pleased to note that they happened and that they concur with the kind of views which permeate the report before the House.  We are glad to note that the Minister can report good progress. How does the performance compare with the plans the Minister had?  The <Col N="753" /> Minister is extremely enthusiastic and desires progress.  Is he satisfied with the progress to date?  I suppose that question is largely hypothetical.  I hope the report will be of help of the Minister in pushing for speedier progress if that is possible.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to incentives.  As a committee, we expressed considerable interest in incentives.  Does the Minister intend to examine the suggestion that there should be a tangible incentive scheme for the Civil Service?  Deputies Ahern and Doyle referred to this point. Should there be some kind of points system for work well done, or financial inducement and, conversely, in the case of people failing to meet targets?  The key questions of motivation, morale, reward and sanction are all bound up with getting the very best performance from people no matter what walk of life they are in. Unless we create that framework for standards of excellence and for getting the best out of people we will always have an under-utilised public service.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to superannuation and pensions.  We are concerned about the long term Exchequer costs.  We were pleased to note the ready acceptance by the Minister of our proposal to carry out the necessary survey to estimate precisely the liabilities involved.  We are pleased to note also that a costing exercise is under way.  When will results be available?  Perhaps the committee might be kept informed in that regard if possible as it is a matter not only of public expenditure importance but of pressing public policy importance.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to a pay-as-you-go scheme.  He referred to the differences in the factors applicable to public service pension schemes and he said that at the end of the day it may make it preferable to adhere to the pay-as-you-go formula in the public service rather than to adopt a funding procedure.  I am not so sure about that.  We wanted to establish that whatever scheme we opt for we would do so in the full possession of the facts which at the moment are not available.  The pay-as-you-go scheme is a cause of discontent in the private sector as people have an impression that there is a free <Col N="754" /> pension scheme for civil servants.  Every time one hears reference to the pensions of people in public life they are lumped into this category.  Whatever about the civil servant having a perceived free pension, Oireachtas Members do not.  We pay into a contributory scheme.  If we are prematurely decanted out of the House before eight years we do not get the benefits returned to us.  Perhaps the Minister might clarify the present pension scheme so that no undue injury would be inflicted on civil servants.  There is no such thing as a free pension or a free lunch.  Someone pays for it.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to training. He said:</P>
    <P>He fully agrees that the resources for training for higher management and training in programme management generally should be increased.</P>
    <P>Obviously a demand for more resources is liable to meet with a mixed reaction. We are not necessarily convinced that better training automatically means increased resources.  There is the question of the quality of existing courses and this was a cause of concern to the committee.  Such courses may not be the most effective available and the consultant identified this as a problem.  We are not looking for more money for courses but we are looking for more relevant and more effective courses and a qualitative improvement in existing courses.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the question of charging for services.  He said he always thought it would be a good idea if interdepartmental services were charged for.  This question is vital.  We will take up the Minister's suggestion and forward a copy of our report to the Committee of Public Accounts with a view to bringing about the necessary changes as quickly as possible.  We believe there will be more accountability and responsibility on behalf of managers and Departments if true costs are spelled out and have to be paid for by Departments.</P>
    <P>On behalf of my colleagues I note with approval the Minister's intention to consider favourable our recommendations in <Col N="755" /> relation to manpower planning.  My committee considered these recommendations to be among the most important in our report as they relate to matters absolutely central to the effectiveness of the Civil Service.  They are central to the value we derive from our most valuable asset, our people.  We cannot stress that too strongly.</P>
    <P>I would remind the Minister again of some of the more serious problems which we identify in paragraph 74 and which our recommendations are designed to alleviate.  Obviously the Minister could not refer specifically to all the various points but I would urge him to pay particular attention to recommendations Nos. 3, 21, 24 and 27.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment briefly on the very valuable point made by Deputy Doyle about computerisation, that is, the wonderful opportunity and challenge which this technology presents.  A sensitive and sensible co-ordinated approach in this area by the DPS could yield extraordinary benefits to the State in the coming years.  It is only right that that factor should be drawn to the attention of the public.</P>
    <P>I welcome very sincerely the tone and the content of what the Minister had to say.  This leads many of us on the committee to regard our work as worthwhile but we will have proof of that in due course if the recommendations are implemented. The Minister's response has been warm and accepting and that is encouraging to us.  It is right that the committee should take note of what Deputy Ahern said and also of what I said earlier today, that is, that the way in which criticism and suggestion is ventilated could lead to undue damage to public service morale.  Often the public sector seems to be the whipping boy, expected to remain mute and take criticism which in many cases is aimed at it unfairly.  My personal view is that the public sector is what the politicians have made it.  If there are weaknesses and inefficiencies in the public sector, successive administrations must take the blame for that because of the failure to set clear targets, for not creating an environment <Col N="756" /> in which the best can be extracted from people and for not producing award, incentive, encouragement and sanction where appropriate within the public service. We are supposed to do these things, not the public servant who is essentially part of the executive arm of Government.</P>
    <P>Our public servants have done a tremendous job for the State since its foundation, sometimes during very difficult and turbulent times.  When in other countries similar political situations presented themselves, public servants were not always found to be as trustworthy and as loyal as ours have been.  The effectiveness of the Civil Service is of vital importance to all of us.  In the past year many initiatives have been taken to improve its effectiveness and the value we derive from it.  The Department of the Public Service have the central dynamic role to play in that process.  My committee wish the Minister every success with his work in that respect.  We trust our report will help him and he can be assured that we will be interested in his implementing our recommendations and that we will co-operate with him in that regard in every way possible in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>I thank Mr. Kevin Murphy, the Secretary of the Department, and his officials who helped us in this our first review of a Government Department.  They facilitated us in every way possible during those interviews.  They helped to elucidate for us, and for the public who we hope will take some interest in these matters, what is perhaps not the most rivetingly important area but what is fundamentally an area of vital importance to the quality of life and of service in this community and which from the point of view of the taxpayer is of fundamental importance from the point of view of the cost implicit in the way we manage our Civil Service numbers.  I trust the report will be interpreted in that spirit.  I thank the Minister for his reaction to it and I commend it to the House.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 18 June 1984 and payment was made to 27 May 1985 based on her insurance record for the 1982-83 contribution year.</P>
      <P>She did not attend for examination by a medical referee of the Department on 28 May 1985 and as a result payment of benefit was disallowed for the statutory period of six weeks from 28 May 1985. She was informed of the disallowance of benefit on 7 June 1985.</P>
      <P>She is not entitled to payment of benefit from 20 June 1985 as contributions recorded on her behalf for the 1983-84 year are recorded at Class J and do not give cover for disability benefit.  If the person concerned wishes to submit an explanation for her non-attendance at the medical referee examination, consideration will be given to payment of benefit from 28 May 1985 to 19 June 1985.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 66 together.</P>
      <P>A number of factors have been affecting the prices for early Irish potatoes recently.  These include the availability of unusually large supplies of good quality potatoes from last year's bumper crop, increased supplies of Irish earlies and imports from a number of countries including Cyprus.</P>
      <P>Following the recent decision of the Court of Justice in regard to the import into this country of potatoes which are already in free circulation in another member state my Department have sought authority from the EC Commission to restrict temporarily imports of potatoes originating in third countries.  A decision from the Commission is awaited.</P>

      <P>There is no provision in the Vocational Education Act, 1930, which requires vocational education committees to advertise a public competition for the filling of vacant teaching posts.</P>
      <P>The relevant regulations relating to the granting of approval for teaching appointments made by vocational education committees specify, however, that vacant posts must, normally, be advertised by the committees concerned in newspapers with national circulation.  The regulations also provide that exceptions to this requirement may be made in special circumstances.</P>

      <P>What is proposed for the vocational school in Dundalk is not the currently used prefabricated classroom but a good quality system-built accommodation which will have an expected life of 25 years.  In the case of the other schools, permanent extensions were sanctioned generally to cater for the existing levels of enrolments, whereas the vocational school extension was sanctioned to cater for additional numbers.  The system-built accommodation for the vocational school was approved because of the uncertainty as to the appropriate numbers to be catered for in the longer term.  However, my Department propose to review the situation in the light of the enrolment figures and projections in September next.  At that stage, I will consider the question of the type of accommodation to be provided.</P>
