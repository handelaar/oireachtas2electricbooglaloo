    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he is aware of a report published by the Council for the Status of Women which shows that only 10 per cent of the membership of the boards of semi-State companies are women and that 33 of the country's semi-State companies have never had a woman on their boards of management; if he has any plans to increase the numbers of women on these boards; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information in the report in question is based on a questionnaire sent to State-sponsored bodies between mid-January and mid-February 1985.  It shows that out of a total number of 1,261 persons on these boards at that time 10.8 per cent were women.  The total number of Government appointments involved in this number was 862 persons, or 68.3 per cent and of this number 11.9 per cent were women.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a source of concern to me that the overall percentage of women is low and that many key State-sponsored bodies do not have and never have had women on <Col N="1604" /> their boards.  The procedure for State board appointments is currently being reviewed and particular attention will be paid to this aspect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Taoiseach indicate how many vacancies exist at present on these semi-State companies? Will he say if he has any plans to ensure that a reasonable proportion of such vacancies will be filled by qualified women?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not indicate the number.  Probably there are very few actual vacancies but there is always a number of appointments due to be made in the immediately foreseeable future.  I have not the exact number.  I am concerned about the position.  A general review is taking place of State board appointments and, in addition, other steps have been taken.  The Minister of State for Women's Affairs in my Department ensures that where a vacancy arises on the board of a State body and where the appointment is one where the Government or the relevant Minister have a function they are furnished with the names of suitable candidates to be considered for appointment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's office are building up a register of women available for appointment to boards and this register, together with that compiled by the National Women's Talent Bank, is proving of considerable practical use to Ministers when vacancies arise.  I would also refer the Deputy to the recently published working party report prepared under the Chairmanship of the Minister of State for Women's Affairs entitled &ldquo;Irish Women &mdash; Agenda for Practical Action&rdquo; which covers this area in depth.  The regulations made with regard to women on State boards will provide an important base for future policy in this area.  As is evident from the figures given in my reply to the question, about one-third of the appointments are not made by the Government or Ministers directly but are made by nominating bodies.  I am proposing that Ministers would ask these bodies, whose record is less good than that of the <Col N="1605" /> Government, to have due regard for a balance between the sexes in their nominations to State bodies.  Some Ministers have done this already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the replies received so far from the local authorities concerned I am satisfied that there is a wide general acceptance of the need for a sympathetic approach in accordance with the aims of the guidelines and that a genuine effort is being made by the local authorities to deal with individual cases in accordance with those guidelines.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister indicate if he is aware that Dublin Corporation area transfers to local authority tenants are being refused because a tenant owes local charges to the county council?  Is that procedure in line with the guidelines which he has laid down?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I submitted a question to him some weeks ago giving specific details of a case in Ballymun where a family living in overcrowded conditions and with medical priority for transfer to a house <Col N="1606" /> were refused the transfer because they were not in a position to pay the local charges to the county council?  The corporation are refusing the transfer.  Will the Minister indicate if that is in breach of the spirit of his guidelines and if he will request the corporation to allow the transfer to take place?</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The general policy cannot be indentified by one case which has arisen.  However, if this is the general policy I assure the Deputy that I will have the matter looked into.  I would not be prepared to accept one case as representing the policy of the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>

      <P>What guidance has been given to local authorities who have been obliged under the legislation to issue bills for water charges to people who do not avail of water supply from the local authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>This is why the circular was issued.  We had evidence that bills were issuing to people who did not avail of the service from the local authority.  In such cases we asked for the justification for sending bills to these people.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this was pointed out to him when the Bill was being debated?  He was asked if this practice would be applied to people not availing of the service.  The Minister said yes, they would have to pay for the service whether or not they availed of it.  The Minister refused to accept an amendment from this side of the House at that time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The guidelines had to be issued because of the utter confusion which prevailed throughout the local authorities because this matter was left as an executive function to the managers. Will the Minister agree that he made a mistake?  Will he give the power to the elected councillors rather than to the manager?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that all the Minister will tell us?  The IDA are trying to encourage people to set up small industries and it would be a logical step to look at the possibility of removing rates from small industrial premises to allow people with ideas, who may not necessarily have the finance to back up those ideas, to set up in business.  It would generate employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>They may not have the necessary finance to meet the very steep demands made on them by local authorities. Would the Minister consider that area in the light of encouraging industrial starts?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>While separate figures in respect of the cost of derating such premises are not available, it is clear that the cost would be substantial because the yield from rates on industrial and commercial premises totals £122 million per annum.  The removal of this substantial source of revenue, over which local authorities have direct control, would have major consequences both in terms of local finances and of the powers of local authorities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the average delay in new house inspections in Counties Cavan and Monaghan from the date the file is sent to the housing inspector until the file is returned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The general length of time taken for inspections in the Cavan-Monaghan area is estimated to be about eight weeks at present.  This longer than normal period is because of a number of factors which had arisen due to staffing difficulties, including the continuing absence on sick leave of one inspector, and particularly difficult weather conditions during the winter months.  An additional inspector was assigned for a period to the area in order to reduce the average waiting time.  The matter is being kept under review in the light of the position on inspections both in the Cavan-Monaghan area and other parts of the country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that last year the delays were twice as long as he indicates in his answer and that not alone are these delays resulting in people having to wait quite a long time for new house grants but also for loan subsidy payments?  We are talking about people who in most cases are badly in need of these payments.  Will the Minister not agree that a serious situation has developed in this respect in the past 12 months?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that, for the reasons I have outlined, a serious situation did arise.  As I have said, this was due to temporary staff changes.  In the Cavan-Monaghan area there was an increase in the number of cases awaiting inspection.  Following the retirement of a supervisor inspector in Donegal last year, <Col N="1613" /> a housing inspector from the Cavan-Monaghan area was appointed to fill the higher post in a temporary capacity.  A housing inspector from another area was sent subsequently to Cavan-Monaghan for a period so that the backlog that had accumulated there might be cleared.  I understand this move has had a beneficial effect there.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this problem arises also in cases in which applicants request the Department to send an inspector to the premises concerned but where in many cases there is a problem relating to garage size or the overall size of the house and that, after waiting for perhaps five months for the arrival of the inspector, the applicant is told there is a problem, that, for instance, the garage could be converted.  While awaiting the visit from the inspector, the applicant would have continued with the building but because of what the inspector says, the applicant might lose the £2,000 grant and also the £3,000 loan subsidy?</P>

      <P>Four schemes have started already and satisfactory progress has been made in the pre-construction procedures relating to the other schemes scheduled to commence in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the 54 major schemes which will be commenced and completed during the period 1985 to 1987, 20 schemes are already in progress and work is expected to start on a further three schemes within a few months.  Since the plan was published, nine public inquiries have been held and arrangements have been made <Col N="1615" /> to hold a further three inquiries within the next three months.  Earlier this month Dublin County Council approved a toll scheme for the Road linking the Lucan Road and Navan Road in Dublin at a cost of over £25 million.  This scheme should start next year.  To date, State expenditure on road grants is some £2 million ahead of target.</P>
    <P>Further particulars of the schemes referred to in my reply are included in a statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.  Following is the statement:&mdash;</P>
    <P Just="Center">Progress Report on new Road Plan</P>
    <P>The new Road Plan lists 54 major projects which will be commenced and/or completed during the period 1985 to 1987.</P>

      <Col N="1616" />&mdash;Dungarvan (Waterford) </P>
    <P>(4)  The Inspector's report on the Glanmire By-Pass inquiry in Cork is expected shortly.</P>
    <P>(5)  Three further inquiries will be held soon:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Remaining 14 mile section of Cork/Mallow (June)</P>
    <P>&mdash;Newbridge By-Pass (July)</P>
    <P>&mdash;Downstream Crossing of River Lee (September)</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(6)  Without prejudice to the statutory procedures involved, the Government have no objection to proposals received from Conor Holdings Ltd. for funding a road linking the Lucan Road and the Navan Road at a cost of over £25 million. Dublin County Council approved the toll scheme for this route on 10 June, 1985, and the necessary public inquiry will be held later in the year.  The scheme should start next year.</P>
    <P>(7)  The total State road grant for 1985 is £152.5 million.  Between 1 January and 31 May, 1985, £54.5 million was paid to local authorities, which is £2 million more than scheduled in the monthly expenditure profile prepared at the beginning of the year. </P>

      <P>Can the Minister inform the House which of the nine schemes have commenced?  I understand from the document, <i>Policy and Planning, Framework for Roads</i>, published in January 1985 that the proposal was that nine major roadworks would commence this year.  As we are now half way through the year I would appreciate the Minister informing the House which schemes have commenced and when the remainder are likely to commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The following is the present position regarding the schemes listed in the plan referred to.  Work on the Chapelizod by-pass started at the end of May and the 1985 grant commitment in that regard is £1.755 million.  The final engineering document in respect of the Lucan by-pass has been prepared and construction is expected to commence in the autumn.  The grant commitment in that respect is £2.1 million.  Work is in progress on the Oranmore by-pass in respect of which the grant commitment this year is £1.5 million.  At the CPO public <Col N="1617" /> inquiry on 6 May objections were lodged in respect of the Newtownmountkennedy by-pass scheme.  These objections are being considered and a decision is expected in the matter in July.  The 1985 grant commitment in respect of that scheme is £500,000.  In respect of the Brownswood-Edermine, Wexford road, work is in progress.  The 1985 grant commitment in that regard is £1 million. Regarding the Port Road, Manorcunningham scheme, objections were registered at the CPO public inquiry on 4 March last.  These are being considered and a decision in the matter is expected in July.  The 1985 grant commitment in that respect is £0.625 million.  Work is in progress on the Southern Ring Road in Cork in respect of which the 1985 grant commitment is £2.2 million.  Contract documents are an an advanced stage of preparation in respect of the Blackrock by-pass.  Advertising for tenders is likely to be in September and the work is expected to commence later in the year. In respect of that scheme the 1985 grant commitment is £1.3 million.  Phase work is in progress on the Kilkenny inner relief road in respect of which the 1985 commitment is £0.4 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say how the Government could have published a programme for road construction works which were to commence in 1985 when the land had not even been acquired on which such roads were to be constructed? Am I to take the Minister's reply as indicating that in a number of cases compulsory purchase orders have not been finalised, and had not been finalised at the time these dates were inserted in the Government's programme, giving a false impression of the amount of capital which would be invested in road construction in 1985?  Is the Minister aware that the major companies involved in road construction have stated recently that 75 per cent of their machinery is lying idle in yards awaiting the Government release of the major road works programme they announced and to which they are committed? <Col N="1618" /> Surely it is clear that a lot of these road works cannot possibly commence in 1985 because advanced planning had not been completed and, in many cases, the land had not even been purchased?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in many cases.  I mentioned the Newtownmountkennedy by-pass CPO having taken place on 6 May and another, in the case of the Port Road, Manorcunningham in Donegal, where objections to the scheme and a CPO inquiry were made on 13 March 1985 and which are being considered. Those are the only two where the CPO hold-up could be advanced as an excuse for not perhaps commencing on time. These are the procedures people are entitled to follow in the case of these major contracts.  I also stated, in reply to the Deputy, that the programme is running £2 million ahead of target. Therefore I am satisfied that progress in general is not only on target but is ahead of target at this time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister said that expenditure was running £2 million ahead of target.  It is very easy to run expenditure ahead of whatever target one is talking about because, in many cases, one is paying for work done last year.  Is the Minister not aware that CPOs, from the time of initiation to completion, have taken up to eight years, and that it was very wrong of the Government to include any proposal commencement in 1985 where there was a CPO involved because of the long delay and tortuous procedures which apply to CPOs?  Surely the Minister must admit that it was somewhat optimistic, and not the proper thing to do, to include works, indicating that they would be commenced, when in fact the land had not even been acquired or the designing completed, as has been indicated from some of these replies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be clutching at two straws in endeavouring to make a case which is not a valid one.  Progress on the roads programme is moving ahead.  I have indicated what is <Col N="1619" /> the situation in regard to the nine projects for this year.  In only two cases is the CPO in question.</P>

      <P>In view of the major contribution which the East Link toll bridge has made to the easement of the traffic situation in Dublin, can the Minister outline for us what is the present position in regard to the proposed second toll bridge across the Liffey in the Lucan area?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In my reply I indicated proposals for a road linking the Lucan Road and the Navan Road.  The Deputy will be much more conversant with that area than I am.  In my reply I said that Dublin County Council had approved the toll scheme for that road at a cost of £25 million and that this scheme would start next year.  That is all the information I have on that road at this time.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the bridge, an application by the same people who built the East Link, who have an application in for a second toll bridge which everybody agrees would effect an enormous easement of traffic congestion in that area.

      <P>I do not know what is the technical name but it is very clearcut: there is a major bridge proposed across the Liffey out in that area which is the subject of an application from private interests; I do not know what their name is.  What is the position about that application?  Is the Minister aware that the first toll bridge, the East Link, is <Col N="1620" /> making an enormous contribution to easing the traffic situation in Dublin?  I hope we will not have the same long period of delay in having the second toll bridge brought in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no reason this toll bridge could not be commenced in 1985.  I might ask the Minister another question: in a lot of the road building in progress around Dublin city at present it seems, to the inexpert observer, that they are being built to very palatial sorts of standards, in many cases it being difficult to visualise their being fully utilised in our lifetime.  Is popular rumour true that these roads have to be built to enormously expensive standards because of EC regulations and directives?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think the Minister is aware of the exact import of my question.  Is he aware that in many cases roads which are being built are four and six lane highways, that those of us who <Col N="1621" /> know the city fairly well cannot visualise them being fully utilised certainly this century?  Are they being built to these very grandiose standards because they are EC funded and that the EC insists on these standards?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally the amount of EC funds would be dependent on the quality and type of roads being built. That is one of the consideration in building roads of that nature.  But I do not agree with the Deputy when he says that they are being built to an excessive standard. The road system which is being constructed is being utilised and has proved to be of a very good standard and of a very safe standard.  I have not heard a complaint that we are overspending.</P>

      <P>I want to ask a final, important question.  This is a matter of public interest.  Is the Minister aware that this is naturally a question of allocating scarce resources for the best possible results, that it seems to many people that some of these projects are being built very expensively and to standards on a scale that would not be required in the foreseeable future and that some of this money might be better spent on other roads which are in a very bad state of repair and which could do with some of the expenditure allocated to those other expensive major highways that are being built?</P>

      <P>I do not have the information in the format requested by the Deputy.  However, at 31 December 1984, the latest date for which statistics are available in my Department, local authorities had 3,140 approved housing applications from single parent families.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>In considering the need for housing most authorities maintain a regularly revised approved housing list of persons in need of housing.  In order to assess the overall position the Department annually request the authorities to supply information about their waiting lists.  On 31 December 1984, the latest date for which returns are available, there were 3,140 approved housing applications for single parent families.  This is the information we have received from the local authorities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that many of these single parent families have been on local authority housing lists for up to five and six years and that no effective decision has been taken in relation to these applications which are simply held in abeyance?

      <P>The year 1983 was the first time that this type of information was requested of the local authorities. The number of lettings now being made to single parent families constitutes a sizeable proportion of the overall letting being made in 1984.

      <P>Single parent families are the forgotten people.  They do not qualify for a family type house or for an old person's dwelling.  In practically every local authority they are, as Deputy Kirk said, probably three times as long on the housing list as other families.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will outline the main recommendations of the Tribunal <Col N="1626" /> of Inquiry into the Stardust Fire which have yet to be implemented; if he will indicate the recommendations the Government have not accepted; when the recommendations which have been accepted will be implemented; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The tribunal report contains a wide range of recommendations and all of these recommendations have been fully considered by the Government and represent a major input to the continuing evolution of the Government policy on fire and to the development of the fire service.  Many of the recommendations have already been implemented.  Others, of their nature, require implementation on an ongoing basis and this is being done.  In the case of a small number of the tribunal's recommendations it was decided, after careful consideration of the wider issues involved and of the overall implications, that it would be better if they were not brought into effect or that a modified version of the recommendations should be implemented.</P>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to emphasis again my commitment, and that of the Government, to the development of the fire service as rapidly and comprehensively as possible.  Priority will continue to be given to the financial and other needs of the fire service within the limits of available resources and this is provided for in the Government's plan <i>Building on Reality.</i> The measures already taken have resulted in major improvement in recent years in the financing and equipping of the service, in the organisation and staffing and in the legislative framework, leading to substantial progress in the capability of the service to respond to fire and other emergencies, and to a significant increase in fire prevention activities.  Real progress has been made and continues to be made all the time across the whole field of fire safety including:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;fourfold increase, to £10.25 million, in capital provision between 1981 and 1985 resulting in 25 new or reconstructed <Col N="1627" /> fire stations and 90 new appliances already provided.</P>
    <P>&mdash;restructuring of the county council fire services resulting in the creation of 87 new professional posts of which 47 are on fire prevention work and, in addition, 19 officers full time on fire prevention work in the Dublin area.</P>
    <P>&mdash;the establishment of the Fire Services Council by my predecessor, Deputy Spring, just two years ago resulting in significant improvements in the level and scope of training at national level, including the use of UK and continental facilities and expertise; 20 courses were held by the council over the past two years and 18 to 20 are planned for this year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;increased training at local and regional level has been facilitated by the additional numbers of instructors being trained by the Fire Services Council.</P>
    <P>&mdash;revised draft building regulations issued over a year ago and the discussion document on fire safety in places of public assembly together form a modern up-to-date code, which takes account of the tribunal's recommendations, to assist fire officers and others in their work.</P>
    <P>&mdash;a model emergency plan and guidance documentation prepared in my Department have been issued to local authorities to assist them in emergency planning and this is being backed up by a series of regional seminars conducted by my Department.</P>
    <P>&mdash;installation of computerised information system on dangerous substances in 11 local authorities and distribution of emergency services hazard information card to all firemen in the country.</P>
    <P>&mdash;continuing high level of work by the Fire Prevention Council to promote greater awareness of fire hazards among the public at large and special interest groups. </P>
    <P>A statement of the kind requested by the Deputy on the main recommendations of the tribunal would have to cover <Col N="1628" /> a wide range of issues and would, of necessity, be very lengthy and could not appropriately be made at Question Time. I am arranging, therefore, to have such a statement included in the Official Report.</P>
    <P>Following is the statement:</P>
    <P> 1.  Capital Investment</P>
    <P>Capital investment in the fire service has increased four-fold over the last five years from £2.5 million in 1981 to a provision of £10.24 million in 1985 with provision for further increased funding in 1986 and 1987.  This funding, together with a state subsidy of 50 per cent on fire authority loan charges, has enabled the following since 1981:</P>
    <P>&mdash;25 new fire stations and major reconstructions completed.</P>
    <P>&mdash;15 additional fire station projects are currently in hand and another five should begin before the end of the year</P>
    <P>&mdash;90 new fire appliances were purchased</P>
    <P>&mdash;major improvements in radio communications, in the provision of breathing apparatus and other fire-fighting and rescue equipment. </P>
    <P>2.  Staffing</P>
    <P>The county fire service was completely restructured in 1982 to increase its effectiveness with emphasis on fire prevention. Prior to this restructuring the only professional post in the county fire service was that of Chief Fire Officer.  There are now 87 professional posts in addition to the grade of Chief Fire Officer throughout the country and 47 of them are on fire prevention duties.  In addition Dublin Corporation now have 19 officers engaged full time on fire prevention duties.  It is anticipated that a competition for the post of Chief Fire Officer in Dublin, filled temporarily at present as recommended in the report of the Stardust Tribunal, will be held in the autumn when potential candidates will have completed necessary training courses.</P>
    <P>3.  Education and Training.</P>
    <P>The tribunal made recommendations on training and education in fire matters and on the need for a national training <Col N="1629" /> centre.  Major improvements in fire service training have taken place, particularly following the establishment of the Fire Services Council in June 1983.  Central training courses have been substantially increased in both scale and scope&mdash; the council ran five courses in 1983, 15 in 1984 and 18-20 are planned for 1985.  The council make use of training centres in the UK and on the Continent and have brought in lecturers of the highest standing in the field of fire safety engineering. Local training at county and regional levels has increased also due to greater numbers of local instructors being trained by the council.  On the question of a national training centre, the council availed of the services of Mr. Gunner Haurum, the Director of the Danish National Fire College to advise them and Mr. Haurum has reported on the matter. Following recent discussions with the council I have asked them to develop their proposals for a national training centre in more detail.  I must stress however that the physical location of a training centre is far less important than the provision of course which has been undertaken by the council.  The experience gained by the council in providing courses, including information on foreign training, is a valuable input into the council's deliberations and proposals for a national training centre.  A number of fire safety engineering courses have also been provided in universities including one early this year which was jointly organised by UCD and the Fire Services Council.</P>
    <P>4.  Legislation.</P>
    <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981, represents a major overhaul of fire service legislation and strengthens the powers of fire authorities to enforce fire safety measures while placing the primary responsibility for fire safety on those incharge of premises used by the public. </P>
    <P>Building Regulations.</P>
    <P>The building regulations have been extensively revised to take account of the tribunal's recommendations.  To ensure the success of the regulations and to provide <Col N="1630" /> for minimal disruption of the building industry the Government recognised the need to hold extensive consultations with the relevant professional institutes and other interested bodies.  Indeed, this need was recognised also by the Opposition who asked in the Dáil that the Building Control Bill should be deferred until these consultations had been satisfactorily concluded.  The consultations have now been completed and the Building Control Bill, which is currently at Committee Stage, will give statutory effect to the regulations.  In the meantime the draft revised regulations are being applied as if they had the force of law.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the fire related parts of the regulations as recommended by the tribunal was considered but was found to be impractical due to the inter-action between the different parts of the regulations as drafted.  The tribunal's recommendations that some form of approval by local or central authority would be required in relation to the fire parts of the regulations has been accepted and there is provision in section 6 of the Building Control Bill for the issue of a fire safety certificate by a building control authority.</P>
    <P>Management Regulations.</P>
    <P>Management regulations under section 37 of the Fire Services Act, 1981, will provide for fire safety in premises when occupied.  As a first step, in 1983 my Department circulated a detailed discussion document on fire safety in places of public assembly.  This document gives fire authorities, and indeed all concerned with fire safety, guidance on the level of standards desirable in public assembly premises.  The proposals in the discussion document were well received and, taking account of the comments made, the Fire Services Council have prepared a draft code of practice which will accompany the management regulations.  The draft code is now being examined by a committee of council members and other experts and the draft code and regulations should be published later this year and will be implemented following necessary consultations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1631" /> A separate regulation has, at my request, been drafted in the Department making it an offence to lock fire exit doors while a premises is in use.  I intend that this regulation will be introduced immediately following certain necessary consultations. An offence under these regulations will carry a maximum fine of £10,000 and/or two years imprisonment.</P>
    <P> 5.  Responsibility for the Fire Service and Question of an Inspectorate</P>
    <P>The tribunal recommended changes in the responsibility of the Minister in relation to the fire service and proposed the establishment of an inspectorate of fire services.  Detailed examination of these recommendations indicated specific difficulties of which the main difficulty would be the underlying principle of the proposal as it would affect local autonomy. This would be totally at variance with the Government's proposals for devolution to local authorities.  While it is not proposed to make the fundamental changes recommended by the tribunal nevertheless, with the help of the Fire Services Council, I am now much better equipped to discharge my advisory and supervisory role.</P>
    <P>6.  Emergency Planning</P>
    <P>The tribunal referred to emergency plans and the importance of following recommended procedures.  My Department have been providing extensive advice and assistance to local authorities on this matter:</P>
    <P>&mdash;A model emergency plan has been prepared and issued to local authorities accompanied by an extensive package of guidance documentation.</P>
    <P>&mdash;My Department are currently runing a series of regional seminars on emergency planning for local authorities.</P>
    <P>&mdash;Eleven local authorities are installing the Chemdata computer-based information system which is designed to provide vital information for dealing with an incident involving dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1632" />&mdash;A working group including representatives from the chemical industry are examining the means of improving the level of response to chemical incidents and the possibility of greater co-operation between the chemical industry and the local authorities on this matter.</P>
    <P>&mdash;An emergency services hazard information card has been prepared and copies issued for every fireman in the country together with detailed guidance notes for the fire service on the transportation of dangerous substances.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>7.  Fire Prevention Council</P>
    <P>The tribunal referred to the value of publicity aimed at increasing the general level of public awareness of fire hazards and the important role of the Fire Prevention Council.  The Fire Prevention Council are funded jointly by my Department and the Federation of Insurers in Ireland to promote public awareness of fire hazards through publicity, advertising and a wide range of seminars and conferences. The level of funding has significantly increased from £100,000 in 1980 to £232,000 in 1985 which has enabled the council to carry out an expanded programme of activity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister for his detailed reply, but a number of points arise from it.  He indicated that a code had been prepared for fire officers for use in their day to day work regarding places of public resort.  Can he indicate to what extent fire officers have checked out places of public resort such as discos, stadia and so forth to ensure that regulations that exist are being complied with? Could he indicate also if since the Stardust tragedy any orders under section 20 (1) of the Fire Services Act, 1981, the safety notice section, have been served?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981, contains a wide range of powers for fire officers to deal with fire safety in buildings and the issue of fire safety notices prohibiting the use of a building or part of it for any specific purpose or prohibiting the use of a building altogether <Col N="1633" /> until specified precautions have been taken.  Under the terms of section 23 of the Act in particularly serious cases the fire authority can apply to the High Court for orders restricting or prohibiting the use of a building.  Both management regulations and the Building Control Bill will impose severe penalties, a fine of £10,000 and two years' imprisonment for breach of the regulations.  In the circumstances it is not considered that there is a pressing need to change the legislation. Nevertheless, the matter is being kept under review.  As to the number of visits made by inspectors, I do not have that information before me but I can certainly find it out for the Deputy.  As it is a matter for the local authority concerned I have not got it at present in my brief.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The question I asked related to section 20 (1) of the Fire Services Act and I would appreciate information concerning the number of notices served under that section, but the Minister has not got it at present.  He is aware, I am sure, that the tribunal recommended that the District Court should have the power to close a premises which is found to be in breach of any of the building regulations.  The Fire Services Act already has the power through the High Court.  Does the Minister not consider that, in view of the tribunal's recommendations, this power should be given to the District Court?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>At this stage I do not propose to comment on this section of it.

      <P>I find that reply from the Minister quite extraordinary.  Is he not aware that the chairman of the Stardust Victims Committee has written recently to him as Minister in connection with these recommendations and has sought certain information and assurances in regard to these matters and recommendations of the tribunal's report in relation to building regulations, fire safety precautions and so on?  Can the Minister confirm that he has received that letter and whether he intends to reply to it?  Let me point out to him that the letter I am talking about and these matters here have nothing to do with the cases which the families are taking to the courts?</P>

As I have said, I am aware of the cases which are being considered by the legal profession on behalf of the Stardust victims and I have to be sure that any correspondence between me and any member of the victims will not be used as some sort of evidence in court cases which may occur.  When I get clearance from my legal section I will then consider what my reply might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to say that by his reply to me the Minister has indicated that he has not read that letter.  Is the Minister aware that these families, while rightly concerned with compensation, are perhaps even more concerned that a tragedy similar to the Stardust should never recur in this country and that as a group of families and victims they are deeply anxious that the recommendations of the tribunal report in regard to these safety matters&mdash;nothing to do with compensation&mdash;should be implemented?  They have written to the <Col N="1635" /> Minister asking him, in line with Deputy De Rossa's question, the extent to which the recommendations have so far been implemented and they have sought certain information and assurances in that connection.  I ask the Minister, if he has not already done so, to reply immediately to the chairman of the victims' committee. The letter to which I am referring has been addressed to the Minister and has nothing whatever to do with the legal matter of compensation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment the effect of the recent 5 per cent increase in VAT on building and construction output in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to estimate the precise effect on construction output in 1985 of the increase in the <Col N="1636" /> building services rate of VAT because of the boost to private housing demand likely to flow from the increase of £1,000 in the amount of the new house grant, and the substantial amount of building work not affected by the VAT increase in the commercial, industrial, agricultural and semi-State sectors.  Also, information is not available on the extent to which contractors may pass on the increased VAT charge in the form of higher prices or the extent to which total demand for construction work may be affected. Overall, I would estimate that if the total effect of the VAT increase will be to reduce the volume of construction output in 1985, it will be by a very marginal amount, say 1 per cent below the level that would otherwise have been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it is not satisfactory that he is not in a position to indicate to the House what the direct effect will be of the 5 per cent increase in VAT on building in 1985?  Is he aware of estimates others have had to make in view of the reluctance on the part of the Government to give information in this matter?  Is he aware of estimates by others that there will be a reduction of between 2,000 and 3,000 housing units per annum arising from increased costs resulting from the 5 per cent increase in VAT?  Surely he must agree that with an extra take of 5 per cent from the capital provided by the State there will have to be a direct reduction in the amount of building activity.  The reduction could be as much as £60 million when one calculates the additional 5 per cent.  No additional moneys have been injected by the Government to compensate for this increase, other than the increase in the new house grant from £1,000 to £2,000 which will have a minimal effect.  On what facts is the Minister basing his statement that a boost to private housing demand will result from measures the Government have taken, when all the indications in the marketplace are that there is a disastrous slump in the market and in house construction?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I would contend that <Col N="1637" /> the reduction in the standard rate of VAT from 35 per cent to 23 per cent and the reduction in VAT on concrete blocks from 23 to 10 per cent will reduce the cost of building work carried out by direct labour units in the public authorities and by private individuals.  This will result in an offsetting increase in the volume of construction output in 1985.  In addition the effect of the VAT increase on the demand for new private houses will be largely offset by the increased grant to first-time buyers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage of first-time buyers qualify for new house grants? The Minister is trying to give the impression that all purchasers of new houses qualify for this grant.  Is it not true that approximately 60 per cent qualify, while 40 per cent do not qualify?  How can the increased grant offset the cost to those people who do not qualify?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting that these changes will have a beneficial effect.  The reduction in VAT overall will bring a generally beneficial effect to the whose economy.  As a result of these benefits people may be in a better financial position to trade up in houses.  The furnishing of houses is made easier by the reduction in VAT and this may offset some of the increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  It is not as black a picture as the Deputy wishes to make out.  The figures coming to me do not reflect the dire situation he predicted as a result of the change in VAT.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 14 together.</P>
      <P>A reliable estimate of private house completions in 1985 is not possible at this stage.  The number of local authority houses completed in 1985 is likely to exceed the target of 6,000 houses annually set in <i>Building on Reality.</i> The Government's target of housing 9,000 households on waiting lists is also likely to be well exceeded.</P>
      <P>Details of private house completions for the years 1981 to 1984 are as follows: 1981, 23,190; 1982, 21,087; 1983, 19,245; 1984, 17,942.</P>
      <P>Details of local authority house completions in the same years are as follows: 1981, 5,681; 1982, 5,686; 1983, 6,190; 1984, 7,002.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that there is a very dramatic drop in the construction of houses, particularly in the area of private housing.  The Minister has not satisfied the House, as he said he would do when dealing with the previous question, as to the basis for his optimistic assertions regarding a boost in demand for and construction of private housing.  It is clear that since his Government came into office the private house building industry has collapsed.  It is very disappointing to hear the Minister say now that in the area of local authority housing the Government's target is to reduce the number by 1,000 completions on the number completed last year.&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to take that the Government's policy is to reduce the number of local authority houses this year by 1,000 on the number completed last year?  It is obvious, from the introduction of additional VAT and the position in the market-place, that the construction of private housing will also drop.  Is it not true that the level of housing on target for completion in 1985 now looks set to fall back to the figure achieved in 1973, of about 24,000 houses from a high of 29,000 houses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy always seems to make the most pessimistic argument. I did not hear any compliment about the 7,000 houses completed by local authorities last year, but of course I did not expect it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's target of housing 9,000 people on waiting lists will be well exceeded this year and the Deputy knows that a number of incentives were brought in to achieve that total.  I am also sure that he agreed with many of the things we did.  A number of factors combined to make a reliable forecast of private housing completions in 1985 impracticable but some figures are available now.  I am glad to say that the total completions of local authority and private houses were 10,887 in the January to May period of this year, an increase of 191 houses or 1.8 per cent on the period for 1984.  I am sure that the Deputy will welcome that increase despite the very bad winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has not informed me what the Government's estimate for house completions are in 1985.  It is important, in view of the fact that they are providing a very high percentage of the funding for housing construction, that we should know what the Government's estimates are.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>They will be well ahead of target in respect of the past four years with the exception of last year, which was a record year.  There will be a very high target and all the indications are that private housing is picking up.  For the first five months of this year, there has been an increase in the number of houses completed and I hope that trend continues. It is not possible to have details available regarding private housing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister give some more information in regard to the whole area of housing?  I understand that the housing completion figures are based on ESB connections and that is the final act before people move into a house.  In most cases those houses would have been commenced in 1984 and completed in 1985.  The number of people employed in the building industry is dropping dramatically and surely the Minister agrees that if there are fewer people involved in building houses there must be a drop in the number of houses completed?  The Government do not seem to be showing any great concern in this area.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Building on Reality, 1985-1987</i> does not propose a reduction in rates support grants for any of the years to which it relates.  In 1985 the combined rates support grants were actually increased by £7 million.  I am not in a position to give the provisions for these grants in 1986 and 1987 until the Estimates for these years are decided on by Government; but I can say that the increased global allocations for current expenditure in 1986 and 1987 in the Environment Vote, contained in table 7.1 of the plan, reflect increased provisions for these grants.</P>

      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1804" /> The purpose of the Bill, as Deputies will be aware, is to provide for equality of treatment for men and women in the social welfare code.  This is required in accordance with the terms of an EC directive adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1978.</P>
    <P>The main area of discrimination in the social welfare code concerns the entitlements of married women.  The Bill is a reforming measure which will remove fundamental inequalities in the code affecting married women even though I am bringing it forward a little later than the directive provides or than I would wish.  These changes will have a major impact both on the thrust of the social welfare code and on the operations of my Department on which they will place substantial new demands.</P>
    <P>So that our debate may be complete and that Deputies will have a full picture I should like initially to outline in detail the background to the Bill.  EC Directive 79/7/EEC on equal treatment was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 19 December 1978.  The directive applies to statutory schemes providing protection against sickness, invalidity, old age, unemployment and accidents at work and occupational diseases.  It does not apply to survivors benefits nor to family benefits and, naturally, the implementation of equal treatment does not preclude provisions relating to the protection of women on grounds of maternity.</P>
    <P>Social assistance, in so far as it is intended to supplement or replace similar social insurance schemes, is also embraced by the directive.  In accordance with the directive all sexual discrimination in such schemes whether direct, or indirect by reference to marital or family status, must be removed and the Bill now before the House provides accordingly.</P>
    <P>There are four distinct areas of such discrimination all of which have been part of the social welfare code for some considerable time now.  Firstly, certain married women receive lower rates of benefit than men and other women in the schemes of disability benefit, unemployment <Col N="1805" /> benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injuries benefits.  The married women so affected are those deemed by the social welfare system to be dependants of their husbands which, in effect, is any married women living with her husband.  Her personal entitlement to flat rate disability or unemployment benefit is £32.75 whereas the standard rate for most other beneficiaries is £37.25 per week.  Secondly the maximum duration of entitlement of a married woman to unemployment benefit is 312 days which is 52 weeks of benefit.  For most other categories it is 390 days, a difference of 13 weeks.</P>
    <P>In relation to unemployment assistance, married women are effectively debarred under existing legislation from applying for assistance.  In order for a married woman to qualify, either her husband must be dependent on her&mdash; and under existing legislation this means that he must be wholly or mainly maintained by her and incapable of self support by reason of mental or physical infirmity&mdash; or she must not be a dependant of his. In this regard the present definition of dependency provides that all married women are dependent on their husbands as long as they are living with them.  In practice, therefore, the vast majority of married women cannot apply for unemployment assistance.</P>
    <P>The final and most complex element of discrimination relates to the payment of increases in respect of adult dependants. Differences exist in the conditions under which increases are paid to men and women in respect of adult and child dependants and these differences are heavily biased in favour of men.  As I mentioned above, a married woman is almost always regarded as her husband's dependant and accordingly he qualifies for an increase of benefit in respect of her regardless of her employment status.  A married woman on the other hand can only qualify for an increase for her husband if he is invalided.  Neither of these definitions reflects dependency in a way which conforms to present day realities and they must be revised.  I will, however, return to this later in my speech.  At this <Col N="1806" /> stage I am mainly concerned to outline for Deputies the extent of the discrimination.</P>
    <P>The other aspect of dependency concerns the payment of increases for dependent children.  Married women can only rarely qualify for these as the children are deemed by the legislation to be normally resident with the father.  The expression &ldquo;normally resident&rdquo;, which Deputies will see in the Bill and elsewhere in social welfare legislation, is a mechanism to determine who should receive increases in respect of dependent children.  Where children are living with both parents the existing legislation deems them to be &ldquo;normally resident&rdquo; with the father rather than the mother.  To comply with the requirements of the directive this situation must be changed.</P>
    <P>These four areas describe the scope of the problem which must be tackled and the Bill now before the House does this in, I submit, a balanced and equitable manner.  I will deal with the provisions of the Bill and the manner in which equality is to be implemented later.  Before that however I would like the House to consider in a general way what exactly is meant by this concept of equality which we are attempting to introduce into the social welfare code.  This is necessary I feel because of the confused thinking which was evident, for example, in the contribution of the Members on the other side when a motion on equal treatment was debated by the House before Christmas.</P>
    <P>Firstly, let me remind Deputies that the present directive is the third in a series of measures concerned with equal treatment for men and women in the social affairs area.  The first of these, in 1975, was concerned with the application of the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women.  The next, in 1976, dealt with matters relating to access to employment, vocational training and promotion, and working conditions. These two directives in essence dealt with inequalities existing between the sexes in the labour force.  Finally, we are only concerned, in this third directive, with matters relating to social security <Col N="1807" /> schemes provided by the State.  Deputies may feel that women are still not treated equally in the labour market notably, though not exclusively, as regards levels of pay.  Such discriminations inevitably spill over into other areas.  Whilst such matters are a cause of concern to everyone and should be rectified we cannot address or redress all these inequities in a social welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>We are obliged by the directive to provide equality of treatment in matters of social security.  As I stated during the debate on the Opposition motion before Christmas, the principle of equality in the directive could be described as a neutral concept.  It must be applied unconditionally to all.  We cannot apply it on a selective basis seeking to have equality here and there but not in schemes or parts of schemes where it does not suit us.  We must remove the fundamental inequalities which exist against married women and give them the same entitlements as others.  However, we cannot go to the other extreme and implement equality by applying to them out-dated rules and definitions which are now inconsistent with the changed role of women in society.  The implementation of equal treatment provides us with the opportunity, not to say obligation, to review and, where necessary, replace some concepts and rules which we have maintained in the social welfare system through the years though the social situation they were intended to reflect has changed so radically.</P>
    <P>We are faced with a number of serious discriminatory factors in our system which we must eliminate.  But let me say here that the fact that person A is entitled to a benefit&mdash;of any sort&mdash;to which person B is not, does not necessarily imply discrimination against B.  Even where it does, it does not follow that the only or the best way to remove the discrimination is that B should automatically receive the same entitlements as A has got up to now.  A's entitlement may in fact be legally well founded but totally unjustified in the light of current facts <Col N="1808" /> and another solution may be called for. The resolution of inequalities can therefore be approached in a number of ways. For example where the discrimination relates to differences in the rates of payments, equal treatment could be affected by bringing all payments up to the highest level.  An alternative would be to equalise entitlements at the lowest level.  There are any number of possibilities in between.  The main point is that in implementing an equal treatment principle, the main aim must be a balanced overall result which reflects today's social and economic relationships and does not perpetuate those of another era.</P>
    <P>The discriminations we are faced with in the social welfare code, which are clearly contrary to the EC directive, do not lend themselves to a simple, straightforward application on a universal basis to both sexes of the rules or conditions now applied to one sex only.  While the elements of the discrimination in the code as it stands can be individually distinguished, they are all related back to the principle, which is embedded deeply in the code, that in principle married women are financially dependent on their spouses.</P>
    <P>The underlying concept in the code always has been that the husband was the breadwinner and head of the household and the person to whom the full benefits of the social security system should be available.  Consequently, the husband was also deemed by social welfare legislation to be the person to whom increases in respect of dependants should be paid. Any married woman living with her husband was regarded as his dependant and any children were also regarded as his dependants.  Only where the husband was incapable of self-support through mental or physical infirmity could the wife claim him as her dependant.  As a consequence, the husband almost always qualified for increases in respect of his wife and children, even where the wife was in employment or receiving benefit in her own right.  In such circumstances the needs of a married woman were not seen as being <Col N="1809" /> the same as those of a married man, leading to the inferior personal entitlements such as lower personal rates of benefit which I have just described.</P>
    <P>This approach was undoubtedly relevant at a time when it was most exceptional for a married woman to take up employment outside the home, but this, as we are all too well aware, is no longer the case.  In present circumstances it results in many thousands of married men being paid adult dependant allowances in respect of wives even when the wives are either in employment or receiving a social welfare payment in their own right on the basis of an insurance record built up when in employment.  If equal treatment were applied simply by giving married women exactly the same rights as married men now have, it would lead to ludicrous results.  For example, in the case of a married couple where both are absent from work due to illness, each would be given a separate entitlement to disability benefit with increases for each other and for any child dependants.  Even more ludicrously, it would enable a wife claiming disability benefit, for instance, to get an adult dependant increase in respect of her husband&mdash;and child dependant increases to boot&mdash;even though he was in employment earning a substantial salary sufficient to support the whole family in comfort on his own.</P>
    <P>Simply to extend to women the present conditions which men enjoy would mean that a wasteful and inequitable payment of adult and child dependant increases, even in respect of spouses at work in well-paid employment, which occurs at present, would be expanded enormously and would indeed reach gigantic proportions. For example, it would mean that family A, where both husband and wife had been at work but now had separate entitlement to social insurance benefits, would receive twice as much in weekly payments as family B, where only the husband had a recent employment record.  Equal treatment on those lines would cost about £100 million to implement. But cost aside, no Minister for Social Welfare could justify the allocation of very scarce resources to such an <Col N="1810" /> inherently biased and inequitable approach.  I am grateful that the review of the dependency concept which has taken place in the context of implementing the EC directive has highlighted the need to redefine dependency in economic terms rather than basing it on sex or marital status.  That is precisely what one of the key sections of the Bill, section 3, sets out to do.  This is a major step forward in the area of real equality but it has tended to be overshadowed by the agruments about the ins and outs of the new economic definition of dependency.</P>
    <P>The new economic conditions of dependency, which will apply uniformly to men and women, are based on the principle that one spouse will be regarded as dependent on the other spouse only if he or she is being wholly or mainly maintained by that spouse.  Under the provisions of the Bill, the existing presumption that any married women living with her husband is automatically a dependant will disappear and any person, male or female, who is in employment or in receipt of a social welfare benefit in his or her own right will, in general, not be deemed their spouse's dependants for the purposes of qualifying for increases of benefit.</P>
    <P>There are necessary exceptions to this general principle in certain cases which I will return to later.  A great deal of ill-informed comment was made about this proposal when it was first announced and, in outlining for Deputies the effects of the Bill, I will show just how wide of the mark this reaction was.  For the moment, however, I would like to complete the outline of the Bill's provisions.  The effect of this revision of the dependency conditions will be that there will be no <i>a priori</i> presumption about either married women's or married men's dependency on their spouses.  All married persons, <i>qua</i> married persons, will have the same status within the social welfare code.  Several changes in entitlement follow from this.</P>
    <P>Section 2 of the Bill, with the Second Schedule, provides that married women will have the same personal rates of disability benefit, unemployment benefit and <Col N="1811" /> invalidity pension as other persons, while section 7 provides for the payment of the corresponding higher rates of occupational injuries benefits.  In this case equality is being applied by a levelling up process, because it can be so done without creating any new forms of discrimination.</P>
    <P>Secondly, the discrimination in the matter of the duration of the payment of unemployment benefit is being removed under the provisions of section 6.  For the same reasons as in section 2, a levelling up approach is also being adopted here. This section also contains the usual transitional measure in such cases where the period of the payment of a benefit is being extended.  It provides that anyone whose benefit expired before the section comes into effect, and who would still have been entitled to benefit if the provision had always existed, shall be so entitled to the end of the now extended period.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, married women will be entitled to apply for unemployment assistance. The condition debarring them at present is contained in section 136 (3) (d) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981 and reference 4 in the First Schedule to the Bill provides for the abolition of this provision.  After the passage of the Bill, therefore, married women who are unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking employment will be eligible to apply for unemployment assistance on the same basis as other unemployed persons in similar circumstances. Unemployment assistance is a means-tested scheme and, in common with the other assistance schemes, in assessing means the income of the spouse is taken into account.  There would be no reason to depart from this principle in the case of the extension of the scheme to married women and the means test will continue to apply.  Section 13, to which I will be proposing amendments of a technical nature, contains the necessary changes to enable the existing test to be applied in the context of the new situation where either spouse will be entitled to apply.  Where both spouses have entitlement, the means will be aggregated and <Col N="1812" /> split between them and section 12 (2) contains the necessary provisions in this regard.</P>
    <P>Section 12 also provides a mechanism to ensure that the unemployment assistance scheme is not used as a means of topping up family income.  Because the personal rate of assistance is higher than the adult dependant's increase paid with this benefit an incentive could exist for non-working partners to apply for assistance in their own right when their spouses are on benefit.  They would thus be seeking to exploit the social welfare system to secure for themselves a higher total entitlement than the social welfare system intends for a family in their particular circumstances.  Subsections (1) and (4) of section 12 provide the necessary safeguards against this.</P>
    <P>The other change of significance in the Bill concerns the proposed new arrangements for dealing with increases in respect of child dependants.</P>
    <P>The removal of the automatic presumption of dependency and the treatment of married women in the labour market as in principle financially independent in exactly the same way as married men means that their role in contributing to the support of their children must be recognised.  At present only the husband can, in general, qualify for child dependant increases.  In future where one spouse only is in the labour force, be it husband or wife, that person, when claiming a social welfare payment, will qualify for the full increases in respect of children.  Where both spouses are in the labour force clearly the full increases could not be paid to either spouse when claiming benefit.  To do so would be to ignore the contribution which the other spouse makes to maintaining the household. The Bill provides that in such circumstances each spouse will have an entitlement to 50 per cent of the appropriate increases when claiming benefit. The relevant sections of the Bill in this regard are section 4 in relation to benefits generally, section 11 in relation to unemployment assistance and section 14 in relation to old age pensions.</P>
    <P>I am also providing in section 5 for the <Col N="1813" /> payment of increases for children and maternity allowance.  This is not required by the terms of the directive.  I am making this additional provision because prior to receiving maternity allowance a woman may have been in receipt of disability benefit and entitled to increases in respect of her children.  On becoming entitled to maternity allowance, therefore, it is appropriate that the level of her entitlements should remain the same and the new arrangement provided for in section 5 will achieve this.  Where the husband is in employment or in receipt of benefit, the payment of the child dependant increases with maternity benefit will be at half the standard rate in line with the principle I described earlier.  The inclusion of this extra provision demonstrates, I think, that my primary concern in implementing the directive is to achieve a balanced overall package which ensures that equality is achieved in a real and coherent way rather than in a piecemeal sense.</P>
    <P>These then are the main provisions to provide for equality of treatment.  The Bill contains a number of other changes but these are of a technical nature to permit the implementation of equality on the basis outlined.  I should now like to discuss the effects which these equality measures will have.  I should, however, mention at this stage that the Bill was circulated last December and the Schedule to it contains the current rates of benefits.  For ease of reference, therefore, I am using examples based on the existing rates of benefits.  These are, however, due to be increased from early next month in accordance with the provision of the Social Welfare Act, 1985 passed earlier this year.  We will, therefore, on Committee Stage need to amend the rates in the Schedule to this Bill.</P>
    <P>Over 46,000 married women on social welfare will benefit from the provisions of the Bill.  For a start they will be entitled to higher rates of benefit.  The vast majority would be on disability or unemployment benefit.  They will, quite apart from the effect of the other proposals entitling them to increases for dependants, each receive an increase of £4.50 per week at <Col N="1814" /> current rates of benefit.  Married women on unemployment benefit will have the duration of their benefit entitlement extended by 13 weeks.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, all married women will be eligible to apply for unemployment assistance subject to their being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment in the same way as other applicants and to their satisfying the means test.</P>
    <P>The most complex area in regard to equality of treatment is that relating to increases in respect of dependants and much of the debate on the equality of treatment proposals&mdash;and as I said earlier most of it ill-informed&mdash;has been concerned with the proposed new dependency conditions.  Demands have been made that all benefits must be levelled upwards and that no one should suffer a reduction in entitlements.  I have explained why the present conditions which apply to men cannot automatically be applied to women.  To do so would imply that in order to achieve equality all married men should automatically be regarded as dependants of their wives claiming benefit, irrespective of employment or economic status.  Equal treatment on these lines could not be defended and would require a massive injection of financial resources.  Equal treatment must, therefore, involve a revision of the present dependency conditions.  What the Bill does is not alone to define dependency in a non-discriminatory way but in a way which also reflects the concept in a realistic and genuine manner.  Only spouses who are wholly or mainly maintained by their partners will be deemed to be dependants and this will be deemed not to be the position where a spouse is employed, self-employed or entitled to benefit in his or her own right.  However, where the employment is part-time work of an insignificant nature or of inconsiderable extent &mdash; and this is defined under existing regulations &mdash; the spouse will continue to be regarded as a dependant and the full dependant increases will be payable.</P>
    <P>Married women will benefit substantially from this change.  In the case where <Col N="1815" /> only the wife works and her husband is a dependant &mdash; in a reversal of the traditional roles &mdash; she will now be entitled to the full adult and child dependant increases as long as her husband is not on benefit.  At present she can only qualify if her husband is an invalid.  This would give married women with three children in such circumstances a gain of £51.10 a week compared with the present provisions, in addition to the higher personal rates to which she would now be entitled.</P>
    <P>In families where both spouses are economically active there will be offsetting gains and reductions.  A married woman with three children, for example, whose husband is employed or on benefit would, when on benefit, gain about £13.50 per week in addition to the increase of £4.50 in her personal rate of benefit.</P>
    <P>Reductions in the entitlements of husbands will occur but such reductions are inevitable because the present adult dependency arrangement is not defensible. As I stated earlier, it gives a husband an increase for his wife not alone where she is in employment but even where she is entitled to benefit in her own right. In effect, the social welfare system is at present paying on the double for the same person.  This must stop in the context of equality of treatment.  There is no objective reason why such families should receive more from the social welfare system than families in which only one spouse is claiming benefit and the other spouse is not economically active.</P>
    <P>There are at present over 170,000 payments being made per week by way of increases of benefit in respect of adult dependants.  Almost all of these would be payable to married men in respect of their wives.  In the vast majority of these cases, however, that is where only the husband works, there will be no change whatsoever in his entitlements and he will continue to be entitled to full increases in respect of his dependants.</P>
    <P>The information at the disposal of my Department indicates that only in about 20,000 cases, out of 170,000, of married men in receipt of benefit with wives in <Col N="1816" /> employment or also on benefit would entitlements have been affected and I propose to take steps to alleviate the effects of the revision in many of these cases.</P>
    <P>Of this figure of 20,000, in about 12,000 cases the wife is in employment.  I would accept that in a small proportion of these cases the earnings of the wife would be very low and the reduction in the benefit entitlement of the husband would represent a substantial loss of income to the household.  I have indicated from the beginning that these cases were a cause of particular concern to me and when the Bill was being drafted I ensured that it contained the necessary power to enable me to provide alleviation in such cases. The new definition of adult dependant in section 3 enables the Minister for Social Welfare, by regulation, to specify other persons to be adult dependants.  I propose to use this provision to ensure that where the earnings of a spouse are below a specified figure she &mdash; or he for it will be applied equally to both sexes &mdash; will continue to be a dependant and full increases for dependants will be payable. This will be a permanent feature of the new dependency arrangements.</P>
    <P>The introduction of an earnings floor has operational consequences in that it would further complicate the payments delivery system.  Its effect on the overall level of service which the Department can give to the public is, therefore, a crucial issue at a time when staffing restrictions and a massive increase in the claims load are already combining to put the system under enormous pressure.  For this reason the rule must be simple and straightforward so that it will be easy for claimants to understand and will not increase significantly the amount of time needed to process applications and make payments which would disimprove the service to social welfare clients.</P>
    <P>Ideally an earnings rule might be graduated so that benefit is reduced as earnings increase.  This will simply not be possible and accordingly I have already proposed that the earnings rule should consist of a single cut-off point of about £50.  The possibility of introducing some <Col N="1817" /> element of graduation at a later date will be kept under review in the light of staffing and other constraints.  The introduction of this rule will mean that in about 3,000 of the 12,000 cases where the wife of a beneficiary is in employment no reduction in benefit entitlement will occur.  Of the remaining 9,000 cases, the wife will have earnings in excess of £100 per week in over half of these.</P>
    <P>I also expressed concern about the situation where both spouses are separately in receipt of social welfare payments. About 8,000 such cases are affected by the new provisions.  After equal treatment each spouse will have the full personal rate of benefit and between them they will have the full increases for children. It must be accepted that the social welfare system is providing fully for the family within the system and the level of benefits provided.  However, the net reduction of about £20 in household income compared with their present entitlement could represent a substantial loss and I propose to phase in equal treatment in these cases by an arrangement which will repay some part of the loss. Section 20 contains a general power enabling temporary and transitional arrangements to be made on a limited basis and I will be using this to make a special payment of £10 in these cases for one year or for the duration of the claim, whichever is the shortest.  No permanent arrangements could be considered under this heading as any steps that are taken are themselves in conflict with the principle of equal treatment.  All 8,000 cases will benefit from this arrangement.</P>
    <P>To summarise, of the total number of 20,000 married men with wives in employment or on benefit who otherwise would have been affected by the revision of the dependency conditions, I will be taking steps to fully or partially alleviate the adverse effects of the revision in over half of them.</P>
    <P>Debate on the alleviating measures should not obscure the main purpose of the Bill which is the removal of fundamental inequalities in the present system. The Bill in its entirely is a positive response to the provision of equal rights <Col N="1818" /> in the social welfare code for married women who pay the same social insurance contributions as other employees. They will, by virtue of the provisions of this Bill, now have the same benefit entitlements.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that in this measure we are providing for equality of treatment in an equitable and practical way.  Some 46,000 married women will gain substantially. Of the 170,000 married men in the system 150,000 are not affected at all and only about 20,000 would have stood to lose to the extent I have mentioned at this stage.  I am providing alleviating measures in about 11,000 of these cases which will wholly or partly eliminate such losses.  That is a reasonable balance.</P>
    <P>Some people may seek to get highly selective mileage out of this.  In this regard, for instance, I was disappointed to see that two of our more prominent trade unions have issued leaflets furnishing &ldquo;information&rdquo;&mdash; and this very deliberately I put in quotation marks &mdash; on the equal treatment debate.  Unfortunately the information is unbalanced in some respects and I regret that the leaflets may only serve to create unwarranted concern in the minds of people who will not be affected in any way by the equal treatment provisions.  In both cases the leaflets speak of the loss of the adult dependant allowance with little or no qualification as to the circumstances under which this will happen.</P>
    <P>As I explained above, this loss will occur in only a small number of cases and it will occur, unavoidably, because any revision of the concept of dependency which has existed in our code made necessary by equal treatment must result in some reduction in entitlements.  Those who would seek otherwise should at least make some attempt to define the concept of dependency they wish to substitute for what the Government propose and say clearly what would be its financial and other implications.</P>
    <P>In the case of the leaflet issued by the Federated Workers Union of Ireland reference is made to the &ldquo;halving of children's allowance&rdquo;.  It is unfortunate that greater care was not taken with the <Col N="1819" /> phraseology of the leaflet.  Presumably what the authors have in mind are the increases of benefits paid in respect of dependent children which will be reduced for some, and only some, beneficiaries. The leaflet, however, refers quite specifically to children's allowances which in most people's minds are the monthly allowances paid in respect of children to all mothers regardless of their or their husbands' employment or economic status.  These allowances are totally unaffected by equal treatment and the leaflet will, therefore, only cause needless concern to many people.</P>
    <P>The leaflet from the Irish Transport and General Workers Union suggests that it would have been much better totally to reform the social welfare system. This, however, they see as their long term view and in the short term they say that their ideal would be for the introduction of equalisation in a way that causes least hardship to families on social welfare.</P>
    <P>As to the long term, one of my first actions on assuming the position of Minister for Social Welfare was to establish a Commission on Social Welfare to review and report on the social welfare system having regard to the needs of modern Irish society.  I recognised from an early stage that a fundamental reappraisal of the whole social welfare code was required and I took the steps to see that it happened.  The commission are now well advanced in their work and I expect to have from them within a year a blueprint for the development of the social welfare services in the years ahead.</P>
    <P>As to the short term, it is evident from the proposals I have outlined that every effort is being made to introduce equalisation in a way that minimises hardship. Before leaving this question let me assure Deputies and others that my Department will be extensively advertising the changes resulting from equal treatment when the legislation has been enacted so that the public will know clearly their rights under the new provisions.</P>
    <P>To those who would see political advantage for themselves in the equal treatment debate I would say that I regret <Col N="1820" /> the reduction in entitlements which will occur in a small number of cases but it is an inevitable consequence of making married women and married men equal before the social welfare code.  As I told the House during the motion on equal treatment before Christmas, previous Ministers for Social Welfare were faced with the same problem and came to the same conclusion.  When the equal treatment directive was adopted by the Council of Ministers in 1978 the then Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Haughey, who is now the Leader of the Opposition, had a statement inserted in the Council minutes to the effect that the Irish delegation in accepting the adopting of the directive considered that nothing in the directive prevented arrangements being made to control dependency payments so as to avoid paying increases of benefit in respect of a spouse when that spouse is already receiving benefit or is in employment, or to control payments of increases for children.</P>
    <P>Quite clearly the then Minister envisaged that a revision of the concept of dependency involving controls on the payment of increases for a spouse in employment or on benefit in his/her own right would be required.  His policy in regard to equal treatment was exactly in line with the proposals I have now outlined.  This is the only realistic approach to implementing equal treatment and now that Deputies have had an opportunity of reflecting on the issues involved, I feel that they must conclude likewise.</P>
    <P>Before ending I should like to mention two further matters.  The first is very much related to the fundamentals of the equal treatment debate.  It has been raised by many commentators though it is not a matter which needs to be provided for in this Bill.  This concerns the application by my Department of the statutory condition requiring applicants for unemployment benefit and assistance to show that they are available for work. In the legislation this condition is phrased in a non discriminatory fashion and does not need to be amended in the Bill before the House.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1821" /> The purpose of the unemployment payment schemes is to provide income maintenance for persons who are involuntarily unemployed and who are available for and genuinely seeking employment.  In determing availability for work it is necessary to establish whether persons claiming payments genuinely wish to and are seeking to obtain work, whether commitments of a domestic or other nature exist which might limit the person's freedom to accept, or might prevent acceptance of, full-time employment which would normally be suitable, and whether restrictions are being imposed by the person on the kind, place or hours of employment acceptable, any of which would unreasonably diminish the prospects of obtaining work.  The determination of availability is made by deciding officers and appeals officers, in the exercise of their statutory functions, through the interpretation and application of any or all of these broad criteria in relation to the facts and evidence available in each case.</P>
    <P>In determining claims to unemployment benefit or assistance, deciding officers must satisfy themselves, in the light of those broad criteria, that the claimant concerned is available for work. To so satisfy themselves they must try to ascertain all of the facts of the case.  If there is any element of doubt in the matter, the deciding officers are obliged to query the position by asking the claimant any question which they consider may be relevant to the case.  Information may, therefore, be sought about what efforts the claimant has made to obtain employment since becoming unemployed, whether he or she has registered for work with the National Manpower Service, what type of work the claimant is seeking, whether there are any factors which would prevent the claimant from taking up work if it were offered and so on.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the controls that are now in place are not excessive and that by and large they are fairly applied.  In view of the concern which exists regarding the application of these measures, <Col N="1822" /> however, particularly that they are exercised in a manner discriminating against married women, I will be taking the necessary steps to ensure that in the future all conditions relating to entitlement to unemployment benefit, and all inquiries made in connection with these conditions, are applied impartially as to sex.  New guidelines will be prepared bringing to the attention of deciding officers and other staff the requirements of the EC directive that no discrimination either in laws or administrative provisions is permissible and that in applying availability for work criteria there must be no discrimination on the basis of sex, directly or by reference to marital status, in questions asked or conclusions drawn.</P>
    <P>Finally I should like to deal with the operative date of the provisions.  The deadline contained in the directive for implementation of its terms was, as Deputies are aware, 22 December 1984. High Court actions have been initiated by two married women, and plenary summons issued on behalf of more than 10 others, seeking to have the provisions of the directive deemed directly applicable and equal treatment in accordance with its provisions implemented from 22 December last.  The President of the High Court has submitted a reference to the European Court in Luxembourg for a preliminary decision and we must await the outcome of this case before we know where we stand in the matter.  In passing I might add that arising from the provisions of the directive a case is already before the European Court concerning the implementation of the directive in the Netherlands.  Clearly therefore we are not alone in the difficulties we face in introducing the concept of equality of treatment into our social security system.</P>
    <P>For the information of Deputies I should mention that while a directive is binding on a member state as to the results to be achieved it leaves open to national authorities the choice of form and methods to be adopted.  Deputies will realise from the outline I have presented that in implementing equal treatment in the Irish social welfare code we are dealing with a complex issue which could <Col N="1823" /> not be proceeded with until the national Parliament had discussed the issues involved and passed the necessary amending legislation.</P>
    <P>In this regard also the suggestion has been made in some quarters that some parts of the proposals involving the increased rates of benefit should be made retrospective to December last.  I do not think, however, that we should or could look at any parts of the equal treatment proposals in isolation.  The package is, as a whole, a balanced and equitable approach to providing equal treatment, involving the removal of the automatic presumption of dependency of married women and conferring on them in consequence full entitlement to social welfare rights.  As retrospection obviously cannot arise in the case of the elements of the package which involve reduced entitlements I see no case in principle for providing for it on the other elements.</P>
    <P>I hope from the information I have given that Deputies will now have a clearer understanding of the many complex issues involved in applying the principle of equal treatment in our social welfare system.  I am happy to bring forward this reforming measure and I strongly recommend the Bill to the House.</P>
    <P>Because of having agreed several months ago to attend a conference on network for the disabled between 5 p.m. and 6 p.m. this evening, I regret that I shall not be able to remain in the House to hear Deputy McCarthy's contribution but I shall be back about 6 p.m.  During my absence the Minister of State at my Department will be present.  I look forward to hearing the views of the Opposition on the Bill.</P>
    <P>The directive in question was adopted by the Council of Ministers in December 1978.  It had been around from 1976. What is involved is a very complex piece of legislation and I have been involved in that respect in the past couple of years. The explanation to the people as to what is involved is even more complex.  At times I have experienced great difficulty in explaining in any precise detail.  I hope <Col N="1824" /> my elaboration here today will be of some benefit.  I can assure Deputies that it is not my fault that there has been a delay of two years.  I have endeavoured to move as expeditiously as I could in that regard. Although the directive was adopted in 1978 successive Governments decided to put off the evil day.  I decided that we should apply it as a matter of urgency and have the Bill drafted, which has taken considerable time.</P>
    <P>In replying I hope I will have an opportunity to elaborate on any issues raised by Deputies in relation to the Bill itself which I trust will have a speedy passage through the House and, therefore, enactment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>The principle or concept of equality for men and women has been a basic commitment of this party since its foundation.  As a party we have consistently stated that we were totally opposed to discrimination against women whether that related to their status, their eligibility for employment or social security payments.</P>
      <P>It is obvious to all of us that there have been anomalies within the social welfare code which discriminated unfairly against women.  We recognise that such discrimination was fairly widespread, stemming from the traditional image of the family, with the father being seen as the breadwinner and the mother as the homemaker. The result was unfair treatment of women, especially those with dependants. It is obvious that this form of discrimination should cease and we are totally supportive of its abolition.  Article 119 of the Treaty of Rome clearly states that equal pay means not only equal wages or salary but also equality in any other consideration, whether in cash or in kind, the worker receives directly or indirectly in respect of work done from the employer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In December 1978 the Council of Ministers of the EC adopted a directive ordering the gradual application of equal treatment of men and women in socio-security systems.  I might stress the words &ldquo;the gradual application of equal treatment&rdquo;. It is unfortunate that all of these <Col N="1825" /> changes and their cost should be inflicted on the public in one fell swoop.  I believe it would have been better had those changes been implemented gradually over a number of years.</P>
    <P>As the Minister said, the House is aware that by 19 December last all member states should have abolished discrimination in statutory social security schemes covering illness, invalidity, old age, occupational injuries and diseases, accidents at work as well as family allowances.  The concept of equality, the rights of women, are something we in this party have consistently supported in the past and shall continue to do in the future. We believe there should be no discrimination against women in any area, whether in terms of social security or employment status.  Unfortunately, in relation to employment, there remains a considerable degree of scope for improvement.  I believe equality of status and benefit to be the natural right of any woman.  Neither should they be conferred on them in any patronising fashion such as seems to be the case on the part of the Government. It is clear to any observer that the Taoiseach and the Government have adopted a more than patronising attitude to women, to the extent that they endeavour to have them appear as special subjects, which is something many women resent.  They feel that their status and rights should be guaranteed without any such patronisation on the part of the Government.</P>
    <P>Since we have a statutory obligation to comply with equality legislation one would have thought we would have had the pleasure of welcoming its implications in the knowledge that women's rights would be assured under social security schemes without there being any financial damage to family incomes. However, it is now clear that in complying with the directive the Minister and the Government will cause enormous financial hardship to thousands of families at present in receipt of social welfare payments.  We welcome the fact that the implementation of the provisions of this Bill mean that women in receipt of social welfare payments, in particular married <Col N="1826" /> women, will receive the same payments as men, which is only right and just.  One also welcomes the fact that such payments to women will be of the same duration as those paid to men at present.</P>
    <P>Also welcome is the admission of married women to the unemployment assistance scheme, subject to means testing. When their eligibility is being determined I would hope that any such means testing would not be over-stringent, that women's availability for work would be deemed to be evidence furnished by them, such as the fact that they had registered, with say, Manpower, or that they could produce evidence from employers in their area that they had sought employment so that they would not be dismissed as not having tried properly to seek gainful employment.  If they can produce reasonably satisfactory written evidence that they have tried in vain to seek gainful employment there should not be any further interrogation.</P>
    <P>Until today the Minister had given no clear indication of what provisions the Government would make to compensate those families now in receipt of social welfare payments, where the unemployed or sick man with the working wife, or part-time working wife, would lose his dependency claim for his wife and half his dependency allowance for his children. Under these provisions it is obvious that unemployed men and their families will lose between £20 and £50 per week in social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>The Minister has told us that some 46,000 women are expected to gain extra benefit at a cost of £17 million per year to the Exchequer as a result of the Bill. These gains will be quite minimal.  The figure amounts to £4.75 per week.  The Minister has also said that, as a result of the change in the laws on dependency, 9,000 families will not be compensated for the loss of social welfare payments. The Minister has also said that, where both parents are on social welfare payments, as a result of the implementation of the Bill and the directive, about 8,000 families will lose £20 per week but that his Department will subsidise that loss <Col N="1827" /> with a payment of £10 a week.  Those families are already on the breadline and cannot afford to lose £10 a week.  This is a regrettable situation.</P>
    <P>The gesture made by the Minister today in order to pretend that the Government are overcoming the hardship and losses which will be incurred will not placate the public or the unions. This will not be acceptable.  This is another sleight of hand operation designed to improve the cosmetics of this dubious operation.  I appeal to the Minister even at this late stage to guarantee to all families dependent on social welfare payments that the dependancy conditions as they exist will be retained.  Will the Minister assure us that families will not lose income as a result of the implementation of the directive?  The Minister said there was nothing he could do, but he could change his mind very rapidly when he realises the impact these measures will have on the families concerned.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister realise that a loss of between £25 and £50 per week in social welfare payments will make the living standards of these families much worse? Does the Minister realise that families dependent on social welfare payments do not have enough to maintain reasonable living standards and that many are suffering grave hardship and are finding it almost impossible to provide the necessities of life?  This is due to the paltry increases they got over the last two and a half years.  They received increases on the one hand, but they were taken back when the Government halved the food subsidies last autumn and in the budget they followed that by increasing VAT on clothes and fuel.  Are the Minister and the Government oblivious to what is happening in the outside world, or do they care?  We all know of many families who are without the basic necessities in life.</P>
    <P>Since this Bill was circulated last December the Minister and the Government have done little or nothing to allay the fears of thousands of families on social welfare payments.  Because of their past record it was quite obvious that this Government would avail of the opportunity <Col N="1828" /> when implementing this directive to ensure that substantial losses would be suffered by many families dependent on social welfare payments for their existence. I am not surprised that the Government have taken this course.  For some reason best known to themselves this Government have adopted an anti-social policy towards underprivileged families. They have consistently ensured that their living standards will worsen.  They are deliberately reducing the income of the working class families.</P>
    <P>There has been a demand from the trade unions and other organisations for equality of treatment under the social welfare code for men and women.  We have learned today that 17,000 families on low incomes will have their incomes further reduced.  There is widespread confusion and uncertainty amongst the families.  I hope that, even at the final fence, the Minister will turn back and maintain the present dependancy allowance payments. It is no wonder there is fear and worry amongst people as the Government have consistently attacked the rights of the less well off and have made every possible attempt to ensure that the sick or unemployed got as little extra support from the State as possible.</P>
    <P>The Government have kept the increase in payments down to an absolute minimum, certainly far short of keeping in line with the inflation figure as they had promised before they came into office and as they have tried to pretend they have kept in line with the trend.  We will have no increase in payments this year, as we know, until well into July, yet in the meantime thousands of families are having to bear the increased cost of the VAT implications of the budget on clothing, footwear and fuel.</P>
    <P>The Government are so obsessed with fiscal rectitude that in their quest to find where cuts can be made thousands of families are now living under absolutely deplorable conditions with standards of living lower than they have been for years.  The reductions in the subsidies on bread, butter and milk, announced last autumn, were a savage blow not only at every category of social welfare beneficiary <Col N="1829" /> but also at many thousands of others on low wages who were already finding it impossible to make ends meet from week to week.  It is regrettable that we have had such a turn of events month after month.  The Government, particularly in this Department, have sought to impose extra hardship on the less well off sections of the community.  I do not think that anyone would be really greatly surprised if most of these contemptible decisions were made by a Fine Gael Minister in a Fine Gael Government.  Fine Gael have consistently practised this type of policy since their foundation, but since this Government came into office we have seen the rather tragic spectacle of a Labour Minister for Social Welfare doing Fine Gael's dirty work for them, at the same time posturing in his usual autocratic style, pretending to protect, within the Cabinet, the interests of the workers and their families.  It is contemptible and he should be ashamed of himself.  The Minister for Social Welfare, Deputy Desmond, I have no doubt will go down in history as the Minister who consistently since he came into office inflicted the hardest and cruellest blows on the working people.  I am sorry that he is not here because I do not like to say things about people who are not present.  He does not like people to say these things.  He is like Paddy, the schoolboy, who when pinched in school runs to the teacher and says, &ldquo;Sir, Johnny pinched me&rdquo;.  I am sorry the Minister is not here because he would probably do the same schoolboy trick.  If he were here he would know exactly what I am referring to.  Since he came into office he has inflicted the hardest and cruellest blows on the working people, the low income earners and those on social welfare payments.  He seems to take a sadistic pleasure in announcing his formula or plans or policies.  I regret having to say these things, but that is the truth and the public know it.  When the Minister was in Opposition, time and again he aspired to present a real and true social conscience but since he has come into office he has clearly divested his soul of any political socialistic principles that he might have had in the past, <Col N="1830" /> although I am beginning to doubt if he ever had them.  The Minister for Social Welfare is the classic archetype of political hypocrisy and duplicity and the people are ashamed of him and despise him for it.</P>
    <P>Shock waves are spreading throughout the community as this Bill's implications become clear.  Many families are worrying bitterly about what severe hardship will be brought on them as a result of the directive.  The public know that the Minister intends disallowing the adult dependant allowance for married men who are on social welfare if their wives are working only part time.  The £50 exclusion figure is paltry.  We know that should a father be ill, retired or unemployed he should receive full allowance for his children irrespective of their mother's financial position, but if this Bill passes through the House this will not be so and if the mother is in the labour force each parent will receive half the child dependant allowance if or when claiming social welfare payments.  There might be some reasonable rationale for this if women's earnings in general were equal to men's or if genuine equality of opportunity existed for women in the employment sphere.  As things stand, women's average earnings in industry are still only two-third's of men's earnings, and whilst there is a general pretence that there is genuine equality for women in the employment sphere, this is not completely true.  It seems now that such families could suffer major losses which will have absolutely catastrophic effects on their living standards.</P>
    <P>I have chosen deliberately as an example a figure which has escaped the Minister's cosmetics.  A man is on unemployment or disability benefit and currently receives allowances for his wife and four children.  His social welfare income would be approximately £116 per week assuming pay-related payments within that.  If his wife works and brings home an income of £80 to £85 per week after tax, the total household income there would be approximately £200 which is roughly the average male industrial wage earned and is hardly a huge amount <Col N="1831" /> for six people to live on.  This family do not get an exemption from their dependency status because the woman's income is over £50.  The effect of these proposed changes would be to reduce this family's income by approximately £42 per week.  In other words, the income of this family of six people would be reduced from £200 per week down to between £155 and £160 per week.  These are the facts.</P>
    <P>There is no point in the Minister's trying to pretend that severe hardships will not be imposed.  We cannot be convinced by him that a family of six people who had been getting £200 per week were in the millionaire class, enjoying high-class living, wining and dining.  They would have found it very hard indeed to provide for the basic necessities such as food and clothing.  These are the facts which are causing so much worry.  While the unfortunate people on social welfare payments worry about what is to happen, the Minister and the Government seem to be totally unconcerned.  It looks certain that after this Bill has been implemented many families on the lowest incomes will lose between £20 and £50 per week from their social welfare payments.  This is an appalling travesty of social justice.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister and the Government decided specifically to single out the unemployed, who would be included among this severely affected grouping.  The unemployed do not deserve to be singled out as a section of the community who should be harshly treated.  Many of those who are unemployed would give their very eyes for a job if one could be found or created.  We now have approximately 220,000 unemployed people.  I do not understand why the Government have let industry after industry, business after business close down.  Now they are taking specific discriminatory action against the unemployed. They halved the food subsidies and caused enormous problems, despite the supposed relief which was to be provided by the famous family income supplement. It was supposed to compensate families for the removal of half the food <Col N="1832" /> subsidies, but the Minister specifically excluded the unemployed from availing of the family income supplement.  One could almost infer that the unemployed were not entitled to any special help or to any decent standard of living.  It looks as if the Government and the Minister totally disregard the unemployed.  They are perceived as not worth looking after. It is as if the unemployed have been specifically chosen by the Minister and the Government for a very definite anti-social policy.  The Government do not appear to regard this section of the community as having the right to basic living standards.</P>
    <P>Prior to the last general election Deputy Desmond and his Labour Party colleagues issued an election document entitled <i>Where Labour Stands</i> which stated:</P>
    <P>The main parties propose massive cuts in public spending falling especially on health and social services and affecting the weakest in the community. Labour utterly rejects any policy that makes the poor, the unemployed, the sick, the homeless and the young bear the brunt of corrective measures.</P>
    <P>The famous Labour/Fine Gael <i>Programme for Government</i> stated:</P>
    <P>Unemployment, disability benefit will be kept in line with take home wages and salaries.  Expenditure on social benefits will be maintained in the light of inflation, so that even if a drop occurs in the immediate future in the purchasing power of better off groups in the community the living standards of the section of the community dependent on social welfare payments will be maintained.  Additional help over and above the standard increases will be provided for specially disadvantaged groups.</P>
    <P>How do the Minister and the Government reconcile those two statements with what they have done since the took office?  I would respectfully suggest to the Minister that if he has any shred of decency or honesty or any bit of integrity left or any part of a social conscience, <Col N="1833" /> he should do the honourable thing and resign, although at this stage it is almost too late since he has inflicted so much hardship.  The track record of this Government in the area of social welfare and health has been absolutely deplorable, as it has been in many other areas also.  Enormous hardships will be caused by the loss to any family of the adult dependants allowance of between £25 and £28 per week and the loss of child benefit of £9 or £10 per week.  The standard of living of these families will be reduced to a new low.  Little children will not have even enough to eat as a result of these cruel and inhumane policies.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Government have any concern for the principles of social justice.  They are completely out of touch with reality, especially when one examines the stupid little document they produced last year entitled <i>Building on Reality.</i> They do not know what reality is or how people live.  They have no concern for poverty.  They do not seem to realise that many thousands of people are living below the breadline.  The Government are now taking a step to increase further this economic deprivation.  It may be hard for some people to understand how a Government who once paraded themselves as a Government of care and concern can now behave in this way, but it comes as no surprise to those of us who know the calibre of the personnel within that Government.  The myth of an honest, caring Government has been clearly exploded.  It is obvious that the Government do not care for the people or for the country itself.  Members of the Cabinet have no shame left.  They are leading the people down a ruinous economic path and creating a climate where there is no confidence and no hope.</P>

      <P>It was disappointing to listen to Deputy McCarthy during the past half hour delivering an Estimates-type speech.  He must have used some notes for such a speech because while he did outline some of the people who would lose by the changes, he totally ignored the fact that successive Ministers such as Deputy Haughey and Deputy Woods had <Col N="1834" /> this problem on their desk but ignored it since 1978.  He went so far as to say that he regretted that this change was not phased in over the past three years but if he examines his own party's record I wonder how he can regret the timing of its introduction.</P>
      <P>I strongly welcome the introduction of this Bill.  There are some gross anomalies against women in the social welfare code. It is totally unfair that women who go to work, paying the same PAYE and PRSI and doing the same hours of work, should have less benefits by virtue of their sex and marital status, rather than any other factors.  It is clearly anomalous, discriminatory and unfair.  It is also unfair that women in the same circumstances should have less entitlement to unemployment benefit, no entitlement to unemployment assistance and that their entitlement to invalidity pension or to occupational injury benefit is based on dependency status.  It is also unfair &mdash; and the Bill does not address itself to this &mdash; that men are not treated fairly by comparison with the treatment of women in relation to pensions, deserted wife's allowance and so on.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that all Members of the House will wish to join with me in expressing our deepest sympathy to all those bereaved or who otherwise suffered loss as a result of the tragic crash of Air India flight AI 182 which occurred off the Kerry coast last Sunday morning.  A tragedy which claimed the lives of all 329 people &mdash; passengers and crew &mdash; on board the Boeing 747 is truly horrific and our heartfelt sorrow, and that of the entire Irish nation, goes out to all who have lost their loved ones in the disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Air India flight AI 182, a Boeing 747, Registration No. VT. EFO, <i>en route</i> from Montreal to London and destined for Bombay was in radio communication and radar contact with Shannon Air <Col N="1835" /> Traffic Control and the last voice contact with Shannon was at 0709 GMT (0809 local time).  At 0713 GMT (0813 local Irish time), the aircraft disappeared from the radar screen.  The position of the aircraft at the time was 51º N 12.50º W, which is approximately 100 nautical miles from the Kerry coast.  No distress message was received from the aircraft but at approximately 0803 GMT (0903 local time) signals were picked up from an emergency location transmitter.</P>
    <P>A massive search and rescue operation was immediately launched under the control of the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre, Shannon, involving a wide range of services, Air Traffic Services, the Air Corps, the Naval Service, the RAF, the Royal Navy, the US Air Force, the lifeboats from Valentia, Courtmac-sharry, Baltimore and Ballycotton, land based services such as Shannon Aeradio (Ballygirreen), Valentia Coast Station, the Meteorological Service, the Garda and the Southern Health Board.  An emergency plan for the reception of casualties was put into immediate operation at the Cork Regional Hospital.</P>
    <P>On being informed of the incident just before 10 o'clock on Sunday morning, I immediately notified the Taoiseach and other Ministers who might be affected. The Indian Ambassador was notified by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I assembled a team of technical and administrative officials from my Department, together with representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs, from the Office of the Attorney General and from the Government Information Service.  A team of officials was subsequently despatched to Cork Airport and an all-night emergency telephone service was opened up within my Department.</P>
    <P>Wreckage from the aircraft and bodies were located over a five square mile stretch of the sea about 112 miles southwest of Mizen Head.  Unfortunately, no survivors were found and up to midnight on Sunday 130 bodies had been recovered, most being brought to Cork Regional Hospital.  The search was continued <Col N="1836" /> through Sunday night by the LE <i>Aisling,</i> the LE <i>Emer</i> and HMS <i>Challen-ger,</i> supported by a Nimrod aircraft, and the full air and sea search was resumed at dawn yesterday morning.  While further wreckage was recovered, only one body was located; 198 victims are still missing and, with the hopes of finding them diminished, the search has been scaled back. However, the LE <i>Aisling</i> and LE <i>Emer,</i> with assistance from the Irish Air Corps, will continue to search.</P>
    <P>Investigation of the accident will be conducted under the provisions of Annex 13 to the Chicago Convention and will also, we understand, be subject to a judicial inquiry under Indian law.  While the aircraft was under the control of Shannon Air Traffic Control at the time of the crash, it was operating in international air space over the high seas.  Annex 13 provides that in such situations responsibility for the investigation of an accident rests with the state of registry of the air-craft&mdash;in this case the Indian authorities. Official representatives from India have already arrived in Ireland and have visited Cork and overflown the scene of the crash.  Preliminary consultations have taken place with officials from my Department and with representatives from the Canadian and United States authorities.  I had a meeting this afternoon with the Indian representatives and have pledged the full co-operation and assistance of my Department in the investigation. It is our intention that, subject to the agreement of the Indian authorities, a representative of the Department of Communications will participate in the investigation.  The United States, as country of manufacture of the aircraft, and Canada, as country of origin of the flight, are, of course, keenly interested and already have representatives in attendance in Cork.</P>
    <P>I understand from the Indian authorities that they are currently exploring with experts from the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada possibilities for recovery of the aircraft's &ldquo;black box&rdquo; from the ocean bed.</P>
    <P>While there has been speculation as to the causes of the accident, we must await <Col N="1837" /> the outcome of the official investigation before any definitive conclusions are drawn.  Nonetheless, given the speculation that has taken place, it makes it all the more important that the autopsies, forensic, ballistic and other tests be absolutely thorough in order to adduce every bit of evidence as to the cause of the disaster.  The work being conducted under the Chief State Pathologist in this regard will be completed as speedily as possible.  The Cork City Coroner is addressing the problem of identification of those bodies recovered which is a necessary prerequisite to the release of the bodies.</P>
    <P>Aside altogether from the present tragedy, the happenings of recent weeks in the aviation world have served to point up the vulnerability of the industry to acts of terrorism.  The civil aviation community has adopted comprehensive and resolute measures at international level to ensure the maximum safeguards against hijacking and other acts of terrorism&mdash;as evidenced by the Conventions of Tokyo, the Hague and Montreal &mdash; and the industry, at governmental level under the auspices of ICAO &mdash; the International Civil Aviation Organisation, which is the governing body for international civil aviation &mdash; and at airline level under the auspices of IATA, the International Air Transport Association, is urgently reviewing the world aviation security situation.  Because of the tragedy I was unable to attend a meeting of EC Ministers of Transport held in Luxembourg yesterday, but I know that the Council was both shocked at the disaster and, on a wider level, concerned about the safety exposure of passengers and air crews and of aircraft and airports to acts of terrorism.</P>
    <P>For our part in Ireland, I should say that we have ratified all three international Conventions and we observe a very high standard of security both at our airports and by the national airline.  We must exercise constant vigilance in this area and yesterday I directed both Aer Rianta and Aer Lingus to take any necessary additional precautions in the area of security in the light of recent events.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1838" /> As an island nation, tragedies at sea are nothing new to us.  A disaster on the scale suffered last Sunday, involving as it did the largest ever loss of lives in an air accident at sea, cannot but touch all of us very deeply.  The Taoiseach on Sunday spoke by telephone to the Indian Prime Minister, Mr. Rajiv Gandhi, and to the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Brian Mulroney, and conveyed his sympathy and that of the Irish people at the very tragic loss of life.  A personal message of thanks has been received by the Taoiseach from the Indian Prime Minister.  I have conveyed my sympathy directly to the Canadian Minister for Transport, Mr. Donald Mazankowski, and have met the Indian Ambassador through whom I have conveyed my sympathy to the Indian Minister of State for Civil Aviation.</P>
    <P>I believe that all in this House will, on behalf of the Irish Government, both Houses of the Oireachtas and the Irish people, wish to convey to the Indian and Canadian authorities, and to all who have been bereaved or have suffered in any way from the disaster, our heartfelt sorrow.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I would like to place on record my thanks and the thanks of the Government to all who assisted in the rescue effort &mdash; to the Air Traffic Control service at Shannon, whose diligence and professionalism speedily identified and pinpointed the incident, to the staff of the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre who set the rescue mission in motion and who were assisted by Shannon Aeradio and Valentia Coast Radio and by the Falmouth and Swansea Rescue Co-ordination Centres, to the Air Traffic Control Services at Cork and Dublin, to all those who participated in the search at sea, including the members of the Irish Navy and Air Corps, the members of the Royal Air Force and the United States Air Force, the Royal Navy, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, the captains and crews of other vessels that assisted in the search, to the Meteorological Service, to all of the staff at Cork Airport, to the Garda and the Army, to the staff of Telecom Éireann, to the staff of the Southern Health Board, and in <Col N="1839" /> particular to the staff of the Cork Regional Hospital who are dealing with the situation in a most professional way. It would be very remiss of me not to thank the administrative and technical staff of my own Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney General's Office and the Government Information Service.  Finally, I would also like to place on record in a special way the Government's appreciation of the kindness and generosity of the Cork people who offered all possible assistance to the relatives of the dead.  I am sure that the House will wish to join with me in conveying the sincerest thanks to everyone associated in any way with the rescue mission and in conveying to the Indian and Canadian peoples our profound sympathy.</P>

      <P>On behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party I wish to express sympathy with the Government of India, Air India and the relatives of the people who were killed in this dreadful disaster.  As the Minister has coupled Canada, the place where the flight originated &mdash; it is appropriate that he should do so &mdash; I wish to include the people who have a responsibility in Canada for the airports and security.  It strikes a chord in Ireland when we read that the majority of the people who were travelling were of the Indian diaspora.  It is something that is appreciated here that they were for the most part emigrants from India who were returning on holiday.  That is an added motive for the House, and the people of Ireland, to feel an empathy with them and sympathy for their relatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Comparatively recently I travelled part of a journey in the United States with a family that was returning to India on holidays.  The little girl who sat beside me emigrated at three years of age, had returned to India on a holiday at seven years of age and then, at 11 years of age, was joyfully returning to India as a result of the better economic circumstances which her parents who were with her had found in the United States.  This adds to <Col N="1840" /> the tragedy which we now have to deal with in the manner outlined by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Minister very wisely avoided any speculation as to what caused the accident. We know what the media are saying and we will have to await a specific judgment of what actually happened.  One of the possibilities indicates that our civilisation, our civilised modes of behaviour, are in danger.  I should like, with the Minister, to commend the Irish air and sea input into the recovery effort which has been taking place.  We had to change the word &ldquo;rescue&rdquo; for &ldquo;recovery&rdquo; seeing that nobody could be rescued.  In particular, the Cork Airport authorities, and the Cork medical people in general, deserve our commendation for their efforts and the work which must have been very testing and severe and called on all their resources without sleep or rest for a long period when the disaster struck.  The House should emphasise that in a world where media often belong in certain areas the efforts of a country where there is not such widespread media power should be highlighted by the House.</P>
    <P>I note that the Minister referred to the thoroughness with which all operations, particularly the medical ones, <i>post mortems,</i> inquests and so on, will have to be carried out.  It is important that this should be done thoroughly to give the people who will be assessing the cause of the disaster a proper scientific basis upon which to base their judgment.</P>
    <P>There have been reports that the Xray or testing mechanisms at the airport of origin failed for a period on that day and I would like the Minister to take into account that danger at our airports. There should be some kind of fail-safe apparatus to deal with cases like that.  We have considerable traffic through Shannon and Dublin and some international traffic through Cork.  I should like to commend the Minister &mdash; it may not have been necessary but it was the proper exercise &mdash; for warning the authorities to see to it that no opportunity is given to people who are evilly disposed to board airplanes here with arms, bombs, explosives or hand grenades.  With renewed sympathy <Col N="1841" /> to the Government and people of India and the relatives of the deceased, with a note of sympathy for the Canadian airport authorities and Government, I should like to support what the Minister has said.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of The Workers' Party I should like to extend sympathy to the Government and people of India on this dreadful tragedy.  The scale of the loss on life on this occasion was truly horrific, particularly as all of them were innocent people, including children, on their way to their home country.  Coming less than 12 months after the assassination of the Indian Prime Minister, Mrs. Gandhi, it is indeed a terrible blow to the Indian people.  If, as has been suggested, the disaster was due to a bomb being placed on the plane it is a shocking indictment of the lengths to which terrorists, especially those motivated by religious or racial hatred, are prepared to go.  Our people, North and South, understand the effects of terrorists bombs on innocent people and the brutalising effect they can have on society.  We sympathise in this regard with the Indian people.</P>
      <P>Anyone who was watching the film of the search operation immediately after the crash and the subsequent efforts to recover bodies and establish the cause of the disaster cannot but have been impressed by the way our emergency services reacted to the disaster.  All those involved, including the Naval Service, the Army, the lifeboat service, medical personnel and so on, deserve the appreciation of all Members.  I am sure, as the Minister stated, that a warm welcome and full assistance will be given to relatives of the victims when they come here.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of my contribution I was outlining the anomalies that exist for women in the social welfare code <Col N="1842" /> and welcomed the Bill which will remove them.  I understand that more than 46,000 married women will benefit at an original cost of £7.5 million and a subsequent cost of £8.1 million due to the transitional arrangements announced by the Minister following the publication of the Bill. Undoubtedly, it is a source of regret that although the directive was agreed by EC Ministers of Social Welfare in 1978 it could not have been brought in sooner. Ideally such a fundamental change in the social welfare code needs to be phased in over a six year period and the EC directive suggested that there should be progressive implementation.</P>
      <P>Because of the way the Bill is introduced, it will cause difficulty.  There will be no change in pay-related benefit, but the real benefits will be for wives who are social welfare recipients whose husbands are at work, that is, the wife on disability benefit, unemployment benefit, occupational injury benefit or in receipt of invalidity pension.  This woman will now get the maximum personal rate.  That will mean £4.50 per week for those in receipt of unemployment and disability benefit, £5.10 a week for those in receipt of invalidity pension, and £10.70 per week for those in receipt of occupational injuries benefit.  The other great advantage is that those on unemployment benefit will gain an extra 88 days.  This is only just because these women are paying their PRSI contributions.</P>
      <P>However, problems arise where both husband and wife are on social welfare. The proposed cutback in the adult dependant allowance is greater than the increase from the reduced to the maximum rate for the wife.  A man on disability benefit with three children will have a cut in his dependant's allowance of £24.15 a week.  Even if the wife gets an increase of £4.50 a week, that will not compensate for the cutback.  Let us take an elderly man whose children have left home.  His cutback in the dependant's allowance will be £27.60 a week, whereas the wife's increase may be only £5.10.  This means that families will suffer a cutback of between £15 to £20 per week, depending on the number of children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1843" /> It is estimated that 9,000 households will lose by the cutback in the adult dependant's allowance.  I understand the Minister's dilemma, which I think was faced by the previous Government because nothing was done about this since 1978.  If we just introduce the good part of this directive, which will give the wives the benefit of this £10 million, and retain the adult dependant's allowance, the total cost will be in the region of £100 million.  For example, it is not fair that a bank manager's wife in receipt of disability benefit should get the social welfare adult dependant's allowance for her husband. The real injustice will be as this affects lower income families.  I am not suggesting that the adult dependant's allowance should be given across the board, as Deputy McCarthy seemed to suggest, but in my opinion there are a number of cases which should be investigated.</P>
    <P>Other European countries have had difficulty implementing this directive, particularly Holland.  I appreciate that it is unrealistic and unfeasible to go the full way to meet the case Fianna Fáil are making, or not to make any changes in the adult dependant's allowances.  However, the potential hardship which will be caused for low income families merits action.  Perhaps in the regulations or on Committee Stage the Minister might consider making two changes.  He has made two transitional arrangements which will be of great benefit.  The first was that he introduced an earning floor of £50 a week beneath which the spouse's earnings would be disregarded.  The second arrangement is that he will pay £10 a week of the adult dependant's allowance. I welcome the Minister's efforts in this regard.  In my view this is the right approach but he might go a little further.</P>
    <P>I will now suggest modest extensions to what he has already outlined.  First, if the earnings floor is £50 a week, people earning just above that figure will lose out.  This will create a poverty trap for those earning between £50 and £100 a week.  I suggest that there be a sliding scale introduced.  Earnings beneath £50 <Col N="1844" /> would be totally disregarded; earnings between £50 and £75 would have 50 pence in the £ disregarded; and those between £75 and £100 would have 75 pence in the £ disregarded.  This would mean that the new floor limit would be £100 a week.</P>
    <P>Second, I suggest that the Minister increase the adult dependant's allowance from £10 to £15.  This extra £5 would make a great difference and it would not be very expensive when we consider that all benefit, with the exception of some aspects of disability benefit, is exhaustible. As people sign on at the employment exchanges their benefits run out after 390 days.  This means that this is not a permanent fixed cost on the Exchequer and people who have paid six months PRSI contributions in the relevant contribution year are entitled to these benefits. These are two modest arrangements which could be implemented at no great cost to the Minister.</P>
    <P>Section 4 deals with child dependant's allowance and it is proposed that this allowance be split.  For example, if a mother and father with four children are on disability benefit, the husband would be paid for two children and the wife for the other two children.  That is my understanding of the section.  This means that if the husband is at work and the wife is drawing disability benefit, they will be at a loss of 50 per cent of the child dependant's allowance.  In other words, they will be paid for two children because only one spouse is on social welfare.  This means bigger families will be hit hardest. If there are 14 children in a family, the parent on social welfare benefit will lose the dependant's allowance for seven children.  In certain instances larger families are more deserving of help.  I see a great difficulty with this section.  I appreciate the need for it but it would be better if the child dependant's allowance were not split for incomes below £6,000. In other words, if the husband is still at work and has an income above £6,000, then the 50 per cent rule should apply, but if his income is less than £6,000 there should be an income limit on the application of section 4.  That would be <Col N="1845" /> reasonable and would target the help towards the areas where it is badly needed.</P>
    <P>Section 12 particularly concerns me. It deals with unemployment assistance cases.  Of all the categories of social welfare, this is the area of greatest hardship, with the lowest form of payment and with no fringe benefits such as free electricity or fuel.  It is also subject to a very vigorous means test.  These are the real hardship cases, most deserving of help.  However, section 12 does not provide equal treatment. Take the example of a Mr. John Murphy and a Mrs. Mary Murphy, both working, say, in a hotel for three years which then closes down.  Both draw their unemployment benefit for a year and a half and both sign for unemployment assistance.  Under section 12, the position is that he can draw the maximum personal rate for himself, his children and his wife.  However, if she also signs she will get no maximum personal rate, which is being given in cases of disability benefit, occupational injury benefit and unemployment benefit.</P>
    <P>The whole purpose of the EC directive is to ensure that women, by virtue of their sex or marital status, are treated similarly to those with the same PRSI contributions and the same hours of work.  Married women whose husbands are on unemployment assistance cannot avail of the maximum personal rate and there is no point in their signing, except for credit signing purposes, and I appreciate that there is no change in credit signing here. Equal treatment would cost very little.  I ask the Minister to amend section 12 to ensure that women who are on unemployment assistance get similar treatment. I acknowledge that heretofore married women whose husbands were on social welfare could not draw unemployment assistance at all.</P>
    <P>There are other forms of discrimination of a more latent form against wives and mothers in the social welfare code. This Bill, in its spirit or in its detail, does not correct these forms of discrimination. I am thinking principally of women seeking to draw unemployment assistance or <Col N="1846" /> benefit, who are asked many questions about their availability for work which men are not asked.  We are all aware that women are asked to produce letters stating who will mind the children; men are not asked this question.  We are all aware that women must provide many letters stating that they have sought work.  It is not legislated for, but women are asked to go through more hoops and more red tape than men and this is discrimination. No section in the Bill deals with this area.  Perhaps, when concluding on Second Stage, the Minister could refer to these points.</P>
    <P>Similarily there is gross discrimination on the male side.  I am thinking principally of two areas, first deserted husbands who have no income and must mind the children because they cannot afford to pay anyone to mind them.  There is no such thing as a deserted husband's allowance. Similarly, there is an anomaly with regard to deserting wives who bring their children with them.  Not having been deserted, they get no allowance.  I was speaking earlier to the general Social Welfare Bill and this area is in an utter mess with regard to people who produce annulment orders, separation documentation or even divorce documentation from Britain.  These do not necessarily satisfy the criteria for deserted wife's allowance.  This matter needs to be cleared up.</P>
    <P>The other area of discrimination, more harrowing and more genuine in terms of the assumption that there is some element of culpability on the part of both partners if a marriage breaks up, is that of widowers.  They get nothing at all.  I know of one friend whose wife died in very tragic circumstances four years ago, leaving him to bring up three very young children.  All that widower can get is unemployment assistance.  Technically speaking, he is not available for work because he cannot afford to get someone to mind the children.  There is no equivalent for widowers of the widow's contributory or non-contributory pension.  I am not a legal eagle, but it strikes me that that is not fair play.  What is sauce for the goose is not sauce for the gander <Col N="1847" /> here.  Widowers are deserving of some form of small consideration, especially now that we are purporting to have full equality.</P>
    <P>There are other forms of minor discrimination of which the Minister should take account.  For example, when somebody is in a wheelchair, totally incapacitated, or dying, because his wife is living with him he is excluded from the free telephone rental allowance.  I do not know how he is supposed to survive without his wife living with him, but the regulations say that if the wife is in good health the husband is not eligible for this benefit.  It is very hard to explain the matter to such people.</P>
    <P>I can see in the years ahead a change in the employment pattern, both in the public and private sectors, by virtue of the fact that there will not be work for all.  There will be a mutual demand &mdash; on behalf of the unemployed and on behalf of some workers &mdash; for some form of job sharing, not particular to any sex.  On my recent canvas for the local elections, I met many nurses.  They said that the INO had made a submission to the Minister for Health seeking job sharing.  The fallout of job sharing might not be dealt with in this Bill.</P>
    <P>All the changes in the Bill are based on Class A1 contribution &mdash; in other words, one's equal treatment under unemployment benefit, disability benefit and so on is based solely on Class A1 contributions. Less than 18 work hours a week could be the upshot of much job sharing and it is the role of the Government to encourage job sharing, in order to distribute the existing work load.</P>
    <P>In the long term, I should like to see a section in this Bill which would make it possible to review the present approach. Generally, changes in Bills are made every 20 or 30 years, invariably during the term of office of a Coalition Government, and it is important that there should be some clause to ensure that by ministerial order a class less than A1 contribution could be considered for equal treatment.</P>
    <P>It is mostly women who have part time work.  Men still have the traditional role <Col N="1848" /> of the breadwinner and would be better off on the dole or on social welfare benefit than working 18 hours a week.  That is why there are so many nixers.  I should like the Bill to encompass changes in work patterns by virtue of work sharing.</P>
    <P>This is a limited debate and there are a large number of speakers.  I welcome this Bill and request the Minister and the Department, irrespective of administrative or financial difficulties, not to delay further.  There has been a long delay with regard to this Bill and we have had no clear enunciation of an implementation date and no talk of retrospection.  I should like an implementation date of 1 October of this year and retrospection to the date of the increase in social welfare payments in July 1985.  That would be fair and clear cut and it would be a gesture of good faith.</P>
    <P>It appears from statements made by Sylvia Meehan and others in the Employment Equality Agency that the good work of this Bill has been somewhat distorted and misrepresented.  It would be a gesture of goodwill to have an element of retrospection.  We would also like a clear commitment with regard to the date of implementation.</P>
    <P>In general I welcome the Bill.</P>

      <P>While I agree with the principle of the Bill, which is to provide for equality of treatment for men and women with regard to the social welfare code, there are many aspects of the Bill about which I am not happy.  It will pose grave problems to implement the measure and the Department of Social Welfare will require extra accommodation and personnel to operate it satisfactorily. If the provisions of the Bill are not implemented satisfactorily it will be a failure. As far as I can see it will either be a complete success or a failure &mdash; there is no in-between.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill provides for payment of unemployment assistance to married women and I am most anxious that this provision should be operated as efficiently as possible. However, I have grave doubts about the capacity of the Department, as at present constituted, to implement the <Col N="1849" /> Bill.  At present the entire unemployment system as it is operated in the Department has broken down and there are undue and unnecessary delays in deciding applications and appeals.  I do not understand why it sometimes takes up to two to three months to decide on an application for unemployment assistance. Neither can I understand why it can take up to six months in respect of an appeal against a decision of a deciding officer to reduce, discontinue payment or not to grant unemployment assistance to an applicant.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Department of Social Welfare are inadequately staffed so far as deciding officers and appeals officers are concerned.  Many people in South Kerry have encountered long delays in dealing with their applications. The whole scheme requires a review, primarily to ensure that there are no more long delays.  I would consider a delay that is longer than three weeks to be an undue delay with regard to an application for unemployment assistance and a period in excess of three or four weeks in relation to an appeal would constitute an undue delay in my opinion.  I should like a deciding officer to be based in each exchange. It is only by decentralisation of the decision-making process at that level&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I can see problems with regard to getting decisions within a reasonable time for married women who may apply for unemployment assistance. I agree fully with the proposal to provide this payment to married women who are entitled to it.  However, I should not like these applications to be added to the large numbers of undecided applications already in the exchanges.  Neither should I like to see the applications being trapped in the large number of appeals being considered at present in the Department.  I suggest to the Minister that the number of appeals officers and deciding officers be increased substantially. In my view there should be a deciding officer in each exchange.</P>
      <P>Under existing legislation married women are effectively debarred from unemployment assistance.  In order for a married woman to qualify her husband must be dependent on her.  This means he must be wholly or mainly maintained by her and incapable of self support by reason of mental or physical infirmity. Alternatively, the wife must not be a dependant of her husband.  At present married women can only rarely qualify for unemployment assistance in respect of children as they are deemed to be normally resident with the father.  Therefore, it is necessary to change that part of the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>In his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>To simply extend to women present conditions which men enjoy would mean that a wasteful and inequitable payment of adult and child dependant increases, even in respect of spouses at work in well-paid employment, which occurs at present would be expanded enormously and would indeed reach gigantic proportions.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that it would involve much additional expenditure.  I should like to see the scheme extended to women and equal pay for men and women in respect of adult and child dependants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unemployment assistance is a means tested scheme and, in common with other assistance schemes, the income of the spouse is taken into account.  I agree with <Col N="1851" /> this, but in relation to self-employed people and husbands on very low incomes a certain proportion of their income should be excluded.  It is very difficult to say where the line should be drawn but it should be specified in regulations. Section 12 provides a mechanism which will ensure that unemployment assistance is not used as a means of topping up the family income.  Here is a glorious opportunity to provide an increase through the unemployment assistance scheme to improve the family income.  I can understand the provision being made whereby increases are not granted in relation to wives of self-employed husbands or husbands of self-employed wives but exceptions should be made by way of regulation for those on very low incomes.</P>
    <P>I am glad to see payment of increases for children with maternity allowance. This is not required by the terms of the directive but there has been a demand for this for some time.  The Minister said that over 46,000 married women on social welfare will benefit from the provisions of the Bill.  How was this figure reached and how accurate is it?  He also said that all married women will be eligible to apply for unemployment assistance subject to their being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment in the same way as other applicants and to their satisfying the means test.  Some criterion should be established whereby those genuinely seeking work could be identified.  This has been a bone of contention at oral appeal hearings and between appeals officers and applicants for unemployment assistance.  If an applicant for unemployment assistance is registered with the local manpower office and is in touch with them on a weekly basis and provides certificates from at least three employers that he or she is genuinely seeking employment such evidence should be taken as clear proof that they are seeking work.  Regulations should be drawn up in the manner I have suggested.</P>
    <P>The Minister seems to be concerned that the system in the Department might break down if too many people are <Col N="1852" /> brought within the ambit of the scheme. In about 20,000 cases of married men in receipt of benefit with wives in employment or also on benefit their entitlements would be affected and the Minister proposes to take steps to alleviate the effects of the revision in many of these cases. Measures should be taken to ensure that is not necessary.  A section should be inserted in the Bill stating that married couples should not be in receipt of an income from the Department of Social Welfare which would be less than what they had before this Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>This legislation is the most complicated I have come across during my 19 years in the House.  I have met Deputies who say they found it easier to understand many a Finance Bill.  I agree with the proposal that details of the Bill should be published in the newspapers in simple terms and without any ambiguity.  This is very important from the point of view of those on unemployment assistance and for married men and women who may want to get their own portion of the assistance. It must be spelt out clearly so that the public will understand what is involved and assess, before they make an application, the full implications of such application if granted.  That is important. The Minister said he would provide alleviating measures in about 11,000 cases which would wholly or partly eliminate losses.  He said that was a reasonable balance.  It should not be necessary to provide alleviating measures.  These measures should be enshrined in the legislation.  The Minister admits that there will be a reduction in entitlement in a small number of cases and that it is an inevitable consequence of making married men and women equal before the social welfare code.  If that is the intention it should not be necessary to have a reduction in entitlements.  The Bill must be strengthened considerably in that regard.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that deciding officers must satisfy themselves in the light of certain broad criteria that a claimant is available for work.  The criteria must be laid down and, as I have suggested, it <Col N="1853" /> should be mainly that the applicant prove he is in close touch with his local manpower office and that he should provide a letter from each of two or three employers in his area certifying that he is genuinely seeking work.  Such documentation should be regarded as absolute proof of the applicant's genuineness in seeking work.  However, I am concerned that if the criteria is too strict this measure will be used as a device to remove from the live register people who should be on it and who should be in receipt of employment assistance.  None of its provisions should be used for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I agree generally with the principle of the Bill, which is the provision of equality of treatment in the social welfare code for men and women, but I am concerned about certain provisions especially in the context of the efficiency of the Minister and his Department in considering applications from married women for unemployment assistance and in deciding on appeals from those aggrieved by the decisions of appeals officers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this opportunity to express my support for the Social Welfare (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill, 1984, which, will give effect to the EC directive on equal treatment for men and women in matters of social security. In giving equal rights and entitlements to men and women in the schemes of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, old age and retirement pensions, invalidity pensions and occupational injuries benefits, it will eliminate the remaining areas of our social welfare code which are discriminatory and these all relate to the entitlement of married women.  Married women, at present, receive lower rates of benefit than men, can only receive unemployment benefit for a maximum of 312 days as against 390 days generally and have conditions applied to them in the matter of adult and child dependants which are considerably less favourable than those applying to married men.  Also, married <Col N="1854" /> women will be entitled to apply for assistance in the same way as other unemployed people who are capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment.  Up to this they would not have been eligible unless they were living apart from and not being supported by their husbands.  About 46,000 married women will benefit from the higher rates of payment and enhanced entitlements which will be available on the introduction of the equal treatment measures: the vast majority would be on disability or unemployment benefit and they stand to gain increases of the order of £4 to £5 per week, quite apart from the effects of the other proposals enabling them to qualify for increases for dependants.</P>
      <P>However, the most significant aspect of the Bill for women in general is the revision of the concept of dependency that it introduces.  The general framework of social welfare schemes has remained unchanged for a long time and the underlying concept with it, that the husband was the breadwinner and head of the household and the person to whom the increases of benefit in respect of his wife and children should be paid.  Any married woman living with her husband was regarded as his dependant and any children were also regarded as his dependants whether the wife was working and contributing to their support.  It was only where the husband was incapable of self-support through mental or physical infirmity that the wife could claim him as her dependant.</P>
      <P>It is easy to see how this approach was appropriate and legitimate in times past when it was most exceptional for married women to take up employment outside the home.  Today, it results in many thousands of married men being paid adult dependant allowances in respect of wives who are either in employment or receiving a social welfare payment in their own right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Apart from the necessity to apply genuine and uniform criteria of dependency in all cases to avoid what in effect amounts to double payments, such criteria are also desirable in ensuring that women have equal status in all areas of <Col N="1855" /> society, particularly in those in which the State plays an influential role.</P>
    <P>The decision by the Government that, in future, adult dependant increases will be payable only in respect of spouses who are being wholly or mainly maintained by beneficiaries is an important milestone not only for the many married women who currently stand to benefit directly but for all married women.  As the Working Party on Women's Affairs and Family Law Reform, which I chaired, commented in their report <i>Agenda for Practical Action,</i> which was recently published:</P>
    <P>The practical substance underlying the principle of equal treatment is recognition that the concept of a husband as the sole or invariable breadwinner of the family is no longer one that applies universally in our society.</P>
    <P>Equal treatment in statutory social welfare schemes is, therefore, particularly welcome as a coming to terms with what is anyway a fact of life as well as constituting an important step in the attainment of equal opportunities generally for women.</P>
    <P>In the interim report from the European Commission on the application of the directive, the Commission expressed the view that the &ldquo;head of household&rdquo; notion was incompatible with the principle of equal treatment and the abolition of discrimination and that the principle carried the implication of some sort of hierarchy between a married couple which was no longer in line with either the realities of society or the provisions of civil law.</P>
    <P>In order to maximise on the benefits which the legislation is bringing, I would urge the Minister to ensure that the married women who now apply for assistance under it will be subjected to the same criteria of assessment which male applicants have to undergo.  There is evidence at present that women applicants for unemployment assistance can be the victims, in certain circumstances, of a presumption that the female spouse is unavailable for employment where she has children.</P>
    <P>The effects of the introduction of the <Col N="1856" /> new definition of dependency will be that in the vast majority of cases, that is, where only the husband works outside the home, there will be no change whatsoever in entitlement.  But in the case where only the wife works outside the home, she will now be entitled to the full adult and child dependant increases so long as her husband is not on benefit and this could give married women with three children a gain of £51.10 a week compared with the present provisions.  She would, in addition, receive an extra £4.50 on her personal rate.  There will be offsetting gains and reductions in entitlement where both husband and wife are economically active but these will result in a more equitable balance of entitlements than heretofore.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the new approach, though very desirable and commendable, will result in a loss for some families. These are cases where both husband and wife are at present separately entitled to social welfare payments.  The overall net loss for such families will be about £20 per week.  A worse situation and one about which I would be even more concerned, as Minister with responsibility for Women's Affairs, is where the husband is on benefit and the wife is presently working.  For a couple in this situation with three children the legislative proposals before us could result in a reduction in flat rate benefit of up to £37 per week. The effect on that household of the reduction would depend largely on the wife's income from her employment.  But if she is low paid the prospect of such a loss would be daunting and also she might find that by continuing to work she would be only marginally better off than if she were on benefit.</P>
    <P>Any spouse who works more than 18 hours per week, or fewer than 18 hours per week but who is mainly dependent on that income is excluded as a dependant under the Bill.  So, in addition to spouses who are in low paid employment, spouses in part time employment in excess of 18 hours, or who are mainly dependent on that part time work, might be tempted to surrender their employment if the other spouse is receiving unemployment or <Col N="1857" /> disability benefit.  There might be women in full time employment who are tempted to opt for a part time employment of under 18 hours a week.  I would recommend to anyone contemplating such action to take full account of the other benefits which they will be surrendering and not just assess their situation in terms simply of economic gain or loss.  Conditions of employment attaching to full time work are substantially better than those for part time work.  The short term monetary gain might not justify the fact that the employee is now outside the scope of certain protective legislation and, after a length of time, will also be ineligible for unemployment benefit and other security.</P>
    <P>There might also be a tendency to drift into the black economy where remuneration would not be cognisable by the State. For similar reasons, I would strongly advise against anyone taking this course because, apart altogether from the moral aspect and the damage which it does to society in general, there is a very real danger for the person themselves in that such income is, invariably, precarious and unreliable.</P>
    <P>It is hard to assess the number of married women who might be open to influence in the manner which I have just described.  In research data from a report which I have commissioned only 44 per cent of the married women at work were in full time jobs, and nearly 40 per cent of all female part time labour was accounted for by catering and cleaning industries and retail businesses.  Considering the notoriously low play levels in these areas, it can be seen that a substantial number of workers might be influenced.</P>
    <P>I greatly welcome, therefore, the Minister's proposal to use the enabling powers contained in the Bill to mitigate the effects of the equal treatment provisions in cases where loss will occur.  I understand that it is the Minister's intention to make regulations providing that where a spouse's earnings are below a figure of about £50 a week he or she will continue to be regarded as a dependant of the spouse who is claiming benefit, that no loss of benefit will follow and that he also <Col N="1858" /> intends to make a transitional payment of about £10 a week in cases where both spouses are separately drawing benefit when the new dependency conditions are introduced.</P>
    <P>I also understand that about 20,000 families will be affected by the revised dependency conditions, that about 8,000 of these will benefit from the transitional payment and a further 3,000 will suffer no loss as the wife will continue to be regarded as a dependant.  The remaining 9,000 or so will suffer some loss of income but I am assured by the Minister that in over half of these cases the wives have earnings of over £100 a week.</P>
    <P>Whatever the difficulties of the implementation of this Bill it is important to remember that its purpose is to bring about a more equitable situation.  I welcome it not only for the 46,000 women who stand to benefit immediately but as another step forward in the road to equality of opportunity and status for women in every segment of our society.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the belated introduction of this Bill.  The Minister has expressed his concern at our having waited so long for it.  This Bill is based on an EC directive of which we were aware at national and European level for over six years.  I can understand the Minister's dilema when confronted with the task of bringing about this equality legislation.  What worries me is that while administration after administration were aware of this directive and of the huge discrimination against married women with regard to work and social welfare contributions, nothing was done within this Legislature to bring about more equity and justice for married women. These women were not seeking any thing more than that being given to everybody else, which was that, having paid their contributions like all other workers, they would not be discriminated against at every level.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were being denied benefit to which they had contributed as workers. Not alone were women denied their right financially by the way of benefit, in that they had paid their full contributions as <Col N="1859" /> workers, but such discrimination was allowed to prevail to the extent that women were not regarded as workers in their own right but rather as dependants only, and that in the eyes of society and of the law.  I should like to record my disappointment that successive administrations did not take the necessary steps to introduce such legislation.  I heard Members deplore the fact that such discrimination was allowed to prevail with regard to women in our society although women's organisations, women trade unionists and, in fairness, some male workers also had lobbied continuously.</P>
    <P>Even when the deadline for the implementation of the directive had been reached, presumably because nothing had been prepared over the years, the implications for the present Minister were even greater.  Had there been an attempt made to cope with the problems over the years, then the delay in the introduction of this Bill would not have occurred.  Neither should I like to think that we would constantly rely on EC directives to ensure that women here are given equal status and rights.  I am sure other Members would join me in saying that it is a shame that we must await a European directive to force us to remove obstacles and discriminations against half of our population.</P>
    <P>The provisions of this Bill raise many questions in the area of women at work and woman's wages generally.  I am aware that the Minister has been conscious of the difficulties with regard to low income families brought about by the introduction of this Bill.  I would hope that its introduction would highlight two areas of great concern to all of us in this House, the first being the number of families living on the breadline where the granting of equality to women would affect such low income families because such women are earning so little outside the home or form part of households living on social welfare.  This highlights something we must be constantly watchful of with regard to the creation of a more just society.  We should strive constantly <Col N="1860" /> not to have families existing on such a borderline that when we introduce legislation to effect equality or remove discrimination people find themselves worse off or in a poverty trap.</P>
    <P>I hope all of us will continue to raise the question of the low earnings of women, who work at home.  Some women's earnings are so low they find they are placed just above the borderline of subsidisation or of having a decent wage in their own right.  A husband at present in receipt of a dependent wife's allowance may well bring such pressure to bear on his wife that if they are going to be worse off or only marginally better off the wife may be psychologically forced to leave her work rather than deprive the head of the household and the household itself of that allowance.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister is working toward the concept of social welfare contributions that will allow people, regardless of the number of hours they work per week, contribute on a percentage or proportionate basis, so that they will be social welfare contributors and recipients in their own right.  Part of the trap in which women are caught with regard to opportunities for work is that employers consistently employ women in jobs where they are deliberately kept working below a certain number of hours so that they cannot become social welfare contributors. Not alone does it not give them the security and full regard and status of a worker, but it also has huge implications in that they do not perhaps receive sickness pay and they do not have benefits if and when they are laid off for any length of time.  All of this contributes to the low image and self-esteem women are asked to accept.</P>
    <P>I hope this debate will bring home to people the principle of this Bill which is that, regardless of the implications and the complications for certain areas under the present social welfare code, and regardless of the history of our social welfare code which labelled women as dependants until now, women workers should get exactly the same rights as others.  This is not an attack on male householders and we are not tearing <Col N="1861" /> down the social fabric of society.  Too often any advance made by women has been turned into such an implication.  We must never forget that the principle here is to restore a right to women which they have been denied.  They have been penalised financially and psychologically for years.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State for Women's Affairs referred to the fact that by consistently keeping women working at a low level both in relation to hours at work and in relation to social welfare, and by making it difficult for them to be recipients of social welfare benefits, we are forcing more and more women into the black economy.  This is of no help to women because it means they can be and are exploited, and it does not help the country.  We should encourage every worker to make a full contribution both in tax and social welfare contributions.</P>
    <P>The Minister said we must remove the fundamental existing inequalities suffered by married women and give them the same entitlements as others.  In doing that, we must make sure that all the other overlapping discriminations and inequalities are removed.  The Minister was right to refer to the fact that for many years, as more and more married women moved out into the workforce, they found themselves caught in the situation in which it has been increasingly difficult to prove their entitlements for the discriminatory benefits allowed to women.</P>
    <P>There was an acceptance by people questioning them that married women, especially married women with children, regardless of the ages of the children, were not genuinely seeking employment. I am sure the Minister is aware that there was this type of questioning and that until recently a separate form of questioning was used for married women which insisted that married women with children could not be genuinely looking for employment.  We all know cases where women who had been working for ten, 15 or 20 years were questioned in a way which suggested that they were not genuinely looking for employment because they were married and their place was in the home and their role was to bring up <Col N="1862" /> children.  When a woman appealed the decision she was sometimes required to place written evidence before a tribunal or the oral evidence of somebody, almost swearing that that person was looking after her children.</P>
    <P>It is a most gratuituous insult to women and to mothers to assume that they would be irresponsible, and that they would race out to take jobs without first ensuring that a responsible person was minding the children.  That is a huge insult to women especially when one considers the obstacles women have to overcome when they work outside of the home.  There is an attitude that it is all right for women to work in low paid jobs as long as there are plenty of jobs, but that they should remember their place and get back to the kitchen as soon as the jobs become scarce.  It is of interest that the only time we started to object to married women working outside the home was when they got an opportunity, because of the lifting of the marriage bar, to stay in jobs where their skills, education and training guaranteed them a higher rate for the job than that paid for unskilled labour.</P>
    <P>Even in the midst of our huge recession and the backlash against women working, I do not see huge queues demanding that women give up their jobs as cleaners in the service industries and in areas that are skilled but which down through the years have been valued as women's work and therefore low paid.  When men start to move into these areas and start trying to improve conditions and levels of payment, we will see some kind of equality of opportunity. I would like the legislation to concentrate on that fact and reinforce what the Employment Equality Act hopes to do, which is to ensure in the area of social welfare contributions that a woman should not be questioned differently from a man with regard to her gender, domestic responsibility or career opportunities. When we do this &mdash; I wish interviewers would realise this &mdash; we are contravening the Employment Equality Act.  Unfortunately, a great number of employers and employment agencies do <Col N="1863" /> not seem to have recognised that, therefore they feel that not alone can they treat women as having less right to work but women should not be allowed to work at all if they have children.  Up to now when we allowed them work we made sure that they did not get the same benefits as men from the various contributions they made as workers.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the loyal service given by employees of Irish Shipping to the people of Ireland until the liquidation of that company in November, 1984, calls on the Government to:</P>
      <P> (i)  pay adequate compensation to the staff of Irish Shipping of six weeks salary per year of service; and</P>
      <P>(ii)  restore the pensions of all former Irish Shipping staff to their pre-liquidation level; </P>
      <P>and further calls on the Government to recognise the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep sea merchant shipping fleet and to provide for the reconstitution of such a fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am very pleased that we have the opportunity to discuss this motion.  I would wish to be in better voice for it. The purpose in putting it down is to try to change the Government's attitude on the treatment of the workers in Irish Shipping Limited, those who were in service when the company was liquidated and those who are on pension.  Also we on this side of the House are trying to get the Government to do what we had promised to do, namely, to recognise the strategic and economic necessity for a <Col N="1864" /> national deep sea merchant shipping fleet and to provide for the reconstitution of such a fleet.</P>
    <P>We have on numerous occasions, most recently on the occasion of the introduction of the Estimate for the Department of Communications, stressed our commitment to the Irish Shipping workers, but I think that at this stage, judging by the deaf ears upon which our words have fallen now, the Fianna Fáil Party seem to be the only channel through which the workers' grievances can be channelled and discussed openly with a view to changing Government policy with regard to the treatment of these workers.  Once more I accept that the years of service from 1941 on, when the company were established, the workers have given to one of our prestige State companies should get better recognition than they have got from this Government.  The service has been unique, shining, as Deputy Kelly said, like a fair deed in a naughty world, to quote an interruption from him during the Estimate debate.</P>
    <P>I would like once more to emphasise to this House that the industrial relations of Irish Shipping Limited, the way that the workers in Irish Shipping Limited and the management controlled their affairs for the 15 or 16 successive years up to 1983 when the company were making a profit, are the ideal industrial relations both for State companies and for private companies.  I must say that the workers, those who were directly affected &mdash; namely, the staff in Irish Shipping Limited but also those in other State companies and even in private companies &mdash; must be disillusioned if at the end of that kind of period of excellent industrial relations they can be treated as these workers have been treated.  What the workers over and over again, in public statements from their trade union and in representations to Members of this House and members of the Government as well as of the Opposition, have been looking for is the kind of treatment which the chief executive of the company received on his retirement.  I put it on the record of the House that they are seeking six weeks' pay multiplied by the number <Col N="1865" /> of years of service.  That is what they are seeking as well as the restoration of their pensions.</P>
    <P>We had before the House comparatively recently a Supplementary Estimate to deal in part with some of these workers. It dealt with an <i>ex gratia</i>&mdash; Lord save the mark &mdash; payment to pensioners which was being paid to certain pensioners by the company prior to the liquidation.  The Minister came into the House and made something of a virtue out of doing this for those who served on Irish ships during World War II.  I gather that this affected only 23 in all of the workers, and at that time I asked on behalf of my party that all pensioners be included in the new arrangement.  The Minister of State said that because of financial and legal sensitivities &mdash; those words take the biscuit &mdash; he could not go any further, he could not expand the benefits to cover all the workers in Irish Shipping Limited.  Financial sensitivities, begorrah.  When I had a look at the Estimate sheet which the Minister gave us at that time I noticed that at least for this year all he was asking was an <i>ex gratia</i> payment for certain pensioners of Irish Shipping Limited of £51,000, then I see appropriations-in-aid of £50,000.  The net total required was £1,000.  If you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the House consider that this £1,000 involves any kind of financial sensitivity then you and the House are softer than I would have thought.</P>
    <P>What the financial sensitivity would be if all the pensioners were included I do not know, because we did not get the benefit of that information from the Minister of State at that time.</P>
    <P>There were also legal sensitivities. That gets under my skin totally.  This is the House that deals with legislation. Here is the place where a Bill could be brought in to nurture the sensitivities or wipe out the sensitivities or get rid of or whatever we have to do with these legal sensitivities.  This is the House that could do it.  We submitted at that time, and I submit now, that this is the House where that should have been attended to by legislation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1866" /> I referred in the Estimate debate to the growing practice of throwing the umbrella, at one time the <i>sub judice</i> umbrella, another time the liquidator umbrella, over statements in this House. The Minister did not give the House the benefit of his thoughts about the sensitivities at that time.  I presume he meant something to do with the liquidator. When will the liquidator finish business with regard to Irish Shipping Limited?  It is an important question in regard to the substance of this motion.  At least there must be an educated guess as to when it will be finished and then we can move on to formulate other policies for the future of Irish merchant shipping.</P>
    <P>I have said that the workers deserved well of this country, especially in time of danger.  I quoted here the story of a man, now a pensioner, whose ship was torpedoed and sunk and a month later he was on board another Irish Shipping vessel serving this country.  I do not have to go through that story again, however much worth the telling.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping workers also deserve well because they saw that management seemed not to be steering the course they should be steering, long before the liquidation.  When speaking on 13 June last I quoted part of the submission by the Federated Workers Union of Ireland to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies. column 1449, volume 359, of the Official Report states:</P>
    <P>There are problems with the management structure of Irish Shipping Limited and these problems need to be addressed.  In the main, we feel there is a bunching of the managerial functions in the hands of a small number of people.  It is true to state that very important and far-reaching decisions are being taken by two or three people with little if any reference down the line.  Since 1973, the Irish Shipping management group has been reduced from seven to five and at present six management functions are vested in two individuals.  It is astonishing to note that the general manager, <Col N="1867" /> since his appointment last year, continues to carry the full functions of administration manager and personnel manager.  This is entirely inefficient and likely to lead to decisions which will cause the company considerable discomfort.</P>
    <P>This indicates that the workers were alert to certain weaknesses, dangers and difficulties and I am advancing that as an argument for the State's treating them fairly, justly and equitably.  This is the kind of advice that was coming from the committed workers of Irish Shipping Limited whose case I am pleading tonight.  It showed they were committed, serious about their work, and anxious that their company should be well managed and successful.  That is a very strong argument indeed for this House to take their plight into consideration and to do what we ask in this motion tonight.</P>
    <P>I cannot command words effective or strong enough to urge on this House reconsideration of the matter.  If I could get a promise from the Minister for Communications, even an indication that the case might be prised open fractionally, then the effort would be worth while.  I appeal most vehemently to the Minister. I do not know where the Minister for Communications is but he may be otherwise engaged.  He has a Minister of State but I see the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare has to stand in.  I refrain from criticising in the hope that perhaps he, as a prestigious member of the Government, could weigh in strongly on behalf of these workers to see that they get what in all justice they deserve from the Government, since the Government wholly owned Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>The second part of the motion calls on the Government to recognise the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep sea merchant shipping fleet and to provide for the reconstitution of such a fleet.  We have appealed to this House on numerous occasions since November last year.  We have appealed to the Government even in principle to <Col N="1868" /> make a commitment to the establishment of a deep sea Irish fleet.  Due to weaknesses in management the chartering section was expanded to meet coal, steel and timber shipping demands which were never made.  Therein lay the big weakness which was referred to by the workers in their submission to the committee.  This part of the motion addresses itself to the same request to the Government.</P>
    <P>It is generally conceded that when there are wars or major international disturbances it is a case of &ldquo;every man for himself&rdquo;.  I have read very carefully all the speeches written by Seán Lemass, Minister for Industry and Commerce and afterwards Minister for Supplies, relating to transport in the thirties and forties.  He had a natural commercial bent and the wisdom that one gathers with the years. I quoted elsewhere a statement he made with regard to a certain commodity, that he thought he had a gentleman's agreement with certain people but, when war broke out, they did not stand by it.  He said caustically that you can only have a gentleman's agreement with gentlemen.</P>
    <P>In times of crisis, the national needs of trading companies will be met first.  We are supposed to have a great rapport with the United States but, even before they came into the war, they were not over concerned with our plight.  I suppose we cannot base an argument on necessity in time of war although, in the kind of world in which we live, there is no surety that a dangerous and wide conflagration will not break out at any time, particularly in the Middle East.  For that reason, the words of our motion are important and the sentiments expressed in that part of the motion should be listened to and acted on.</P>
    <P>One could argue that even from the point of view of national prestige, it is important to have a deep sea merchant fleet.  The cynics may say that prestige butters no parsnips and that is true but there is such a thing as national morale and morale gets sustenance from the prestige that comes from owning a deep sea merchant fleet, among other things. I also include Aer Lingus.  There is such a thing as morale in a community and it <Col N="1869" /> helps economically as well.  If you come down to my constituency &mdash; the Ceann Comhairle knows what I am talking about &mdash; you will see what Mr. Barry McGuigan's win did for a small community.  It lifted it businesswise and in many other ways.  In the same way, a country like Ireland has or has not strong national morale.  That morale is sustained and fed by having profitable trading companies such as Irish Shipping were for the greater part of their existence.</P>
    <P>I wish to quote from the OECD book, page 127, <i>Maritime Transport 1983</i> Paris 1984, to show what small countries have by way of fleet, and perhaps it will indicate the lines on which the Government and the House should be thinking.  Belgium has 3,690,000 dead weight tons; the figure of Denmark is 7,926,000 dwt; Finland, which has a frozen sea to its north and the Baltic freezes regularly, has 3,601,000 dwt.  I shall skip the big countries.  Iceland has 168,000 dwt.  In 1983, Ireland had 266,000 dwt.  We learned in school that the Netherlands is the size of Munster and it has 7,479,000 dwt. New Zealand, which has a smaller population than Ireland, has 270,000 dwt. Norway, again with a smaller population than Ireland, has 33,524,000 dwt, and Portugal has 2,161,000 dwt.</P>
    <P>There are also figures in relation to the world fleet which are worth noting. Cyprus, like ourselves, is an island and they have 5,784,000 dwt.  Malta has 1,342,000 dwt.  I am asking the House to take note of how those small countries see their national interest.  I submit that we should see our national interest in the same way.  I did not quote figures for Switzerland which has no coastline nor for Austria but the figures are there and they are reasonably substantial.  Are we saying that we have a wisdom that the Danes, the Dutch, the Norwegians or the Finns do not have?  If we are, we are being stupidly arrogant.  They know how important it is to have their own deep sea fleet.  The figures I gave were for mid-1983. I also have the figures for ships of Irish Shipping Limited and I invite the House to study the booklet published by the Irish Maritime Institute on Irish ships.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1870" /> The institute, on a shoestring, have been indulging in propaganda, in the best sense of the word, and have supported Irish ships over the decades.  Dr. John de Courcy Ireland is a tireless writer on the importance of shipping to this country and on the important contribution which Irish sailors and men of the sea have made, not merely locally, but throughout the world.</P>
    <P>It is worth reading that booklet and subtracting Irish shipping from it and then contemplating what is left apart from B &amp; I and their subsidiary.  It is worth looking at it because what we see there cuts the ground from under anybody who is arguing that is what is left is adequate.  I think I am right in saying the Taoiseach advanced that kind of argument in the House on the occasion of the announcement by the Minister of the liquidation of Irish Shipping.  There is no way that what is left is adequate, however efficient and praiseworthy the efforts of the various small, in world terms, shipping companies may be.</P>
    <P>I make the point to indicate that we need something more.  The booklet covers the whole range.  It covers Irish Shipping, now in liquidation.  We can only ridicule the idea that what is left when Irish Shipping have gone &mdash; B &amp; I are not a deep sea fleet &mdash; is adequate in any way to deal with the needs of the country.  I had a communication in regard to Irish Shipping from Deputy David Andrews who told me that Irish Shipping was selling 42 paintings and five large models of ships in the open market.  I appeal to the Minister to have a look at that and, perhaps, make a decision to buy those items for the nation so that they do not leave the country.  They are a valuable collection, more valuable to us than they would be to any outside buyer.</P>
    <P>Time and again I have suggested that the <i>Irish Spruce</i> which found itself at Marseilles having a propeller refitted when the liquidation hammer fell &mdash; that ship was built specifically on the order of the Irish Government to bring coal to the Moneypoint power station in Clare although the Minister told the House there was no definite contract in that <Col N="1871" /> regard &mdash; should be used as the base for a new deep sea fleet.  I know there are all kinds of complications about purchase money, and so on, but there is nothing that cannot be solved with the proper commitment.</P>
    <P>In this context it is important to know the date for the finalisation of the liquidation proceedings.  I am aware that Irish Shipping workers made proposals to the Government with regard to a co-op for the management of the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> If the Minister decides that there may be a way forward there &mdash; I suppose he may have to await the finalisation of the liquidation proceedings &mdash; let him go that way. If necessary let him from a State company and thus build up a fleet.  I want to make it clear that I am talking about the 200,000 ton dwt. range for a small efficiently run and managed Irish deep sea fleet.  Let it be a private Irish company. Let it be a joint venture between the State and private enterprise but, for God's sake, let us have a deep sea fleet.</P>
    <P>Another point I should like to make is that the revival of a deep sea fleet requires trained personnel.  At the moment we have men of great skill, up to the rank of captain, idle.  They are available for the manning of ships in a deep sea fleet.  For God's sake let them not lie fallow.  Let them not remain idle in our State to wither because they cannot practise their skill.  With regard to the training system that has been developed I should like to call the House's attention to the danger of breaking the chain.  In educational matters if there is a gap it is difficult to set it up again.  The United States found that in certain areas of study.  When they cast them aside they had to import the brains from elsewhere after they had foolishly allowed a break in the chain. They had the money to do it.</P>
    <P>It should not be forgotten that if the chain is broken, if there are no facilities or trained personnel coming on the market, a decision of a future Government will be hampered in this regard.  If we are to have a deep sea fleet in the future we will have to have foreign crews. That is not our idea, nor was it the idea <Col N="1872" /> by definition of Irish Shipping when they were established.  Irish Shipping were established to serve a need during the war.  The ships had to be Irish owned, Irish crewed and flagged.  That is the kind of Irish Shipping company we are making a plea for tonight.</P>
    <P>In the debate on the Irish Shipping (Amendment) Bill, 1984, the Minister said that the ancillary activities of Irish Shipping provided a profitable cushion against losses for Irish Shipping Limited. What happened the cushion?  Did we lose the cushion?  Why did we not siphon off or take off the profit-making ancillary activities that provided this cushion against losses before the liquidation took place?  Why were Mombasa, Taiwan and Marseilles the locations of the ships when the liquidator was called in?  Lough Swilly or Cork could have taken them.  Those ports should have been their home before the liquidation occurred, not with a view to diddling anybody out of their just entitlement, but with a view to being in control of what happened and giving more control to the liquidator.</P>
    <P>I gather that the <i>Irish Rowan</i> has been sold, given away to a Yugoslav company. The ship was worth £15 million but $2.5 million was the price paid for it.  That is the kind of thing that is heart breaking for anybody who has the interest of a deep sea fleet or the country at heart.  I should like to emphasise how important it is, not merely for the workers who have lost their jobs and their careers, that the State companies and the private sector. They must take note of what can only be regarded as savage treatment by the State of employees after years of service given with perfect industrial relations and a commitment which prompted them to make the type of submission I read into the record of the House.</P>
    <P>We should not forget their entitlement to redundancy payments.  We should not forget the entitlement of pensioners.  All we are asking is that the rest of the pensioners get what the Minister, Deputy Nealon, got for the group who served during the Second World War.  That is <Col N="1873" /> the purpose of the motion.  I ask the House bona fide to consider our motion in that way.  This is not a political point scoring exercise.  It is an effort to see that justice is done to a certain group of people and that the State addresses itself to the establishment of a deep sea fleet for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No.1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;notes the action taken by the Minister for Communications to deal with the problems arising in the aftermath of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This motion before the House is reckless and irresponsible.  It ignores several issues of a fundamental nature in this extremely difficult and sensitive situation which exists in the aftermath of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited. The motion is not concerned at all with the wider implications of what the Government are being asked to do.  It ignores any legal or financial constraints which might be on the Government or the Ministers concerned.</P>
      <P>Of course, this whole House is united in sympathy with the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited who are the innocent victims of outrageous and irresponsible decisions taken by the company in 1979 and 1980 without informing or obtaining the consent of the Government Ministers directly concerned.  Even making due allowance for the benefits of hindsight, it is difficult to see how any responsible management could have taken those chartering decisions which led inevitably to the downfall of the company, one of the most unfortunate and tragic aspects of which was the loss of employment for people who had served the company well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The background to the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited was set out in its fullest detail in my statement to this House on 14 November 1984 and I do not see any necessity to repeat all the <Col N="1874" /> details I gave on that occasion.  Furthermore, Irish Shipping Limited are now in the hands of a liquidator who has been appointed by the High Court and the Government have, therefore, no longer any function in relation to the company. It would in fact, be quite improper for me to discuss any aspect of the liquidation process and I do not intend to do so.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in my statement on 14 November that the cost of keeping Irish Shipping Limited going for the next five years would have amounted to about £144.5 million with another £60 million approximately still owned after that.  To put this whole matter in a clearer perspective, this means that it would have cost the Exchequer over £76,000 per job per year, or about £380,000 for five years, to maintain each job in Irish Shipping Limited for the next five years with no real expectation that the company would be viable at the end of that time.  I have no doubt that the Irish taxpayer would agree that it would have been economically and socially indefensible to use limited State resources to keep Irish Shipping Limited in operation at such a cost.</P>
    <P>There were, of course, certain liabilities in respect of borrowings and other commitments by Irish Shipping Limited which had been guaranteed by the Minister for Finance and these legal obligations and guarantees are being honoured by the Government.</P>
    <P>It is now nearly eight months since the company went into liquidation.  In November 1984 the Tramp Trip Charter Index of the General Council of British Shipping stood at 113.  In April 1985 it was 100.  I have not yet got the May figure.  According to <i>Lloyds Shipping Economist,</i> a highly reputable trade journal, freight rates for medium sized dry cargo bulk carriers &mdash; 40,000 tons to 80,000 tons deadweight &mdash; have generally been depressed over the past year.  While there has been a growth in trade since the beginning of 1984, this has not been matched by a recovery in freight rate levels.  This is mainly due to chronic overtonnaging in the sector, which makes any <Col N="1875" /> sustainable improvement in rates unlikely. Despite significant annual demand growth of 7 per cent there has been a deterioration in tonnage balance as supply climbed by 9 per cent.  In February 1985 there was a surplus of supply over demand of 17.3 million tons deadweight, equivalent to 40 per cent of demand.</P>
    <P>Freight rates for handy size dry bulk carriers &mdash; 10,000 tons to 30,000 tons deadweight &mdash; have also failed to show any real signs of recovery.  Indeed, current freight rates for the type of handy size vessel owned and chartered by Irish Shipping Limited &mdash; about 30,000 tons deadweight &mdash; are significantly below the levels of a year ago.  This can also be attributed to overtonnaging.  In February 1985 there was a surplus of supply over demand in this category of 20.6 million tons deadweight, equivalent to 29 per cent of demand.</P>
    <P>The figure therefore of £144.5 million which I have quoted earlier was based on advice from reputable international shipbrokers obtained by the then chairman of Irish Shipping Limited.  At the present time freight rates in the deep-sea sector are even worse than that advice anticipated.  Panamax vessels, of which there were five in the company's fleet, are earning about $1,000 a day less than forecast.  The smaller vessels are also having a bad time.  At the same time costs are increasing.  The situation, therefore, is that the company's losses would have been very substantially greater this year alone if they had continued in business.</P>
    <P>Not surprisingly in these circumstances, shipping companies continue to go to the wall.  One of the latest casualties is the Reardon Smith Line, the Cardiff based shipping company with which Irish Shipping Limited were associated in Celtic Bulk Carriers.  Reardon Smith Line went into voluntary liquidation at the beginning of this month.  The company's chairman attributed their downfall to a sharp fall in ship values and the persistent weakness of freight rates.</P>
    <P>I do not, however, consider it necessary to justify again the Government's decision not to make any more money <Col N="1876" /> available for Irish Shipping Limited in November 1984.  That decision was clearly the right one as anybody who examines the situation objectively and knows the circumstances of the world shipping industry will agree.  This country, in the present financial and economic climate, simply could not afford to accept responsibility for the enormous financial commitments entered into by Irish Shipping Limited, without &mdash; and I think that I should again repeat this &mdash; without the knowledge or consent of the then Government or of the Ministers concerned.</P>
    <P>The situation of over 30 ship officer cadets training with Irish Shipping Limited was affected by the liquidation. Arrangements were made, however, with the liquidator for the continuation of the training up to June 1985, with the Youth Employment Agency meeting the cost and other Irish shipping companies providing the necessary sea time.  My Department are at present consulting with the other parties with the objective of seeking longer term arrangements for the cadets affected by the liquidation and I am hopeful of a successful outcome.</P>
    <P>The payment of redundancy compensation to the company's employees would normally be the responsibility of the liquidator.  Since, however, there were no funds to meet the payments, the Minister for Labour was obliged to pay the redundancy lump sum in full to the employees from the Redundancy Fund.  The processing of the relevant redundancy claims was and is being dealt with expeditiously by the Department of Labour.  There are no funds available from which compensation payments other than statutory redundancy entitlements can be made.</P>
    <P>The suggestion that extra-statutory redundancy payments might be made to ex-employees of Irish Shipping Limited is also affected by other serious constraints. The position is that the company are in liquidation, having insufficient assets to meet their liabilities.  It must be borne in mind that there are creditors of the company who have lost a great deal of money through the liquidation of Irish <Col N="1877" /> Shipping Limited.  In the circumstances of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited, it would be improper to seek to give preferential treatment to former employees of the company.</P>
    <P>The motion also asks that the pensions of all former Irish Shipping staff should be restored to their pre-liquidation levels. I should explain that pension arrangements for employees of Irish Shipping Limited were a matter for the company and the pension arrangements in force at the time of the liquidation of the company were those established by the company. The company operated three pension schemes &mdash; one for senior executives, another for sea-going staff and a third for shore-based staff.  Although section 3 of the Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Act, 1984, provided that my approval would be required from then on for any alterations in the then existing pension arrangements, I was not in fact called upon to exercise that power in regard to these pension schemes.  It must be emphasised that I have had no function, statutory or otherwise, in the pension schemes that existed at the time of the liquidation.</P>
    <P>The <i>ex gratia</i> portion of the pension was, of course, unfunded and was met out of the company's revenues.  It was not paid out of a pension fund and the company were under no obligation to pay it.  So far as the Department understand the matter, the <i>ex gratia</i> retirement payments made by the company arose mainly from limitations in the pension fund provisions in regard to adjusting pension amounts to cost of living increases.  The company, presumably, decided to make these <i>ex gratia</i> payments as a way of topping up the pensions in question.  In addition, some <i>ex gratia</i> payments were made to retired employees who were not in pension schemes.  The level of these <i>ex gratia</i> payments was a matter for the company and when they went into liquidation the continuation or cessation of them became a matter for the liquidator appointed by the High Court.  In view of the nature of these payments, the liquidator could not continue to pay them.</P>
    <P>It is an unfortunate consequence of the <Col N="1878" /> liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited that pensioners should be among the innocent victims.  When the Government were considering the restoration of the <i>ex gratia</i> pension element, the possibility of extending this concession to all pensioners of the company was considered. Due to the financial and other sensitivities involved, it has not been found possible to do this, however much we would like to do so.  It is not that the sum involved would be so daunting.  However, after very careful consideration it was felt that there was a particular category of former employee to whom, without creating a precedent or offending any sensitivities, and exceptional consideration in the matter of <i>ex gratia</i> retirement payments could be applied, and in restoring those payments to those who had service aboard Irish ships during World War II, the Government concluded that it was recognising a very special service to the State.</P>
    <P>Finally, the motion &ldquo;calls on the Government to recognise the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep sea merchant shipping fleet and to provide for the reconstitution of such a fleet&rdquo;.  As I made clear in my statement to this House on 14 November last, this aspect was considered by the Government and they were satisfied that the winding up of Irish Shipping Limited was not a cause for concern in terms of our current strategic needs.</P>
    <P>In the aftermath of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited, I am carrying out a review of policy in relation to the Irish merchant shipping industry.  It is more than 20 years since the last major review of the strategic fleet concept.  Circumstances have changed considerably since then, both in the development of modern ships travelling at higher speeds and operating with greater efficiency, as well as the development of air transport, and in the nature of emergencies which might occur.</P>
    <P>The requirement of a strategic fleet has traditionally derived from the policy of successive Governments on Irish neutrality in the event of armed hostilities involving Europe.  We might remind ourselves <Col N="1879" /> that during the last war the maximum effective tonnage did not exceed 45,000 tons deadweight.  Nevertheless, the ships and their crews played a major part in maintaining effective imports during the most critical period of the war.</P>
    <P>Towards the end of the war, it was decided that Irish Shipping Limited should continue their activities in the post-war period.  It was also decided that the size of the company's fleet should be determined by reference to the minimum tonnage requirement to carry essential imports to the country in time of war.  At that time this was estimated at 250,000 tons deadweight.  In September 1958 this target was reduced to 200,000 tons because of the improvement in the overall efficiency of dry cargo vessels related to their increased size and speed.  This target of 200,000 tons deadweight was in turn revised to 155,000 tons deadweight dry cargo tonnage in the second Programme for Economic Expansion, following a further re-examination in the light of the modernisation of vessels and of changes in national requirements of essential commodities since the target was originally calculated.  The company's growth was not, however, limited to the target figure, but expansion beyond that figure depended solely on commercial considerations.</P>
    <P>The need, in modern times, for the maintenance of a strategic fleet, which was conceived historically in relation to conventional warfare, requires wider consideration and study.  The question arises, for instance, of the relevance of a strategic fleet in an age of nuclear weapons. Moreover, there is a world surplus of shipping at present and this is likely to continue indefinitely.  It would, however, be imprudent not to plan on the basis that future hostilities could be limited to conventional weapons or that there may be emergencies or international crises other than warfare which would create a need for nationally registered tonnage.  It would not be wise to assume that other nations would come to our aid and meet our needs in such times of war or international crisis.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1880" /> Because of the importance of foreign trade in the Irish economy, the diversity of the sources of our imports and destinations of our exports, successive Governments have felt that Ireland's interest lies more in maintaining reasonable freight rates than in maximising earnings from the relatively small shipping industry.  Government policy, therefore, has been aimed at supporting the elimination of discriminatory practices in the shipping industry.  The elimination of these practices should help to keep down freight rates and ensure fair entry in the world market for Irish ships.  We have maintained this advocacy of free and fair competition in the deliberations on maritime policy within the European Communities. The EC Commission memorandum on shipping policy submitted to the Council in March 1985 is a welcome development in this regard.  The Commission's formulation of a policy of non-protectionism based on the principle of free and fair competition is in line with Ireland's espousal of full commercial freedom of shipping.</P>
    <P>Shippers here and abroad are free to use any of the services available.  In any case, the nature of the deep sea trade to and from Irish ports offers little prospect of full and remunerative employment for a shipping company.  This was demonstrated by the inability of Irish Shipping Limited to operate a regular liner service from Ireland economically when they made an attempt to do so some years ago.  As a consequence, the company had to seek remunerative employment in the world tramp market.</P>
    <P>If the maintenance of a strategic fleet remains a valid and realistic policy for Ireland, the current structure and pattern of Irish trade needs to be examined to determine to what extent the strategic or minimum needs of the economy could be met by a fleet owned or capable of being requisitioned by the Irish Government. Obvious needs would be fuel &mdash; coal, oil and petroleum products, in particular &mdash; food and other essential raw materials. Minimum necessary levels could be determined, and from these might be determined the number, type, size and <Col N="1881" /> distance capabilities of the ships which would be necessary to maintain those supplies.  It seems to me that the aggregate tonnage which has heretofore been the prescription for the strategic fleet is a rather crude concept.  It should be possible to define the structure and composition of a strategic fleet more precisely to correspond to present and anticipated economic requirements.</P>
    <P>The present Irish fleet, excluding those vessels which were owned by Irish Shipping Limited, consists of 62 ships totalling about 187,000 tons deadweight.  Apart from the <i>Irish Spruce,</i> there are 44 dry cargo ships on the register with a total tonnage of over 77,000 tons deadweight. This fleet operates mainly in the near continental trading area which generally encompasses ports in Ireland, Britain and Europe between Bergan in Norway and La Pallice in France, but excludes much of the Baltic Sea.  There area also seven small tankers on the register with a total tonnage of over 22,000 tons deadweight.</P>
    <P>There are, of course, obvious benefits to the Irish economy from a commercially successful shipping fleet in the areas of foreign exchange earnings, contribution to the balance of payments, employment of maritime personnel etc.  As I have already stated, this question of a strategic fleet, its value, its structure, its ownership, its employment etc. has not been looked at for over 20 years.  I have indicated that there are many fundamental questions which need to be considered and which clearly go beyond my area of responsibility.  I have decided, therefore, as part of a general review of shipping policy which I am carrying out, to establish a Committee on Strategic Shipping Requirements representative of the Government Departments and other agencies concerned, to investigate and report on our current and future strategic needs and how these should be secured. I will be announcing the composition of the committee very shortly.</P>
    <P>This tragic saga of the end of Irish Shipping has had extremely harsh consequences for many people, many of them innocent victims of decisions in which they played no part.  I yield to nobody in <Col N="1882" /> my admiration for the workers of Irish Shipping Limited.  They have served this country well.  Their commitment to their company's interest has been a model for all workers and their conduct in the area of industrial relations has been exemplary. There is nobody, in Government or outside, who is not moved and concerned by plight of these workers.  I constraints and sensitivities of the situation prevent me from taking further action to ease their lot.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion before the House, in the names of my colleagues, calls on the Government to restore some justice to the former long standing employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  It also calls on the Government to restore the nation's independence by having its own shipping fleet, as is the right and expectation of any sovereign nation.</P>
      <P>The Government's decision in December last to put a liquidator into Irish Shipping was disastrous for a great number of reasons.  First, it dealt a huge demoralising blow and injustice to men who had given great service to Irish Shipping, in many cases at a time when there was great danger to those going out to sea in less peaceful times.  The decision by the Minister left the liquidator with no alternative but to sack staff who had given many years of excellent service.  Their only compensation was a statutory redundancy figure, with no proper pension scheme whatever attached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The decision also left many men stranded in ports.  Indeed, seven months later that situation still prevails, and Irishmen are stranded, not knowing what is likely to happen in the future and being left literally prisoners in a foreign country many thousands of miles away from home.  That decision also placed a huge question mark over Ireland's credibility and creditworthiness abroad and has <Col N="1883" /> possibly done untold damage to the economic development of this country resulting from an Irish Government reneging on and dishonouring their responsibilities and guarantees.  Ethics in any business undertaking is highly important but is much more so at international level where investments and borrowings are guaranteed by a sovereign State.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping Limited for many years had been a very viable undertaking and had not only created excellent employment and prestige for our country abroad but also gave us our independence in shipping in international waters.  Credit must be given to all those involved in developing and building up the company over the years from their pioneering days.</P>
    <P>We may never know what caused the real problems of Irish Shipping but we do know that the Government acted hastily. The Minister rushed in to appoint a liquidator and gave no consideration whatever for its effect on our credit rating at international level, which is probably causing a further deficiency of many hundreds of million of pounds a year on our national debt and repayments.</P>
    <P>We were never told at the time of the liquidation what proposals had been brought forward by the board of Irish Shipping in their report and we were never informed of their recommendations. It is very clear, however, that the recommendations did not include liquidation but it is a tragedy for the country that the Minister did not tread more cautiously in a more statesmanlike way. Instead he rushed in, with the Government's approval, to appoint a liquidator within a matter of hours.</P>
    <P>Not so long before the liquidation this House had passed legislation authorising the Government to guarantee Irish Shipping up to £75 million and following that any person or company doing business with Irish Shipping &mdash; bankers, creditors or others &mdash; were entitled to believe that when the State gave such a guarantee that there would be no question whatever of such a pledge or guarantee not being honoured by the Government of a sovereign <Col N="1884" /> State.  Those pledges also gave some assurance to the employees of Irish Shipping at that time.  Above all they were entitled to believe that there would be no question whatever of the Minister and the Government going back on their word and putting up the shutters in the most disastrous way possible, particularly by bringing in the liquidator.</P>
    <P>Many of the workers had made commitments themselves on personal levels on the basis of the Government's guarantee but once again, and not indeed for the first time, they were betrayed by the Minister and their jobs and their livelihood were gone within a matter of hours. That is no way to run one's affairs and it is certainly no way to treat people who have given dedicated and loyal service to the nation's shipping line for many years, sometimes at great danger and great risk to themselves and to their families.</P>
    <P>We are all also very anxious to know what is going to happen to Irish Continental Lines.  They are a separate company that have been profitable and, again, not only have given good employment but have obtained a good reputation as an efficient and profit-making organisation. The employees of Irish Continental Lines are frightened and nervous.  They have no assurance that their jobs are safe. We all know that the liquidator has been negotiating for the sale for some time now and very obviously the last consideration will be the independence of Irish Continental Lines and, even more importantly, the future of the men and women who are presently employed by that company with an obvious disregard for the contribution they have made to the success of the company, as happened in the case of the employees of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>The problem in Shipping today is no different from that being faced by many business.  The boards and directors of such companies have to take the rough with the smooth and behave in an ethical and proper businesslike way.  Major problems have to be faced up to by all those directing and running businesses. If there are problems we rightly condemn and criticise those who abscond leaving behind their workers without jobs, their <Col N="1885" /> creditors sitting with little or no hope of ever being paid and a general unholy mess.  We do not expect that from good business people of integrity and we certainly should not have to accept such a high-handed, unbusinesslike and dishonest approach from the State and the Government.</P>
    <P>There was blatant mismanagement on the part of the board of directors of Irish Shipping in recent years.  Of that there can be no doubt whatever.  They abused the trust that the Minister of the day, and successive Ministers and Governments, had placed in them by getting involved in absolutely crazy, ridiculous and uneconomic deals, the type of which it is difficult to understand and comprehend from men of so-called business experience, knowledge and etiquette.</P>
    <P>It is, of course, easily known that they were not dealing with their own funds. Many people are still asking if the liquidator intends taking action against those responsible, many of whom have other business interests and assets that are totally unconnected with Irish Shipping. Nevertheless in circumstances such as has happened in Irish Shipping, the liquidator should have the right to examine all possibilities in taking appropriate action to recover some of the lost funds and finances.  The State and the workers are those who always suffer in situations of this nature and the Minister, before making his decision to appoint a liquidator, should also have considered this particular aspect of the matter.</P>
    <P>It is very obvious to anybody with business experience and acumen that in the particular circumstances the Minister should have appointed a receiver, not a liquidator, and provided the receiver with a financial injection which would have assured the continuity of Irish Shipping Limited on a smaller scale but nevertheless we would still have Irish Shipping Limited as an independent and sovereign shipping line.  Many jobs would have been saved and I have no doubt that within a few short years Irish Shipping Limited would have developed once again into a shipping line that we could <Col N="1886" /> have taken a pride in as we had done in other years.</P>
    <P>A receiver at the time could have renegotiated the particular contracts which caused the major problems.  I am sure that in the circumstances the main creditors would have been quite happy to have co-operated in thrashing out some deal satisfactory to them and which would have guaranteed the continuation of Irish Shipping Limited and employment in the company.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister can still retrieve that particular situation, although from his speech tonight it is obvious no progress will be made.  Indeed at the time it should have been a priority of the Government to keep an Irish shipping company afloat and the solvency and credibility of the nation would not have suffered as it has obviously done since November last when that disastrous decision was taken.</P>
      <P>I call on the Minister and the Government to accept our motion tonight.  First, he should renegotiate redundancy terms and pensions with former employees who cannot be accommodated in a new Irish shipping company, and particularly those who have given long and faithful service to Irish Shipping.</P>
      <P>Secondly, in the interests of our independence and credibility, a new shipping company must be floated.  I have no doubt but that under experienced and efficient management we will again experience the pride and joy of having our own national shipping line and not having to be dependent on foreign shipping which will only drive up industrial and distribution costs, therefore, creating further and extensive unemployment which is already in a disastrous state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have seen a petition and a letter that were handed to the Taoiseach's office from the Wives Action Group of Irish Shipping.  Any Deputy, and particularly the Taoiseach, on reading that letter should have given some recognition to the points made.  It is clear from the petition that the wives requested a meeting <Col N="1887" /> with the Taoiseach but they were left waiting for seven hours before it was even accepted.  They were ignored totally. Since then the Taoiseach has not only refused to meet them but has not even acknowledged receipt of the petition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>In the circumstances that is absolutely irresponsible and disgraceful conduct on the part of the Taoiseach and the Government.  It is obvious that the effects of the liquidation of Irish Shipping have been disastrous and traumatic on the families and on the wives of the former employees of Irish Shipping. It could be argued that the same effects can be experienced by the families of any unemployed persons but, in the case of Irish Shipping, we had a profitable and viable shipping line for many years.  I have indicated that, given the chance, Irish Shipping could have been rescued from their financial position and could have prospered in the future.</P>
      <P>I will quote a few points from the petition regarding the employees.  It points out very seriously the psychological effects on wives and children of having a once cheerful, happy breadwinner turned into a depressed, morbid cast off with the resulting change in the home environment. It talks about the increased tension of visiting a husband in a psychiatric hospital, a former employee of Irish Shipping. When teachers complain about a child's lack of attention and change of personality in class and when it is explained to them that one's husband is ex-Irish Shipping, they understand immediately. It also deals with pensions and quotes the anxiety of a 75 year old single pensioner living alone with no wartime sea service.  Her pension of £180 per month was reduced to £58 per month. She had to seek cheaper accommodation and change her surroundings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister has seen this document although it was addressed to the Taoiseach.  There is an obligation on the Minister and on the Government to take some action along the lines of our <Col N="1888" /> motion.  I appeal to the Minister to think big on this occasion and forget politics. I ask him to accept our motion which would be in the interests of the employees of Irish Shipping and the future of the company as a national shipping fleet sailing on a viable commercial basis throughout foreign waters under the Irish flag. That is the least we can ask the Minister and the Government to do.  I sincerely hope that, despite his rebuttal of our motion in his speech tonight, he will reconsider the whole matter and agree to accept the motion as put forward from this side of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>When the Government decided to put Irish Shipping into liquidation the nation was shocked.  As is generally conceded, the timing and the manner of this act was disastrous for the reputation of the country and, strategically, the decision to liquidate when the fleet was spread across the seven seas was illjudged.  The morale of the nation received a body blow.  Its effect is still evident and is felt throughout the country but mostly by the families and dependants of the staff of Irish Shipping.</P>
      <P>The treatment meted out to the workers and pensioners of Irish Shipping was nothing short of scandalous and continues to be so.  The ships were spread throughout the world and all of a sudden their lifeline was cut off.  They were in Africa, France and the Middle East.  Suddenly they were left without a job.  Ships were impounded.  Captains, workers and officers on board were at the mercy of who ever was in control in those countries or at the mercy of pirates on the high seas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have heard stories from those aboard the ships in Mombasa, the Middle East and Marseilles that they were subjected to treatment which they did not deserve.  The reason for this was that the Government did not take into account what could happen to our citizens who were serving our country.  They rushed in wildly without taking into consideration the danger our citizens would be placed in.  Some people were attacked.  Their ships were plundered and they were in <Col N="1889" /> danger of their lives on many occasions. The Government should have considered all of this in detail before making their decision.  We are not talking in terms of financial and economic decisions but about human lives.  This aspect has not been stressed strongly over the past number of months.  The blame must rest with the Government.</P>
    <P>Since the liquidation the families of the workers have suffered greatly.  They did not know what would happen to them from day to day.  In most cases when a company go into liquidation a decent redundancy payment is made.  There is consultation and a fair amount of money is paid to those made redundant.  What happened in this case?  An offer of statutory redundancy was made to those working aboard the ships and on shore. Some members of the management got six weeks salary per year of service not long before the company went into liquidation. The chairman got £66,000 for retiring early but the workers on the ships, the middle management and office workers were treated in a most insulting and degrading manner.  The Minister has defended the Government's stand on the treatment of the workers.  They seem proud of what they have done.  That is one of the reasons for our calling on the Government in this motion to pay adequate compensation to the former employees of Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>There is the case also of the pensioners of the company, some of whom joined the company when it was set up.  The Minister tells us that because the pensions were being paid by Irish Shipping, there is no responsibility on him in that regard. That is not a sustainable argument.  The Minister has power, if he has the will, to arrange for the payment of pensions to those who had been already in receipt of pensions from the company.  Therefore, what is in question is the will of the Minister and of the Government in this matter.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister introduced a Supplementary Estimate for the purpose of providing <i>ex gratia</i> payments for some of the pensioners of Irish Shipping. Obviously, that move was welcomed but there is a certain amount of cynicism <Col N="1890" /> attaching to it because the decision was reached by the Government only after much pressure had been put on them in this regard, after they realised that the people generally were angry at the way in which the pensioners of the company had been treated.  Consequently, the Government decided to give something as a token to those who had served Irish Shipping down through the years.  This <i>ex gratia</i> payment is to be paid to 23 pensioners of the company but I submit that payment should be made to all the company's pensioners.</P>
    <P>In opening his speech the Minister referred to our motion as being reckless and irresponsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to understand how those terms could be applied to a motion which seeks to have paid to the staff of Irish Shipping adequate compensation for what has happened to them.  We are talking about a motion which seeks a restoration of the pensions of all former Irish Shipping staff, which calls on the Government to recognise the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep sea merchant fleet and to provide for the reconstitution of such a fleet.</P>
      <P>There was nothing in the Minister's speech that related to the motion before the House.  Instead we were treated to a history of what he has done in the case of Irish Shipping.  Throughout his speech there was the excuse that because the matter is <i>sub judice</i> it could not be gone into in detail.  For some weeks past Deputy Kelly has been saying in relation to the setting up of new committees, boards and authorities that the power of the Government is being given away.  I agree totally.  In the past year or so I have noted that the Government's response to sticky questions is to invoke the <i>sub judice</i> rule or to say that because the concern in question is in liquidation or is in the hands of some other authority the Minister is not responsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is, too, the very important question of the education of cadets to man a <Col N="1891" /> shipping fleet.  By reason of the liquidation of Irish Shipping that education is being obstructed.  In fairness to the Minister, he has arranged for the continued training at the Cork Regional Technical College of those cadets who have been there up to June 1985 but I am concerned that in future the process of this education will be broken.  I fear that when we again have a merchant fleet we will not have available the qualified staff to man the vessels.  The Minister must ensure that the training staff who are available in the Cork Regional Technical College are retained so that they do not have to go elsewhere to seek employment.  Therefore, it is vitally important that the Minister announce immediately what his plans are in this respect.</P>

      <P>On the last occasion on which we had an opportunity to debate the plight of the employees of Irish Shipping, I contributed to that debate as did many other Members from this side of the House also.  The general point made then was that the employees were the victims of decisions that were totally out of their control and which were taken perhaps totally without their knowledge. While the employees of Irish Shipping have understood and been responsible in their understanding of the situation forced on them it is probably now out of the question that Irish Shipping Limited, as we knew it, can be restored.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This debate should concentrate on what can be done at two levels, first, the present position of the employees and their ension reights.  Although the Minister has not addressed the subject with the urgency I should have liked, there is also the need to review the establishment of a shipping service here, one that would be a national service and of which we could be proud.  We were very proud of Irish Shipping Limited and of their workers who gave loyal dedication and commitment to that company.  Such review should be undertaken urgently.  In changing world conditions it is essential that we keep abreast of changes and the strategic needs of an Irish shipping service, <Col N="1892" /> the type of service that will be needed.  At the same time we are all aware that, in this respect, time is of the essence.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>The point I was making when I was speaking on this debate before Private Members' Business, was one that affected women and has constituted one of the greatest discriminations prevailing within the social welfare code. That was the categorisation of married working women as dependants and the different treatment of them with regard to the benefits to which they had contributed fully throughout their working lives but of which they were not recipients.  I had commented on the fact that unnecessary, insulting and discriminatory questions were put to them.  There is still within this society an attitude &mdash; one we must get rid of and which I hope this Bill will get rid of in some way &mdash; that men's work is real and important but that a woman's work outside the home is less important, a matter of choice.</P>
      <P>Women who work outside the home from choice for their satisfaction and particularly out of economic necessity are constantly accused of doing so merely for pin money.  Until we get rid of that difference in attitude to the work of men and women the provisions of this Bill will constitute a reform of the bare bones only of what we must do to ensure that women at work are treated as people in their own right, as workers in the same way as are men.  This is particularly important with regard to the questioning that has developen from ingrained perceptions that women do not really need to work, that if they have children and seek work outside the home, they have no right to do so and are in some way irresponsible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally there has been discrimination against women in that persistently <Col N="1893" /> they are kept at part time work on hours that prohibit them from social welfare entitlements.  This has been done deliberately to deny women their social welfare benefits.  This carries an even greater inbuilt discrimination because women are also expected to carry all of the domestic responsibilities within the home.  Through demands made on them in the home many women have had to partake of part time work, a concept I consider to be dangerous not alone for women but for men also particularly in the future.  Within our society we still operate a system within which women are expected to go out and work.  Yet there is no network or support system to enable women to do so on a full time basis.  This pushes women into part time employment, denying them their rightful social welfare benefits.  This has arisen because our society has not yet accepted with any degree of seriousness that women as well as men have a right to work.  We have no provision for child care facilities.  There is no point in our talking about giving women equal opportunities to work outside the home if such facilities are not provided.</P>
    <P>There has been no debate on a subject which hopefully will form the basis of a European directive to be drawn up in the near future, that is, the responsibility and sharing of the work inside the home as well as outside it by men, as fathers, as responsible parents.  Probably there will be the same type of resistance to any EC directive on parental and family leave, with this Legislature not taking such responsibility seriously.  We may even be taken to the European Court for not having done so.  We must perceive ourselves here in the way in which we do or do not enact legislation affecting women in our society and, in this respect, our history has been a sad and sorry one.  I would go so far as to say that all of the legislation in support of women and their right to work has been as a direct result of our membership of the EC and not in any way as a result of encouragement or recognition here of the right of women to work.</P>
    <P>Even with the incorporation into our <Col N="1894" /> laws of legislation with regard to equal pay and opportunity, we remain far behind in social welfare legislation.  We have not yet taken seriously or started any kind of national debate in the area of parental and family leave.  Additionally we have not given any real recognition to the need to grant social welfare, proportionately, in respect of part time work.  Those of us who foresee the structures at work in the nineties and beyond the year 2,000 realise that with technology and shortened hours, there will be a vast reduction in the quantity of traditional jobs.</P>
    <P>We have not constructively or positively looked at what women have been doing for a long time and have been discriminated against for doing, that is, that women have perceived that this life is made up of more than work.  They know and desperately want the right, the satisfaction and the contribution they can make to work outside the home.  Indeed, their work inside the home has never been seen as gainful employment.  It is not recognised as such; our GNP does not even take it into consideration.  Until we as legislators start perceiving work as women have done for generations &mdash; and have been penalised for it &mdash; so as to get a real distribution of jobs, we will get nowhere.  We will just create an elite who will be employed.  If we do not change our structures, that elite will consistently be men, and women will continue to carry the whole burden and also the reward of home making and child rearing.</P>
    <P>What legislation must address on behalf of both men and women with regard to future employment is the importance that women have given to areas of life other than work.  If we ignore other aspects of life we will be overwhelmed by the problems.  We should address the whole area of low paid work and of women being categorised as dependent, right up to 1985, and the problems of trying to introduce legislation to give rights and equality to women.  To keep social welfare at its present level the Minister will have to seek ways and means to ensure that an adult will not have to be a dependant in order to get the <Col N="1895" /> extra subsidisation necessary to survive. We are still saying to women, unfortunately, that to bring this legislation in we still have to keep a great number of women, who are so badly paid for their work, categorised as dependants.  The only way we can address this problem in the full sense is to work out a basic family income for all families so that there will be the security to allow people to build on that basic income and share the jobs that they cannot now afford to share because of the insecurity and the out-dated structures relating to work.</P>
    <P>The debate on this legislation should open out not only in the area of what remains to be done to ensure the rights of women, but it should include a positive programme to make sure women get their entitlements and that they are seen to be deserving of them.  The outdated social welfare system and work structures that discriminated so heavily against women up to now should be looked at in an open way as affecting men and women.  This debate has highlighted the huge discriminations that still exist and are allowed to exist against women and also the incredible number of families on low income who are actually below the poverty line.  I hope that the next legislation debated here will be debated in time so that we will not find ourselves reluctantly dragging in legislation such as this which has raised some complaints because of the implications in what it is doing in the areas of which I have just spoken.  What has distressed me and many women is that the principle of equality for women has come last in the wake of everything else.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>No matter what efforts are being made by the Minister in relation to what is in effect a reallocation of existing resources to bring about equality for women, the provision of a proper social welfare system depends very much on the capacity of a nation to produce wealth and of a Government to obtain enough revenue to provide the sort of social security system befitting any civilised nation in western democracies.  The fact <Col N="1896" /> that this Government failed dismally since they took office to increase the productive capacity of this country is an indictment of them.  It also imposes major constraints on the attempts by this Government to look after the less well off members of society who have not the privilege of having a job and who, due to their economic and social status, have no real prospect of obtaining a job in the near future.</P>
      <P>One should look at this legislation in the proper context.  This Government, for all their verbiage and so-called commitment to social reform, are ensuring that the economic recovery of this nation is deferred because of their continuing monetarist policies.  In the spending Departments, Labour Ministers are attempting to justify their continued existence in Government by putting forward legislation which has been delayed by successive Governments since 1978 when this directive was passed by the Council of Ministers.  What is more inexplicable is that Labour Ministers are stating that we have increased resources for social welfare recipients when all that is taking place is a transfer of existing resources in order to keep us in line with our European counterparts to ensure that the equality directive is complied with. The Minister pointed out, in a very lengthy and informative speech, the background to this legislation; but it is quite clear that some social welfare recipients will get less at the end of the week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At the moment women who are working and who are the only persons earning income are entitled to claim on social welfare benefits the full increases in respect of their children.  When this Bill is passed, where a husband is out of work and a wife is working and the wife then goes on social welfare benefit, she will not get the full increase in respect of the children but only 50 per cent of the appropriate increase.  That is my understanding of it, having examined the Minister's contribution this afternoon.  If we were to examine the various cases where people are in receipt of social welfare benefits we would find that these people <Col N="1897" /> are existing under real hardship and with the passing of this legislation their inadequate payments will become more inadequate. That is not so in the majority of cases but in some cases as a result of the passing of this Bill, in the name of equality which is a laudable concept, people will be in receipt of even more meagre social welfare payments at the end of this week.</P>
    <P>I welcome the various positive aspects of this Bill.  It is to nobody's credit that it has taken something in the region of seven years to implement the spirit of the directive in respect of ensuring equality in the social security system implemented by the State here.  Although I have not checked it, I venture to say that we are probably the last country in the EC to do this.  Some aspects of the legislation are commendable.  First, the elimination of the lower rates for women in respect of disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pension and occupational injury benefit is welcome.  The increase in the maximum duration of entitlement to unemployment benefit to 390 days or 65 weeks, similar to men, is also welcome. There was an obvious discrimination there which had no justification at all.  It should be said that it is no more to the credit of this Minister than to any previous Minister that this change is coming about.  We are simply complying with a concept which should have been inherent in our social security system from the outset.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that the Minister did not give much greater detail on one point I would like to make, since consistently as Minister for Social Welfare he says to us that if we are to have a level of service we must take cognisance of the income or of the Estimates which he must deal with in his Department in each year. It has been stated consistently on this side of the House, and I do not think it has ever been properly contradicted on the other side, that the Estimate for social welfare and the allocation made in this year's budget to the Department of Social Welfare mean that there is only enough money there for something in the region of 217,000 people unemployed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1898" /> Obviously at the moment very many more people than that are on the register and many people who are unemployed are not on the register.</P>
    <P>I was disappointed that in explaining this legislation to us on Second Stage the Minister did not go into very much detail on the transfer of existing resources and how the increases in certain circumstances for female social welfare recipients are to be funded.  Consistently, and unjustifiably in many cases, he criticises this side of the House and tries to put across the impression that we seek increased service without trying to find out where the income is to come from. He stands guilty in this regard on this Bill in not explaining to the House &mdash; and, therefore, by extension, to the people &mdash; where he is to get the money to increase disability benefit, unemployment benefit, invalidity pensions and occupational injury benefit to women and how he intends to find the money for the extension he intends to make in unemployment benefit receipts to 65 weeks for women as for men, when it is obvious from the allocation made to him in the budget that he simply has only enough money to deal with 217,000 social welfare recipients.  A glaring omission of the Minister's this evening is that he has not calculated properly how many people in each category will get how much money extra and where that money is coming from.  If he can allocate it without bringing in a Supplementary Estimate some time in this fiscal year, will he tell us precisely which social welfare recipients are to get less money?</P>
    <P>He is probably the most conservative of Labour Party Ministers in Government at the moment, which is a fair achievement.  On national television only last week as a result of the local elections he tried to apply to the Fianna Fáil spokesman what would probably be an unparliamentary term which it seems he can get away with on the national broadcasting media.  He has spoken consistently in terms of the vast volume of money he is allocating in social welfare and the great achievements he has made within his Department.  Yet one sees <Col N="1899" /> when one goes to the doors not alone the rejection of his party's policy, his Government's policy, but the hard reality of increased hardship despite his claim that he is providing adequately for those less well off in society.  His Labour Party colleagues should remember that.</P>
    <P>Whilst we are all aware of the cutbacks he has made in health in his other portfolio, this aspect of the Bill has not been properly explained, to me at any rate. Certain social welfare recipients will lose income and we all agree that their income as it stands is not adequate.  If these people are to get less money we would like to know at this stage of the Bill, in order to put down our amendments, what category of people will be losing out and what category will be getting more, how many people are involved and how much money is involved.  The Minister is in charge of a Department which deals with over £1,200 million of taxpayers money. If he is so concerned about £1,200 million of taxpayers money, perhaps he will help us to be a responsible Opposition in his eyes, by explaining properly the legislation which he proposes to bring in at any given time.</P>
    <P>I respect the Minister's position as we all should.  He is a politician, but there is a certain attitude within his speech, a tendency to talk down to his colleagues to the effect that if one is to equalise benefits one should not equalise upwards but downwards.  I accept the constraints that are on the Minister but I do not accept his attempts to cover up a transfer of existing resources in his Department whereby certain categories of social welfare recipients will get less benefit under this Bill.</P>
    <P>I stated one instance at the outset which I do not think can be contradicted. He has not said how these people are to be properly compensated.  We are talking about people living on the breadline, and not alone that, but living on the breadline without dignity.  Some people are living on the breadline with some semblance of dignity by reason of the fact that they have somewhere to go to work.  Certain categories of social welfare recipients are <Col N="1900" /> already discriminated against under the social security system and will continue to be discriminated against as a result of this legislation.</P>
    <P>I have very serious reservations about a certain category of social welfare recipients who are continuously discriminated against and who suffer very real hardship. They are widows and widowers.  I do not mind what sex they are, whether they are widows or widowers, but I find in my daily dealings with my constituents as a backbench TD that very many widows are not able to make ends meet.  It is sad that a woman must try to rear a family without a proper income supplement as a result of losing her partner who probably was the breadwinner of the family, who paid for his stamps, contributed to his union, and worked hard all his life with no prospect of increased perks or &ldquo;status&rdquo; as regards management or anything like that.  When such persons go to the grave they leave women in many instances with young families and with no social welfare help other than the widow's pension.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is not the Minister's fault that that is the case, but these people are not being looked after properly under our social security system.  While that point is possibly outside the ambit of this debate, it is a passing reference which should be made at every opportunity when Social Welfare Bills or Estimates are discussed in this House.  There are very many people, widows and widowers, who have no proper family income supplement or recognition of the difficulties they have to overcome in trying to rear a family.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair is the boss and I respect the Chair's ruling.  I will continue to make that point until such time as it is rectified.  Unfortunately during the <Col N="1901" /> past 12 months there have been various references to the great achievement of this Minister in bringing in social legislation which puts us on a par with our colleagues in Europe and western democracies with their modernistic approach to life.  People who are finding it very difficult to rear a family are not being properly looked after.  We have more concern for people who do not have the responsibilty of rearing a family than for those who have that responsibility.  I will continue to make that point to a Minister for Social Welfare at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>Many other aspects of this legislation are slightly misleading.  The Minister spoke of the great achievement in allowing women to apply for unemployment assistance.  It subsequently became clear that very few women living at home but available for work will have any chance of getting unemployment assistance because the income of their spouse will be taken into consideration.  Also, social welfare officers may not feel they are available for work simply because no jobs are available in the area.  While a woman will now be able to apply for unemployment assistance, there is no more hope of gaining unemployment assistance then under the existing system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is discrimination in respect of our young population who apply for unemployment assistance but are living at home.  The sum of £29.25 is deducted simply because they are living at home. If they were living in a caravan on the roadside they would get £43 per week but they are penalised if they live at home and receive only about £13 of £14.  While not saying that there is an anti-family bias, it is nevertheless true that a person who has the gall to stay within the family unit will receive a lower social welfare payment because it will be means tested, even though the parents may themselves be dependent on social welfare.  It is wrong to apply that sort of means test to a family whose income is patently insufficient. It is unjust to penalise the second generation simply because they are living at home.  It is not their fault that no jobs are available.  It is partly the Government's fault.  It is certainly the <Col N="1902" /> Government's fault that there is no climate for investment in industry, agriculture or the building industry.</P>
    <P>The Department of Social Welfare simply do not have the necessary money. The delays in processing claims for unemployment assistance are actually criminal.</P>

    <P>While I have pointed out the various aspects of this Bill which I welcome, the Minister has not properly explained to me where the extra money is to come from.  If there is to be a transfer of resources within the Department of Social Welfare, who loses out?  That should be made clear to the Opposition so that they can <Col N="1903" /> be constructive and responsible.  Surely we are entitled to the information which is available to the Department.  We should not have to put down parliamentary questions over the next three weeks to find out how many people are on disability benefit.  This sort of information is available to the Minister on Second Stage.  It would help the debate if we were given the proper information at the outset.</P>
    <P>The family income supplement was the great novel idea of the new Fine Gael Party but it has proved a lamentable failure since so few people have applied or qualified for it.  This is another example of an inadequate response to what is becoming a crisis.</P>

We had a Bill here the week before last under the guise of social legislation whereby the Midland Health Board will have to fund changes, but as they are underfunded at present that will never become a reality.  I should like to be told how this legislation will be effective and where the money will come from to implement these changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on his decision to introduce this Bill and to praise him for doing so because it will end discrimination against something in the region of 46,000 married women.  This is the third of three important EC amendments.  The first was the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1975, and the second was the Employment Equality Act, 1976, both of which I was very glad to use as instruments in my professional career as a trade union official to improve the lot of women.</P>
      <P>I welcome this EC directive and the Minister's intention to bring it in now.  It could have been brought in by previous Governments but they choose not to do so, as also happened in the case of the Vredeling Directive giving information to workers.  It might be salutary to remind some Opposition speakers that they did nothing when they had the chance to introduce it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister pointed out, over 46,000 married women will benefit from the provisions of the Bill and, apart from the effect of the other proposals entitling them to increases for dependants, each receive an increase of £4.50 per week at current rates of benefit.  Married women on unemployment benefit will have the duration of their benefit entitlement extended by 13 weeks up to the 390 days which married men and single women now enjoy.  Furthermore, all married women will be eligible to apply for unemployment assistance subject to their being capable of, available for and genuinely seeking employment in the same way as other applicants and subject to their satisfying the means test.  I was intrigued to <Col N="1905" /> hear the second last Government speaker hinting that this was a device on the part of the Government to hide the unemployment figures.  I see the opposite happening. People who are at present in hidden unemployment, such as housewives, will now make themselves available for work so they will add to the numbers recorded as seeking work and not being able to get it.</P>
    <P>The Minister is often wrongly blamed for being uncaring and callous and it suits some Opposition speakers to project that image.  Anyone who has come through the trade union movement with the distinguished career which the Minister had does not need any defence from me regarding his compassionate outlook.  He has real compassion for people, not the meretricious guff which we hear from people who know very little about the poor in cities.</P>
    <P>The Minister intimated in his speech that he has established a commission to review the whole question of social welfare payments.  As Deputy Barnes said, the time has long since come for the introduction of a simplified social welfare code, the keystone of which would be minimum family income.  It should be easy to understand and to administer and should lay down certain financial entitlements based on a standard family.  The Minister is often accused of being anti-family but he manifestly is not.  However, if the Government could introduce the kind of code to which I referred and indexed in line with the consumer price index, it could be supplemented by way of food, clothing and fuel which we give at present.  It would mean that each family would know their entitlements&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>We cannot have a general discussion on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely mentioned it in passing because it is important, given the Minister's intention to end discrimination, that the system should be made as easy as possible for those who benefit from it to understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to refer to the need <Col N="1906" /> for an improvement in the present system.  The social welfare structure should be decentralised on a regional basis conterminous with the health board areas at present, because it is needlessly cumbersome at the moment.  After long weekends, many social welfare recipients do not get their entitlements because of breakdowns in computers and so on and they are suffering as a result.  I ask the Minister to see what can be done in that regard.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's commitment to removing any element of discrimination in the questioning by deciding officers and other staff.  He said:</P>
    <P>New guidelines will be prepared bringing to the attention of deciding officers and other staff the requirements of the EC directive that no discrimination either in laws or administrative provisions is permissible and that in applying availability for work criteria, there must be no discriminations on the basis of sex, directly or by reference to marital status, in questions asked or conclusions drawn.</P>
    <P>That intrigues me because I have served on many social welfare appeal boards representing the trade union movement and, more directly, the Limerick Council of Trade Unions.  In many cases we come across a woman who has recently had a baby and presents herself for unemployment benefit or assistance.  She is questioned by the deciding officer as to who is available to mind her baby and, in many cases, she states that her sister or her mother can do so.  I know that the deciding officers are humane but they are circumscribed by the existing rules from being more liberal than they would like. However, they are obliged to pursue this line of questioning in regard to married women whereas a married man in the same circumstances would not be asked the same questions although he is the father of the same baby.  Perhaps the Minister would look into this because it is interesting to reflect that under the provisions of the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, you must be in employment for one year before you can pursue a claim to the <Col N="1907" /> Employment Appeals Tribunal.  There are two exemptions from that provision. The first is where one is dismissed on the grounds of belonging to a trade union and the second is if the dismissal was due to having a baby.  Therefore, a woman is protected under one Act for having a baby but is penalised under another because of the traditional attitudes held here.  They were not entirely wrong attitudes but the whole structure of society and attitudes have changed.  The Minister should look at that.</P>
    <P>At present a person made redundant receives a redundancy payment and enjoys 15 months of unemployment benefit.  At the end of that period that person should qualify for unemployment assistance.  However, social welfare officers are now going through a most penal and rigorous form of questioning, asking people where their money is and what they have done with it.  Mr. Con Murphy, the Rights Commissioner, has pointed out that a redundancy for a company is an investment in the future&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I should like to compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.  I must point out to him that many women are at a great disadvantage on the death of their spouse.  The Minister should protect such women by introducing an overall pension scheme providing for the payment of a death-in-service benefit.  Some men are covered by pension schemes but very often they are not. There should be some overall protection <Col N="1908" /> for women and children in such cases. The Minister is aware of my views on that topic.  I suggest that he consult the members of the commission about that and do everything possible to protect the least well off in our society.</P>

      <P>It is only right and fair that we should welcome the Bill late and all that it is.  However, there are elements of hardship in it that could have been avoided.  I understand that the directive was issued in 1978 but it has taken us almost eight years to implement its provisions and apply legal equality to women in the social welfare code.  I am sure the Minister, and all Members, will agree that a lot remains to be done in other areas of discrimination against women.  In many areas it will require a drastic alteration in the attitude of men.</P>
      <P>We welcome the principle of ending discrimination.  The Workers' Party have campaigned for many years for this but the change should have been made in a way that would avoid penalising those on low incomes.  Under the provisions of the bill some families may lose in the region of £20 per week.  In fact, some have estimated that the loss could amount to as high as £40 per week.  I accept that the Minister has said he intends to mitigate those losses to some extent but he has told us that this mitigation will be introduced by way of regulation.  Those regulations, or a draft of them, should be discussed in tandem with the Bill before us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the Bill was published some Government spokesmen indicated that the family income supplement could be used to mitigate the losses to some families. I cannot see how that will be the case.  I hope the Minister will explain the position when replying.  I know that the family income supplement has been used as an excuse for a number of things.  We were told it was introduced to provide an incentive for people on low pay to stay at work but last August we were told it was being used to mitigate the worst effects of the halving of the food subsidies. Again we are being told by some members of the Government that it can <Col N="1909" /> be used to mitigate the effects of the legislation before us on some families. As I understand it the family income supplement is available only to a spouse who is working and has children.</P>
    <P>I agree that treating people equally does not necessarily mean they are being treated fairly.  I assume that is what the Minister meant although the words used could be read in another way.  Obviously, if we are all poor we are all equal but it is not all fair, we are not being treated fairly.  The crucial point in this debate is that a minimum income has to be set for families if we are to avoid the hardships the Bill may inflict on some families.  In some cases it will be disastrous with families losing £20 on an income that is already very low.  Such a reduction will be catastrophic for those families.</P>
    <P>Under the present system most married women are viewed as being dependent on their husbands and are paid less. In such circumstances a married woman on social welfare gets lower benefits than other people but if her husband is on social welfare he will receive extra in respect of his wife and any children. Equalising the benefits paid to men and women can bring losses as well as gains and it is the losses I am most concerned about.</P>
    <P>The inequalities that exist have been mentioned by the Minister and other Members but it is no harm to repeat them.  Married women in receipt of unemployment or disability benefit get £4.50 less per week.  Women get unemployment benefit for 52 weeks whereas men get it for 65 weeks.  Married women cannot normally apply for unemployment assistance.  Adult dependant allowances are normally paid to husbands but not wives on social welfare and the child dependant allowances are normally payable to fathers but not mothers on social welfare.</P>
    <P>The Government would not dare, I hope, reduce general benefits to the level of married women's benefits.  What they are proposing in this legislation is to raise it by £4.50 in most cases and to extend the duration to 65 weeks.  One of the problems is that, while they are proposing <Col N="1910" /> to do this, it is six months late and there is no proposal in this legislation to apply retrospection.  Despite the fact that £17 million was set aside in last year's budget to apply to the equalisation legislation, not one penny has been paid out in that way, although it has probably been used in other directions.  The Government are fighting in the courts against paying retrospection. A number of women have already brought cases to the courts and they have been referred to the European Court to gain retrospection of these benefits.</P>
    <P>The combined effect of the changes proposed will be disastrous in a number of households.  Depending on the number of children, families living mainly on social welfare could lose between £20 and £40 per week.  The only people to gain will be households where the man is employed and the woman is on unemployment, disability or some other benefit.  Her income will rise by approximately £4.50 per week and his will be unaffected.  However, in households where the man and woman are both social welfare recipients, her small increase of £4.50 will be more than offset by the large decrease in his payments because he will lose the adult dependant's allowance which at the moment is £24.15 if she is ill or unemployed, £30.80 if he is on a contributory pension, and £22.30p if he is on urban unemployment assistance. Households where the man is on social welfare and the woman is employed fares worst of all.  He simply loses the adult dependant's allowance plus half the child benefit allowances while she gains nothing. This means an unemployed father of four will lose £41.72p and his wife may not be earning very much more.</P>
    <P>The Minister has suggested that he will introduce cushions, ceilings and floors. Obviously this is being introduced in the face of considerable opposition from the trade unions and women's groups who have made considerable representations to him on the proposals in this legislation. As I understand it, the proposals he is talking about will be where both partners are drawing social welfare, about 8,000 couples, and a cushion payment of about <Col N="1911" /> £10 a week will be made for the duration of any claim or a maximum of a year &mdash; I think that is what the Minister stated in his speech but if I am wrong, perhaps he would indicate where.  This means that instead of losing £30.80p a week right away a man on a pension will lose £20.80p and he will have a year, at most, to get used to the idea of losing the £30.80p.</P>
    <P>Where one partner is working and the other is on social welfare, an earnings ceiling of about £50 per week is proposed, below which the working spouses earnings will be &ldquo;reviewed as inconsiderable&rdquo;, to use the Bill's terminology.  This apparently means that the working spouse continues to be viewed as a dependant and the other spouse can continue to draw the adult dependant allowance. People working less than 18 hours a week will also normally be classed as dependants. It seems that some 3,000 women whose husbands are on social welfare earn less than £50 a week.  They will benefit from the earnings ceiling in the sense that their husbands will not lose the adult dependant's allowance, but another 9,000 families where the woman is earning over £50 a week &mdash; as I understand it at least half the women in that category earn under £100 a week &mdash; will lose out badly.  Unless the woman earns in excess of £72 to £80 per week, the household would be better off if she earned less than £50 a week.</P>
    <P>It seems that having a single ceiling set at such a very low level will have disastrous effects.  It will create anomalies between people earning just below and just above the ceiling.  It will create incentives for both employers and employees to keep certain workers' wages just below the ceiling and it will act as a further discentive to women entering and remaining in the labour market.  It will also perpetuate the undesirable distinction between part time workers, who are typically low paid, non-union, uninsured and legally unprotected, and the rest of the workforce.</P>
    <P>If there is to be an earnings ceiling it should be much higher and it should be <Col N="1912" /> graduated.  The Minister indicated that a graduated ceiling would cause complications and would make it unnecessarily complicated for the recipient to understand and perhaps for the Department to administer.  I doubt if the social welfare code as it exists could be made much more complicated.  It is a maze into which few people like to enter.  I doubt if there are more than half a dozen people who fully know the implications and complications of the system.</P>
    <P>As to the administration of the system, we are led to believe that the Department are computerising and have advanced a considerable distance in that regard.  I am also led to believe that there is very little in the area of complicated paper work that computers cannot manage.  Therefore the Minister is not making a valid case when he pleads an unwillingness to complicate the system further or pleads administrative complications.  I understand the Irish Congress of Trade Unions have indicated that the ceiling should not be less than £100 a week, with marginal relief as in the tax system for those whose incomes are only slightly above that level. As to unemployment assistance, married women should have been getting higher social welfare benefits since December 1984 but they have not been getting them, and, as I mentioned already, there is a legal challenge in relation to benefits.  It has been sidestepped, having been heard before the European Court which is a notoriously slow forum out of which to get a decision.  As the Bill stands, even the married women who do apply for unemployment assistance in future and manage to convince the social welfare officers that they are genuinely available for work and actively seeking employment will not gain anything financially. The legislation is specifically designed to ensure that there is no financial advantage in being unemployed as against being an adult dependant.  If an unemployed woman signs on and gets unemployment assistance in her own right, her husband's social welfare payment will be reduced accordingly.  This is simply a ploy to dissuade unemployed married women from signing on.  Already there is a great <Col N="1913" /> pressure on these not to sign on, because of the considerable difficulties that are placed in their way.  I referred in previous debates to the manner in which married women are constantly obliged to appeal and in many cases are not even advised of their right to appeal against refusal. They have to inquire further as to their rights.</P>
    <P>The view is given that it would not be fair to treat couples differently just because the women is part of the labour force as opposed to staying at home.  The effect of this measure is to replace the present overt sex discrimination by discrimination based on marital status. It means that two people receive lower payments if they are married than if they are single.  This contrasts sharply with the tax treatment of married and single people following the Murphy case which required exact parity.  There may well be scope for similar constitutional action if this legislation goes through as it stands.</P>
    <P>Deputies Prendergast and Barnes have referred to what I consider to be one of the most persistent, insulting and unacceptable forms of discrimination against women in the social welfare system &mdash; the practice of asking mothers who claim unemployment assistance about child care and other domestic circumstances and arrangements.  Despite what the Minister has said, that the law does not discriminate as between men and women in this regard, the practice with regard to application for unemployment assistance by a man and a woman is very different. Deputy Prendergast gave the example of a woman who had recently given birth to a child being asked what arrangements she had made to have the child minded. I have yet to come across a case of a man whose wife recently gave birth to a child being asked what arrangements he has made to have the child minded.  The reality is that there is discrimination against married women in practice, despite the fact that the legislation is neutral on the issue.</P>
    <P>I said in the beginning that the elimination of much of the discrimination against women will depend on the changing <Col N="1914" /> of attitudes, particularly among men but also among some women, in relation to the status of women and their place in society.  The practice of discriminating against married women who apply for social welfare payments derives directly from the attitude of men who primarily run the system, formulate the regulations and implement them.</P>
    <P>The outrageous presumptions behind the practice have been repeatedly challenged over the years, but to little avail. Considerable efforts were made by trade unions and others to secure specific mention of the practice in any new legislation, significantly outlawing this as constitutional discrimination.  However, despite the promises to consider the matter there is no reference to it in this Bill and that is a serious omission.  The Minister has, I understand, suggested instead that social welfare officials might start asking fathers as well as mothers about child care arrangements.  That is not the answer. That will not alter the attitudes to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>We generally welcome the ending of legal discrimination against women in the social welfare code as proposed in this Bill.  There are other areas of discrimination which can only be dealt with by a much wider approach to changing attitudes and ending sexism.  I deplore the fact that the legislation as it stands will hit very many low income families. Despite the proposal suggested by the Minister to mitigate the effects on most people affected, there will still be many thousands of families fairly severely hit by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The whole social welfare code, as I have mentioned on a number of occasions, needs to be totally reviewed.  The commission which the Minister has established are looking into the matter and the Minister says that he hopes to have their blueprint within about a year.  The Workers' Party made a substantial submission to that commission, urging that the taxation and the social welfare system should be meshed together to ensure that there is a basic minimum income available to all families in this State.</P>
    <P>I hope to introduce some amendments <Col N="1915" /> on Committee Stage of this Bill and trust that the Minister will give them favourable consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise initially to support and welcome the Bill but, like many speakers, I decry the fact that it has taken so long for the Bill to come before the Houses of the Oireachtas, particularly since its publication at the end of 1984.</P>
      <P>Like the last speaker and many others, I feel that there are not enough safeguards to ensure that low income families, in particular, will not suffer undue hardship.  As many safeguards as I would think necessary have not been built into the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5 of the Bill, dealing with maternity allowance increases, could have been used very effectively to cater for a growing number of women who temporarily find themselves leaving the workforce to have a baby, or to care for a sick member of the family.  I and my party have already urged the Minister, in this House and outside it, to introduce a system of credits for such women.  Such a system would ensure that while a women would receive no benefits during an absence of one or two years, she would be able to re-enter the workforce without any break in her contributions sequence. The Minister will know I raised a question here on a number of occasions relating in particular to a woman who makes a conscious decision to nurse her baby. When her maternity allowance or benefit runs out she is left with the option of going on unemployment or of applying for disability benefit.  She cannot be entitled to disability benefit because she is not disabled or sick but, on the other hand, she cannot qualify for unemployment because although she is available for work the facilities necessary for her to take her child to work are not available in every employment.  By introducing a system of credits for such women, at least it would get over the difficulties many of them have of re-entering the workforce after a period of absence.  Section 5 could <Col N="1916" /> have been used to incorporate that type of change in the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>Section 13 deals with the calculation of means.  I am sure Deputy De Rossa will agree with me that one of our greatest difficulties as public representatives is that means testing is decided by an individual officer or official of the Department of Social Welfare and in different cases it is not uniform in its application.  I do not think it would have been too much to ask the Department to consider, as was asked by the Joint Committee on Women's Rights, to train a corps of people within the Department to become expert in means testing so that irrespective of the part of the country concerned we would have a uniform system.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker spoke about a matter I dealt with on a number of occasions and one about which I feel very strongly.  All public representatives have had representations regarding the main area of discrimination in the social welfare code as far as married women are concerned, namely, the difficulties experienced by them in qualifying for unemployment benefit.  In this connection I refer in particular to the discriminatory questions that are put to them.  I reject out of hand the suggestion often made by the Department officials, and one that I understand was made earlier by the Minister, that such questions should be asked of the father in the case of a married man.  I reject that totally. These questions that usually relate to the care of children in the event of the mother obtaining work have to be rejected.  It is time for the Department and for the Minister to face up to reality.  The result of such questioning is that the majority of women never get a chance to re-enter the workforce.</P>
    <P>In my experience the kind of questions I am referring to are never put to men and they lead many to the assumption that in this country child neglect is brought about by women.  In its own way that makes women subconsciously feel that in some way they are inadequate as housewives and mothers and are not able <Col N="1917" /> to cope with rearing their children properly. That is wrong.  I ask the Minister to establish regulations and to issue guidelines to all examining officers with a view to the total elimination of discriminatory questions.  These guidelines should be established immediately to enable the departmental officers at all hearings held under the social welfare code to conduct their questioning both of men and women in an open and fair fashion and without any vestige of discrimination.  In the absence of such guidelines, officers of the Department cannot be blamed totally for bringing their set of values to bear on decision-making.  I hope the Minister will consider this point between now and Committee Stage and that perhaps he will come forward with an appropriate amendment.</P>
    <P>It is worth noting that in the first annual report of the Ombudsman issued last March almost half of the complaints made about Government Departments related to the Department of Social Welfare. I should like to put on record that long delays that add to the hardship of social welfare recipients are totally unacceptable. I am sure the Minister will agree with that.  The main sufferers in such a situation are women, many of whom depend on social welfare payments to meet their day-to-day needs.</P>
    <P>All of us are conscious of the present difficult financial times, of the recession and so on but one way in which the system could be improved immediately at little or no additional expense would be to extend decision-making powers to local social welfare officers.  At present the majority of decisions are referred to Dublin and this leads to long delays.  Why do we not accept now the need for decentralising the claims processing work&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not wish to interrupt the Deputy but I must point out she is moving away from the Bill.  The Chair has ruled already on that point.  While the matters may be relevant to the social welfare code they are not relevant to the Bill before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Geoghegan-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The directive was issued by the EC and now it is being implemented by us six months after it should have been implemented.  Because of the long delay many of us thought that in a number of areas where there is enormous discrimination against women and that were not covered by the directive they would have been covered in this legislation.  It is a great tragedy that the opportunity has not been availed of by the Department or the Minister to have these areas included.  I am trying to make the point to the Minister that on Committee Stage he might bring in a number of amendments to ensure that as far as possible inequalities now existing are eradicated.</P>
      <P>Many women who have to claim social welfare payments find it necessary to bring their children with them to the offices and that can add enormously to the frustrations and difficulties of the women.  The facilities provided in the majority of such offices and in employment exchanges are appalling and are totally unacceptable &mdash; I note that the Minister is nodding his head in agreement. As an urgent requirement we should have some facility, even a small room that could be used as a playroom for young children, in such offices.  That would help enormously.  The absence of such an amenity is an indication of the neglect on the part of officialdom &mdash; I blame all of us for this &mdash; of the special needs of mothers.</P>
      <P>In recent years more and more people have fallen into what the sociologists call the poverty trap.  Women who a few years ago knew nothing about social welfare are now a part of the system and they depend on it totally for their most basic requirements.  It is strange that women in general do not regard social welfare payments as something to which they are entitled.  They think there is a stigma attached to applying for and receiving benefits.  I realise the Department are making every effort to cope with an increasingly huge workload and to administer the code in as sympathetic and efficient a manner as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1919" /> Many women often find officers insensitive or unhelpful and usually come away from their encounters with them feeling depressed and inadequate.  Many people who are dependent on social welfare find they have tremendous difficulty in understanding official forms and communications. There are two Departments concerned with this area, the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of the Public Service.  They should pay attention to this area and ensure that communications and correspondence sent to the public are in language which is simple and easy to understand.  They should not need a Member of the House or a community officer to explain what their entitlements are to them.</P>
    <P>There are a substantial number of low income families who, as a result of this legislation, will be worse off then they were before.  The safeguards the Minister stated he was building into the legislation are not sufficient to take account of that large number of families.  We are all agreed that between now and Committee Stage the Minister might have another look at this aspect of the legislation which is extremely worrying.  I should like to see further safeguards built into the system to ensure that as far as possible these families are not worse off.</P>
    <P>In these areas and in a substantial number of others, inequalities have existed.  The six month period between the circulation of the legislation and its introduction into the House could have been used by the Minister and his officials to look at some of the most important areas where discrimination and inequality exist against women.  If these areas were remedied they could have been incorporated into the Bill and it would have been a more comprehensive and a better Bill.  I ask the Minister to look at the points I have mentioned between now and Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an important Bill and one that has the overall approval of the majority of Deputies.  There has been <Col N="1920" /> blatant discrimination against women in regard to social welfare payments.  This Bill will remedy that and prevent it from happening.</P>
      <P>The Bill is welcome but I ask the Minister to consider if some effort could be made by the Department to ensure that this Bill or any other Bill brought forward by the Minister does not lead to further increases in PRSI.  This is causing concern to employers.  PRSI is now acting as a deterrent to employment.  In some instances it is causing a problem for employers who are anxious to retain their staff but who find it difficult to meet these PRSI payments.  I ask the Minister to look at that matter.  It may not be under his control&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to bear this aspect in mind because it is important. Directive No. 79/7/EEC was adopted by the Council of Ministers on 19 December 1978.  All EC directives are very important and well intentioned.  They help to eliminate discriminations and inequities.  However, we must bear in mind some of the problems these EC directives cause.  A number of them should be looking at the ability and capacity of employers in industry to meet these payments.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that, but it is important.  The Bill is based on an EC directive.  These directives are important and the Minister referred to some of the earlier directives, particularly the one which deals with equal pay for equal work.  It is essential that the EC should have a commitment to improve the overall environment for creating work in this and other EC countries.</P>
      <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn mentioned problems which are arising regarding social welfare offices.  The accommodation for people visiting social welfare offices should be improved.  A social welfare officer rents the accommodation.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>This is relevant.  Women will be signing on at labour exchanges. Many of them will have children with them and will be forced to stand in the rain, frost and snow with their babies and children.  People calling to these offices should have proper accommodation provided for them.  I will not labour the point other than to say that it is important for the Minister to look at this area.  The situation is serious and deserves to be closely studied by the Minister and the Department.</P>
      <P>This is a fine Bill but legislation of this kind is only a cosmetic exercise because, while it is important, the problem is that there are so many young women and men who for one reason or another, but partly because of the tax structure and the PRSI position, will not be able to find work. Therefore, while we welcome the Bill we would be better employed in this House in trying to devise methods to enable us to create much more mobility in the open market.  I appreciate that this is a Government rather than specifically a social welfare matter, but we must endeavour to change the tax structure so as to render it worth while for a woman to retire from work during the important formative years of her children.  In this way, too, we would be creating more openings for young men and women.</P>
      <P>The Minister is a man of great capacity in terms of work.  I urge him to give much more thought to trying to create an environment for work.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputies for their <Col N="1922" /> interest in this complex measure, a measure that has posed considerable difficulty for the Department.  As the files in the Department indicate, this issue has caused much difficulty for successive Ministers for Social Welfare.</P>
      <P>There is an impression that I am engaging in a sleight of hand exericse in clawing back money here or there and that at the end of the day we will be simply availing of the existing resources of the Department.  That is not the case.  The implementation of equal treatment of men and women within the social welfare framework will cost additional moneys, many additional millions of pounds.  In a situation in which our resources are very severely stretched, I had to go to the Government last year and say that within the context of the Estimates for the years 1985 to 1987 I needed money to implement the directive to which this legislation relates.</P>
      <P>Deputy Cowen said he did not know where the money would come from to pay for the increases in benefit to married women and he asked who would loss out following the implementation of the legislation.  As I said during previous debates on this issue, there is a special provision of more than £13 million in this year's Estimate for the Department of Social Welfare in respect of the implementation of equal treatment for men and women.  The money required in this respect is not being taken from any other area of my Department's budget.  That has been established beyond controversy and without qualification.  What is involved is a net increase in the Estimate for this year to provide for the introduction of equal treatment.  Therefore, the question of off-setting savings does not arise. The package will cost an additional and substantial number of millions of pounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have not delayed the introduction of the legislation.  It required complex drafting and that task has been in process in the Department for the best part of two years.  It has necessitated a series of Government decisions.  With respect to Deputy Cowen's party, not a great deal of work was done in this respect by his colleagues when in Government.  The <Col N="1923" /> cost of the implementation of this legislation is not being met by way of a reallocation of resources.  Interestingly, enough, Deputy De Rossa asked whether the family income supplement might be used to alleviate the losses involved.  Theoretically it is possible that where one spouse is in employment and earning just over the limit for that relief and where the other spouse is on a flat rate, there might be a small family income supplement entitlement but this would arise only in a very small number of cases.  However, it is an interesting point and one which I shall go into.</P>
    <P>I shall deal in a general way with a number of other points that were raised. Deputies O'Leary, McCarthy, De Rossa and others, too, raised the question of the dependency arrangements.  I was glad to hear that the Deputies welcomed the elimination of discrimination in the social welfare area but Deputies gave the impression that perhaps equal treatment could be implemented without there being a reduction in any respect and that is not possible.  There must be some realignment of benefits.  Perhaps the Deputies could produce some magic formula that has eluded us.  It is clear that any such formula eluded Deputy Haughey when he was Minister for Social Welfare.  He would lead us to believe that very little eluded him but he did not find the magic formula in terms of adjusting the system.  Without a massive injection of financial resources &mdash; and most of any such money would not go in the right direction &mdash; it would be impossible to introduce equal treatment without some beneficiaries suffering a reduction and a realignment in their treatment.</P>
    <P>Only a small number will be involved in any such change.  This arises because all married women are now treated automatically as their husbands' dependants, based not on income but on one criterion only, the fact that they happen to be living with their husbands.  There can be no other criterion.  If I may put it in a capsule, we are getting away from a sex-differentiated basis to an income-differentiated basis.  Equal treatment <Col N="1924" /> demands, the directive demands &mdash; and I must remain within the framework of the directive; otherwise we would be sent off to the European Court for further investigation &mdash; that whatever conditions apply to men must apply equally to women.  If no married men are to suffer a reduction in their entitlement &mdash; and the only reductions are in respect of a small number of married men &mdash; then all wives would have to be entitled to increases for their husbands simply because they are living with them.  On that basis equal treatment would cost an extra £100 million. There is no way, in the context of the implementation of equal treatment, that resources of that nature are available to the State.  In any event if we were to apply it on that basis in the vast majority of cases such husbands &mdash; because they are in full time employment, by no reasonable standard could be deemed to be their wives' dependants.  Equal treatment must therefore involve a revision of the present dependency conditions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the earnings rule and the transitional measures proposed, I am proposing in the Bill an enabling power which will mitigate the effects of the equal treatment provisions to a large extent.  We could not enact a Bill which would continue to regard spouses with substantial earnings as dependants of spouses whose social welfare payments were much lower than their actual earnings.</P>
    <P>The question of retrospection of the implementation date was raised by Deputies Yates, De Rossa and others.  A problem would arise there.  To put it in a capsule: do we retrospectively claw back money we have given people?  I do not think that would be very popular in this House because what is sauce for the equality goose must be sauce for the equality gander if I may use a rather sexist analogy, if there is one.  Far from clawing back money, or docking money on a retrospective basis, it is best that we have a forward date for implementation.</P>
    <P>The package as a whole constitutes a reasonably balanced and equitable approach to providing equal treatment, involving the removal of the automatic <Col N="1925" /> presumption of dependency of married women and conferring on them, in consequence, full entitlement to social welfare rights.  Clearly retrospection cannot arise in the case of the elements of the package which involve reduced entitlement. There is then no case in principle for allowing it in regard to the other elements because there would be very considerable costs and other implications.  Even with approval of the Bill I shall have considerable difficulty implementing its provisions because of the tightness of staff resources, the amount of work to be done in ascertaining a lot of information which will have to be married into payments. As the House is aware at present anybody with an RSI number is paid the particular benefit entitlement and then only when one applies for dependency is one allocated that.  Of course the question of ensuring full cross reference is a major one.</P>
    <P>I must emphasise that there will be a major volume of work involved in my Department in implementing the provisions of the Bill.  For example, 46,000 married women's claims will have to be re-rated and the dependency position of some 200,000 cases of social welfare will have to be examined by means of the issue of questionnaires and their processing which will be a complex procedure. For every 1,000 questionnaires one will have 100 people who will be affected much less.  Of course there the prospects of political exploitation by those who want to exploit it.  But then I have become used to that and somewhat pragmatic about the way the system is exploited, in particular for political purposes.</P>
    <P>At present my Department are also in the process of a major re-design of our computer system which must be completed before the equal treatment provisions can be accommodated within that system.  I shall be going ahead with all expedition on that computer work and we shall not delay in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputies Yates and Cowen also referred to the position of deserted husbands and widowers and the provisions of the directive.  The directive is quite specific in the areas it covers.  It extends <Col N="1926" /> to schemes of unemployment, of sickness, of invalidity, old age and accidents at work.  Survivor benefits and family benefits are specifically excluded from the directive.  The Community farming the directive recognised that there would have been great difficulty is most member states in implementing equal treatment under such schemes because there is no great uniformity in that area.  In view of the multiplicity of such schemes there would be enormous difficulty encountered in endeavouring to bring a degree of uniformity into that area.  That is the framework within which this directive is being introduced.</P>
    <P>Deputies Barnes, Yates, McCarthy and Prendergast raised the issue of the questioning of married women who apply for unemployment benefit.  I referred to that matter in my opening remarks.  I want to say initially that the files in my Department show that a large number of married women, with children, already qualify for unemployment benefit.  A great variety of formal and informal child-minding arrangements are accepted by deciding officers in these cases.  Deputies &mdash; I suffered from this myself over the years &mdash; tend to regard the cases they encounter frequently as being the generality of complaints and very many of us are not objective in our analysis of the situation.  It is true that in determining claims for unemployment benefit or assistance deciding officers must satisfy themselves that the claimant concerned is available for work.  To so satisfy themselves they must try to ascertain all of the facts of the case.  If there is any element of doubt in the matter deciding officers are obliged to query the position by asking the claimant any questions they feel may be relevant to the case.  Information about the applicants on their efforts to obtain employment and whether he or she is registered with manpower and the type of work the claimant is seeking and whether or not there are factors which would prevent the claimant taking up work if work were offered, must be recorded.  There is no doubt that, where a claimant is in charge of minors, this can affect either his or her availability for <Col N="1927" /> employment.  Some married women with young children can be quite readily seen to be unavailable for employment from the information they give about their circumstances and others will be seen not only as being available for employment but as making every effort to get employment. In other cases there will be some doubt and it is in relation to that category of claimant that questions relating to family circumstances are still pertinent because they may help to show whether or not the claimant is available for work.</P>
    <P>I accept that it is a highly subjective area but it is an area where the deciding officer or the appeals officer has statutory powers.  Questions relating to child care and maintenance are designed to try to establish these facts and the deciding officer or the appeals officer is concerned only with the claimant's circumstances in so far as he needs to be satisfied that the claimant is free and willing to take up employment.  It is not the case that claimants are rejected merely because they have young children.  That impression is frequently abroad but it is not the position. I will take all necessary steps to ensure that there is no discrimination in that regard.</P>
    <P>In view of the concern expressed by Deputies here, I will be taking the necessary steps to ensure that in future all conditions relating to entitlement to unemployment benefit and all inquiries made in connection with these conditions are applied impartially as to the sex of the applicants, and new guidelines will be prepared bringing to the attention of the deciding officers and other staffs in the Department the requirement of the EC directive that no discrimination either in our laws or in our administrative provisions is permissable and that any applied availability for work criteria must not discriminate on the basis of sex directly or by reference to martial status in questions asked or in conclusions drawn.  I cannot be more specific than that.  Yesterday afternoon I met a delegation from the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  This matter was raised in discussing the Bill <Col N="1928" /> and I gave a clear assurance to them on that issue.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies referred to alleviating measures I propose to introduce under the enabling powers of the Bill. There were calls for a higher level of earnings to be disregarded.  Deputies Yates and De Rossa suggested that I might consider a graduated earnings rule, but that could not be contemplated.  I explained in my speech why a graduated earnings rule is not operationally possible at present.  I discussed this matter with the congress delegation as well and with other interested parties.  We have no objection in principle to the question of graduated earnings.  If there were graduated structures it would reduce the scope for a poverty trap situation developing but its implementation would place enormous strain on the employment exchanges.</P>
    <P>I do not want to go at great length into the difficulties which any sort of complicated dependency rules would bring about but the introduction of an earnings floor would undoubtedly complicate the payment delivery system.  It would affect the overall level of service which the Department give the public and this is a crucial issue at a time when there are staffing restrictions and a massive increase in claim load which are already combining to put the system under enormous pressure.  For this reason the rule must be simple and straightforward so that it will be easy for claimants to understand and will not increase significantly the amount of time needed to process applications and make payments which would disimprove the service to social welfare beneficiaries.  There are difficulties in that area.</P>
    <P>In relation to a high earnings floor, it is not just an administrative problem but there is a degree of substantial objection in principle to an exceptionally high earnings floor.  We must keep in mind a number of aspects in setting a level on the earnings floor.  It should not be set at a level effectively breaching the proposed statutory dependency principle which terms a spouse as an adult dependant only if he or she is wholly or mainly <Col N="1929" /> maintained by the other spouse so that the higher the earnings floor the more one breaches the dependency rule and then one is coming up to the wire in terms of the directive itself.  It should not be set at a level which would create a particular benefit for some families to have one spouse in employment and the other spouse on social welfare benefit rather than having both of them in employment.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of two families. Where a family have three children and are living on social welfare payments with no other income they would have £88.35 per week.  This would create a serious anomaly and there would be a degree of inequity arising.  Therefore I have pitched a level of an earnings floor.  I have indicated to the House that I considered £50 to be a basic level and £10 on the outer mitigating transitional arrangements.  I have discussed the matter the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who made strenuous representations to me on the matter.  I have agreed to consider those representations and have taken careful note of the points made by the Deputies on this measure.  I will conclude by thanking Deputies for their contributions to the Second Stage debate and I assure them that the points made will be carefully considered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I did not get an opportunity to deal with a number of points raised by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn.  She expressed her concern about facilities for women in employment exchanges, and a large number of women will be going in.  I have indicated that 46,000 married women are going into employment exchanges which need to have their whole edifice improved substantially.  As she indicated, rightly, many of our employment exchanges, including that in Galway which is deplorably bad, are wholly inadequate where young children come in with their mothers who may be claiming.  I assure the Deputy that I will make every effort in that regard throughout the country. Very substantial improvements have taken place in many of the exchanges but the work is progressing painfully slowly. I am bringing considerable pressure to bear on the OPW in that regard and <Col N="1930" /> in some instances they have responded while in others they are painfully slow. Nevertheless, I assure Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that I will endeavour to remedy that situation.</P>
    <P>In many other parts of the country, particularly in areas like Ballybough where the employment exchange will be up and coming shortly, Clondalkin and the outer conurbation suburbs of Dublin where we should have employment exchanges sited.  I have been working on that also and I am quite determined that the facilities should be of outstanding quality, as good as, for example the new employment exchange at Tara Street and the first floor of Apollo House where staff can meet fellow Irishmen and women in conditions where they are able to do their work and where people are treated with the respect, concern and care which we are all entitled to in our applications within the system.  I assure Deputies that I am working in that regard and the work will be ongoing. Accordingly, I thank Deputies for their contributions and look forward to further discussion in due course on Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>Deputy John O'Leary has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of a Private Notice Question today.  Deputy O'Leary will have to read his Private Notice Question if he has it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>I gave notice of my intention to ask a Private Notice Question, <Col N="1931" /> namely, to ask the Minister for Labour if he will personally intervene as a matter of extreme urgency to settle the strike at Tuf Shoes factory in Killarney, County Kerry, in view of the proposals to wind down operations in the factory as from tomorrow, Wednesday, 26 June 1985 and the serious danger of the loss of 100 jobs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
      <P>I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me permission to raise this matter on the Adjournment of the Dáil tonight.  First of all, this strike has been on since 7 June and I understand that there has been no direct intervention by the Minister so far. I understand also that a meeting has been arranged between the management and the union for Thursday but my latest information tonight is that the management will just inform the union again that they intend to stick to their decision.</P>
      <P>The history of this industry is most interesting.  This industry was started by people making handmade shoes in 1881. In 1936 the present premises were built and occupied by a firm known as Hilliard and Palmer who were most successful in the manufacture of footwear.  In 1963-64 this company was taken over by G.B. Britten and operated under G.B. Britten for a few years.  Then a company known as Tuf Shoes, Killarney, was formed and the company has been trading since then as Tuf Shoes, Killarney.  I understand that this industry reached its peak in the late sixties and the seventies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past three or four years persons who left or retired were not replaced due to what is termed natural wastage. It is well known that employees in the clothing and footwear industries are not paid as well as employees in other manufacturing industries and this must be taken very much into account when considering the situation which now prevails in the Tuf Shoes factory in Killarney.  We must also bear in mind the fact that all the employees of the company have given loyal and faithful service to the company. Very few firms and manufacturing companies in this country have had such a loyal and faithful staff as have Tuf Shoes, <Col N="1932" /> Killarney, and their predecessors in the running of this enterprise.  Tuf Shoes, Killarney, supplied the Army and the prison service with boots, shoes and footwear for a long number of years. They also supplied the Department of Posts and Telegraphs and the ESB for many years.</P>
    <P>The company proposed some time ago to make 25 to 30 employees redundant on the grounds that it is the intention of the company to rationalise operations in the plant.  The kernel of the problem is the rate of redundancy to be paid to those being made redundant.  I understand that the company decided to pay more or less according to the Act which would entail half a week's pay for every year of service plus a week's pay.  I understand also that this was discussed by the Labour Court and also by the Conciliation and Arbitration Board but the employees are not happy about the method by which the assessment and the award were made by the Labour Court and by the Conciliation and Arbitration Board.</P>
    <P>Management say that the whole purpose of the rationalisation programme is to hold on to the 95 jobs.  Very few are disputing this.  The kernel of the problem is the rate of redundancy which the company propose to pay to their employees. Common sense must prevail and there is an obligation on the Minister to intervene personally in this case.  One of the major functions of the Minister for Labour and his Department is to monitor disputes, particularly disputes leading to a strike and the possibility of ultimate closure of an industrial enterprise.  In this case we are talking about an industry which is perhaps the oldest in Killarney, if not in all County Kerry.</P>
    <P>Killarney has suffered much from unemployment in recent years and the rate of emigration, particularly among young people, has been alarmingly high during the past year.  Employees are anxious to know whether the Labour Court when assessing the situation took into account the company's profits in recent years.  I appeal to the Minister to intervene immediately, to call both sides <Col N="1933" /> together to settle the dispute and save the 95 jobs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I can readily understand Deputy O'Leary's concern in raising this matter since it affects his constituency.  He and the other Deputies in the constituency of South Kerry are legitimately concerned.  I wish to restate the responsibilities of the Minister for Labour in the area of industrial relations.  The role of the Minister for Labour is to ensure that there is an adequate and effective system of industrial relations machinery available to both sides within the operation of our open, democratic system to enable them to resolve whatever differences arise in a manner which results in the minimum disruption in terms of industrial stoppages.</P>
      <P>As a corollary to that, I do not believe it is the responsibility of the Minister to intervene directly in individual disputes unless there are overriding reasons of a nationwide dimension that would warrant it.  My immediate predecessor, Deputy Liam Kavanagh, was very strongly of this view and established a position which has strengthened the entire industrial relations machinery.  If participants on either side felt that they could have a fast track to the Minister for Labour of the day they would disregard all the intermediate stages in the industrial relations field and would not avail of the professional machinery that exists to enable them to resolve their disputes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not a professional industrial relations specialist, nor have been most of my predecessors.  There are, however, in the Labour Court, the trade union movement and the employers' organisations people whose skill it is to assist in the resolution of such disputes and who have given their life to such work.  It is our responsibility as a Legislature and my responsibility as Minister for Labour to ensure that the skilled people in the area are given the support of our system of enable them to bring about a resolution of a conflict wherever it arises in the industrial relations scheme.  I believe this is the correct position for the Minister <Col N="1934" /> and the Department of Labour.</P>
    <P>This dispute essentially concerns the 24th pay round and the terms of a redundancy programme proposed by the management. Following conciliation conferences the Labour Court investigated both issues.  As the House knows, the Labour Court is a body representing the social partners and independent members and has won the trust and respect of both sides of industry over many years.  Indeed, the Labour Court is literally as old as myself, established in the year of my birth.  It has a whole body of case law and precedent.  In this case the recommendation of the Labour Court was firstly, that the company's offer of a 3 per cent wage increase for six months, followed by a review after implementation of a rationalisation programme, should be accepted by the workforce; secondly, workers made redundant under the rationalisation programme should receive their statutory entitlements only. This is the nub of the issue.</P>
    <P>The workers represented by the Irish Transport and General Workers Union rejected both the Labour Court recommendations and strike action started on 6 June last.  It is understood that the company improved on the terms recommended by the Labour Court but that this improvement was not acceptable to the union.  The company have indicated that no further improvement is possible and that they propose to wind down operations if there is not a return to work by Wednesday, 26 June.</P>
    <P>My Department were aware of this problem.  We have a monitoring group which was established by Deputy O'Leary's namesake when Minister for Labour.  The monitoring group have been in contact with the Labour Court, who have arranged for an industrial relations officer to convene another conciliation conference on Thursday in Mallow.  Both sides have indicated that they will attend the conference.  I would support that meeting and publicly request the company to defer any action which they were proposing for tomorrow until such time as the outcome of the meeting with the IRO is known.  I do not see that I can do <Col N="1935" /> anything more which would be helpful to the interests of the workers in the Tuf factory in Killarney.  It is for their union representatives to negotiate an improved settlement if that is possible and for the company to respond as best they can.</P>
    <P>The position is, quite clearly, that the industrial relations which exist have been brought into play and made available to both sides.  As Deputy O'Leary said, there is a history related to this factory and we know that the shoe industry has gone through a certain amount of restructuring and market change.  I urge both sides to approach the conciliation conference in Mallow on Thursday in a spirit of constructive compromise, with a view to finding a satisfactory solution to this <Col N="1936" /> problem.  that is all that I can do and I ask everybody to refrain from making any further comment on the dispute at this stage so that the outcome of the conciliation conference will not be prejudiced.</P>

Such a statement could not appropriately be made at Question Time.  I have, however, dealt with various aspects of the subject in replies to Dáil questions and in other statements in recent months.  I have now placed in the Library copies of a recent lengthy address on the subject of pollution of sea and air which I delivered at a public meeting in Dublin on 22 April last.

      <P>On 18 June, I made regulations entitled Control of Atmospheric Pollution (Licensing) Regulations, 1985, which deal with air pollution caused by the extraction or recovery of certain metals from scrap metal, waste material and waste cable and which establish a licensing system, to be operated by sanitary authorities, for any trade, works or process in which burning or the application of heat is used to extract or recover such metals.  I have already informed the House that comprehensive new air pollution legislation, which will take account of national and international requirements, is at an advanced stage of preparation and I hope to be in a position to introduce the Bill in the autumn.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 19 together.  Bord na Móna operate three superannuation schemes; one for their general employees, one for their regular employees and one for whole-time members of the board.  It is assumed that the Deputy's questions relate to the Turf Development Act, 1953 (Regular Works Employees) Superannuation Scheme, 1963 and its amending schemes.</P>
      <P>The 1963 scheme, and seven subsequent amending schemes, have received the approval of the Minister and the concurrence of the Minister for the Public Service, or the Minister for Finance as provided in earlier legislation.  Before the schemes were made, they were published in accordance with the provisions of section 6 of the Turf Development Act, 1953.  When the schemes were made, they were laid before each House of the Oireachtas. It has not been the practice to have the schemes published as regulations. The 1980 and 1982 amending schemes contain the most recent references to resignation and redundancy. Copies of the relevant documents are available in Bord na Móna for inspection by members of the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of participating in EXPO 86 has been considered on a number of occasions.  The exposition is basically of a non-commercial nature dealing with transport and communications and estimated to be of very little trade benefit to Ireland.  Because of the theme of the exposition, the Minister for Communications took the lead role in deciding on attendance.  On being consulted and having discussed the matter with the promotion agencies under my control, Córas Tráchtála, Bórd Fáilte and the IDA, I advised the Minister for Communications that because of the specialist nature of the exposition it was felt that any benefit to be gained from participating would not justify the expenditure necessary to mount a national stand.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Minister for Communications consulted the relevant semi-State bodies under his aegis which are involved in the area of transport and communications and was satisfied that because of financial and other constraints none of the bodies would be in a position to take part in the exposition.  On the basis of the various views expressed, the Minister for Communications decided that Ireland would not participate in EXPO 86.  This decision was conveyed to the Canadian authorities through the Department of Foreign Affairs in May 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following further representations from the Canadian authorities the matter <Col N="1651" /> was reconsidered but again it was decided not to participate.</P>

      <P>Dollymount Strand is an open space under the control of the parks department of Dublin Corporation and is subject to by-laws and made pursuant to the Open Spaces Act, 1906.  These by-laws prescribe, <i>inter-alia</i>, a speed limit of 12 mph on the beach.  Responsibility for ensuring safety on the beach rests primarily with Dublin Corporation.  While, I have no direct function in the matter, I will ask Dublin Corporation to carry out a review of safety in relation to traffic and parking on the beach.  In so far as contraventions of the provisions of the Road Traffic Acts in relation to driving or parking may be concerned, responsibility for enforcement of these provisions rests with the Garda Síochána.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 76 and 78 together.  In September 1984, the Minister of State at my Department requested the three Dublin local authorities to co-operate in the preparation of a water quality management plan for Dublin Bay, and statements in regard to the matter were subsequently made by me and by the Minister of State in Dáil Éireann and elsewhere.  The members of all three local authorities have since approved of proposals that An <Col N="1669" /> Foras Forbartha be requested to undertake the studies required for the preparation of such a plan for the bay and the tidal section of the River Liffey, and that the Eastern Regional Development Organisation would commission An Foras to carry out the work and provide the necessary co-ordination of the project.</P>
      <P>A steering committee is to define the parameters of the study, draft terms of reference and generally oversee the work as it proceeds.  The committee is composed of representatives of the three local authorities and the Department of the Environment, while independent professionals in the environmental field have also been invited to join the committee. There will be scope for other organisations to make an input in the preparation of the plan; it will be a matter for the steering committee to decide when submissions should be invited.  When a draft is available, it will be put on public display for at least three months so that representations can be made and considered by the local authorities before formally adopting the plan.</P>

      <P>The directive to which the Deputy refers applies to waters where bathing is specifically authorised or traditionally practised by a large number of bathers.  Because of the terms of the directive, it is deemed not to apply to any bathing waters in Ireland but, in order to conform with the spirit of the directive, six beaches have been selected for monitoring: Portmarnock, Dollymount, Courtown, Tramore, Fountainstown and <Col N="1670" /> Salthill.  Monitoring is carried out at these beaches fortnightly during the bathing season and a report is submitted to the EC Commission each year.  The Commission's comments on the monitoring procedure in Ireland (made in first report which dealt with the type of data required) were taken into account in the compilation and presentation of bathing water results in subsequent years.  I am not aware of any further comment by the Commission on the matter.</P>

On the basis of information recently supplied by the deceased taxpayer's next of kin the taxpayer's liability for 1982-83 has been reviewed.

      <P>Between 1978 and 1980 the Secretariat of the Central Development Committee and the Galway County Development Team examined the possibility of providing an air service to Inishbofin.  Two sites suitable for air strips were identified and in 1980 an engineering report estimated the cost of providing an airstrip at either £526,000 or £600,000, depending on the site chosen.  The examination concluded that expenditure at this level could not be justified and that, in any event, there was almost no prospect of a viable air service being established even if an airstrip were constructed.  I do not believe that any further statement is called for.</P>

      <P>The Revenue Commissioners have advised me that on a return of income, which he completed on 2 May 1985, the taxpayer indicated that he was in receipt of a social welfare pension and a retirement pension. Both pensions are chargeable to income tax.  In accordance with standard practice the aggregate tax-free allowances under PAYE are reduced to take account of the social welfare pension which is paid gross, the tax attributable to it being recovered under PAYE from the retirement pension by means of the restricted tax-free allowances.</P>
      <P>An amended certificate of tax-free allowances to take account of the social welfare pension and incorporating an amount of £56.04 in respect of estimated marginal relief due was issued to the taxpayer on 15 May 1985.  The certificate was issued on a non-cumulative basis to avoid collection in one sum of the underpayment which would have arisen since 6 April last.  The certificate includes all the allowances and reliefs to which the taxpayer is entitled.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>It has not been the practice to determine actual costs of maintenance and treatment for individual patients, or for patient categories.  Consequently it is not possible to state, with any degree of precision, the total cost to the Exchequer involved in the provision of services for road traffic accident cases.</P>
      <P>Charges in respect of the treatment of such cases were levied by the hospitals concerned.  Charges initially raised related to the hospitals concerned.  Charges initially raised related to the hospital's overall average daily costs covering both maintenance and treatment.  These charges were subject to reduction or waiver in the light of the amount, if any, of damages or compensation received by the persons liable for the charges.  In the years 1980 to 1984, inclusive, receipts in respect of services provided for road accidents cases amounted to approximately £7 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is generally a considerable time lag between the initial raising of charges and the receipts of payments.  Consequently substantial amounts were outstanding at the end of the period mentioned in respect of services provided <Col N="1689" /> during the period.  On 16 December 1983 the Supreme Court held the Regulation, under which the charges were raised, to be <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister and void.  Amending legislation will shortly be introduced which will, in effect, restore the position which existed prior to the Supreme Court decision.</P>

      <P>Type C botulism occurs in birds and other animals but rarely affects humans.  Soil and water are reservoirs of infection and the toxin is produced under anaerobic conditions.

      <P>The person concerned reached age 65 on 7 April 1984.  He then resided in Britain and details of his claim for retirement pension were received from the British Authorities on 22 May 1985.</P>
      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from his year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before reaching pension age.  The person concerned does not satisfy this condition as the Department's records show that he had a total of 199 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1984.  This is equal to a yearly average of only six and, therefore, he does not qualify for a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  Neither did he qualify for old age contributory pension at age 66; a yearly average of at least 20 is required for this latter pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He was insurably employed in Britain from 1956 to 1984.  Under EC Regulations on social security a person who has been employed in another member state <Col N="1697" /> can qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension on his combined Irish and British records, the amount payable being based on the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total.  His total of 199 Irish and 1,426 British contributions entitles him to a <i>pro rata</i> pension of £10.30 per week, at present rates.  This includes an allowance of £4.40 in respect of his wife.  He is also in receipt of a British retirement pension.</P>
    <P>The Department have no record of a pension payment of £2 to his wife.  If this is a payment being made by the British Department of Health and Social Security any inquiry regarding it should be addressed to that Department in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Two of the conditions for the receipt of a deserted wife's payment are that a husband must have left his wife of his own volition and that she must make and continue to make reasonable efforts to trace her husband and to prevail on him to contribute to the support and maintenance of herself and her children. The deciding officer held that these conditions were not satisfied in this case and <Col N="1707" /> disallowed the claim of the person concerned. She appealed against the decision and after an oral hearing of the case on 12 November 1979 an appeals officer disallowed the appeal.</P>
      <P>Since then the claimant has made a number of further applications for payment which have all been refused. The most recent was on 14 May 1985 when she forwarded a copy of a maintenance order she had obtained against her husband.  However, an attempt to serve an attachment of earnings order on the husband was unsuccessful as he had apparently left his job.  The appeals officer accepted at that stage that she had made the necessary efforts to obtain maintenance.  He also held, however, that the other ground on which the claim was refused, <i>viz.</i> that her husband had not left her of his own volition was still in effect.  She is not therefore entitled to a deserted wife's payment and she has been notified to this effect.</P>

      <P>Payment of unemployment benefit is normally made from the 4th day of unemployment in a period of interruption of employment.  However, any two periods of interruption of employment not separated by more than 13 weeks are treated as one period of interruption of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit to 27 February 1985 after which date he ceased to sign as unemployed as he commenced participation on an AnCO course.  He again registered as unemployed from 3 June 1985 and his claim was allowed at the weekly rate of £80.15.  As these two dates are separated by a period in excess of 13 <Col N="1708" /> weeks, under the legislation he would not be entitled to unemployment benefit for the first three days of the second period of interruption of employment.  However, the exact period during which the course in question took place has not been verified and the matter will be clarified with the claimant on his next attendance at the exchange.</P>
    <P>The general position governing entitlement to unemployment benefit of claimants who resume signing the unemployment register after participation at an AnCO course is at present under examination in the Department. Any changes in the present arrangements in this regard would involve amending legislation and would be for consideration in the context of the annual Social Welfare Bill.</P>

      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 365 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1979.  This is equal to a yearly average of only 14, and therefore, he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension.</P>
      <P>Contributions at a reckonable rate were paid in respect of him up to 1959. There is no record of any contributions for him from 1960 to April 1967 and his contributions, thereafter, were paid at a low rate giving cover for occupational injuries benefit only.

      <P>The person concerned <Col N="1729" /> claimed disability benefit from 30 July 1984.  She is not entitled to payment as she has less than the required minimum of 26 contributions recorded in the 1982-83 year, on which her entitlement to benefit is based from 30 July 1984.  The insurance contributions paid on her behalf for 1983-84, the contribution year governing her claim from 7 January 1985, are not reckonable for disability benefit as they were paid at the Class J rate which does not give cover for disability benefit. Accordingly, she is not entitled to payment of disability benefit.</P>

      <P>One of the qualifying conditions for the receipt of a contributory old age pension requires the claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions from 6 July 1953 or from her year of entry into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before she reaches pension age.</P>
      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned has a total of 384 reckonable contributions in the relevant period which in her case, is from 6 July 1953 to 5 April 1980.  This is equal to a yearly average of only 14 and, therefore, she does not qualify for a contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>Under EC regulations the contribution records of a person who was employed in two or more EC member states may be combined to enable her to qualify for a <i>pro-rata</i> pension.  However, she had a total of only 54 British contributions since 1953 and her combined Irish and British total in the period from 6 July 1953 to 5 April 1980 is equal to a yearly average of only 16.

This is equal to a yearly average of only 12 and, therefore, he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension.  He was awarded a non-contributory old age pension at the weekly rate of £26.05 from 8 March 1985. This includes an adult dependent allowance of £8.75 in respect of his wife.  This is the rate to which he is entitled having regard to the assessment of his means, consisting of half the weekly value of a holding.

However, because he was unemployed at the time the award was made to her (early in April last) he was not considered to be in a position to do so.  The husband returned to work on 2 May 1985 and the claimant was notified of the steps she should take to obtain maintenance from him.

      <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of a deserted wife's payment is that a husband must have left his wife of his own voliation.</P>
      <P>The deciding officer held that this condition was not satisfied in the case of the person concerned and disallowed her claim.  She was notified to this effect and of her right to appeal if she was dissatisfied with the decision.</P>
      <P>The Deputy's question is being taken as indicating that she wishes to appeal and a form has been sent to her on which to state the facts and contentions she relies on in support of her appeal.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of deserted wife's allowance/ benefit is that a claimant must make and continue to make reasonable efforts within the means available to her to trace her husband's whereabouts and prevail on him to contribute to her support and that of her children.  In addition, to qualify for a benefit payment there must be at least 156 Irish paid insurance contributions (either on her own or her husband's insurance record) between the date of entry into insurance and the date of desertion.  The deciding officer held that in this case the person concerned who was claiming deserted wife's benefit did not satisfy these conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>She appealed against the decision and the deciding officer subsequently accepted that the first condition was satisfied but the insurance contributions disqualification still stood.  She was notified to this effect on 3 December 1984 and informed of the number of insurance contributions paid by her and her husband up to the date of his leaving.  She was also <Col N="1775" /> requested to inform the Department if, in the circumstances, She wished to pursue her appeal.  There is no trace of the receipt of a reply from her.  As far as the Department is aware, the claimant is working and her income from the employment would render her ineligible for receipt of deserted wife's allowance, which is a means tested payment.  If her circumstances have changed, however, or if they change in the future she could claim the allowance.</P>

      <P>, <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 to 347, inclusive together. I am informed by the Garda authorities that there are no proposals at present for increasing Garda strength at Maynooth, Leixlip or Celbridge.  Policing arrangements for the towns of Maynooth and Celbridge will, however, benefit from the first phase of the new national Garda communications network which is due to come into operation next month in areas outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area.</P>
      <P>I have consulted the Garda authorities again about the question of providing a Garda station at Leixlip and they still consider that the present arrangement whereby the area is served from Lucan station makes the best use of available resources.  They have also indicated that as a result of impending organisational change affecting the Lucan Garda sub-district, it is hoped to effect some improvement in the policing of Leixlip and the matter will be kept under review.</P>
      <P>There was a substantial reduction in the level of indictable crime in the Lucan Garda sub-district last year and provisional figures for the first quarter of this year indicate a further improvement in the crime situation there.  The downward trend in the crime rate is encouraging and I hope that this improvement can be maintained.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> The detailed policing arrangements for individual areas are a matter for the Garda authorities and the allocation of manpower between protection duty and other duties is a matter for the local Garda officers having regard to available resources, local circumstances and other demands on Garda services.  I an informed by the Garda authorities that it is not correct to say that gardaí are being deployed on VIP protection duty to the detriment of other police duties in the area concerned and that they have been unable to confirm that such a statement was made by any member of the force.</P>
      <P>Garda strength at the two stations serving the area, which takes account of special commitments such as protection duty, has been increased by a total of 35 members since 1 January 1983 and the service provided from these stations is currently being supplemented by assistance from elsewhere in the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  The policing arrangements for the area are being kept under review by the Garda authorities and the question of a further increase in strength at the two local stations will be further considered when the next group of Garda recruits becomes available for assignment in August.</P>
