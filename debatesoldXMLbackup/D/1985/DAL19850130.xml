      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main purpose of this Bill is to give legal effect to the decision taken by the then Government in October 1982 to discontinue the licensing of bulls.  The Bill will also provide legislative powers <Col N="973" /> to prohibit the use of non pure-bred bulls for breeding purposes.</P>
    <P>The Live Stock Breeding Act was enacted in 1925 and was designed to control the quality of bulls used for breeding in Ireland.  Under the Act inspections of bulls were carried out mainly by temporary inspectors selected for their knowledge of cattle.  They were, in the main, pedigree breeders who were paid on the basis of fees for inspections.  Some 7,000 bulls were inspected annually at more than 400 approved centres.  Between 85 and 90 per cent of the bulls presented for inspection were passed by the inspectors.</P>
    <P>In the 60 years since 1925 there have been many developments in livestock breeding &mdash; changes in animal husbandry, specialisation of production and the introduction of new breeds in cattle.  This was reflected in the type of bull in respect of which licences or permits were granted over the years.  In all cases the bull had to pass a visual inspection before being licensed.  Practically all the applicants were for pure-bred bulls entered or eligible for entry in the herd book of their breed.  In general, non pure-bred bulls were not licensed for breeding.  However, where and whenever conditions so war-ranted, exceptions to this general practice were made.  For example, non-pedigree Shorthorn bulls of exceptional merit were eligible for licensing throughout the country.  In the Kerry cattle area non-pedigree Kerry bulls were also eligible for licensing.</P>
    <P>Following the first importation of Charolais and Simmental bulls in the early seventies there was widespread concern that the supply of such bulls from the herd-book sector would not meet the demand.  Accordingly, as an interim measure, it was decided to inspect for licence initially half or higher cross continental bred bulls.  As the numbers of continental pure-bred bulls increased, however, the percentage of continental blood required in the cross-bred for licensing was progressively increased to three-quarters and seven-eights.</P>
    <P>Under the old licensing arrangements there were two rounds of inspections <Col N="974" /> annually in spring and autumn followed by two rounds of appeal inspections. Additionally an annual search, more commonly known as &ldquo;the comb&rdquo;, for unlicensed bulls was carried out.  As bull inspections had to be completed by specific dates and as large numbers of bulls were inspected at over 400 approved centres, bull licensing was quite expensive for the Department to administer. The inspection system at current prices cost about £160,000 annually whereas receipts by way of licence fees amounted to only £4,000.  This left the nett cost of this service to the Exchequer at around £156,000 annually.</P>
    <P>The previous Government decided in October 1982 to discontinue the existing system of bull licensing.  The present Government endorsed this decision and announced that licences would not be required for the keeping of bulls in 1983.</P>
    <P>EC Council Directive 77/504 on pure-bred breeding animals provided for the harmonisation of breeding quality standards and for such related matters as the recognition of breeders' organisations and associations, establishment and recognition of herd books, standards governing entry of animals into the herd book, and soon.  In essence, this EC legislation is stipulating that the quality of animals entering the herd book should be of a good standard and that such quality control should be exercised by the breed society concerned.  However, the directive does not cover the use of non pure-bred bulls.</P>
    <P>Following the announcement of the decision to discontinue bull licensing the practical consequence was that there was no restriction on the use of bulls for breeding purposes.  This gave rise to considerable concern by sections of the cattle and beef industry about the likely adverse effects on the quality of the national cattle herd and on the export trade in cattle, beef and beef products.  It was contended that the absence of controls on the use of non pure-bred bulls for breeding purposes would result in the more widespread use of genetically inferior animals, with a consequential <Col N="975" /> deterioration in the standard and conformation of the progeny.  Indeed in an adjournment debate in the Seanad this was brought home very strongly by the Members of the Upper House.  Additionally, it was claimed that the discontinuation of licensing could dilute the effectiveness of measures taken to improve the national herd through the Department's various livestock improvement schemes.</P>
    <P>In the light of those views I requested the Cattle Advisory Committee, which is broadly representative of farming organisations and of the cattle industry, to examine the matter.  This committee was established in 1972 to keep all aspects of cattle breeding under review and to make recommendations as necessary to the Minister.  The Cattle Advisory Committee advised that the interests of the industry as a whole would best be served by the official authorisation for breeding of only pure-bred bulls registered in the herd book of their breed and they urged that appropriate steps be taken to implement that recommendation.</P>
    <P>Agriculture accounts for roughly a quarter of our total exports.  The cattle sector accounts for about 85 per cent of agricultural exports and about 19 per cent of total exports.  Because of the importance of cattle to the national economy it is essential in the national interest to ensure that the quality of output from the national cattle breeding herd is capable of satisfying the demands of the market &mdash; largely an export one &mdash; and at the same time capable of giving a good financial return to the producer.  The national cattle breeding herd provides the raw material for both the dairy and beef industries. An important element in the quality of production from the cattle sector is the genetic merit of the breeding stock. That is why over the years we have been spending a lot of money on genetics. Cattle breeding is best approached on a whole population basis and it is necessary to ensure that an effective national breeding programme operates.  In most countries the state takes a leading role either directly or indirectly in the operation of <Col N="976" /> national cattle breeding programmes.</P>
    <P>As 80 per cent of our beef output and 65 per cent of our milk output are exported it is very important that we remain competitive internationally.  To do this we must continually improve the quality of our stock and at least match the progress being made by our competitors. It has been clearly demonstrated that improvement and changes to meet needs in our livestock can be brought about by evaluation and measurement of the merit of individual animals and by selecting the best of these to be the parents of the next generation.  By repeating this process of identification and selection of superior animals for use in the breeding herd we bring about gradual and steady cumulative improvement, generation after generation.</P>
    <P>The necessary recording, evaluation and selection to bring about this genetic improvement is generally done in the pedigree herd book sector.  It is important that such genetic improvement be disseminated to the whole cattle breeding population, thus ensuring the continuing improvement of the national cattle herd. This dissemination is done most efficiently by commercial producers continually using bulls from the improved herd book sector either as natural service sires or through the artificial insemination service. Bulls in AI usually undergo an additional phase of selection based on performance of their progeny &mdash; progeny testing &mdash; thus ensuring the much higher merit and value of bulls in AI.</P>
    <P>A further reason for concentrating on herd book registered bulls is the desirabliity of being able to identify the genetic makeup of an animal at the various stages of production.  This country has many different markets for its cattle and cattle products &mdash; diverse markets each with its own requirements.  We have currently in the national cattle herd many different breeds each having its own characteristics and suitability to fulfil the requirements of our different markets.  Many of the requirements for these markets are best met by crossbreeding our cattle.  It is most desirable that the breed make up of our cattle be predictable from visual assessment <Col N="977" />&mdash; this is usually done by colour pattern combined with other minor indicators. Use of pure-bred bulls allows such identification with a reasonable degree of accuracy.  Use of cross bred bulls, on the other hand, gives much undesirable variation in many traits of importance including colour which makes evaluation of genetic makeup and suitability for particular markets much more difficult.</P>
    <P>Some representations have been made to the effect that the proposed controls will adversely affect the income of many farmers, especially in the disadvantaged areas This topic has been given substantial media coverage on TV, radio and the national and provincial press.  It has been contended that a large percentage of farmers with small suckler herds and dairy herds simply cannot afford, or justify, the purchase, upkeep and insurance of a pedigree bull because of the size of their herds.  This view has been strongly expressed by some individuals and I accept fully that it is sincerely held.  However, I believe that the overall interests of the country, the farming sector and the individual farmers earning their living by producing cattle on comparatively small margins of profit will best be served by the use of breeding of only the best bulls.</P>
    <P>By and large, the best bulls to use are those from the herdbook registered sector.  I accept that exceptional individual non-registered bulls might in some cases be better breeding animals than the poorest herd book bulls.  I accept that use of the AI service may be a little more difficult in certain parts of the country and in certain farming situations.  However, it is significant that overall 126,000 farmers availed of the AI service in 1983. I do not wish to impose controls just for the sake of so doing.  However, I am advised that without controls, significant numbers of farmers are using and will continue to use inferior type &ldquo;scrub&rdquo; bulls and that continuation of official State control on the quality of bulls used for breeding is still very necessary.  Imposition of such controls, in practice, must apply broadly and cannot cater for the situation on every individual farm.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="978" /> The Bill before the House provides that a person must have a permit issued under the Act if he has an unregistered bull.  The circumstances in which permits will be issued will be laid down in regulations made under this Act.  As a general rule, it is envisaged that permits will be issued to cover only bulls kept for research, bull beef production and similar enterprises.  For registered bulls (that is, those entered in official herd books) the breed society will issue a certificate for each bull entered in the herd book.  These permits or certificates must be produced on demand to inspectors of the Department of Agriculture or members of the Garda Síochána when they are checking on the status of bulls under the Act.  The inspectors and gardaí will have powers to enter land and to examine bulls found on that land.</P>
    <P>If a person is believed to have an unregistered bull, or a bull without a valid permit he will be allowed 28 days to apply for a permit for the bull, or else to have the bull castrated or slaughtered.  He can make representations against a direction to have the bull castrated or slaughtered. Should he ignore the direction to have the bull castrated or slaughtered, the Minister will be empowered to have this done at the owner's own expense.  The Bill sets out the maximum penalties that can be imposed for various offences under the Act.  Finally, the Live Stock Breeding Act of 1925 is repealed by this Bill.</P>
    <P>I commend this Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): This Bill sets about raising the standard of our national cattle herd and, of course, that is desirable.  As the Minister rightly pointed out, it repeals the Live Stock Breeding Act of 1925, which has served the interests of the cattle breeding industry for 60 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The concept of the Bill before us I accept in principle.  Nevertheless, it has totally and completely neglected the problems of the small farmers in the remote and disadvantaged areas, who <Col N="979" /> have not the capacity to acquire registered pedigree bulls.  I very well understand their problems and sympathise very much with them.  It is necessary at this stage that the Minister find some way of helping this sector of the farming community. Keeping in mind the importance of upgrading the standard of our breeding herds and also the important role which this section of our farming community play in the development of our cattle industry, the Minister must come up with some positive alternative now to help this section.  They are the backbone of our economy and are the most important sector of the farming community.  This help can be given by making available some financial assistance towards access to the services of pedigree sires or, alternatively, by allowing the farmers to keep, for a limited upgrading period, non-pedigree bulls, subject, of course, to their being passed as suitable by his Department. I am making this suggestion to the Minister, bearing in mind the problems existing in these areas.</P>
    <P>The restoration of the beef breeding herd to its former level, to something in the nature of 700,000, is of extreme importance.  This required increase in numbers can only come from the western areas which certainly need encouragement to bring this about.  I doubt if this legislation will do that.  There will have to be incentives to the farming community in those areas to add to their cattle stocks on a sound farming plan.  This should be the target, while improving beef quality at the same time.  Ideally, the maximum possible number of beef cows should be bred from a continental type bull.  In passing, the Minister could bring in some scheme to promote commercial exploitation of embryo transfers and twinning, especially in beef cows.  I understand that this technology is now established and readily available.</P>
    <P>If our beef herd numbers increased fairly rapidly &mdash; and this is a very effective way of doing that &mdash; then the problems which I have outlined and of which the Minister is aware, would be solved.  There would be no further need for special treatment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="980" /> The Minister referred to the availability of the AI service.  In certain areas there is a very serious difficulty, because AI is not the solution.  The Minister knows this very well.  It does not constitute a solution because of the isolation of the area, the non-availability of the service, delay in the provision of service and, most important of all, the nature of the terrain in this area.  There are in the region of 43,000 beef herds in disadvantaged areas, in which herds the average cow number is in the region of seven. Surely it is not practicable or proper for the Minister to impose the provisions of this Bill on those farmers without there also being some flexibility.  I leave it to the Minister to introduce amendments on Committee Stage or, when replying, to offer alternative, positive suggestions.</P>
    <P>In the course of my comments I shall advance alternative suggestions which hopefully will be accepted by the Minister. We shall also be putting down amendments to ensure that the people to whom I refer &mdash; who constitute the backbone of our farming community &mdash; will not be left at a disadvantage because of the implications of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister and his Department would investigate the possibility of the introduction of a scheme for the location of bulls on special terms, under which scheme pedigree bulls &mdash; I should say this is nothing new but has been operated by the Department for many years &mdash; are placed at the beginning of each year in congested districts and disadvantage areas at reduced prices payable by instalment.  The custodians of such bulls are required to maintain them in healthy, breeding condition for four breeding seasons and must be available to serve cows and heifers in the neighbourhood. As the Minister is aware, this scheme was highly successful in the areas to which I refer and was operated also by the ACOT committees, or the old county committees of agriculture, under which premiums were allocated more or less on the same terms and for the same purpose. This should be examined.  As this Bill <Col N="981" /> progresses through the House I hope to make alternative suggestions for implementation by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would also arrange for research into the regulations operating in other countries with regard to bull licensing.  For instance, in France, as far as my information goes, no such regulations obtain as are now being introduced here.  I am sure the Minister and the House will agree with me that none of the French breeds of bulls could be faulted on quality.  In New Zealand I understand that the position is much more flexible than is proposed under the provisions of this Bill.  In this vein I would suggest that the provisions of this Bill should enable the Minister to introduce regulations as the need arises, in other words, that there be much more flexibility than obtains at present, and we hope to introduce amendments to allow for such flexibility.</P>
    <P>It is important that our beef cattle numbers be increased while raising the standard of the stock.  One must pose a question as to the availability of sufficient pedigree bulls to meet the demand.  In this context &mdash; and the Minister referred to this in the course of his remarks &mdash; the use of AI could be considered but I question whether it constitutes an acceptable alternative.  In many areas I would suggest it is utterly impractical.  For instance, in suckler herds heat detection can often be almost impossible with the nearest AI station being sited some distance away and many farmers in disadvantaged areas are not on the telephone. Another point worthy of mention is that many suckler herds are kept off the farm or grazed on the mountainside.  I should point out to the Minister that many farmers in disadvantaged areas must supplement their incomes with off-farm work, in which case AI may not constitute a practical solution.</P>
    <P>I might commend the submission made by the Sneem Development Co-operative with regard to the provisions of this Bill, details of which no doubt the Minister has in his possession.  I compliment them on their research and study <Col N="982" /> into the development of our beef cattle industry and the raising of the standard of our breeding stock.  I note with regret that the Minister has refused to meet this group, to debate in public the merits or demerits of their suggestions.  Surely the Minister has an obligation to meet all groups who are prepared to carry out research into the aims and ideals of the upgrading of the standard of our beef cattle herd?</P>
    <P>For the record I should like to briefly outline some of the points the group made in the course of their submission to the Minister.  They maintained that the proposed Bill will confine farmers to the use of pure bred bulls registered in the herd book of their breed.  They contend that monopoly would have serious implications for the huge number of farmers with less than 20 cows because their incomes would not enable them to purchase and maintain a pedigree bull.  They continue to contend that it will force smaller farmers to rely totally on AI, resulting in a huge reduction in calves, especially in suckler herds, with obvious implications for marts, co-operatives and the beef industry generally.</P>
    <P>Another point they make it that is will create a monopoly for pure-bred bulls and a very substantial gain for breeders of such animals, resulting in a huge percentage of milk-orientated bulls for producing quality beef.  Inevitably, because of the scarcity and prohibitive cost of quality, pure-bred bulls of a continental-type, they continue to say that the provisions of this Bill will place the AI service in jeopardy because the purchase of the cheapest possible pedigree bull will result in a huge reduction in demand for the service, and they offer alternative suggestions. They stated that a clause should be inserted in the proposed Bill permitting farmers in the disadvantaged areas to use both pedigree and quality non-pedigree bulls.  This would guarantee the production of the maximum number of quality beef calves and benefit farmers, marts, co-ops and the beef industry generally. The Minister said quality non-pedigree bulls could produce stock of a better quality than pedigree bulls.  We must look at <Col N="983" /> this very carefully in the context of this legislation.</P>
    <P>They also said it would safeguard the AI service, as cows that prove difficult to get in calf on AI, could have the back-up service of a realistically priced or farm bred quality non-pedigree bull.  They made further realistic points which the Minister must look at.  I hope the Minister will have these proposals examined very carefully.  While he may not be able to accept all of them, on Committee Stage he could introduce amendments to meet the just demands of this group and many other farmers in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>Bearing in mind the importance of upgrading our breeds, we can also cater for the people to whom I have referred.  I have made some alternative suggestions. We must keep in mind at all times the importance of the control of the quality of our breeding stock to ensure that our beef export market is not affected by a low quality carcase.  Therefore, our cattle breeding standards must be upheld at all times.  This can be done if the Minister accepts the proposals for the provision of suitable premiums or the introduction of suitable subsidies to enable the farmers in question to purchase top quality bulls. I have outlined the scheme of premiums which existed in the past and also the availability of bulls on special terms.</P>
    <P>Another suggestion is the inclusion of a double subsidy under the headage grant scheme where bulls are kept by small farmers in the disadvantaged areas. There could be a special payment per year for a period of three years.  I should like the Minister to consider the provision of some other type of financial inducement in the short terms so that these farmers would have access to proven pedigree sires.  All we need is to get over the transition period.  I appeal to the Minister to give us some indication of how these requests can be met, and they can be met provided he has the will and the backing of his Minister and the Government.  This will need a financial injection and also help and assistance for these people.  Initially it requires to be done over a period of two or three years only.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="984" /> This would get over the difficulties I have outlined and it would ensure that we would have top quality breeding stock available not only to the larger farmers but also to the less well off farmers in the disadvantaged areas.  I am putting up positive alternatives.  If the Minister and the Department are prepared to grasp the nettle and give this financial assistance and aid to these people, we can overcome the difficulties.  They can be overcome provided the Minister has the will to do so.  We must ensure that our beef breeds are of the highest quality and that the small farmers in the disadvantaged areas are not forced to use the wrong type of bull.  We want to avoid that.  I regret that the Minister referred to scrub bulls.  We should forget that word.  We should talk about non-pedigree bulls.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>(<i>Limerick West</i>): Farmers in the disadvantaged areas are severely handicapped and the Minister knows that as well as I do.  The whole population in these areas are directly or indirectly dependent on the income they derive from the land.  The average size farm is very small and only a small proportion of the land is good.  The average herd has less than ten suckler cows.  For 90 per cent of the farmers the land is used mainly to support suckler herds most of which are relatively small.  Practically 100 per cent of the calves from the suckler herds are destined for the beef trade and mostly to be sold as weanling stores in the autumn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These farmers make a very substantial and important contribution to the Irish economy in terms of exports of beef and lamb.  We must look to these areas in the future for an increase in our beef cow numbers.  The Minister's Department <Col N="985" /> have recognised this because they increased the headage grants in the disadvantaged areas.  I supported that.  If the Minister goes a little further and gives the necessary incentives and financial injection, he will ensure that all our herds will use top quality pedigree and non-pedigree sires.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will give this matter his utmost consideration and that he will come back to the House with a solution which will maintain the standards of our breeding herds and will not put farmers in the disadvantaged areas at a greater disadvantage so far as their breeding stock is concerned.  I ask the Minister to look at these proposals very carefully and to come back to the House with positive and progressive alternatives.  If he does that he will have the full support of this side of the House for this legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally when legislation like this comes before the House Deputies give it a guarded welcome.  Farmers living in disadvantaged areas are a bit cynical about the whole purpose of this legislation.  It would seem from the consternation it has created in the disadvantaged areas from Donegal to west Cork that the legislation has been drafted for the benefit of the pedigree bull breeders, an elite group, and that the interests of farmers in the disadvantaged areas were not considered.  In other words, the Bill will be administered at the expense of the minority.  The pedigree breeders are a strong pressure group well known to the Minister and his officials.  They meet him and the officials frequently at the presentation of awards in the RDS.  The small farmers in disadvantaged areas in the south-west, the west and the north-west, cannot avail of such audiences with the departmental officials.</P>
      <P>It is well known that this legislation is based on the recommendations of a body known as the Cattle Advisory Committee in whose composition there is not one farmer from the disadvantaged areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Begley</NameTxt>
      <P>The main thrust of the Minister's argument is that he has been informed by that famous committee that this legislation is necessary &mdash; that he is introducing it on their recommendations. I ask the Minister to look seriously at these provisions when the Bill is in Committee. I realise that we will have to consider rules and regulations governed by EC directives but let us not forget that the EC recognise the disadvantaged area farmers in Ireland.  That is why we have headage and other subsidy payments.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that the legislation is designed to cater for the overall good. He should have added that the Bill is designed to penalise the majority of farmers who use their own non-pedigree bulls and who will be forced to get rid of those bulls.  In 1983 the Government put an end to the licensing of bulls but they should have known that the penalties provided for are outrageous as far as farmers who use non-pedigree bulls are concerned. A small farmer may be fined £600 and lose his headage payments which could amount to another £600.  It is a penal law to crush people in disadvantaged areas.</P>
      <P>In those areas, 80 per cent of farmers breed so that they can have suckler calves for sale in the autumn.  In Sneem in south Kerry most of the smallholdings are uneconomic and 37 per cent of the people, according to a recent well conducted survey, must depend on off-farm incomes in order to survive.  Now they will have to bear these crushing penalties.</P>
      <P>The Minister, being a progressive farmer, must be aware that farmers living in the disadvantaged areas have very small incomes from small herds.  Such farmers in future, perhaps, will be forced to use the wrong types of bulls, pedigree animals, beyond the financial reach of a farm carrying only five or six cows.  In present circumstances farmers living, say, on sides of mountains, may be 25 miles from an AI station and might not be able to avail of the service when they most need it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I urge the Minister to consider these matters carefully on Committee Stage. <Col N="987" /> He knows that the quality of non-pedigree bulls has improved substantially in the last two years and he appreciates that if a farmer has not a good suckler for sale in the autumn, that if the calf does not appear well, the price will drop dramatically.  It is like a greyhound &mdash; by looking at him you can tell his class.</P>
    <P>I suggest that officers of the Department of Agriculture want to squeeze small farmers out of existence.  Many of them live facing the Atlantic and their incomes are so low that they have only potatoes and salt for their dinners two days a week.  Therefore I ask the Minister to look closely at the advantages of retaining non-pedigree bulls.  It must be realised that non-pedigree bulls can produce first class progeny, that cross-breeding can produce excellent animals.  Any of the cross-breeders who come to the south will tell you that.</P>
    <P>This legislation will be rough on the people I have been talking about.  In Sneem they did an excellent survey and study of this legislation and they suggested the insertion in the Bill of a clause that would permit farmers in the disadvantaged areas to use either pedigree or non-pedigree bulls.  On that basis they suggested an amendment, which has been endorsed by the ICMSA, Macra na Feirme, ACOT and the county committees of agriculture.  I suggest there is nothing wrong with that amendment and that the Minister should consider it.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan has said many of the things I had intended to say and there is no point in repeating what he said. However, I must point out to the Minister that his statement that these people must carry the can for the rest of the country is not good enough.  In the interest of fair play and justice the submissions made by many people on the Bill should be noted and acted upon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnOLeary1965" hpid="Mr. J. O'Leary Mr. J. O'Leary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Leary</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Noonan, our spokesman on Agriculture, and Deputy Begley have highlighted the matters that concern me in the Bill.  We agree that in principle it is necessary to improve the quality of our cattle.  That is a desirable <Col N="988" /> objective and one that should be kept in mind at all times and the proposals I intend putting forward will not mean any disimprovement in the quality of our cattle.  I am surprised that the Minister in preparing the Bill accepted advice entirely from the Cattle Advisory Committee because that committee does not have a member from a disadvantaged area.  One could conclude that the Bill will create a monopoly for pure-bred bulls and is designed to benefit a tiny but very powerful pressure group of breeders of such animals.  In my view it will be damaging and discriminatory against the vast majority of the 111,000 farmers who have fewer than 20 cows.</P>
      <P>There is no provision for exemptions in the case of smallholders who live in remote areas.  I should be obliged if the Minister will tell the House the number of pure-bred pedigree bulls, the number of cows and the number of heifers likely to go to dairy this year.  It is my view that there are not sufficient pure-bred bulls to service all the cattle.  I am anxious that the Minister should make provision to permit the use of non-pedigree pure-bred bulls in the severely handicapped areas within disadvantaged areas.  I am concerned about areas such as Sneem, Kenmare and south-west and west Kerry.  The majority of farmers in those areas have fewer than 20 cows.  In fact, many have fewer than ten cows.  In some severely handicapped areas the average is seven cows.  A farmer with seven cows in a remote rural area could not maintain and insure a pure-bred pedigree bull.  The AI service is an excellent one and is operated by dedicated officials.  It is a pity that the AI subsidy scheme was withdrawn because it has made the service very expensive for farmers, especially those who live in remote areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Farmers who rear their own breeding heifers have a problem.  Those animals are generally kept separate from the main herd and a farmer will find it difficult to know whether the heifers are going to dairy or not unless there is a bull running with them.  That important point should be taken into consideration by the Minister. It is for that reason I suggest that the <Col N="989" /> Minister permit farmers to have quality non-pedigree bulls.  Those bulls should be passed by inspectors from the Department or ACOT officials, who are well trained.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State in the course of his statement said:</P>
    <P>Practically all the applicants were for pure-bred bulls entered or eligible for entry in the herd book of their breed. In general, non-pure-bred bulls were not licensed for breeding...  For example, non-pedigree Shorthorn bulls of exceptional merit were eligible for licensing throughout the country. In the Kerry cattle area non-pedigree Kerry bulls were also eligible for licensing.</P>
    <P>Will, the Minister elaborate on that statement?</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the provisions of the Bill will lead to the creation of a monopoly for the Pure-bred Pedigree Breeders Association.  Small farmers in severely handicapped areas cannot afford to buy a pure-bred pedigree bull.  I am familiar with the position of the farmers in the Sneem area, mentioned by Deputy Begley.  I met representatives of the organisation involved and I was surprised to hear that the Minister did not meet them to discuss the matter.  The group have an unanswerable case which has been well researched.  The Minister should take cognisance of the case made by the Sneem Development Association on behalf of smallholders in the area.  The Minister's proposals, if fully implemented, will undermine, if not destroy, the AI service.  Is there a difficulty between the Cattle Advisory Committee and the AI service?</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the proposals support big farmers and those adjacent to the AI service but are not in the best interest of small farmers.  If the Minister does not accommodate smallholders in the west and south-west we will table amendments to the Bill.  Some areas should be exempt.  Annual subsidies should be paid to farmers in severely handicapped areas who are anxious to buy a pure-bred pedigree bull.  A farmer <Col N="990" /> with between 17 and 20 cattle cannot afford to purchase such an animal.  Many areas are remote from marts.  Some areas in south Kerry are up to 70 miles from a mart.</P>
    <P>The Minister should seriously consider the provisions of this Bill.  He should bring in amendments and exempt the areas I have already mentioned.  If he does not do this, this legislation will prove disastrous.  I can visualise inspectors calling on small farmers who, if they are found to have non-pedigree bulls, will lose the headage grants, will be taken to court and so on.  We may even have to come back within 12 months to amend this Bill to exempt these areas.  Now is the time to give these concessions and to make the necessary amendments.  This Bill should be put through the House in a way that will benefit all sections of the farming community.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot agree entirely with the proposed legislation.  I welcome the Minister's concern to ensure that our exports are of a higher quality and that whatever inconvenience may be caused to farmers and breeders in the short term will be compensated for by the better quality livestock they will export.</P>
      <P>It is a reflection on the farming community if, in spite of all the efforts of our advisory services and agricultural colleges, we are still in a situation where we have to introduce the policeman into farm management and to introduce legislation to force farmers to do something which is in their best interest, if it is in their interest.  I would like to comment on the end of the Minister's speech.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Garda should be left out of this legislation because they have enough to do.  Their role in presentday society should not be to look after dog licenses, bull licences and so on.  They must specialise in dealing with the problems of society at different levels and we should not distract them from giving the maximum attention to the most important matters.  We should not involve them in farm management.  I do not believe the Garda would go around looking for breaches of this law because if they did it <Col N="991" /> would not be a good thing.  The Garda need to cultivate the best relationship possible with people in remote rural areas and if they were to get involved in this legislation, it would take up a great deal of their valuable time and damage the interests of the force.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of ways under the existing livestock schemes to police this scheme if and when it becomes law.  In spite of financial and administrative difficulties, never before were the Department in more constant contact with the agricultural community, particularly in the west where we have the headage grant scheme, the calf premium scheme and so on.  The inspectors visit most farms.  The Minister did not mention the penalties a farmer will incur for a breach of this legislation.  I understand most livestock legislation and regulations contain a clause that farmers in breach of any Act will lose benefit under the various livestock schemes, premiums and payments. This means that if a farmer is brought to court and fined, the chances are that in the short term he will lose the benefit of the other livestock schemes.</P>
    <P>The suckling herds are scattered in remote areas.  Mostly they are small herds and the owners have a very small income. The bigger herds are run in a more business like way and the farmers will know what is in their own interest and they will have the resources to pursue the most modern management techniques.  They will buy quality animals for breeding, but the problem arises with the small breeders. AI should be the ideal solution for small suckling herds but it is impossible to detect heat in suckling cows and therefore AI is not the solution.  The only solution is to have a bull with the herd and this is where the problem arises.  The first thing we should have done was to examine the market to see if there are enough pedigree bulls to service all the herds.  I do not believe there are a sufficient number, but when this legislation comes into operation we will reduce the farmer's choice between, maybe, a second rate cross-bred Charolais and a fifth rate pedigree Hereford animal.  I <Col N="992" /> do not want to discriminate between the breeds because they all have their purpose. Under this legislation the farmer will be forced to buy a pedigree animal. This means that he will have to look into the different beef breeds and sometimes he may chose an inferior animal of a breed he does not want because it may not be the most useful, and in the short term this is more likely to happen.</P>
    <P>Under this legislation the Garda will be involved in farm management and this will most affect the small farmers, but the Garda will not be involved with pedigree breeders.  The breeders at the top of the scale have conducted their business very successfully but at the other end of the scale we found the little pedigree bull at the marts or shows in the spring attracting a price because he drank the milk of two cows over the previous year.  It has always been very hard for the inspectors to distinguish between these animals and they got their licence at the end of the day, but if one saw them on the side of a mountain the following October, I guarantee nobody would consider giving them a licence.  It is easier to judge on their merits non-pedigree animals produced in commercial conditions.  I am very concerned about the possibility that inferior stock will get licences because they are well presented, well groomed and well fed.</P>
    <P>I understand some Opposition Deputies, including Deputy Noonan, said a grant should be give to farmers to buy pedigree animals.  If a farmer has to pay a very high price for a pedigree animal to breed with seven cows, it is hard to know if the economics are justified, and when we add a Government grant to that, it makes it a little more difficult.  But then we must ask ourselves to whom does the Government grant go.  The old idea is that money can resolve any problem but in this case money is not always the solution. The chances are that you will just increase the price of bulls by that amount and, if they are scarce, the breeder, not the farmer, will reap the benefit.  The breeders have mounted a lobby condemning all the indiscriminate breeding which has been carried out.  I do not <Col N="993" /> blame them for this as many of them have given dedicated service, although they are no more dedicated to the trade than the small farmer, but they have a right to make profits.  However, there will be indiscriminate breeding until there are enough pedigree bulls to go around.  If this legislation came into effect in the morning, many small farmers would not be able to acquire bulls because the price would be prohibitive.</P>
    <P>We have been using livestock schemes for the past number of years and the argument is that we should provide grants to encourage farmers to participate in them.  Next year the Government plan to raise the suckling premium which will be about £65 or £75 more.  That will bring the total assistance for a suckling cow up to about £100.  This scheme could be considered for the purpose of improving the breed of livestock as we have been doing in relation to sheep.  The question of management or standards did not come into it.  I am not suggesting that we should be very tough but these schemes should be used to nudge small farmers who are recipients of those aids in the right direction over a period of time.  Of course this would create problems for public representatives because when somebody is refused a grant on the grounds that his stock is badly managed they will complain to us.  However, it would be in everyone's interests to do this.  It is reasonable for the Government to give assistance subject to conditions and that would be better than trying to enforce the law by sending in a garda.  The Minister should have discussions with his colleagues to see whether these schemes can be used to improve the quality of livestock and the performance and management of farmers.</P>
    <P>If the Civil Service make a mistake or something goes wrong they are pilloried. However, we do not give them the freedom to use their discretion and common sense.  I do not think that anybody has produced evidence to show that the quality of livestock has disimproved.  From my own observations, I believe it has steadily improved.  While we can use the aids we give to improve the quality of livestock <Col N="994" /> we are getting past the stage where we should use the Garda to impose standards of management in the agricultural industry.  The beef producer who does not impose the required disciplines on himself will not survive for very long.  The European Community is more than self-sufficient in this product and, in the future, it will need subsidies to sell it.  In spite of what we hear about markets in the Middle East and other places, our beef can only be sold outside this country with the aid of European subsidies. Within the Community, we will either have a severe reduction in prices or an imposition of quotas or other measures to save farmers from a total collapse of prices.  There is no future for the farmer who does not produce beef which can compete in Europe and international markets.  I ask the Minister not to seek to solve the problem by paying a direct subsidy because that will go to the breeder.  He should also ensure that the Department must have precise knowledge of the number of animals available and the herds likely to require such bulls. If it is not possible to amend the legislation in this regard, it should be phased in over a period of time taking the likely markets into consideration.</P>
    <P>While I do not give an unreserved welcome to the Bill, I am glad the Minister is trying to improve management at farm level and the products which we are trying to sell.  It is in all our interests that the Minister succeeds in his objectives and I hope the final legislation will make it a little bit easier for the people whom I represent, those with under developed small farms.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the thinking behind the Bill but the debate so far has demonstrated the conflict between the regions.  It also demonstrates how little has been done since we joined the EC.  There is a deep conflict between the 12 western counties and the remainder of the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree with the last speaker when he said there was a great improvement in the upbreeding of our stock and there should be more emphasis on this in <Col N="995" /> future, not just in breeding but also in management, because we are faced with a serious situation in so far as beef in the EC in the future is concerned.  One has only to read the recent CBF review of 1984 to see how dependent we are on EC countries exporting outside the Community. We have a problem regarding competitiveness and it is a pity that there is so much emphasis in the Bill on milk versus beef.  In future they will have to be far more closely related.  This is one of the reasons why I am so concerned that there is not greater emphasis placed on milk production in the west.  Farmers would have been in a position to avail of the milk quotas and would not be solely dependent on store cattle.  That kind of farming is more appropriate to an area with fragmented holdings.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan mentioned aids that could be given to people living in isolated western areas such as a built-in subsidy under the severely handicapped areas scheme.</P>
    <P>Mention has already been made of the importance of beef production for the west.  A figure of 43,000 has been given for beef herds. Beef cow numbers dropped from 541,000 in the 1975-79 period to approximately 440,000 in 1983.  This is very serious.  We must recognise that we will face serious problems if some kind of assistance is not given.  I visited a factory recently and one of the Department's inspectors was grading beef there.  He identified the different carcases by putting a tag on them.  All the beef was purchased on a level basis, no matter whether it was Charolais or Friesian.  It all commanded the same price.  I hope the time will come when we will pay for quality and not have an overall price paid by the factory.  Farmers are not being paid for better quality animals.</P>
    <P>Mention was made of AI.  This has been a great breakthrough as far as cattle breeding is concerned.  However there has been some dissatisfaction with the system.  If AI fails cows are brought to the bull.  Great work has been done by farmers in the high acreage class as far as <Col N="996" /> the importation of milk and beef type bulls are concerned.  We must recognise that.  They import the animals and have improved the breeding stock considerably. Mention has been made of future requirements as regards twinning and upbreeding. This is an area where I hope something will be done to ensure that the future of herd owners in the west is safeguarded while at the same time improving the overall performance of the breeding stock.</P>
    <P>The super-levy introduced an element of despair in farming.  People should look to the future.  We will probably have a quota system for some time but hopefully confidence will be restored to farmers, particularly in the area of cattle production. That is the only area to which people in the west can look for development.  I hope the review of the measures for the west will be proceeded with as quickly as possible.  When these measures were announced in 1979 many of us felt it was a glorious opportunity to build a sound base for farming.  One of the most notable schemes introduced was the cow to beef scheme.  This should have been a good scheme but it fell on its face.  Schemes are introduced to improve the lot of the people in a particular area.  However, the qualifying limits which are set down debar the majority of people from applying for them.  Unless these limits are changed the schemes will not do any good.  The same thing applies to suckling grants.  Unless the limits are changed they will not be of any benefit.  These schemes should be examined on an ongoing basis. If subsidies are paid directly to producers in all probability the price of bulls will be increased.  Aid is available for production and manufacturing under FEOGA funds.  Some system should be devised to make funds available for areas where hardship will be imposed if they have to work within the constraints of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnVFarrelly" hpid="Mr. Farrelly Mr. Farrelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Farrelly</NameTxt>
      <P>We should go further in bringing in new controls with regard to improvements in our cattle breeding.  We have placed much emphasis on our export markets.  We are debating this Bill at a <Col N="997" /> time when there is practically no factory quoting prices for beef after all the hullabaloo that was made about deals in the past few months.  I will deal with that matter later.</P>
      <P>The elimination of non-licensed bulls will have serious effects in certain areas. After the Minister I am the first person to speak whose area is not included in the disadvantaged areas scheme.  I can foresee a problem, namely, that many small suckler cow herd producers will not be able to afford a licensed pedigree bull. A person with, say, 25 animals will have no choice other than to use the AI system.  My information is that working on a percentage basis on suckler cow herds the AI system has a success rate of only about 70 per cent at best.  One of the reasons is that the animals are not seen when in heat and a loss of 30 per cent be suffered in using that method.</P>
      <P>In the early seventies I had half-bred continental animals and the Department inspector inspected them when I applied for a licence.  These half-bred continental animals should be considered when one takes into account the cost of buying a fully licensed pedigree bull.  Getting away from the overall concept of a licence system, if we used that method we could produce the animals required for the continental markets.  I do not see any reason why small producers should not be allowed to produce half-bred continental animals.  From my experience it worked well in the past and the Minister should reconsider it.  I never believed that the system of licensing bulls could be used throughout the country.  One Government abolished that system and another one endorsed it in 1982.  It was a retrograde step in so far as our cattle industry was concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think we will do justice to small producers if we do not amend the proposals that have been put forward. My suggestion regarding half-bred continental animals should be considered.  The average income of a small farmer is less than £5,000 per annum and yet he will be asked to buy a pedigree bull that may cost £1,000.  Alternatively he will have to use the AI system and have a 30 per cent <Col N="998" /> failure rate.  Up to two years ago there was a large swing away from using continental and Hereford inseminations in the AI stations but that may have changed in the past year.  The reason was that people in this line of farming were using their own animals.  It is my view that we can amend the proposed legislation to allow for using the half-bred continental animal as we did in the past.</P>
    <P>We are talking about legislation to improve our animal stock to ensure that we have top-class beasts to export to European and other markets.  In the past few days I have had a number of calls to the effect that our exporting factories who deal with Middle East countries are not quoting for our beef animals.  I have to question the validity of the Opposition taking credit for the proposed deal that we knew was made before they went to Libya some months ago.  Now farmers are in severe difficulties because they are not being asked to quote for animals they wish to sell.  The Opposition have tried to take credit for something at the expense of the farmers.  This is the second time false impressions were given about increased prices in the past nine or ten months and it was done by the same people who made the same trip at great cost to the farmers.  On the basis of my information there are about 2,000 beef farmers in my country who are unable to sell animals at this time of the year when there should be swift trade.</P>
    <P>These people were given a false impression regarding the prices available and the deals that were made.  The farmer paid increased prices over two months last spring and thus lost money under the summer system of grazing.  Now the winter man is buying stores and losing money.  Two weeks ago cattle could not be bought at 118p a pound and last week there were no quotations.  Here we are today in this House talking about improved quality for the future of those markets.  I must ask where are the proposed markets about which a large number of Opposition Members came in here and tried to boast.  Unfortunately, it comes back to the man in the street or <Col N="999" /> the farmer down the country paying for that now.</P>
    <P>We are talking about the future and about the type of animal we would like to see available for these markets.  I hope, this being one of the days when we will have many more important things to talk about regarding the future of the country, being budget day, that we will remember the damage done on two occasions within ten months by trying to inflict on the Irish people proposals and deals which will mean that the farmers on the second occasion will be losing large amounts of money.</P>
    <P>I welcome the figures that the Minister gave of the number of farmers who are using the AI service.  It is an excellent service which has improved enormously the quality of our breeding stocks throughout the country.  Recently I visited the district milk board's breeding station in my constituency where excellent work has been done but I cannot for the life of me believe, with that system and the added expense of only pedigree bulls being allowed, that we will have the results from the suckler cow herds that we require.  We are all aware of the emphasis placed on getting out of milk production because of the super-levy and people in Europe are asking farmers to transfer or change their line of business into other areas.  One very important area is the suckler cow area, and in so far as the disadvantaged areas are concerned I welcome the calf grant which was announced as coming in early this year.  If we are in earnest about the concept of increasing suckler cow herds that grant should be available throughout the country and then we would see large increases in the transfer from dairying to perhaps suckler beef.  If we were in earnest about it as a Government or as a country we would increase the business in and the income from that area.  We are all aware that the income from there is very small compared with dairying.  If we are prepared to do that there will be a great deal of substance in bringing in and permitting only licensed and pedigree bulls for that section of farming.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1000" /> I have talked to many people about the proposed legislation and as a result I feel there is only one way out for the poorer farmer with the small herd, that the half-bred continental type animal be allowed to be licensed, provided he passes the criteria of the Department.  I am sure that Department officials who have been working on that since the early seventies are aware that some of these animals can be excellent and of top quality, depending on the type of animal that the half-bred animal is bred from.  I am sure the Minister will take what I have said into consideration.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposed Bill, but with the cost and the emphasis we must place on the future of the cattle trade and what we require in so far as our European and third country buyers are concerned, we must improve the standard of our animals. Over the years that has improved enormously, and if we make the kind of amendment that I have mentioned to the Bill we will not do any severe harm to the cattle breeding industry.  We will give the small producer an opportunity to provide for his herd at a very low cost, animals that would be quite acceptable and would produce top quality beef cattle.</P>
    <P>This Bill is welcome for the reason.  I stated earlier, that there should be no question of allowing any animal to be used throughout the country without taking into consideration whether the animal is of top quality.  I hope that in the aftermath of what has happened to our cattle trade in the last ten months, the false allegations of proposals and counter-proposals of increase in prices and trade and markets being available for our animals, those farmers who unfortunately have lost thousands upon thousands of pounds even in the last three to four weeks at least will be able to sell their beef animals at this time of the year when the cost of winter feed is greatest. Certain people in this House have much to answer for in that connection.</P>
    <P>I hope that the Minister will take into consideration what I have mentioned here this morning.  I know that he cannot do anything about the other aspect of the increased prices in the cattle trade that I <Col N="1001" /> have mentioned, but it is no harm to put on record here that a large number of farmers in this country in the last 12 months have lost a great deal of money over allegations of proposed deals that never took place.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill will have an adverse effect on this country for the next couple of years due to the fact that less milk will be produced in that time and also fewer beef cattle will be produced. For a number of years people in the pure-bred bull breeding business have been putting pressure on the Minister for Agriculture and the Department of Agriculture to allow none other than pure-bred bulls to be used.  Now when this Bill has come before us the Minister and the Department have acceded to their request.  I have nothing against the people in the pure-bred bull business.  Last year the price of pure-bred bulls ranged from £1,500 to £3,000.  This legislation will mean that there will not be sufficient pure-bred bull to meet the requirements because 75 per cent of the bulls used in the past 30 to 40 years have been non-pedigree animals.  The shortage in the numbers will mean considerable increases in the price of bulls and this will make it prohibitive for many small farmers, especially dairy farmers, to purchase pure-bred bulls.</P>
      <P>Last year I spoke with a farmer who travelled from my country to Limerick to purchase a pure-bred bull.  He was anxious to acquire a pure-bred Hereford, but the cost of those animals was so high that he had to settle for a lesser quality bull which, though a pure-bred, did not suit the farmer because calves that would be born to cows serviced by that bull would be so big as to cause problems at the time of calving.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I come from a great dairying country, a country in which about 90 million gallons of milk are produced each year.  While there are suckler herds in the country, the activity is mainly in dairying.  With such a high output of milk, it is obvious that the producers are very conscious of this Bill.  I wonder if the Minister of State has ascertained from the managers of marts the number of non-pedigree bulls sold at <Col N="1002" /> the marts each year.  I undertook such a task during the weekend and I found that between 70 and 80 per cent of the bulls sold, bulls that would weigh between 12 and 14 cwt. and which are very suitable for factories, were non-pedigree.</P>
    <P>The AI service is used fairly extensively in my country.  There are some fairly big milk producers in the country but also some very small producers.  While a number of dairy farmers in my constituency can keep up to 50 cows there are others who keep only ten or 12.  It is very difficult to succeed in putting all the cows in a herd in calf by means of the AI service. Consequently, a number of farmers in my area keep non-pedigree bulls but bulls that are of good quality.  These farmers have their very good dairy cows serviced by way of AI and use the non-pedigree bull for the remainder, leaving the bull to run with the heifers.  Anyone who knows anything about farming knows that if there are a number of heifers together and if they are not running with the cows, it is difficult to know when they are in heat.  Since many farmers would not be in a position to purchase pedigree bulls, many heifers that are not running with the cows will not be put in calf because to ensure their being put in calf it is necessary to have a bull running with them.</P>
    <P>Down through the years farmers have been using non-pedigree bulls but the quality of the calves produced as a result of using those bulls was as good as, if not better than, the calves produced by using pedigree bulls.  Because of the high preponderance of dairy farming in my county, we supply calves to a number of other counties.  Up to 75 per cent of the calves produced each year are sold.  As a farmer I have occasion frequently to visit the marts but I have never had any reason to complain about the quality of the calves or of the cattle generally in Kerry.</P>
    <P>I noticed that the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i> are opposing the Bill.  In last week's issue there is a reference to the legislation being unnecessary and to it doing untold damage to the suckler herds where non-pedigree bulls have been used up to now. <Col N="1003" /> During the years when there were inspections of non-pedigree bulls, the number of inspections, according to the Minister's figure, was about 7,000 each year and 90 per cent of those inspected passed the test.  The cost of that scheme to the Exchequer was £156,000.  Even at this late stage we should reintroduce that scheme instead of relying solely on pedigree bulls because a few years will elapse before we can build up an adequate herd.</P>
    <P>The Minister should have given at least 12 months notice of this legislation so that those involved in breeding pedigree animals could have taken steps to increase production.</P>
    <P>I submit that the figures in 12 months time will show a drop in milk production as a result of cows not being put in calf because of farmers having to use the AI service and not having non-pedigree bulls to fall back on.  At this point they do not know whether the milk levy is on or off. Perhaps the Minister would welcome a reduction in milk production on the basis that it would save him some embarrassment in regard to the mistake he made in dealing with the levy.</P>
    <P>Many of the farmers in my area have said that they would prefer to breed their cows to a non-pedigree bull.  If the breeding is too fine one gets a beast which might not be suitable to our climate.  In a couple of years we may have to go back to the non-pedigree bulls.  The Minister in his speech mentioned scrub bulls, but they have been gone for the past 20 years. The non-pedigree bull is a good animal and most farmers are educated enough to keep a good non-pedigree bull so as to get a good calf for sale.  If this Bill is passed the price of pedigree bulls will be so prohibitive that many small farmers will not be able to afford them.  The Minister should introduce a subsidy, perhaps for farmers with under 30 cows so that they can purchase pedigree bulls. In recent times farmers had small farms assistance but that has been virtually discontinued.  They also enjoyed an AI subsidy but that also has been discontinued. Now we are introducing this <Col N="1004" /> Bill which will be a further burden on them as they will not have the money to purchase pure-bred bulls.</P>
    <P>Deputy Farrelly talked about the sale of cattle.  The prices of cattle were never better.  We should appreciate the fact that Deputy Haughey went to Libya with a delegation and did a great deal for us in getting back our order for cattle, beef and poultry.  As a result of that the price of cattle went from £80 to £100 a head here.  Deputy Farrelly said that the sale of cattle in his county last week was not good.  There was not a depression in the sale of cattle in my county.  There are always peaks and valleys in the sale of cattle for one reason or another but we should appreciate the fact that we can now export our cattle to Libya.  The present Government did not succeed in getting that order from Libya&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>On the morning <Col N="1005" /> before the presentation of the budget we have heard sufficient comment about bulls so I will not detain the House long with what I have to say.</P>
      <P>Everybody agrees that to the Exchequer, for the financial well being of the country and to the farming community the livestock industry is most important. Every effort should be made to ensure that quality animals are produced. I could never understand why the previous administration decided to discontinue the licensing of bulls in 1982.  It had been part of the farming structure since 1925 when the Act was introduced and it helped to increase the quality of animals and the quality of breeding considerably in that time.</P>
      <P>Submissions have been made to every Deputy from the Sneem Development Co-operative Society Limited.  They are seriously concerned about the effect of this legislation and every Deputy from the Kerry area has seemed to echo their sentiments.  I do not entirely agree with what has been said by them and the Bill will not have the effect that they envisage. I agree with the Minister in reintroducing measures to ensure that quality bulls are registered.  I may disagree with the Minister slightly on some points but the Minister has been advised by officials of his Department in relation to the quality of animals and how the livestock industry, particularly the beef sector, is developing.</P>
      <P>Quite sizeable fines are imposed under this Bill for keeping an unregistered bull. The farmer will have to apply to the Department to find out the conditions for registering.  The breeding societies are the important people with regard to the supply of quality animals to the market. They will have their animals submitted for registration into their herdbooks at the age of nine months and subsequently. A lot of concern and dismay have been mentioned in relation to the non-availability or scarcity of such quality animals, but that will sort itself out.  The market place will determine whether it is profitable to become breeders of such quality animals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1006" /> Deputy McCartin expressed serious reservations about the involvement of the Garda Síochána in becoming inspectors. This is not necessary.  Yesterday we debated the Animals Bill into which the Garda Síochána were drawn and now in this Bill the Garda Síochána are again being asked to play a very vital role.  They have sufficient work of their own.  If we are serious about this legislation in the interests of the economy there are sufficient personnel within the Department of Agriculture to be used in the local veterinary offices to ensure that the law is carried out to the full.  It would be wrong to ask the Garda to become involved in this and I would agree totally with Deputy McCartin in that regard.</P>
    <P>The £600 fine for keeping an unregistered bull is severe and farmers will think twice about doing so.  There is a £250 fine for failure to produce a certificate and £1,000 for altering a permit.  These are quite substantial fines which will have the necessary effect.  The legislation has advantages.  Of that there is no doubt. The objective is to ensure a supply of quality beef.  This is an important element in our economy.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim gloated that his party's leader, Deputy Haughey, was able to go to Libya and bring home what appeared to have been a lost beef deal.  I do not think that Fianna Fáil members honestly believe that and the great majority of people throughout the country do not believe it.  The Deputy may have made a contribution towards it and we congratulate him for that.  We welcome any contribution from any member of the Opposition which will ensure sale for any product, beef or otherwise.</P>

      <P>The only reasons for countries trading with one another is because of advantages.  If Libya wants meat from Ireland and needs it badly then if given the right price it will buy the meat.  The Departments of Agriculture and of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism are quite alert to that.  Their role must not be played down by the politicians.  There are many inherent dangers in doing that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference was also made to the milk levy and it was mentioned that the Minister for Agriculture had made a mistake in this regard.  I could not let that statement go without comment.  The Minister for Agriculture did not make any mistake.  Unfortunately, there was a difference of opinion about a certain tonnage of milk, but I am confident that that difficulty will be sorted out in time also. It is what has actually been produced in 1983 which is important.  All the farmers and people in non-farming areas, are assured of the commitment of the Minister for Agriculture to getting the best deal for the country and are aware of his efforts in securing what was way and above that anticipated at the time.  Both sides of the House were complementary in that regard and we should leave it at <Col N="1008" /> that.  There should not have been references to mistakes made.</P>
    <P>With regard to the advantages in this Bill, improvement of quality is admirable. The IFA animal committee would be fully supportive of that.  Other organisations, perhaps the ICMSA, have a wider umbrella over a smaller area and would have doubts about the desirability of this legislation.  People often have found difficulty in recognising the desirability of certain legislation, but something which is in the national interest, and this surely is, must be a matter for congratulating the Minister for taking this vital step.  I have been told by people going to marts that the quality of calves is dropping.  I do not know the reason for this.  I am not sure if the concept of pure pedigree quality is to some extent the reason.  I have seen pedigree breeds drop in quality. I have been associated, right through my youth, with the breeding of Aberdeen Angus cattle.  That breed was very much in demand in the forties and fifties, but there does not appear to be the same demand for it today.  It has been said by experts that that breed was allowed to degenerate to such an extent that it eventually became unacceptable.</P>
    <P>This legislation would lead to the greater use of artificial insemination, which has most certainly improved the quality of animals over the years.  The Government have always been committed to ensuring the availability of artificial insemination for all parts of the country. In the areas where there are small cow numbers it has been claimed that this legislation will reduce them still further. These fears are to some extent unfounded.  The Opposition spokesman did not reflect the fears expressed in the submissions of the Sneem co-operative and he was wise, because he understands the industry.  He knows what is involved in having proper quality bulls for the production of beef.</P>
    <P>Not to permit some continental breeds of bull might be a mistake and amendments have been suggested to the Minister in that regard.  He has been asked to investigate further the possibility of <Col N="1009" /> licensing good quality non-pedigree continental bulls for beef purposes.  Good crosses of certain types of breeds have ensured a good supply of beef cattle. There is the very legitimate claim that not all farmers, particularly in the suckler cow herd area, will be in a position to own a bull themselves unless the price dramatically drops because of an increase in the number of people producing such quality bulls.  Through the agency of ACOT perhaps the Minister would consider providing premiums or other incentives to ensure such possibility of ownership.  Cow and calf numbers could drop in disadvantaged areas unless there is introduced what has been referred to as the straw bull element.  I know of no farmer who will allow in a straw bull just for the sake of having one on his farm. Most of these people are experienced and recognise what is a good cross breed. Indeed, this element exists in every industry, whether it is horse racing, dog racing and so on, when one can come up with the occasional good cross breed animal which can be extremely successful. Nobody can say for certain whether cross breeds are less effective in certain circumstances than the pure bred.  If we confine ourselves absolutely to the pure bred area then we shall tend to reduce the quality and size of animal produced. The Minister might investigate some of the very important continental breeds such as Simmental, Charolais, and others, whose progeny I have seen and are of excellent quality.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will bear in mind the many sincere contributions and suggestions made on behalf of people genuinely interested in the development of the industry along lines welcomed by the Department of Agriculture.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill as constituting a contribution to the upgrading of our cattle herd generally, both beef and dairy herds.  As I see it there is only one contentious section, section 3, which insists on the use of pure bred pedigree bulls only.  However, under subsection (1)  it may be possible to allow people in <Col N="1010" /> disadvantaged areas &mdash; and to whom all Deputies have made reference &mdash; to be issued with permits.  I am thinking of people in remote, severely disadvantaged areas and those on islands off our coast who have not had the availability of the AI service or the necessary resources with which to purchase pedigree pure bred bulls.  I join with other contributors from both sides of the House in requesting the Minister to examine the possibility of introducing some amendment on Committee Stage to give some amelioration to those people.  I realise this will be difficult because one either has pure bred or one has not.  It is somewhat like trying to be almost a virgin, a virtually impossible status to achieve.</P>
      <P>It should be borne in mind that the beef industry is a £1,000 million industry of which approximately 75 to 80 per cent of its product is exported.  Therefore, we need top quality.  In recent times the status of this industry has not been that good with the collapse of certain meat plants, in particular, and difficulties encountered with contracts in Libya and, more recently, in Canada.  The Libyan situation has been sorted out and I would hope that the Canadian one can likewise be.  I hope that the recent cessation of the derogation <i>vis-á-vis</i> the status of the Irish cattle industry in regard to our &ldquo;white country&rdquo; status regarding the foot and mouth disease regulations did not have any deleterious effect on the Canadian situation because we had there a £40 million export market which was terminated rather abruptly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regarding the dairy herd the position has not been too good despite the availability of the AI service to those herds over the past 30 years.  The yield of the Irish dairy cow is only approximately half that of the better dairy producer in the Netherlands and, in particular, in Denmark. If we want to improve that situation I suggest that our AI centres and cattle breeding stations become more through in their selection of sires.  This programme, having been in operation for 30 years with a yield still in the region of 700 gallons per cow, demonstrates that there is something radically wrong.  There <Col N="1011" /> is no reason whatsoever why that yield could not be raised to at least 1,200 gallons. There has been reference to the pedigree breeder &mdash; an exclusive, elite club, 99 per cent of whom have yields in the higher bracket &mdash; setting a headline for the rest of the industry.</P>
    <P>In addition to having a relatively low volume factor, the constituent content of milk is also relatively low.  It is somewhat a disgrace that Ireland can still achieve only 85 per cent of the EC target price of milk.  We should be able to achieve much closer to the 100 per cent, as they do in the Netherlands, where it is 104 per cent to 106 per cent of the target price.  The reason for our figures is the poor quality breeding.  I would hope that the provisions of this Bill would contribute to such improvement.  I hope milk purchasers, in particular some of the larger co-operatives, would move away from the recent development of paying for milk on volume only.  Rather it will have to be paid for on a constituent basis because it must be remembered that it is converted into milk products and volume is of no great value unless the solids and constituents are of a high order.</P>
    <P>Following the introduction of a super-levy quota for the dairy herd, farmers will have to seek alternative enterprises, which for many will mean getting into beef.  In the past decade the beef herd has been reduced by approximately 50 per cent.  If there is to be a reduction in the dairy herd following the introduction of the super levy &mdash; because 80 to 85 per cent of calves for the beef herd come from the dairy herd &mdash; there could be a tremendous scarcity of cattle.</P>
    <P>It will be important that the provisions of this Bill focus attention on increasing the beef herd, not only in quantity but in quality also.  I would hope that, for example, the suckler cow premium, which unfortunately will not be introduced for another year, will contribute thereto because there has been a considerable reduction in the numbers of beef cattle.  Of course there have been a number of other constraints like the seasonality of supply.  Roughly twice as <Col N="1012" /> many cattle go for slaughter at the back end of the year which puts pressure on factories.  At this time of the year there are close downs and under-utilisation. That will have to be rectified if we want to have a steamlined, efficient and effective industry.</P>
    <P>We have the same thing in milk production where we have a 16:1 ratio in the summer versus winter production.  For any kind of efficient and effective industry we need continuous production all the year round.  Last year we had a massive increase in the amount of processed meat for export and in particular vacuum packs.  Many more of our slaughtering firms should increase their capacity for the additional processing of meat and meat products.  One need only take a stroll down this town or any other town to find that we import a considerable amount of meat products.  With the ending of the derogation on foot and mouth regulations, unfortunately, there will be an increase in the importation of meat products just as there is in the importation of dairy products.</P>
    <P>With regard to the collapse of factories in recent times, and in particular the collapse of Clover a number of months ago I suggested that the industry might look at a scheme to introduce protective bonding for the industry to ensure that farmers who sell their entire year's production to a factory will not find themselves pauperised because a firm suddenly collapses and leaves them high and dry without a penny.  Members of local authorities know that very successful bonding schemes were introduced to protect house owners from builders who left an estate unfinished.  The same thing happened in the case of the travel business.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about the status and the morale of the dairy and beef industries.  I am suggesting that perhaps a bonding scheme could be introduced <Col N="1013" /> to protect beef producers and farmers.  That would be in the long term interests of the industry.  I am giving two examples: one in the are of the local authorities and one in the area of the travel business.  A Bill was put through this House to protect people.</P>
      <P>Last year we had in excess of one million cattle slaughtered in our factories. The bulk of those cattle would be worth in the order of £800, £900 or £1,000.  If we had a protective £1 bond that would make up a fund of £1 million per annum. The total loss to the farmers in the case of Clover was £1 million.  It would be easy enough over a number of years to build up a sizeable fund.  This would be in the long term interests of the producers, the cattle breeders and the beef industry generally.  I ask the Minister to look into that matter.</P>
      <P>I welcome the Bill.  I hope that, in the contentious area of suckler farmers in the disadvantaged areas and the severely handicapped isolated remote areas where they have not got access to the AI service, the Minister will consider introducing an amendment on Committee Stage to reduce the impact of that problem.  If that is done the Bill will be a fairly major contribution to the enhancement and improvement of the industry.  I will make a further contribution on Committee Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill if it will improve the standard of our cattle breeding.  The main purpose of the Bill is to give legal effect to the decision taken by the previous Government in October 1982 to discontinue the licensing of bulls. We are told the Bill will also provide legislative power to prohibit the use of non-pure-bred bulls for breeding purposes. I am not happy about the phrase <Col N="1014" /> non-pure-bred bulls.  Before going into that in detail, it is important that we should know the very important role we play.  Irish farmers produce the highest quality of beef for our home and export markets.  We must keep up that tradition. Only the best will survive in a strong, competitive export market.  The Irish housewife is now a very discerning customer. Only prime quality beef will meet her demands and only the best quality cuts will be purchased by her.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>Rightly so.  In 1984 the value of our livestock meat trade and by products amounted to £890 million in exports, an estimated 19 per cent of our total national exports.  Total beef exports were estimated at 251,000 tonnes, an increase of 4 per cent over the 1983 figure.  The United Kingdom remains our biggest customer accounting for 98,000 tonnes of those beef exports, with approximately 95,000 tonnes going to third countries and 50,000 tonnes to other EC countries.  Bearing those figures in mind, it is vital that we produce the best quality product possible to ensure a continuity of our export trade.  Total shipment of live cattle in 1984 was estimated at 396,000 head, valued at £235 million, which includes export refunds, MCAs, and so on.  This was 9 per cent lower than the figure in 1983 and 175,000 cattle were shipped to third world countries in 1984 compared with 234,000 in 1983.  These figures are very interesting.  While many worthwhile proposals are included in this Bill, the Minister should give serious consideration to inserting a clause in the Bill providing that farmers in disadvantaged areas can use both pedigree and what I call quality half bred bulls of recognised beef breeds.  This would be an immense advantage to the thousands of small farmers in the disadvantaged areas from Mizen Head in Cork to Malin Head in Donegal.</P>

      <P>Those small breeders must be recognised because they are the backbone of the cattle industry.  The big rancher can change overnight from beef to milk or to sheep, but the small farmer on the western seaboard has one major problem, survival.  Although he may be insignificant in the eyes of some people, he is a very important part of the Irish economy.</P>
      <P>Therefore, it is important that farmers who are breeding to the best of their ability on small parcels of land along the western seaboard should be given incentives to stay in beef production.  Otherwise they will starve.  The last Fianna Fáil Government discontinued the bull licensing scheme.  Where was the clamour to do that and why was it done?  In 1982 a Fianna Fáil Minister scrapped the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture who scrapped it. It is most important that Irish farmers produce the highest quality beef for home and export markets.  I would not be in favour of giving <i>carte blanche</i> to Irish farmers to use non-pedigree bulls of any breed because it could give rise to widespread use of scrub bulls which would be to the detriment of the beef industry. <Col N="1016" /> No sane Minister could condone a policy whereby scrub bulls of inferior breeds would be allowed to roam at large in carnival mood through our beef cattle herds in disadvantaged areas.  Scrub bulls are a menace to our cattle industry and this must be regulated.  Fianna Fáil were very tame when they scrapped the scheme that would improve the standard of our cattle.  Of course they took the easy way out.</P>
      <P>There is room for a registered half-bred bull of high quality beef breeds to be kept by farmers in disadvantaged areas. After all, the AI stations throughout the country can supply that type of animal. It is well known that when small farmers go to recognised pedigree bull sales they find themselves competing against very strong opposition and will be outbid for valuable bulls.  It is very important, therefore, that such farmers would be compensated in some way.  That is why I ask the Minister for Agriculture to insert a clause in the Bill which would allow the introduction of the half-bred bull for the benefit of farmers who financially are not able to pay exhorbitant prices for bulls.</P>
      <P>After the enactment of the Livestock Breeding Act in 1925, 7,000 bulls were inspected annually at more than 400 centres. I am amazed that Fianna Fáil abolished that scheme.  It is well known that cross-breeding of beef animals in the past 30 to 40 years proved very successful in our beef cattle trade.  It is well known that the cross between a Hereford bull and a Friesian cow produces a very good calf.  I advise Deputies opposite to visit the marts in their constituencies.  They will see that when a black Hereford bull appears in the ring he will make at least £10 per kilo more than any other animal of his size and weight.  This should be borne in mind by the Minister when considering the Bill in Committee.</P>
      <P>I dislike the move to create a monopoly in any section to exploit our farmers.  I refer specifically to the pure-bred associations around the country who could be given a monopoly.  Then the price of pure bred bulls could be increased beyond the reach of ordinary farmers.</P>

However, at the moment that is not a question that has arisen. The main consultation is on alternative projects, whether they be in the health care area or otherwise.

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that to the extent possible multinational companies operating out of Ireland should work in conjunction with CTT but it will be appreciated that many of these companies, before they come to Ireland, have in place very sophisticated marketing operations which mean that they do not have great call on the services of CTT. The concern of the Deputy is that we should have early warning of any deviations from marketing performance of these companies which could have an adverse affect on the country.  One purpose of the company development approach which has been initiated and in which 50 companies will be involved this year is in the case of domestic and multinational companies to keep in touch with how the company is progressing so that difficulties can be anticipated in good time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that we should push all appropriate multinationals to locate a research and development and a marketing function here rather than simply a manufacturing function. The IDA press this very hard and have been very successful in a number of cases &mdash; for instance, the A &amp; D plant which has just been announced.  There is a problem that Ireland is a low tax environment so far as manufacturing is <Col N="1021" /> concerned and research and development and marketing are costs.  Companies want to locate cost creating items in areas where the tax is highest so that it can be offset against the most rather than the least amount of tax.  This difficulty is inherent in our present system which we have to overcome, but it is not easy to overcome it.</P>

That is contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome and I underlined this very firmly at my meeting with the Commissioner.  I intend to do everything I can with the present Commissioner on Competition Policy &mdash; a man who should understand Ireland's position &mdash; that something should be done about this.

      <P>There are no comprehensive statistics available to calculate accurate absenteeism levels for Irish industry.  The available evidence would suggest a general absenteeism rate of the order of 8 per cent to 13 per cent.  International comparisons are equally difficult but Ireland's position would seem to be close to the West European average.</P>
      <P>I have been very concerned at the effect of absenteeism on our industrial competitiveness and I believe that action can be taken to reduce the levels of absenteeism. In order to see what positive action could be undertaken by Government to improve the situation, I established in 1983 a ministerial task force to investigate the issue and report back to me.  I now have their report and recommendations and I hope to be in a position to present them to Government shortly. At this stage, however, I should stress that, while the Government may initiate certain action to combat absenteeism, it is primarily a function of management to tackle absenteeism at the level of the individual firm.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the absenteeism rate is between 8 per cent and 13 per cent, but would he confirm that there are certain sections of industry with absenteeism rates in excess of 20 per cent?

      <P>Real import substitution will only take place, however, when Irish goods and services can realistically compete with imported products in terms of price, quality and reliability.  The extensive services and expertise of State agencies are available to assist Irish industry in this regard. In relation to the Deputy's question concerning the introduction of an import substitution programme, the Deputy will be aware that, as a member of the European Communities, Ireland is generally precluded from restricting the import of materials produced in other member states or from engaging the services of State agencies to promote the sale of Irish made products over those produced in other member states.</P>

I am sure the Minister is aware that we have entered into GATT agreements <Col N="1028" /> on a wider scale which also imposes restrictions on us.  If we were not members of the Community, does the Minister believe that we could pursue a policy of discrimination against imports of goods from countries with whom we would have to trade in any case?  The Minister is probably aware that we have an adverse trade balance with only one member of the EC and that that country had a free trade agreement with us before we joined the Community.</P>

However, I do not accept that a policy of trade restriction serves the interest of anybody.  It is to the overall detriment of all countries to pursue such a policy.  What I have been describing in my replies to Deputy Crowley's question does not relate to restrictions on trade but to helping Irish industry to exploit the opportunities of trade to the maximum.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the plan he has for the co-ordination of the promotion and marketing of Irish goods on world markets, for example, through the work of agencies such as Córas Tráchtála, An Bord Bainne, Córas Beostoic agus Feola, the Pigs and Bacon Commission and the Irish Sugar Company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Córas Tráchtála has general responsibility to promote, assist and develop exports.  With the exception of the Pigs and Bacon Commission which no longer exists, the other bodies mentioned by the Deputy have responsibilities for particular sectors of the food industry.  I am satisfied that CTT constantly review arrangements with those other bodies so as to ensure maximum co-operation at a practical level.  For example, those bodies participate in <Col N="1029" /> national stands organised by CTT at international fairs.</P>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware, the Government have established a group of Ministers of State to review the involvement of Government agencies in the food industry with a view to ensuring that they operate in a fully co-ordinated manner and to identifying gaps or duplication in their operations.  The group consists of the Minister of State at the Departments of Foreign Affairs (Chairman), Industry Trade Commerce and Tourism, Agriculture and Fisheries and Forestry.  The group is currently examining submissions made by various interests including the bodies mentioned.</P>

      <P>The Minister has tidied up the situation at home in relation to the IDA, IIRS and the ICC.  Because of our huge exports, does the Minister agree that many valuable markets have been lost because of duplication and because of the fact that no one is responsible for some of our exports.  CBF are responsible for promotion and if CTT had responsibility for the co-ordination of all our marketing abroad, does the Minister agree that we would have much more streamlined sales and promotions?</P>

The group are now working on other agencies and they received submissions from 26 interests in the food and food-related sectors which they are currently considering. I agree that the maximum degree of co-operation is needed between existing agencies and the very fact that this group was established is recognition that there have been problems in this regard up to now.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is aware of the crisis position that exists in the writing of non-life assurance; the number of insurers who are sustaining substantial losses each year and the difficulties that creates for insurers and consumers alike; and if he will take steps <Col N="1032" /> to insure the protection of all interests involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that a crisis exists in the writing of non-life insurance business in this country.  Non-life insurers in Ireland are operating in difficult conditions, in common with most other insurance markets worldwide.  The industry has taken corrective measures, including premium rate increases, to improve matters and these are already showing fruit.  Excluding the largest motor insurer which as the Deputy knows is under administration, and the inclusion of whose reported results would distort the true picture, underwriting results improved in 1983 over 1982 with losses reduced from 21 per cent to 18½ per cent of premiums written.  Market underwriting performance improved in five of the seven main accounting classes, and two of these classes recorded an underwriting profit during 1983.</P>
      <P>It is important to bear in mind that, while financial results may vary from year to year, the Irish insurance industry is basically sound and customers need have no worries about doing business with it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is becoming increasingly more difficult to get the Minister of State to accept that there is a crisis as far as the insurance business is concerned in the non-life area.  Would the Minister now confirm that the 40 non-life companies operating at present sustained losses in excess £40 million last year?  Does he regard that as satisfactory?  No company in the non-life sector returned a trading profit last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is satisfied that the freedom of services that now exist in so far as the provision of insurance is concerned resultant from EC directives is in the best interest of the consumer; and if he is satisfied that insurance companies traditionally operating in Ireland are not placed at a commercial disadvantage because of the new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no EC directive in force relating to freedom of services in insurance, which in the context of the Treaty of Rome means the freedom for an insurer to write insurance in another member state without having to establish there by way of a branch or subsidiary.</P>
      <P>I take it therefore that the Deputy in referring to EC directives is referring to the EC Non-Life Directive of 24 July 1973 (73/239 EEC), the EC Life Assurance Directive of 5 March 1979 (79/267/EEC), which were implemented here in 1976 and 1984 respectively.  Both these directives relate to the freedom of EC insurers to establish by way of branch or subsidiary in another member state of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am required under these directives to grant an authorisation to EC life or non-life insurers wishing to establish here, once they meet the requirements of the relevant directive.  I am specifically excluded by the directive from examining an application for authorisation in the light of the commercial effect on existing insurers in the market.  The new entrants to the Irish market have obviously had an impact but by and large the existing <Col N="1035" /> insurers appear to be meeting the challenge. As for consumers, I have no reason to believe that the entry of new insurers had militated against their interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister of State agree that the advent of some insurers into the Irish scene over the past few years has had a debilitating effect on the progress made by native insurers and that they have cut their premiums substantially in order to compete with these outside insurers and that they have lost a considerable share of the market?  This is the reason the insurance business is in such turmoil and crisis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>For the information of the Deputy, since 1976 six head office and 13 branch office authorisations have been issued to non-life insurers.  For life assurers, seven head office and no branch office authorisations have been issued. With regard to the Deputy's statement, I am aware there have been price wars under certain headings which have led to a difficult situation for some companies. However, this has been relieved somewhat by the companies themselves who realise that price cutting has had some damaging effects on their profitable position. This is evident in the manner in which they are now approaching the market.</P>

      <P>If the Deputy has details of particular organisations facing current difficulties with public liability insurance, I will have the matter investigated if he gives these details to my Department or to me.  As far as the particular body referred to by the Deputy is concerned, I believe that the sporting body accepted the quote, which works out at an annual cost of £4.50 per member, and that the insurance cover involved has been extended considerably to include not only the central sporting body, but affiliated clubs and individual members.</P>

I do not think it necessary to take the steps suggested by the Deputy.  It is not my responsibility to force the insurance companies to cover any risk, and in certain sports one must admit that there are risks.  However, I am satisfied that the insurance now enjoyed by that organisation is reasonable in the context of the sport itself.</P>

I cannot <Col N="1043" /> say to the Deputy that the insurance cover for these sporting organisations will be cheap.  Insurance must reflect the risks involved and one must accept that certain sports are dangerous.

      <P>&mdash;protect those on low incomes from the impact of the recession.</P>
      <P>It is widely held that our tax levels are now an obstacle to economic development. Reform of the tax system is needed:</P>
      <P>&mdash;to help to create the conditions which will favour expansion of employment;</P>
      <P>&mdash;to reduce both the opportunities and the incentive for evasion; and</P>
      <P>&mdash;to restore the competitive balance between domestic business and commerce and their competitors in Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>Despite the severe constraints on the public finances in recent years, the Government have protected the incomes of the less well off and introduced important improvements.  Real rates of income support have improved in the past couple of years.  Today's budget measures will maintain that momentum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> These needs will be met and employment will be promoted by three of the central features of today's budget.</P>
    <P>The first is a radical change in the income tax structure, incorporating</P>
    <P>&mdash;a reduction in the number of tax rates to three: 35 per cent, 48 per cent and 60 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a substantial widening of the 35 per cent tax band;</P>
    <P>&mdash;abolition of the present top rate;</P>
    <P>&mdash;increases in personal and other allowances; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;reductions in tax liability all the way through the income scale for both single and married taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The second central feature is an equally radical reorganisation of the VAT system, incorporating a reduction in the number of rates to three: the rates will now be zero, 10 per cent and 23 per cent. This new structure will, by reducing the cash-flow and administrative burdens on productive activity and removing much of the incentive for legal and illegal imports, substantially improve the employment capacity of Irish commerce and industry.</P>
    <P>The third central feature of today's budget is an increase in social welfare payment rates by an amount slightly in excess of the expected rate of inflation between mid-1985 and mid-1986, together with improvements in a number of social welfare schemes.</P>
    <P>Today's budget measures will ensure that developments in the public finances will be in line with the targets set out in the national plan.  The effect of these measures on the cost of living will be about one-quarter of one per cent, the lowest impact since 1978.</P>
    <P>The international economic outlook for this year is reasonably favourable, after a very strong year in 1984.  Growth is expected to continue in 1985 but at a slower pace than last year.  The most encouraging factors on the domestic front are the declining inflation rate, now firmly in single figures and continuing to <Col N="1075" /> fall, and the improvement in the balance of payments.</P>
    <P Just="Center">REVIEW OF 1984 BUDGET OUTTURN</P>
    <P>Last year, for the first time since 1978, the budget deficit outturn was within target.  This was a welcome departure from the trend in the intervening years. Improvements in budgeting procedures and controls are clearly beginning to yield results.  This financial discipline will continue to be maintained at all levels.</P>
    <P>We were able last year to take advantage of improved market conditions and of Ireland's high credit standing to prepay £637 million in foreign loans maturing in the period to 1989 and to replace them with debt carrying a longer maturity and lower cost.  We were also able to renegotiate on more favourable terms and for a longer period a $500 million loan which had been raised in the United States in 1983.</P>
    <P Just="Center">THE ECONOMIC SITUATION</P>
    <P>Last year real gross domestic product grew by almost 3½ per cent, a rate of growth appreciably faster than the average for the rest of the European Community. Further significant progress was made in curbing inflation, with the average increase in consumer prices in 1984 easing to about 8½ per cent, compared with 10½ per cent in 1983 and 17 per cent in 1982.  In the 12 months to mid-November last, the year-on-year average increase slowed further to 6¾ per cent.</P>
    <P>The external account continued to improve, with the current balance of payments deficit falling to around 5 per cent of GDP, its lowest level since the mid seventies.  Both the agricultural and manufacturing sectors had output increases which were among the highest in recent decades.  While unemployment increased by more than 17,000, this increase was considerably smaller than the average increase of almost 30,000 a year in the preceding three years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1076" /> At the beginning of 1985, the economy is therefore well placed for the sustained expansion which is envisaged in the plan. If the conditions for sustainable growth in output and employment indicated in the plan are attained, the coming year should be one in which the Irish economy will make further significant progress. The rate of increase in consumer prices, taking account of the effects of this budget, should fall to 6 per cent or below, the lowest rate since 1968.  The balance of payments deficit on current account should register a further improvement, with the possibility that the value of exports of goods and services in 1985 will, for the first time in very many years, outstrip the cost of such imports.  Unemployment, taking account of the impact of special employment measures, should begin to level out and, given moderation in pay developments, there should be some pick-up in employment.</P>
    <P Just="Center">GENERAL BUDGET STRATEGY 1985</P>
    <P>BUILDING ON REALITY</P>
    <P>The national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i> sets out the overall shape of budget policy over the next three years.  This year's budget targets are consistent with the plan policy.</P>
    <P>As recognised in the plan, several factors constrain our ability to achieve reductions in the budget deficit.  Interest payments on the national debt have continued to grow; the high level of unemployment has called for considerably increased resources for income maintenance; and an expanding population &mdash; now more than 3,500,000 for the first time in this century &mdash; creates a greater demand for public services.  The strategy outlined in the plan reconciles the tendency towards increased expenditure with the resources likely to be available to us, and the need to generate the extra, sustained employment which we so badly require.</P>
    <P>The budget I am presenting today is generally in line with the projections <Col N="1077" /> which underlay <i>Building on Reality</i>.  The provision for central fund services is unchanged.  Overall provision for current supply services will be fractionally higher than planned, but receipts will also be higher than expected, resulting in a current budget deficit almost identical with that envisaged when <i>Building on Reality</i> was published, and equal to 7.9 per cent of GNP.  The overall provisions for capital expenditure differ only slightly from those projected in the plan.</P>
    <P>EMPLOYMENT</P>
    <P>Although it is projected that, given moderation in pay developments, employment should begin to pick up this year, special Government measures are needed to stop the growth in unemployment.</P>
    <P>Provision has already been made in the Estimates for major new employment and training schemes which will soon be under way.  The gross cost of the social employment scheme alone in 1985 is budgeted at almost £30 million and, when fully operational, it will provide part time employment for 10,000 persons who have been unemployed for one year or more. The success of the enterprise allowance scheme, which has already helped almost 5,000 unemployed persons to set up on their own, and of the many programmes operated under the auspices of the Youth Employment Agency, testifies to the response of this Government to the unemployment crisis.</P>
    <P>Expanded provisions in the Estimate for the IDA, Córas Trála, the National Development Corporation and the other promotion and rescue agencies are pitched at the highest possible levels.</P>
    <P>My main purpose today is to tackle those features of the tax code which at present inhibit the expansion of employment. In doing this, I have to be conscious of the fact that a relief in one area generally results in a higher tax burden elsewhere. The changes I will propose today have been carefully designed to have the maximum possible beneficial effect on employment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1078" /> Before going on to the details of today's budget, I should first like to set out the Government's views on public service pay and incomes policy generally.</P>
    <P Just="Center">PUBLIC SERVICE PAY AND INCOMES POLICY</P>
    <P>PUBLIC SERVICE PAY</P>
    <P>In the past three years substantial progress has been made in containing the growth of the Exchequer pay and pensions bill.  The percentage increase in expenditure over the preceding year has fallen from 15 per cent in 1982 to 10 per cent in 1983 and to just over 7 per cent in 1984, when the provisional outturn amounted to £2,340 million.</P>
    <P>The plan provided £2,400 million for public service pay in 1985.  This is only £20 million more than the published estimate at current rates of pay.  The arbitrator's recent finding of 3 per cent from January and 3 per cent from July in respect of Civil Service grades would cost £108 million if implemented and applied throughout the public service.</P>
    <P>The Government are prepared to make provision for a twenty-fourth round in the public service based on this finding. But there must be offsetting savings to secure a budget deficit in line with that planned.</P>
    <P>The experience in the past two years has been that public service pay has turned out about £35 million lower than estimated in each year.  That is because of tight control over spending in this area. The Government have determined that a saving of £30 million can be made this year, bringing the pay figure at current rates down to £2,350 million.</P>
    <P>The excess over the plan provision can be accommodated, taking account of the revenue position and of savings which I will detail later, while the current budget deficit will be kept within £6 million of what was envisaged in the plan arithmetic.</P>
    <P>GENERAL INCOMES POLICY</P>
    <P>The Government's guideline for pay in <Col N="1079" /> the twenty-fourth round, as set out in their statement of 2 April 1984, called for a long pay pause followed by an increase of not more than a few percentage points. The statement identified a number of criteria, particularly the impact of proposed settlements on employment prospects, which parties to pay negotiations were expected to take into account.  While settlements in 1984 were more moderate than in previous rounds, and in some instances reflected employment considerations, the trend here was still out of line with trends in competitor countries.  In the manufacturing sector last year, for example, hourly earnings increased by about 10 per cent compared with an increase of about 6½ per cent for our main trading partners.  This undoubtedly contributed to job losses in that sector.</P>
    <P>It is essential that there be a significant further moderation in the rate of pay increases in 1985, in order to maintain, and preferably to improve, our cost competitiveness. The Government's stated pay policy objective is that average pay increases in the private sector should not exceed those in competitor countries.  It is now expected that average earnings among our main trading partners will again be limited to an increase of about 6½ per cent in 1985.  Here, on the other hand, there will be a substantial carryover into 1985 from last year's settlements, leaving limited scope for new pay increases if the competitiveness of Irish labour is to be improved.  The fall in the inflation rate to 6 per cent or less and the income tax improvements in today's budget will provide even further grounds for moderation this year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CURRENT EXPENDITURE</P>
    <P>CENTRAL FUND SERVICES</P>
    <P>The estimate for expenditure on Central Fund Services this year, at £2,250 million, is £322 million or almost 17 per cent higher than the 1984 outturn.  The debt service component is up by £286 million on 1984, and as a proportion of <Col N="1080" /> GNP it shows an increase of about one percentage point.  This increase puts a major strain on the 1985 budget arithmetic. To attempt to offset this increase fully this year would, however, require further large-scale expenditure reductions.  The Government consider that this would not be justified, particularly as the mediumterm expectations are that interest rates will fall significantly by 1987.  This, combined with the absolute necessity of halting the rise in the tax burden, is the principal reason for the Government having decided that the overall level of Exchequer borrowing as a proportion of GNP in 1985 should not be reduced below the 1984 level.</P>
    <P>CURRENT SUPPLY SERVICES</P>
    <P>The published 1985 Estimates for the non-capital supply services amount to £5,318.5 million.  I will be announcing adjustments to these provisions later, the net effect of which, taking account of the addition to the pay provision to which I have already referred, will be to add £115.7 million to current expenditure. Allowing for this, and for the deduction of £50 million Departmental balances, the post-budget provision for the non-capital supply services is just over £5,384 million.  This is an increase of some 6¼ per cent in day-to-day expenditure compared with increases of 22 per cent in 1982, 11.4 per cent in 1983 and 8.8 per cent in 1984. The 1985 budget provision of £5,384 million represents a reduction in the proportion of GNP taken up by day-to-day expenditure from about 35.0 per cent in 1984 to 34.6 per cent in 1985, the first reduction in the last seven years, and a start on the way towards the plan target of under 33 per cent of GNP by 1987.</P>
    <P>EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS</P>
    <P>Apart from the pay saving mentioned earlier, the Government have considered closely whether other reductions could be made in the Estimates provisions for the cost of providing current services.  In the light of the most up-to-date information now available about actual 1984 non-capital supply expenditure by Departments, <Col N="1081" /> and the recent slowing-down in the rate of inflation, they have decided on certain reductions in the published Estimates totalling £28.6 million.  These reductions, and the other changes affecting expenditure which I am announcing today, will be reflected in the revised 1985 Estimates which will be published shortly.</P>
    <P>LOCAL AUTHORITIES</P>
    <P>The Government have decided, in the light of the increased provision for public service pay referred to earlier, to make an additional £9.5 million in respect of remuneration available to local authorities by way of an increase in the rates support grant.</P>
    <P>SOCIAL WELFARE</P>
    <P>This year's total social welfare outlays will exceed £2.25 billion.  While economic difficulties have imposed a heavy burden in recent years, other factors have also contributed to the rapid growth in transfer payments.  These include demographic changes and real increases in benefit levels.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Long-term Weekly Benefits</i></P>
    <P>The last two budgets provided increases in long-term rates of benefit totalling almost 20 per cent to cover the period from mid-1983 to mid-1985, while inflation in this period is unlikely to exceed 15 per cent.  The Government's commitment to match the rate of inflation has been more than honoured.  This is in marked contrast to what has been happening during this period in many other European countries.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided to increase long-term weekly social welfare rates by 6½ per cent with effect from 11 July 1985.  Weekly health allowances will be increased correspondingly.</P>
    <P>&mdash; This will mean an extra £3.15 a week for a contributory old age pensioner under 80, bringing the maximum pension up to £51.40 a week.</P>
    <P>&mdash;For a married couple where both are <Col N="1082" /> of pensionable age, the increase will mean an additional £5.50 a week, bringing their maximum pension up to £89.75 a week.</P>
    <P>&mdash;The non-contributory old-age pension will be increased by £2.70, bringing it to a maximum of £44 a week.</P>
    <P>&mdash;A widow with three children on a contributory pension will receive an additional £5.25 a week, bringing her weekly income figure to £85.95.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Short-term Weekly Benefits</i></P>
    <P>The Government have reviewed short-term rates of benefit, notably unemployment and disability benefits, with particular regard to the relationship with disposable earnings.  It has been decided to increase weekly short-term welfare rates by 6 per cent from 11 July.  However, rates of unemployment assistance for long duration recipients will be increased by 6½ per cent.</P>
    <P>Full details of the various increases are included in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Equal Treatment</i></P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that legislative proposals have been introduced to afford equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security.  The principal beneficiaries of the proposed changes will be married women who, until now, were eligible for certain benefits at reduced rates only, or for shorter periods of time than their male counterparts and were not entitled to unemployment assistance.  The proposed legislation will be debated shortly by the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Action to Combat Poverty</i></P>
    <P>The Government have prepared legislation to establish a new anti-poverty organisation, to be called &ldquo;The Combat Poverty Agency&rdquo;.  The functions of the agency will include the promotion of research into the nature, causes and extent of poverty, the making of policy <Col N="1083" /> recommendations in areas affecting people in poverty or at risk of poverty and the testing of possible new anti-poverty programmes on an experimental basis.</P>
    <P>The second EEC combat poverty programme was recently agreed under the Irish Presidency.  Under this programme, assistance will be available for a limited number of suitable projects in Ireland.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Family Income Supplement</i></P>
    <P>The family income supplement scheme took effect from 1 November last with payments backdated to 6 September for those who claimed before 1 December. The purpose of the scheme is to redress the imbalance between weekly welfare rates and take-home pay for those on low incomes.  As a result of the increases in short-term social welfare benefits and today's changes in personal income taxation, the weekly amounts of income which determine entitlements under this scheme will be increased from next July.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Treatment Benefits</i></P>
    <P>The Government have decided that, from 11 July next, dental, optical and aural benefits under the social insurance treatment benefit scheme will be made available to all pregnant women whose husbands are fully insured.  This is a first step in the extension of these benefits to all non-working wives of fully-insured persons.  The cost of this measure will be met from within the published provision for social welfare.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Other Social Welfare Policy Changes</i></P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that for the third year in succession the Social Insurance Fund contribution rate will not be increased, despite higher social insurance expenditure.  However, the published Estimates for 1985 provide for an increase in the earnings ceiling from £13,000 to £13,800 with effect from April next.  The Estimates also provide for an increase in the income ceiling applicable to the 1 per cent health levy from £12,000 to £13,000, with effect from the same <Col N="1084" /> date.  Provision is also made for an increase from £43 to £49 from April next in the weekly earnings floor above which pay-related benefit is calculated.</P>
    <P>Following the passage of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, the redundancy fund has been renamed the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.  Under this Act, certain additional charges may arise on the fund.  To take account of this and of the need to maintain the solvency of the fund, it has been decided to increase the employers' standard contribution rate by 0.1 of a percentage point, that is, from 0.4 per cent to 0.5 per cent, with effect from April 1985.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Overseas Volunteers</i></P>
    <P>Before leaving the area of contributions, I should mention that the Minister for Social Welfare is urgently examining the social insurance position of certain Irish volunteer development workers who go to developing countries.  The Government wish to ensure that the social insurance position of such workers is safeguarded.  The necessary arrangements will be made in the context of the forthcoming Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Cost of Social Welfare Improvements</i></P>
    <P>The additional cost of the foregoing improvements in social welfare benefits, together with an increase in the value of fuel vouchers which I will announce later, is estimated at £59.4 million in 1985 and £123 million in a full year.  I am also making a contingency provision of £600,000 to meet outstanding claims arising from the abolition of the intermittent unemployment scheme with effect from 6 January last.  Taking account of anticipated savings on the Social Welfare Vote, the net cost comes to £55.5 million.</P>
    <P>SPECIAL EXPENDITURE PROVISIONS</P>
    <P>I should now like to mention a number of special additional expenditure allocations which the Government have approved.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1085" />&mdash;<i>Voluntary Organisations</i></P>
    <P>In each of the last two budgets the Government allocated £500,000 to provide once-off grants to meet special needs of a large number of voluntary organisations engaged in the social services area. We have included a similar provision in this year's published Estimates.  In recognition of the valuable work done by these bodies, the Government have decided to increase this provision by a further £150,000 to £650,000.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Irish Welfare Centres in Britain</i></P>
    <P>It has also been decided that the level of support for the Irish welfare centres in Britain should be increased from the £72,000 provided in the Estimates to £104,000.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>New Park Development in Cork City</i></P>
    <P>The Government are providing £300,000 towards the cost of the development of a new park at South Main Street in Cork, in conjunction with the celebrations marking the 800th anniversary of the founding of the city.</P>

      <P>&mdash;<i>European Music Year</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Twenty-three European nations are <Col N="1086" /> taking part in European Music Year 1985.  I am providing £100,000 to the Irish committee towards the cost of organising a suitable programme of events.</P>

    <P>&mdash;<i>Dublin Zoo</i></P>

      <i>Olympic Council of Ireland</i>
    </P>
    <P>Looking further ahead, I am providing a grant of £150,000 to the Olympic Council of Ireland this year to assist in the planning of this country's participation in the 1988 Olympic Games.</P>

      <i>Other Sporting Bodies</i>
    </P>
    <P>Additional assistance totalling £75,000 is being provided for other sporting bodies: the details are set out in the &ldquo;Principal Features of the Budget&rdquo;.  The total cost of these special provisions comes to £1.3 million.</P>
    <P>NATIONAL LOTTERY</P>
    <P>The Government announced in the plan their intention to set up a National Lottery, part of the proceeds of which will be devoted to sport.  The Government will shortly be considering detailed proposals in relation to the lottery.</P>
    <P>TAXATION</P>
    <P>TAXATION POLICY</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Tax Reform</i></P>
    <P>The national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> provides that there will be no increase in the overall level of taxation over the period of the plan.  This is the starting point for taxation policy in the present budget.  Given the overall budgetary constraints, it will be necessary to offset the reductions which I propose by a widening of the tax base and by limited tax increases in other areas.  The overall result will be a very substantial improvement in the distribution of the tax burden, a gain in simplicity and, above all, a positive stimulus to economic activity and employment.  The changes which I propose today will also eliminate a number of anomalies and open the way for continuing improvements over the next few years.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1088" /> INCOME TAX</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>All Taxpayers Benefit</i></P>
    <P>Government policy in relation to personal taxation is that, over the period of the plan, bands and allowances will be adjusted each year so that the overall income tax burden on taxpayers will not increase.  In order to give effect to this in the coming income tax year, changes are being made in the income tax bands, allowances and exemption limits.  I am also taking this opportunity, to the extent that budget constraints allow, to reorganise the income tax structure in order to remove some of the more marked disincentive effects and complexities.</P>
    <P>I am increasing the personal allowance from £3,600 to £3,800 for a married couple and from £1,800 to £1,900 for a single person.  In addition, the widowed person's allowance and the one-parent family allowance will each be increased by £100.</P>
    <P>Last year I abolished the 25 per cent band and widened the 35 per cent band. This was a first step towards simplifying the structure for income tax deductions. This year I am making major changes which will benefit all taxpayers.  The 35 per cent band will be widened by 12½ per cent to £4,500 for single persons and £9,000 for married couples.  The four bands at present above the standard rate &mdash; at 45 per cent, 55 per cent, 60 per cent and 65 per cent &mdash; will be replaced by two bands, one at 48 per cent and the other at 60 per cent.  The 48 per cent band will be £2,800 for single persons and £5,600 for married couples.  The balance of income will be taxed at the new reduced top rate of 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>This reform will effect changes all through the system.  All taxpayers will benefit from the increases in allowances and there will be benefits from the changes in rates and bands for taxpayers all the way up the income scale.</P>
    <P>Some 65,000 taxpayers who are now paying tax at the 45 per cent marginal rate will, as a result of these changes, see their marginal rate reduced to 35 per cent thus cutting by one-sixth the number of <Col N="1089" /> people paying tax at the higher rates.  A further 80,000 taxpayers, who at present are paying tax at a marginal rate of 55 per cent, will now have a top marginal rate of 48 per cent.  As a result of the abolition of the 65 per cent rate, more than 60,000 taxpayers will benefit from a reduction of their marginal rate from 65 per cent to 60 per cent.</P>
    <P>In all, 220,000 taxpayers will experience substantial reductions in their marginal rates or become free of income tax. Some 124,000 taxpayers will see their marginal rate move from 45 per cent to 48 per cent, but the marginal rate will, as a result of the changes in allowances and bands, apply to a smaller amount of income than heretofore, so that the net effect for these taxpayers will nevertheless be a reduction in tax liability.  The same is true of the 25,000 taxpayers whose marginal rate will move from 55 per cent to 60 per cent.  For almost 430,000 taxpayers, the marginal rate will remain unchanged at 35 per cent, while, for some 55,000, the rate will remain at 60 per cent but for both of these groups the increase in personal allowances will result in a reduction in tax liability.</P>

      <P>In line with these changes to the rates, bands and allowances, I am also increasing the general exemption limits for those on low incomes.  The limit for single and widowed persons will be increased from £2,500 to £2,650 and from £5,000 to £5,300 for married couples.  In addition, the age exemption limits are being increased from £2,800 to £3,000 for persons aged 65 years or over and from £3,300 to £3,500 for persons aged 75 years or over.  These limits will be doubled for married couples.  Marginal relief will continue to apply to incomes which do not significantly exceed these limits.  The changes to the exemption limits and the increases in personal allowances will remove about 15,500 taxpayers from liability. The cost of these adjustments will be £58 million in 1985 and £97 million in a full year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This reform in the income tax system will have four main benefits. First, it will benefit every taxpayer. Secondly, it should ensure that, in respect of income arising in the 1985/86 income tax year, the overall income tax burden on taxpayers will not increase.  Thirdly, it achieves a worthwhile simplification of the tax code.  Taxpayers, employers and the revenue authorities will all welcome this.  Fourthly, overall, the new structure will substantially improve the incentive to produce more and to earn more.  I am confident that this will be recognised by the many people who say that their motivation to work has been diminished by high marginal tax rates, and that they will feel again that extra effort is worthwhile.</P>
      <P>The special PRSI tax allowance and the temporary levy of 1 per cent on income are to be renewed for a further year.</P>
      <P>Last year, I exempted persons earning less than £5,000 a year or less than £96 per week from the income levy.  I am now raising this exemption limit to £5,300 per year, which is the equivalent of £102 per week for employees.</P>
      <P>The estimated cost of renewing the PRSI tax allowance is £55 million in 1985, while the renewal of the temporary 1 per cent levy with the increased exemption limit will yield £41.2 million this year.</P>
      <P>There will be improvements in a number of secondary allowances.</P>
      <P>The incapacitated child allowance will be increased from £500 to £600.</P>
      <P>The blind allowance will be raised from £500 to £600 and, where both spouses are blind, from £1,200 to £1,400.</P>
      <P>Last year, I made a substantial increase in the allowance available where a person is employed to take care of an incapacitated taxpayer or taxpayer's spouse and this year I am proposing a further increase from £2,000 to £2,500.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I propose to increase the ceiling on relief for rent paid by older persons to £1,500 for married couples and £750 <Col N="1091" /> for single persons and to reduce the age limit for eligibility from 60 to 55 years.</P>

      <P>&mdash;<i>Farmer Taxation</i></P>
      <P>Arrangements for the introduction of the farm tax, announced in the national plan, are in hand, and the necessary legislation will be published soon.  Farmers will of course continue to be liable for income tax up to the end of the 1985-86 tax year.  I propose to extend the existing stock relief arrangements for farmers for a further year at a cost in 1985 of £3 million.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Incentive for Land Leasing</i></P>
      <P>In order to promote the long term leasing out of land by persons who are unable to work it to its proper potential, it is proposed to exempt from income tax liability, from 1985-86 onwards, the first £2,000 of leasing income obtained each year by a lessor of agricultural land who is over 55 years of age or who is incapacitated. In order to qualify for this concession, the lease from which the income is derived must be for a period of not less than seven years.  The cost of the concession is not expected to be significant in the short term.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Confining Stallion Fees Exemption to Ireland</i></P>
      <P>There will be a provision in the Finance Bill to confine the tax exemption on stallion fees to income earned from stallions at stud in this country.  This change will ensure that the relief benefits the domestic Irish bloodstock industry only, as was originally intended, and not bloodstock operations outside the country.</P>
      <P>TAXATION OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The bank levy will apply again in 1985 at a level of £25 million.  I am looking at <Col N="1092" /> the possibility of making some adjustments to the basis for calculating the levy to ensure that it is operated as equitably as possible.</P>
    <P>A higher tax contribution will be required from the building societies on interest and dividends payable to their investors.  The composite rate of tax is being increased from 75 per cent to 85 per cent of the standard rate, giving a new rate of 29.75 per cent for 1985-86. This will give an extra tax yield of £4 million this year and £10 million in a full year.  Should any society feel that this increase is unwarranted, the Revenue Commissioners will undertake a survey of depositors with a view to determining what the composite rate for that society should be.  I propose to make permanent the payment date arrangements for building societies introduced in 1984.  The combination of this change and the increase in the composite rate adds £32 million to the pre-budget tax revenue estimate for 1985.</P>
    <P>SAVINGS RELIEF FOR OLDER PEOPLE</P>
    <P>I am introducing a change in the tax relief for certain deposit interest to encourage older citizens to put their savings in safekeeping.  For taxpayers who qualify for the age allowance, that is, taxpayers over 65 years of age, the present ceilings for tax relief on deposit interest are being doubled.  This new arrangement will apply in respect of interest otherwise assessable for 1985/86.</P>
    <P>COMPANY TAXATION</P>
    <P>At present, all companies are due to pay a first instalment of corporation tax six months after the end of their accounting periods.  The due date for payment of the second instalment varies as between companies from one day to almost nine months after the due date for the first instalment.  The lack of a uniform second payment date for all companies is an anomaly which is hard to defend nine years after the introduction of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1093" /> I propose to advance the second payment date so that all corporation tax will be due for payment six months after the end of an accounting period.  To lessen the impact of this change on those companies which will be most affected, I am advancing the second payment date in the first instance by only three months for accounting periods ending in the year beginning on 28 February 1985.  In no case, however, will the new second payment date be earlier than six months after the end of an accounting period.  This change will yield £10 million in 1985.  A similar advancement of the second payment date by a further three months in each instance will apply for accounting periods ending in each of the following two years.  This will mean a single due date for payment of corporation tax for all companies by 1987 at the latest.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Continuation of Partial Relief from Advance Corporation Tax</i></P>
    <P>The transitional arrangements under which advance corporation tax is payable at 50 per cent of the full rate will be extended to distributions made up to 31 December 1985.  The cost of this extension of relief will be £2.5 million this year.</P>
    <P>INCENTIVES</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Continuation of Stock Relief</i></P>
    <P>The system of stock relief introduced in the 1984 budget will be continued for a further year.  This will cost £3 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Continuation of Capital Allowances</i></P>
    <P>The 100 per cent initial allowance for plant and machinery and the 50 per cent initial and 4 per cent annual allowances for industrial buildings, which were due to expire on 31 March, will be extended to 31 March 1988.  There will be no cost in 1985.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1094" /> CAPITAL TAXATION RELIEF FOR SPOUSES</P>
    <P>I propose to exempt from capital acquisitions tax inheritances taken by one spouse from the other on or after today. It is estimated that this relief will cost about £0.5 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>STAMP DUTY EXEMPTION FOR YOUNG TRAINED FARMERS</P>
    <P>The stamp duty exemption in respect of the transfer of land to young trained farmers, which is due to expire in July 1985, will be continued for a further year.</P>
    <P Just="Center">INDIRECT TAXATION</P>
    <P>VALUE-ADDED TAX</P>
    <P>In the course of my Budget Statement last year, I indicated that I would look at the possibility of a fundamental reorganisation of the VAT system.  There is general dissatisfaction with the existing system and it is clear that we need a more rational arrangement which will give a better return in terms of efficiency and impact on the economy.</P>
    <P>The present system gives rise to problems such as a high level of duty-free imports, both legal and illegal, substantial compliance costs for businesses, administrative costs for the revenue authorities and distortion of trading patterns. The main structural causes of these problems are the very high level of some VAT rates, particularly the 35 per cent rate, the multiplicity of rates and the application of widely divergent VAT rates to related goods and services.</P>
    <P>In considering the reorganisation of the VAT system, I had the benefit of the Commission on Taxation's Report on Indirect Taxation.  The commission recommended that the general objective should be to levy VAT at a single rate on as broad a base as possible.  This would undoubtedly be the most efficient system, but the Government do not consider that a single rate is feasible at present, particularly because of the effect on food prices. They have, however, decided on a major rationalisation of VAT.</P>
    <P>From 1 March 1985, the VAT system <Col N="1095" /> will comprise three rates, zero, 10 per cent and 23 per cent, rather than the present six.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Abolition of 35 per cent Rate</i></P>
    <P>The 35 per cent rate will be abolished: items now charged at 35 per cent will instead be charged at 23 per cent.  This will reduce the tax on a wide range of household items, including for example radios, record players, tapes, soaps and detergents, toys, cutlery, pottery and glassware, bicycles and household durables, and on a wide range of industrial materials.  This will minimise the incentive for consumers to purchase these items outside the State.  It will also reduce costs for a wide range of businesses and services, including for example the cost of educational materials.  It will ease the cash-flow burden of VAT for industry, both at point of import and for domestic transactions, since many inter-industry goods have been liable at the 35 per cent rate.  I expect this rate reduction to give a substantial stimulus to output and employment across a wide range of activity.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>23 per cent Rate</i></P>
    <P>The coverage of the 23 per cent rate will remain unchanged, apart from two exceptions.</P>
    <P>
      <i>VAT on Newspaper Sales</i>
    </P>
    <P>The national plan provided for a reduction in the VAT rate on newspaper sales from 23 per cent to 18 per cent.  In line with the reorganisation now proposed, this rate will be reduced further to 10 per cent.  This will provide a substantial relief for Irish newspapers.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The 18 per cent VAT rate, which <Col N="1096" /> covers hotel accommodation and short-term car, caravan and boat hire, will be reduced to 10 per cent.  This will substantially improve the competitive position of registered businesses in these areas, with a consequent improvement in their capacity to attract new business and in their employment capacity.</P>
    <P>These VAT reductions will allow price reductions of between 7 per cent and 10½ per cent for the items involved.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Exemption of Theatres and Live Performances</i></P>
    <P>I propose to exempt from VAT theatrical and other live performances which are at present at the 5 per cent rate.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Increases</i></P>
    <P>In order to complete this reorganisation of the system and at the same time provide part of the revenue required to finance the foregoing reductions, the following increases will apply:</P>
    <P>&mdash;the 8 per cent rate on adult clothing will be increased to 10 per cent;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the 5 per cent rate will also be increased to 10 per cent, involving mainly building, fuel other than electricity, certain agricultural contracting services, and car repairs;</P>
    <P>&mdash;adult footwear, which is zero-rated at present, will be charged to VAT at 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>The flat-rate reimbursement of VAT to unregistered farmers will be increased to 2.2 per cent in order to offset the effects of VAT increases on certain farm inputs.</P>
      <P>&mdash;<i>Relief for Building</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In order to reduce the effect on the building industry of the increase in its rate <Col N="1097" /> of VAT, the Government will introduce a number of special measures.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Increased Grant for First-Time House-Buyers</i>
    </P>
    <P>The level of grant for first time owner-occupiers of new houses affected by the VAT increase is being increased by 75 per cent from £1,000 to £1,750.  An additional sum of £5 million is being added to the public capital programme for this purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Special New Incentive for Letting</i>
    </P>
    <P>A measure will be included in the Finance Bill to provide a tax incentive in respect of certain premises let for multiple residential occupation.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Concrete Blocks</i>
    </P>
    <P>The second exception which I propose in the coverage of the 23 per cent rate is a reduction of the rate of VAT on concrete blocks from 23 per cent to 10 per cent. This will improve the competitive position of registered manufacturers and reduce the scope for evasion.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Fishery Harbour Development Works</i>
    </P>
    <P>An additional sum of £0.5 million is being provided in the public capital programme for fishery harbour development works.</P>
    <P>A much greater proportion of public capital expenditure in 1985 than in recent years will benefit the building industry. The expansion in road construction, up 23 per cent or £23 million on 1984, and educational building, up 17 per cent or £14 million on 1984, will provide a boost to the industry.  In addition, the building industry will benefit from the preservation of mortgage interest relief, the new £5,000 grant for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers who give up their houses and who acquire private houses, the increased rent relief for older people, the abolition of the 35 per cent VAT rate, the income tax reform, and the general economic recovery which is being supported by this budget.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1098" />&mdash;<i>Free Fuel Schemes</i></P>
    <P>Free fuel schemes help to meet the heating needs of certain groups of people dependent on social welfare or health allowance payments.  The present value of the weekly fuel voucher is £4 and the Government propose to increase it to £5 from next October, the start of the next heating season.  The cost of this concession, which will far more than offset the increase in VAT on fuel, is £2.5 million this year and £5 million in a full year.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Motor Vehicle Parts: Reduction in Duty</i></P>
    <P>Since the reduction in VAT on motor vehicle repairs and servicing in 1983 from 23 per cent to 5 per cent was offset by an increase in excise duty on cars, it is appropriate that today's increase in VAT to 10 per cent should also be matched by a reduction in another tax.  I consider, however, that it would be more appropriate to apply the reduction to motor vehicle parts rather than cars.  This will reduce the tax differential between parts sold in the State and elsewhere.  A reduction in the duty from 25 per cent to 10 per cent is proposed.  This will be phased in over a short period, in consultation with the trade, in order to minimise the difficulties arising.</P>
    <P>The overall effect of this reorganisation and simplification of VAT will be to facilitate economic and commercial activity, and it will be of considerable help in expanding employment.  In addition, I expect a substantial and positive effect on the volume of both legal and illegal imports from Northern Ireland, to the benefit of manufacturers and traders here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is estimated that the net effect of these changes in VAT in 1985 will be a reduction in revenue of £9.2 million.  This takes account of gains from reductions in evasion, improved efficiency in the system, revenue from purchases diverted back to domestic sources and a net once-off loss of revenue payable at the point of import.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1099" /> EXCISE DUTIES</P>
    <P>Last October, following the announcement in the national plan, a substantial reduction was made in the duty on spirits. This was designed to win back to domestic outlets the significant proportion of purchases of spirits which had been diverted outside the State and the expectation was that no loss of revenue would arise.  It is too early to say whether this expectation will be realised.  The indications so far are encouraging, though the initial disruption of the market arising from the reduction, as well as the fact that the full increase in demand will take time to emerge, resulted in the 1984 revenue recipts from spirits being less than they would otherwise have been.</P>
    <P>Excise duties are an important source of revenue.  Since most of them are specific rather than <i>ad valorem</i> duties, increases are needed each year even to maintain the real level of the duties.  In order to meet budget targets, increases in some duties are necessary on this occasion.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Alcoholic Beverages</i></P>
    <P>
      <i>No Increase in Duty on Beer, Wine or Spirits</i>
    </P>
    <P>Because of the significant Exchequer cost which would be involved, I am not in a position to reduce the duty on beer or wine, as was done with spirits.  There will not, however, be any increase in the duty on these products.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Cider and Perry</i>
    </P>
    <P>There has been a very rapid growth in consumption of cider in recent years.  The duty on cider and perry is very low compared with that on other alcoholic beverages and I consider that the gap should be narrowed.  I am therefore proposing an increase, with effect from midnight tonight, of 20p per gallon in the duty, including VAT, on the ordinary-strength cider and perry, with a relatively smaller increase for middle strength cider and perry.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1100" />&mdash;<i>Hydrocarbon</i></P>
    <P>I propose an increase of 10p per gallon in the duty, including VAT, on petrol and auto-diesel, with effect from midnight tonight.  Existing rebates on petrol to handicapped drivers will be increased to match the duty increase.  The auto-diesel increase will not apply to scheduled road passenger services.  The tax on auto-LPG will be increased by a roughly similar amount through the increase in the 5 per cent VAT rate, so no excise duty increase is proposed.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Cigarettes and Tobacco</i></P>
    <P>I propose a tax increase of 10p on the packet of 20 cigarettes, with pro rata increases for cigars and other tobacco products.  This will have effect from midnight tonight.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>&ldquo;Cigarette&rdquo; Lighters</i></P>
    <P>The duty on &ldquo;cigarette&rdquo; lighters will be increased by 10p, or 13½p including VAT at 35 per cent, with effect from midnight tonight.  From 1 March 1985, when the VAT rate will be reduced from 35 per cent to 23 per cent, a further 10p excise increase will be imposed, which will broadly offset the reduction in VAT. These changes are designed to bring the tax on lighters more into line with that on matches.</P>
    <P>The total yield from these increases is estimated at £44.6 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>In the case of petrol and auto-diesel, increases in retail prices must await new maximum price orders to be made by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, who will determine the appropriate implementation date. Today's duty increase is being applied against the background of falling pump prices in recent months, so that the net impact on the motorist over the period from November to February will be relatively small.  In the case of other tax increases which apply from midnight tonight, there should be no increase in the price of goods already in the shops, as the excise duty will apply only to goods <Col N="1101" /> imported or removed from bond after tonight.</P>
    <P>I propose also to make some concessions in the excise area.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Televisions: Halving of Excise Duty</i></P>
    <P>The excise duty on televisions, combined with the 23 per cent rate of VAT, results in a big tax differential on these items between the State and Northern Ireland.  While televisions cannot legally be imported duty-free by travellers, since they would generally exceed the £55 single item limit, it is clear that large numbers are imported illegally.  The trade have been seeking a 50 per cent reduction in the excise duty, in order to reduce these illegal importations.  While I do not accept that this reduction would be selffinancing, I feel that the level of illegal imports has grown to such proportions that a reduction is needed and I propose that a 50 per cent excise duty reduction be granted from an early date.  The timing of the reduction will be decided following discussions with the trade.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Duty Refund on Oil Used by Sea-fishermen</i></P>
    <P>Sea fishermen already benefit from a refund of part of the excise duty on the oil which they use, paying only a net 5p per gallon rather than the normal 8p.  I propose to relieve them fully of this excise charge from 1 February 1985 by increasing the refund to 8p per gallon.</P>
    <P>The loss in Exchequer revenue from these reductions and from the reduction in duty on motor vehicle parts announced earlier is estimated at £3.7 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>&mdash;<i>Reduction in Betting Duties</i></P>
    <P>Betting is an area where the level of evasion is reported to be high and it can be very difficult to obtain adequate evidence to sustain court proceedings.  The 20 per cent duty on off-course betting represents an exceptionally high effective level of tax on betting, since it is applied to the amount staked, not just to the <Col N="1102" /> net amount lost by the punters to the bookmaker.  It is very difficult to know what the effect of a substantial reduction in betting duties would be.  However, I feel that there is a reasonable possibility that the cost of a significant reduction would be relatively small.  I propose to make such a reduction as an experiment to test whether this is so.  Accordingly, the excise duty on off-course betting will be reduced to 10 per cent with effect from 4 February next.  The 1½ per cent stamp duty on on-course betting will be abolished from 1 April next at an estimated cost in 1985 of £600,000.  The whole position will be reviewed before next year's budget.</P>
    <P>ROAD TAX</P>
    <P>Turning to road tax, I propose to increase the annual tax on private motor cars by 50 pence per horse power for cars of eight horse power or less, by £1 per horse power for cars between nine and 15 horse power, and by £2 per horse power for all cars of 16 horse power and over.  These changes are specifically designed to favour smaller and more economical cars.  I am also proposing that the very low rate of road tax on agricultural tractors and excavators be increased from £15 to £30 this year.  These changes will take effect from 1 March and will yield an additional £7.5 million in 1985.</P>
    <P>TAX COLLECTION</P>
    <P>Attention was drawn in the national plan to the urgent necessity to make the tax collection apparatus more efficient. Substantial improvements have been made in recent years.  In particular, wide-ranging changes were introduced in the 1983 Finance Act and these are now beginning to have an important effect. The tax clearance certificate scheme for public sector contracts, which was introduced last June, is proving very effective. Collection, however is still far from being satisfactory.</P>
    <P>One of the biggest problem areas in the tax collection process is enforcement, where there is a large accumulation of <Col N="1103" /> arrears.  I am determined that this log-jam should be removed.  I am, therefore, setting up a working group to make recommendations to Government for substantial improvements in the enforcement process.</P>
    <P>OVERVIEW OF TAX CHANGES</P>
    <P>The changes which I have proposed in our income tax and VAT systems will unquestionably improve the climate for enterprise, effort and employment. Taken together with the tax concessions in other areas which I have announced today, they show clearly the Government's resolve to minimise distortions and disincentives in our system, within the constraints imposed on us by the need to continue with the necessary adjustments to the public finances.</P>
    <P Just="Center">POST-BUDGET CURRENT REVENUE</P>
    <P>The net effect of the tax proposals which I have made will be to raise an additional £82 million this year.  This includes £33 million from the continuation of temporary tax measures, £58 million by way of increased tax revenue buoyancy arising from the measures announced today and a net reduction of £9 million from the other tax changes made.  The total tax revenue estimate, which comes to £5,704 million, shows an increase of 7½ per cent on 1984, which is broadly in line with the projected increase in nominal GNP, fully meeting the Government's commitment not to increase the overall burden of taxation. There is rather more uncertainty than usual about the tax revenue forecast, particularly in view of the major structural changes in VAT announced today.  I am, nevertheless, confident that, following the pattern of 1983 and 1984, tax revenue will again this year be quite close to target.  Total current revenue is estimated at £6,400 million.  The tax changes in today's budget will raise the consumer price index by about one quarter of a <Col N="1104" /> percentage point &mdash; the lowest, in fact, since 1978.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CAPITAL BUDGET</P>
    <P>1985 PUBLIC CAPITAL PROGRAMME</P>
    <P>As I have already mentioned, I have decided to make two changes in the 1985 Public Capital Programme, published last November.  The level of grant for first-time owner-occupiers of new houses affected by the VAT increase is being revised upwards from £1,000 to £1,750. A sum of £5 million is being provided for this purpose.  I am also, as I mentioned earlier, providing a further £0.5 million for fishery harbour development works.</P>
    <P>Taking account of these changes, the total provision for the public capital programme in 1985 comes to £1,806 million, of which £1,046 million is Exchequer-financed and £760 million is financed from other sources.  Exchequer spending on capital projects in 1985 will be up by £131 million, or over 14 per cent on the 1984 outturn.  This, as I have already mentioned, reflects the decision to allocate substantially increased resources in 1985 for road construction and for capital spending on education.  Non-Exchequer public capital programme expenditure in 1985 is lower than in 1984 due to major infrastructural programmes winding down or finishing.</P>
    <P>EXCHEQUER BORROWING REQUIREMENT FOR CAPITAL PURPOSES</P>
    <P>Allowing for the global provision of £45 million for Exchequer-financed non-Programme outlays, total Exchequer capital expenditure in 1985 will be £1,091 million.  Exchequer capital resources are estimated at £306 million, leaving a borrowing requirement for capital purposes of £785 million.</P>
    <P Just="Center">DEFICIT AND BORROWING REQUIREMENT</P>
    <P>The estimated current deficit for 1985 <Col N="1105" /> is £1,234 million, which is 7.9 per cent of GNP.  This compares with an outturn last year of £1,039 million, equivalent to 7.2 per cent of GNP as against the original budget target of 7½ per cent.  The total Exchequer borrowing requirement for the year will be £2,019 million or 13 per cent of GNP.  This compares with an outturn of 12.6 per cent for 1984, as against the original budget target of about 12¾ per cent.  The total public sector borrowing requirement for 1985 will come to £2,521 million, or 16.2 per cent of GNP, down from 16½ per cent in 1984.</P>
    <P>The target levels of the deficit and borrowing requirement are at the maximum of what it is prudent to undertake, and are closely in line with the projections underlying the national plan.</P>
    <P Just="Center">CONCLUSION</P>
    <P>Today's budget measures represent a creative and forward-looking response to our needs and problems.  The Government have put forward, within the framework set out in the national plan and within the inescapable financial constraints, a set of measures designed to produce the maximum response in terms of social justice, output and employment from the use of the resources available to us.  We will realise our objectives within that framework so as to ensure that we can continue to make progress towards the financial targets set out in the national plan.  This budget is an important step in the implementation of the policies which the Government have set out in that plan. Our detailed public expenditure policies have already been announced and are being implemented.  A whole range of <Col N="1106" /> policies needed to make the economy and the public service more efficient and productive is now in train.  The tax and expenditure measures announced today will underpin those policies and increase the prospect of their success.  This is the only path to sustained growth in employment levels.</P>
    <P>The Government have created the environment in which employment can be substantially increased.  We have shown our readiness to meet the problems created for us by recession and by past mismanagement.  We are confident that we will get a positive response and that the benefits will be felt by those &mdash; and they are many &mdash; who want to contribute and who want to work.</P>
    <P>To sum up, this budget fully honours the Government's commitment to the less well off in our society.  It reforms and simplifies the income tax system, with benefit to all taxpayers.</P>

      <P>It reforms our value-added system, with advantages to manufacturers and traders in terms of the effect on their cash flow and the simplicity of the system.  It improves our cross-Border competitive capacity.  It produces a major boost for tourism, for newspapers, for goods that are now at 35 per cent and for industry in general.  Not only does it underpin financially the range of measures introduced to promote and expand employment but, as a result of this tax reform, it gives them an extra impetus; and, Sir, it achieves all of this within the financial framework set out in the national plan.</P>

    <P>(1) Prior to 1983, debt service costs paid from the supply services were included under this heading.  As part of the revised functional classification of expenditure, these costs (e.g. Exchequer subsidy on service costs of loans for local authority housing) are now included under the appropriate functional categories.  The total debt service cost in the Central Fund and Supply Services in 1984 was £1903 million of which £1746 million related to interest and £157 million to sinking funds.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I now call on Deputy O'Kennedy, spokesman for the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister chose to address, just before summing up, those, as he says &ldquo;who want to contribute and who want to work.&rdquo;  I do not know if there is an implication in that phrase &ldquo;who want to work&rdquo; that so many of our people who are unemployed do not want to work.  The reality is, for a Government who claim to face reality, to build on reality, that there are now 225,000 of those going on the live register alone &mdash; 55,000 more than when the Minister first took over responsibility &mdash; who want to contribute, who want to work, who want the dignity of contributing not just for themselves and their families but also to see an end to the day when they are seen as being dependants or parasites, if you like, on the rest who have the opportunity to work.  For that reason no Minister for Finance in the history of this State has ever presented a budget on which so much depends.  There were the unprecedented number of pre-budget submissions and publications from every section of our community, economic, social and voluntary groups, testifying to the sense of urgency, expectation and, we might as well acknowledge, crisis which is rampant throughout the country at present.</P>
      <P>If we are to see today's budget as an instalment towards realising what this Government set out in their document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> it should be noted that they asserted only a few months ago that they were going to build an economy and a society that provides justice and security for all its people by recognising the realities of our present situation and by confronting those realities head on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister had no easy task drawing up this budget in view of the Government's actions and the consequences of those actions in the last two years.  The reality he had to confront today &mdash; on any range one cares to look at and by any criteria one cares to apply &mdash; is very much more intimidating than that which he faced on assuming office <Col N="1132" /> two years ago.  We should endeavour to look at those and ascertain to what extent today's adjustments &mdash; because that is all they are &mdash; will make any impact on this reality.</P>
    <P>There is, first of all, the reality of unemployment.  Can anybody in this House, from any of those benches &mdash; because if they can I shall be thrilled, as will be 225,000 unemployed and the many young people out there listening would be even better pleased &mdash; point to anything in this budget that will stimulate opportunity for employment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any one thing in the whole of this budget that will create one extra job, that will provide the incentive to do anything that has not already been done?</P>
      <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is there any one reference, apart from a very pallid, passing reference by the Minister, that it is in line with the promotion of a climate for employment?  Is there any single thing that any one of us on any side of the House can point to?  That is the reality the Government said they would confront. That is the reality that the Government have again chosen to ignore, not for the first time, not even for the second because, two years ago, they said they were going to take immediate and urgent action to reduce the level of unemployment and we watched a reduction turn into an increase of the order of 55,000. And we are asked to accept that we are making progress towards realising those aims.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In any event, thousands of our young people who have been waiting have already despaired.  The unemployed were awaiting some news today, some recognition, but many of the young have already despaired and have left for better hope elsewhere.  For those who remain &mdash; and this is another reality we must begin to look at &mdash; the burden of taxation since this Minister assumed office has <Col N="1133" /> increased from £4 billion two years ago to, before today, £5.3 billion, an increase of over 35 per cent in total taxation, representing an increase of approximately 3 per cent or 4 per cent in terms of GNP.  In the meantime we have watched 2,000 of our limited liability companies over the last couple of years go out of business because of the impact of the recession and crushing burden of taxation. We have watched many small businesses, family businesses, close, workers having been affected more than anybody else, suppliers and customers.  Now we are being told that the burden of taxation is being lifted at last.  I shall return to this aspect in some more detail.</P>
    <P>The reality is &mdash; as distinct from the reality the Minister is trying to present &mdash; that, far from being lifted, even those he claims to help today in terms of income tax adjustments will find by the end of this year they will be worse off in net terms in take home pay than they were at the beginning of this year before he introduced his budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to turn now to the standards the Government set for themselves, the things about which they boasted, the fiscal aggregates they were going to correct, the responsibility that <Col N="1134" /> was going to be introduced into the whole of our budget programme.  If we look at the budget deficit we see that in 1982, when the Minister took office, it was £988 million and after today it will be increased to £1,234 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If they will allow me to make my contribution, as we allowed the Minister to make his, then we will let the public judge.  On the basis of the rectitude this Government were going to follow we were told particularly that the budget deficit in the first instance would be phased out over a four year period. Now we find that phasing out means increasing, just as reducing unemployment means increasing unemployment, just as reducing the level of taxes means increasing the level of taxation.  Whether one judges it in money terms or a percentage of GNP &mdash; so beloved of this Government &mdash; the reality is that, after today's budget, and the Minister has acknowledged it here, the current budget deficit at the end will be £1,234 million or 7.9 per cent of GNP, an increase of 2 per cent of GNP over last year and up £200 million over last year.  It is time then that the Government dropped this whole presentation of concern, discipline, control in bringing about a reduction in our budget deficit and consequently also in our Exchequer borrowing requirement which, if it is to be reduced as the Government promised in this budget, will rise from 12.6 per cent of GNP to 13 per cent <Col N="1135" /> of GNP at approximately £2.02 billion.</P>
      <P>Might I ask Deputy Molony who already has signalled that he does not intend to remain much longer in this House to allow me make my contribution?</P>
      <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is contradicting everything he said over the last 12 months.</P>
      <P>(<i>Interruptions.</i>)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The public sector borrowing requirement has gone up to £2,520 million, or 16.2 per cent of GNP. It may be all right for us here and for the Minister in particular in his stainless steel tube to speak in terms of GNP.  I am speaking in those terms because the Minister and the Government have chosen to adopt them as being their direction in terms of Exchequer borrowing requirement, current budget deficits, and so on.  For the public out there who have to live with the realities and have to face the brunt of the tax imposed by this Government over the past couple of years, and the increase in this budget, it will be more difficult, and not less difficult as a consequence of this budget, to have any reasonable income to provide for their needs.  For those who are looking for employment it will be more of a vain hope than it was at the beginning of the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year our total national debt rose to a figure of £18.5 billion.  When this Minister took office it was £12.5 billion, an increase of £6 billion, £6,000 million in two years since this Minister took office.  We are being told that what is being taken from the PAYE taxpayer is needed to service that debt.  Of course it is, when we see the debt spiralling under a Government who claimed they would reduce it.  As a consequence, over £350 million of the extra taxes the Minister will collect this year will not go towards a regeneration in our economy.  They will go a small bit of the way to cope with the <Col N="1136" /> huge increase in our debt, and particularly our foreign debt in the two years since this Minister took office.</P>
    <P>We see a growth in public expenditure which is far in excess of any level of growth in the economy.  We see a major collapse in investment in our economy. When it comes to their turn I ask Government backbenchers to point to any one item that will give any signal, any encouragement, any hope to those who wish to invest at home rather than hiding their money abroad or getting it into a tax climate which is more favourable than ours.  The old, the unemployed, those who want to work and those who want to invest look to us, and particularly to the Minister, for something in this budget which should have been the most important budget ever introduced in this State. The Minister has not responded to them. It is no wonder that there is a degree of cynicism and perhaps hostility towards all of us who are involved in the political process.  No wonder there is despair among the young.</P>
    <P>We can now come back to what the Taoiseach said.  Perhaps we should not have expected too much today.  A couple of months ago the Taoiseach told us that budgets will become less important. Today his Minister has underlined just how unimportant they have become. Total public expenditure under this Government in the current and capital programme is of the order of £9,000 billion under a Government who were to control public expenditure.  Even if we are making adjustments here today of the order of hundreds of millions of pounds, and even if those adjustments are not significant in the context of total expenditure under this Government we could have expected some psychological boost, some signal to the people at whatever level, that the Government have recognised the reality and would find a way to enhance the role of every citizen, and to protect those who need protection in these difficult times.  We got no such boost.</P>
    <P>I want to look at exactly what we have had today.  Our total taxation is £5,704 million.  That is a huge increase in the <Col N="1137" /> total tax since the Commission on Taxation were set up a little over four years ago by us in Government when I was Minister for Finance.  It was then £2,619 million and it has now jumped to £5,704 million.  By any standards the biggest single issue confronting us is to create a new environment for work, for activity and for a renewal of the economy.  The Minister confined himself to mere tinkering and adjustments of margins.</P>
    <P>Let me welcome the fact that at least we are seeing an adjustment in the income tax bands.  We appealed for this last year.  We called for it so many times in the past 12 months if for no other reason than that it is clearly obvious that the system is creaking under the weight of all the various bands and adjustments the Minister introduced in the past couple of years.  Let me also welcome the fact that instead of the six different VAT rates which have obstructed business people who were trying to carry on and meet their obligations in their returns to the Revenue, we will now have three rates. That is welcome.  I wonder why the Minister did not have the courage to go further having regard to the leakage across the Border and the loss of revenue in the areas of beer and petrol, not to mention television.  The Minister guaranteed today that not only will he not stop that trend, but that it will continue.  I hope it will not be aggravated beyond the point we have already seen.  I do not want anything I say here to be in any way a signal for an increase in the awful haemorrhage from our business and our economy.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that having regard to his adjustments in income taxation all taxpayers will benefit.  I cannot understand how the Minister could be so bold as to make that assertion.  A major element and particularly the poorer taxpayer at the lower end of the bands will be hurt significantly.  We will be giving detailed figures in the course of this debate at a later stage.  It is clear that, because of the minimal adjustments at the lower levels of the bands, those on lower incomes, far from benefiting, will <Col N="1138" /> suffer considerably as a consequence of this.  They will also be paying 10 per cent on footwear and 10 per cent on clothing. The people we claim to be concerned about and the unemployed who will not get the benefit of tax allowances will pay the price for this unfeeling budget.  There is no point in ignoring that reality.</P>
    <P>If we were to have an adjustment in income tax in line with inflation at 6 per cent that would have required a tax allowance of the order of £100 million in this budget.  What is provided in this budget is an adjustment of £58 million gross. This will be reduced after the impact of indirect taxation on those who get the benefit of that slight adjustment.  They are mostly in the higher bands.  In net terms, this will mean a cost to the Exchequer of the order of £35 million.</P>
    <P>That is as far as the Government have been prepared to go to deal with levels of taxation, which are about the highest in the EC, but the Minister today tried to convey the notion that by introducing new tax bands and getting rid of the 65 per cent band, which has been brought down to 60 per cent &mdash; we described it last year as a penal disincentive to those who might otherwise contribute to the benefit of our economy &mdash; PAYE people will be better off.  He omitted to say that many of those who were in the 35 per cent and 45 per cent bands will hereafter be in the 60 per cent bracket.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 48 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Others who up to this were in lower bands will be caught in the middle bands.  We have minimal relief for those with higher incomes at a time when we know that our level of taxation, particularly in the higher bands, is very much in excess of any other state in the EC.  If we are to make adjustments surely they should benefit those who are penalised and crippled in the lower income groups. Since the Minister came to office the yield from income tax has increased to more than £2 billion from £1.4 billion a few years ago.  Yet the Minister claims to be giving benefits to taxpayers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1139" /> Those listening inside and outside the House today will have heard of the top band being abolished and adjustments made in the middle bands, and will welcome it.  My advice is that they should be very cautious in their welcome because when indirect taxation seeps through to take home pay packets it will be seen that we have not even kept pace with inflation.</P>
    <P>I will turn to indirect taxation.  It is fairly clear that the levels of indirect taxation, which are the highest in the EC, have had a major crippling effect on trade and consumption and on other sectors of the economy since the Minister introduced them in 1983.  I would like to have seen the Minister take the opportunity to visit the Border towns and see the impact there.  Even on a short visit he would have seen the state of Border towns and the flow of our shoppers to Newry and other towns on the North side of the Border.</P>
    <P>The adjustment made, for instance, in relation to television sets will not have the consequence he would claim for them.  We all recognise that the attraction luring people across the Border is the differential in the price of petrol.  In petrol we have seen a fall-off in consumption and consequently in excise yield.  In 1982 the excise yield from petrol was £245 million, in 1983 it was £275 million and last year the yield increased marginally to £281 million.  This, in real terms, means a huge reduction in excise yield from petrol.  The obvious reasons are the levels of excise duty and VAT imposed on these products.  Before today there was a differential of 65p, Irish equivalent, in the price of a gallon of petrol.  After today the differential will be 75p.  It will mean there will be increased traffic across the Border, particularly of people living near the Border, because it will be worth their while to travel across.</P>
    <P>This budget, I regret to say, has the effect of aggravating the problems of those in Border regions.  The Minister must be concerned, as all of us have been, about the growth in smuggling and the black economy and the impossibility for <Col N="1140" /> excise and revenue officers to cope with the growth.  The Minister must be concerned about the breakdown effect this has in the social and economic order and the loss of about 6,000 jobs in the drink, car and electrical industries.  Nevertheless, the only adjustment the Minister has made today to cope with that problem is a reduction of 50 per cent in the excise duty on TVs.</P>
    <P>Already there is a differential of £400 in the price of a 26-inch colour set here and in the North and £360 for a 22 inch colour set.  Does the Minister seriously believe that an adjustment in the excise duty of the level he has given will have any effect on the haemorrhage of Border traffic and smuggling, in the past 12 months in particular?</P>
    <P>It would not have required any great intelligence on the part of the Minister to realise that the levels of duty and VAT have been responsible for reducing revenue yields.  Ironically, we are actually getting a lower yield in revenue because of the higher levels of excise duty and VAT being imposed.  The Minister should have seen those figures in the past two years and taken the necessary steps to ensure higher yields of revenue and more protection of employment.  Had he done that, normal trade throughout the country, particularly in Border regions, would not continue to be undermined.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Minister is a hero in Newry, and no one here begrudges anything to Newry &mdash; perhaps he is also a hero in Whitehall because of the benefits from this to the British Treasury &mdash; but in Dundalk and other Border towns, he is a bandit because people have been savaged by the levels of taxation imposed in recent budgets.</P>
    <P>I will refer to the impact of the budget on taxation generally.  There has been a deduction of 25 per cent in real terms in take home pay since four years ago.  This is the biggest single issue to be tackled if we are to give a signal to encourage employment, investment and incentive. The National Economic and Social Council demanded that the Minister give a clear signal in response to the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation. <Col N="1141" /> I have to say that the reduction in the number of bands is a move in the right direction but, equally, I must say that the levels of taxation still obtaining either in VAT or income tax are such as to ensure that the problems under which we have laboured in recent years will be massively increased in the next 12 months.  The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners indicated recently that our system is not capable of coping with the burden of taxation imposed on us.  Clearly, that burden has been increased and I cannot imagine how the Minister can hope to make any meaningful impact by the adjustments he has made today.  A £50 million reduction in income tax and an increase of the order of £50 million or £60 million in indirect taxes is not the way to move.</P>
    <P>If the adjustments on the indirect tax side which we have asked for for so long had been measured on a selective basis, as happened in the case of spirits when the Minister eventually and reluctantly agreed, the Minister would have seen that the amount mentioned in the case of beer, petrol and electrical goods would have resulted in a major increase in revenue which in turn would have given scope for adjustments in the income tax bands.</P>
    <P>I should now like to turn to an issue which faces us all and which the Government in their policy document two years ago, in <i>Building on Reality</i> some months ago and today, describe as the priority needing to be tackled if we are to get a renewal in our economy, the problem of unemployment.  What is the response to that priority?  We are all aware of the disincentive effect of PRSI contributions on employers and employees.  It is one of the major problems in terms of generating employment.  Has there been even a gesture in the budget towards lifting the level of PRSI burdens on employer or employee?  Is there a proposal to move in that direction so that new jobs created will be liable for a graduated reduction of PRSI?  The Minister cannot make any distinction between the need to promote new jobs and the reductions that should be given in terms of PRSI contributions and jobs that are in existence.  The reality <Col N="1142" /> is that we cannot wait until tomorrow. For the young people, those going on the register daily, we need a signal but we did not get one today.</P>
    <P>A scheme announced by the Minister last year was meant to be a signal to industry and those likely to invest &mdash; the tax allowance on equity participation &mdash; but it has not been referred to by the Minister today.  Frankly, I believe the Minister was ashamed to make any reference to it.  In introducing the scheme last year the Minister said he wanted to encourage people to invest by equity participation in manufacturing industries. We pointed out then that the scheme was too complex and was surrounded by all types of restrictions and regulations.  We said that at the end of the day it would not have the effect of encouraging any significant investment of money in our industrial development programme.  The Minister has deliberately avoided making a reference to that scheme because the reality is that not even five or six schemes have been launched under the programme.  We had been led to believe that the scheme might be extended to the service sector and areas other than the manufacturing sector but the Minister has passed it by silently. Obviously, he has acknowledged his failure by that silence.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Clearly, it is not there.  The Minister may wait until tomorrow, next week or next year but he must be aware that our young people who are waiting for a signal for work at home cannot wait that long.  Business people <Col N="1143" /> anxious to invest cannot wait until tomorrow. Those who are putting their money in safe havens, are exporting their money, will not wait until tomorrow.  Any opportunity to invest in renewal of our economy has been ignored in the budget although the Minister told us that one of his priorities remains the generation of employment.</P>
      <P>We are all slow to acknowledge mistakes but the Minister for Finance finds it impossible to acknowledge mistakes.  He will assert something as a fact in the face of the truth.  If there has been a mistake in the area of tax it has to be the introduction of the income related property tax.  The Tánaiste is present and he may say that this tax proves that the Labour Party are still alive in Government. It is about the only thing that proves that because apparently this was their price for participation in Government. The reality is that the tax last year yielded £1 million gross.  In fact, in net terms it may have cost the Exchequer money when one takes all the administration costs into account.  One must also take into account the cost to the private sector of filling up the various forms.</P>
      <P>Why is it that the Minister did not make the obvious decision and get rid of this nonsense tax that does not fulfil the first requirement of any tax, to yield revenue? Had he done so the public &mdash; not just the well-off &mdash; would have got a clear signal that from now on they were free again to sell their house, buy a house or improve their house.  It would have been a clear signal to the building industry that the private sector housing area, an essential element in the building industry programme, was being encouraged by the Government.  The abolition of that tax could not have resulted in less than £20 million to the Revenue in terms of the enhanced activity in the building sector, stamp duty and transfers of one form or another.</P>

      <P>The admission, which I take the Minister's silence to be, of the failure of nonsense taxes like these is clear.  It also has the consequence of creating unnecessary divisions and tensions between those who seek to have and those who clearly do not.  The reality is that if the Tánaiste wants to make a contribution to regenerating some degree of economic activity and providing employment, in this instance in the building industry, and adding to revenue yield, he should signal to his colleagues sitting beside him that his ideological insistence on this nonsense tax is no longer worth stating and that he is prepared to face reality, as the Government claim they are.</P>
      <P>There is another area where the Government, and the Taoiseach particularly, made very strong assertions.  This Government always claimed that they would be consistent and that they would adhere to what they said; but when they said they would adhere to the current budget deficit they meant the opposite. They said they would reduce unemployment, but they did the opposite.  They said they would reduce the level of taxation, but they did the opposite; and the latest is the public sector pay.  Two or three months ago the Taoiseach emphatically stated that the Government would not provide anything above what had already been provided in the Estimates. He said they were determined to adhere to a 1 per cent increase for the public sector.  When he makes such a strong assertion does the Taoiseach not realise that he is undermining his authority which, as leader of this nation, he is obliged to uphold?  Does he not realise that by retreating from these statements without any explanation he is undermining his authority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The actions of the Government over the past two days in calling in the public sector unions for discussions on the terms of the public sector pay award and then telling the unions to go because they had nothing to offer them is extraordinary when one considers what was announced here today.  Are the Government trying <Col N="1145" /> to demonstrate to the public sector unions that, while they are now conceding the implementation of the arbitrator's award, they were not prepared to admit earlier that what the unions were looking for was reasonable?  Could the Taoiseach explain why the Government showed such a determined negative front to the unions two days ago but today, in one casual phrase, the Minister said he will make provision for this increase in the budget?  The Minister has not made provision for this increase in the budget.  The reality is that he has been forced to go way beyond any of the statements the Government made in terms of the current budget deficit, far in excess of what anybody expected.</P>

      <P>May I speak now about those who have a first claim on us?  There is a view abroad that in recent times we have all become selfish, that we expect too much, that we are a little unreasonable and that we will not face reality.  But if there is one group who are entitled to expect, and demand, more, it must be the old, the sick and those in receipt of long term social welfare benefits.  We acknowledge that inflation will be at least 6 per cent next year, but what is in this budget for those people?  An adjustment of less than 6 per cent from July.</P>

      <P>Now that the figures are coming through from the current budget revenue for 1984, let me place on the record figures we did not have earlier. Income tax in 1985 will increase by £164.7 million.  Those are included in the tables which were not made available to us before I stood up to speak.  Those who might have believed the Minister when he made his assertion that all this will mean relief for every taxpayer can now see that the relief will come in the form of an extra £165 million.  Those who thought that there would be relief on value-added tax in view of the adjustment see now that it will come in the form of an extra £122 million to the Revenue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister claimed that he would tackle the issues of unemployment and taxation but he is now tackling them in the way the Government always have &mdash; by increasing the revenue by imposing an extra burden, ensuring that the depressed state of the economy and our citizens will unfortunately continue next year and that <Col N="1149" /> we will be in an even more depressed state than last year.  Everybody waited for a signal from this budget; the young waited for some opportunity for employment; the unemployed waited to see what would be indicated as a signal that their dignity would be at last respected; the old waited to see how they would be protected against the increased cost of living which is always a major concern to the old and the sick.  The Minister did not hear or respond.  Either the Minister has a lack of awareness &mdash; I doubt that such is the case &mdash; or a lack of concern, capacity or direction.  It is time he recognised that we need broad, clear outlines which will indicate to the employed that the investment climate will improve. Those who believe in this country should be encouraged in their commitment and the problems of those who care for families and old people should be catered for.  It is quite significant that there is no increase in children's allowances.  I am quite prepared to give way to the Minister if I am wrong in this regard.  Is the Minister going to insist that we have had an increase in children's allowances year after year?  Are our taxpayers going to be better off in the future?  If I have overlooked or omitted anything I should be greatful if the Minister would point it out.</P>

      <P>There is no increase in income tax allowances in real terms or no provision for the old and the sick. There is no sign to the people that the Government believe in them.  It is clear also that the Government do not believe in themselves, but a signal of belief and confidence in the people would have been very welcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If a new direction had been given we would all, regardless of party affiliations, <Col N="1150" /> have rowed in behind the Minister.  However, we got the same old thing of adjustments in tax bands here and there but dressed up in slightly borrowed clothes. In the final analysis, those borrowed clothes cannot conceal the fact that we will all be worse off as a result of this budget.  It is not just a question either of how much better off we will be financially. Unfortunately, we will be poorer not just in money terms but in terms of morale, respect and our confidence as a nation.  If the Minister does not have respect for those essential characteristics of our people, it is time he reconsidered his responsibilities.  Everyone has been waiting for a signal from the Minister but he has turned his back on them.  There is an even more depressing year ahead than we have faced in the last two disastrous years since the Government came to office.</P>

      <P>God be with the days when a budget was a budget.  The Minister for Finance would open up his bag, let us hear the good news and the bad news and that would be the end of it for another year.  We can no longer say that because mini budgets are now introduced and, in the past year, we had budgets every second week.  The worst news was announced last August weekend when food subsidies were abolished.  We do not know, therefore, what will happen in the coming year in regard to other little items.  Will the other half be abolished next August?</P>
      <P>I appreciate that VAT was removed on theatre and live performances and reduced on newspapers.  Changes in the tax bands and VAT will simplify the code which is a welcome development.  I specially welcome the increase in the age allowance for the old age pension.  They had only been increased once in seven years and that was by about £20.  The figure of £200 is long overdue and I am glad it has been allowed although it should be a much higher figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want to go into detail on the budget which has been teased out by Deputy O'Kennedy in regard to its effects, etc.  There is no alteration in the <Col N="1151" /> burden of taxation.  I do not wish to go into detail regarding the effect of VAT and tax allowances.  However, it is clear that the Minister has rejected the whole idea of tax reform.  The Commission on Taxation was the only thing achieved by the thousands of PAYE marchers who looked for changes in the tax burden.  The commission have now issued a number of reports but they have been dismissed in a few lines in <i>Building on Reality</i>.  This means that the Government have decided that the tax march days are over, that the Government can forget the Commission on Taxation and continue to screw the PAYE workers.  The budget indicates that that is still their attitude. There is no indication of any new taxes being imposed on anybody.  Deputy O'Kennedy in his criticism of the budget did not indicate one area of new taxation where further revenues could be gained by the Exchequer.  Unless there is a move towards tax reform, there is no point in introducing budgets of this nature.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has more or less admitted that is the attitude of Fianna Fáil as well.  In regard to that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions has said that they will not allow dissatisfaction with the heavy burden of taxation being borne by workers to be used as an excuse for cuts in essential public spending and that they will resist the attempt by diverse elements to whip up anti-tax and an anti-public expenditure hysteria among the electorate.  That is what has been built up over the past year in particular by this Government and by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>The Workers' Party say there is no room for further taxation on workers but there is plenty of room for more taxation on other areas and sectors which have been untouched in the budget except in so far as further relief has been given to them.  To indicate what I mean, income tax in 1965 took in a total of 16.7 per cent of total tax revenue but in 1984 it brought in 34.5 per cent of total tax revenue.  Of that, PAYE workers paid 86 per cent, the self-employed paid 12 per cent and farmers who constitute 20 per cent of the population paid 1.8 per cent.  In 1965 tax <Col N="1152" /> on company profits brought in 9 per cent of tax revenue.  In 1984 this was down to 3.9 per cent, just two fifths of what it was in 1965.  Property tax in 1965 brought in 15.1 per cent of revenue whereas in 1984 it only brought in 3.3 per cent.  Capital taxes in 1974 amounted to 11.4 per cent of revenue and in 1984 only 4 per cent of revenue.  In all cases the tax on personal income has doubled while in all other areas the tax dropped dramatically.</P>
    <P>A good example appeared in the newspapers the other day when the Guinness profits were disclosed.  The profits of the Guinness group in Britain were taxed at a rate of 45 per cent whereas in Ireland they were taxed at a rate of 5.6 per cent. Jefferson Smurfit disclosed the other day that of their $45 million profit they paid $21 million in tax, in other words 46 per cent of their profit was paid in tax in the US.  That is Reagan country and in Britain it is Thatcher country but here they only pay 5.6 per cent of their profits in tax.  Tara Mines have never paid one penny in tax or royalties since 1978.  This is the area where we say higher taxes should be imposed to help reduce the budget deficit, the level of borrowing and to stop the cuts in services which are being continued by this Government.  I have not heard Fianna Fáil say they would agree with an increase in tax on capital, property or corporation profits.</P>
    <P>A list of the significant events which have occurred over the last three years in this area is worth noting.  In 1974 estate duties were abolished.  Wealth tax was introduced but it was abolished in 1978. Capital gains tax was introduced in 1974 but it was reduced by Fianna Fáil in 1978. Capital acquisitions tax was introduced in 1974 and reduced by Fianna Fáil in 1978.  VAT refunds to unregistered farmers were abolished in 1976 but reintroduced in 1978.  In this budget it has been increased from 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent. Rates on houses were abolished, car tax was abolished in 1977 and reintroduced in 1981.  The 2 per cent farm levy introduced in 1979 did not last for a year.  It was abolished in 1979 also.  The resource tax on farmers was introduced in 1980 but abolished in 1981.  The tax was <Col N="1153" /> refunded to those who had paid it.  Rates on agricultural land were abolished in 1982 but were replaced by water charges and charges for other local services.</P>
    <P>As regards VAT refunds to unregistered farmers only 700 farmers are registered. In effect VAT refunds to unregistered farmers means refunds to all farmers.  They are refunded a notional figure of 2 per cent VAT because they are unregistered.  The Exchequer paid out £6.8 million on this in 1979.  In 1981 they paid out £22 million.  By 1982 it has almost doubled to £41.5 million and in 1983 they paid out £53.70 million.  I am sure there must be a fiddle in that somewhere. A number of farm inputs including fertilisers are zero-rated; yet the Government have increased the VAT refund to 2.2 per cent.  Why not ask all farmers to register for VAT in the same way as all shopkeepers must register?</P>
    <P>I do not like going on too much about farmers because Joe Rea might get apoplexy. I would refer him to what the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Séamus Parker, said.  He said farmers owed the largest amount of income tax among the self-employed.  He also said if farmers, traders and professional people decide not to pay tax, not to co-operate and not to participate in the body politic they could avoid tax and it would take years to go after them.  The Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners accused them of refusing to participate in the body politic and I agree with that.  During the American Revolution there was a slogan which stated: &ldquo;No taxation without representation&rdquo;.  That could be reversed now to no representation without taxation.  How can they continue to expect services in education, health, the services of ACOT and so on and how can they expect to get £350 million from the Exchequer when only £30 million is paid in by them?</P>
    <P>Joe Rea accuses us of being anti-farmer but he with the attitude he represents is irresponsible and against the national interest and, therefore, against the interest of farmers.  This is something farmers must face up to.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1154" /> The situation with regard to unemployment was bad a year or 18 months ago but then people expected it would end.  I remember all the talk about the unemployed getting more than those who were at work.  They were getting unemployment benefit, pay-related payments and so on but now two years later these people are on unemployment assistance. I understand more than 70 per cent of the unemployed are on assistance and that their families account for 150,000 children.</P>
    <P>On assistance means that prior to this budget a family of four got £73.90 per week.  They probably have had enough to eat but how can such a family live any kind of life on that amount?  This budget will give them an increase of £4.80 but, at the same time, it will put increased VAT on clothes from 8 per cent to 10 per cent and it will put VAT on shoes and on fuel.  Yesterday the price of coal was increased and there will be a further increase because of this budget.  Half of the food subsidies have gone and probably the rest will go next August.  Certainly they will be gone this time next year.  How can a family who are on assistance survive on that kind of money?</P>
    <P>Does the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance know that a single man, aged 36, the eldest of his family, who is living at home with his parents will get assistance of £12.80?  This is a man who has worked for 14 years.  This is quite common in Dublin.  I understand it is not so common outside of Dublin and I cannot understand the reason.  I can cite immediately two people in my constituency who have to exist on this kind of assistance. Another man aged 30 is only getting £9 assistance money because he is living at home.  This is a humiliation and degradation. It is a deliberate insult to people who have worked and have paid their taxes.  They have not avoided paying their taxes.  This budget will not help them.</P>
    <P>The public sector is under tremendous attack by this Government.  I hear Deputy Kelly regularly on the radio uttering the same tirade against public sector companies, calling them white elephants and so on.  The Tony O'Reilly papers, <Col N="1155" /> the <i>Independent</i> newspapers, also project this view.  They call for privatisation and they demand that we should hive off companies to the private sector £100 million worth of equity each year.  The leading article in the <i>Irish Independent</i> of 13 January stated that relatively successful State-sponsored enterprises should put £100 million on the stock exchange and allow private enterprise to share in the bonanza.</P>
    <P>Let us have a brief look at what is called the burden on the taxpayers of the public sector companies, the white elephants as they are called.  It may be of interest to know that not one of these companies got one penny from the Exchequer in 1984.  B &amp; I and Irish Shipping were liquidated but they did not get one penny from the Exchequer.  Aer Lingus, Irish Steel, NET, ESB, Bord na Móna, An Bord Gáis, RTE, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann, Bord Telecom and so on are the white elephants.  CIE got a subsidy for running a social service &mdash; they got £112 million &mdash; but the others did not get one penny of the taxpayers' money in 1984 and I doubt if they will get anything in 1985.  Bord na Móna got £1 million but that was to hand out to private bog developers.</P>
    <P>A sum of £490 million was given to State-sponsored companies which I list. Bord Iascaigh Mhara got £7 million to help private enterprise, namely, the fishermen.  Údarás na Gaeltachta got £6 million to hand out to the private sector in the Gaeltacht area.  ACOT got £18 million for the farming community.  The Youth Employment Agency got £84 million, most of which went on employment incentive schemes for the private sector. Bord Fáilte got £22 million to hand out in grants and aids to hotels and guesthouses. I suppose P.V. Doyle and his friends shared in that £22 million.  An Foras Talúntais got £16 million, again for the agricultural community.  Córas Tráchtála got £18 million.  This was because the great private sector have no marketing ability whatever and, therefore, the taxpayers had to pay the money to Córas Tráchtála to do the marketing <Col N="1156" /> for the private sector.  That is what it is all about.  Fóir Teoranta got £19 million of the taxpayers' money to bail out firms in trouble.  The IDA got £123 million for grants to the private sector.  That is where the taxpayers' money goes.  It goes to the private sector in aid and grants.</P>
    <P>The private sector sent nothing back to the Exchequer except the normal taxes, PRSI and so on that the public sector pays.  Public sector companies gave back to the Exchequer £85 million.  When one adds £132 million from the Central Bank and the £23 million the Exchequer took by way of levy on the ESB it makes a sum of £240 million which was paid to the Exchequer from public sector companies in 1984.  Let us hear no more about the white elephants and the cost to the taxpayers and to the Exchequer.  Let us look at what the Minister, Deputy Bruton, is doing.  He said that State agencies are currently selecting 50 Irish companies whom they will assist in specific development programmes this year. They must be aided by State agencies.</P>
    <P>We hear a lot about the entrepreneurs, about private enterprise and so on, but where are these entrepreneurs? I do not see them around.  In reply to the budget last year I spoke about competitiveness. An excellent document was produced entitled &ldquo;Economic background to the Budget&rdquo; and from that I pointed out that as a consequence of an increase in productivity unit wage costs in Ireland fell by 1 per cent in 1983 as compared with an increase of 3½ per cent in our main trading partners.  This year the Government have produced the same type of document but I had great difficulty in finding data on competitiveness. Although every other paragraph has a heading such as &ldquo;income development&rdquo;, &ldquo;inflation&rdquo;, &ldquo;monetary development&rdquo;, &ldquo;expenditure&rdquo;, etc., the piece about competitiveness has none.  I had to search for it.  I had to read most of the document before I found it.  Again this year we see in terms of unit wage costs a relative improvement recorded in Irish manufacturing industry.  It says: &ldquo;In national currency terms Irish unit wage costs fell <Col N="1157" /> slightly in 1984 as against an increase of 2.5 per cent in our main trading partners&rdquo;. And we are told continuously that we are not competitive, we must lower our wages, we cannot have increases in either the public or private sectors because we are not competitive.  According to the figures here before us we are far more competitive than our main trading partners, so what is wrong?  We are far more competitive in productivity and unit wage costs.  Why can we not compete then?  Obviously the problem is in management. Despite the fact that Mr. Ivor Kenny has been running the IMI for a number of years and his great interest in management, he has not been able to develop managerial skills to compare with those of our trading partners.</P>
    <P>Another area is marketing.  We are unable to market the goods.  Although our workers have increased their productivity and are competitive in wage unit costs the companies are not competitive in management, marketing or any other way.  Where are the entrepreneurs?  As far as I can see, it is just people looking for a fast buck.  The public sector workers are being made the whipping boys for this.  They are being penalised for the greed and incompetence of the private sector.  They are being told that they must take less pay than those in the private sector.  I do not go along with that argument. Public sector workers are entitled to the same rates as comparable workers in the private sector, and that must be maintained.  It is shown that there are ample ways in which the Government can raise the revenues if they have only the guts to raise those revenues.  Therefore, public sector workers should not be made to pay for either the mistakes of Government or the greed of the private sector.</P>
    <P>Deputy John Kelly seemed to project the impression that there are no entrepreneurs in the public sector and that all in the private sector are persons of great enterprise.  This is also a favourite theme of John Healy, the great verbaliser of all time who refers to all other people as verbalisers.  He says that we must have four private sector workers to pay for every one public sector worker.  That is <Col N="1158" /> complete nonsense.  They are not doing it.  I suppose we have the biggest colony in Spain at the moment of private entrepreneurs who ripped off workers and the Government here, who bought their villas in Spain and are living on what they made here.</P>
    <P>There are plenty of innovators and people of enterprise in the public sector but when they show enterprise they are knocked over the head, they are not allowed to innovate or show vision or enterprise.  The classic case is Michael J. Costello who was in charge of the Irish Sugar Company.  Here was a man of dynamism and vision.  He grabbed hold of the new technology and accelerated freeze drying to apply it to the vegetable industry.  He started Erin Foods.  He slogged all over the country organising farmers, co-operatives and so on to produce the vegetables; he organised workers to process the vegetables and what thanks did he get?  First, the Government gave him an instruction that he could sell only 10 per cent of his product on the home market.  Imagine the Government telling a State company that they could sell only 10 per cent of their product on the home market because the Government must protect the private entrepreneurs, Batchelors, Goodalls etc.  Therefore, Erin Foods were forced to sell 90 per cent of their product abroad.  After being thwarted in every way Michael J. Costello was thrown out.  The Government did not agree with his enterprise. Erin Foods were handed over to Tony O'Reilly who lost no time in selling out to Heinz Erin, for which he was made vice-president of Heinz Erin and is today president of Heinz International and gets, I suppose, about $1 million in just salary from Heinz International, not to mention the various millions on his oil deals, Fitzwilton deals and so on.  Where is Michael J. Costello?  He is on the scrap heap.  Nobody wants to know him any more.  Nobody knows or cares where he is.  I met him only once in my life, last year.  He was going to a number of Deputies in regard to a commemoration that was being held in November.  Certainly his are not my kind of politics.  I would <Col N="1159" /> be totally opposed to him politically, I would have cast him a Blueshirt, probably the same as Deputy Kelly.  He is very close in politics to Deputy Kelly, but Michael J. Costello is a true patriot.  He knew and understood what the whole fight for freedom and independence was about.  What is it about?  How many people in this House know or think about what it is all about?  Michael J. Costello had a very clear understanding of what it was about.  It was about independence in economies as well as political independence. It was about giving greater wealth and greater opportunity and greater living standards to our people.  This was what people had fought for.  They fought for control of our land so that we could do all these great things with it.</P>
    <P>We talk about freedom but we never think of what freedom means.  We say there is no freedom of expression in the Soviet Union, Poland and so on, and we do not even think what freedom of expression means.  What kind of freedom of expression have you if you leave school at 12 or 14 unable to read or write?  If you have only a primary education you cannot express yourself.  No matter what freedom we give, such a person has not the education to have freedom of expression in speech, writing literature, music, art or anything else.  &ldquo;Educate that you may be free&rdquo; Thomas Davis said, and we are cutting back on education when the whole future of our country depends on giving a greater and higher standard of education to young people.</P>
    <P>This type of budget does not in any way face up to the extraordinary changes in the past decade in the economy, technology and in the people themselves and their social consciousness.  Even in the past five years extraordinary changes have taken place but this Government have not geared themselves for these changes.  They show no change in attitude, thought or development whatsoever except to come up with the same, &ldquo;We have changed the tax bands, we have put it on here and we have taken off that and everything will be hunky-dory&rdquo;. <Col N="1160" /> You borrow a few quid here and you mention something about percentages of GNP, and everything seems to be going grand.  The books are right or they are not right and we will put it off now for another five years.  All that nonsense which is not helping the economy of our people, which is not doing anything to develop the resources of the nation so that we might provide jobs.  We must reform totally our tax system in order to bring about fairness and equity.  In addition, we must be prepared to give full rein to the public sector, to the enterprise and the innovation that exist in that sector.  I am not suggesting that we stop the private sector.  By all means let us help those in the private sector who are working in the national interest, who are doing a good job.  Grants and aid should be on the basis of productivity, in other words, we must ensure that we get value for money.  We must allow the public sector companies to compete also.  There is no point in hammering them.  Unless we do this and develop the economy in freedom and independence we will not be able to provide jobs and a better future for all our people.</P>

      <P>Resolutions Nos. 3 and 6 are being discussed together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>We are opposing Resolutions Nos. 3 and 6.  Resolution No. 3 imposes additional duty on petrol primarily, but also on a number of oils.  The effect of Resolutions Nos. 3 and 6 together is to impose an increased burden on an already overburdened motorist.  It is recognised in this House now in a number of budgets that when we are talking about the price of petrol, the tax on petrol and the tax on cars we are no longer talking about luxuries.  For many people a motor car is a necessity.  It is an essential part of their employment.  It is necessary to enable them to get to their place of work and very often to travel during the course of their duties.  An increase under either of those headings <Col N="1164" /> will impact directly on a very large section of the community and under no circumstances should it be regarded as a tax on luxurious items or on something which is primarily a form of relaxation.  On simple economic grounds it is unfair and undesirable to resort to the motorist once again as has been done on this occasion.  There is of course the subsidiary aspect of cross-Border trade which in recent years has loomed very large in all our discussions on taxation and particularly on indirect taxation.  With the recent movement in favour of the Irish pound against sterling that inclination to shop across the Border has become even more attractive.  There have been some changes in VAT rates today which are intended to improve the situation in that regard but which most of us believe will not have any major effect.  One of the key elements in enticing consumers across the Border is the price of petrol and from that point of view Resolution No. 3 must be regarded as very detrimental.  To increase the price of petrol is here to give a very considerable impetus to that cross-Border trade.</P>
      <P>Resolution No. 3 also covers other energy areas.  In particular, the cost of heating oil will be increased.  I should like the Taoiseach to give us full details of exactly what will be involved in the operation of this resolution.  We are entitled to know, firstly, what exactly it will mean in relation to the price of petrol at the pumps.  Secondly, we are entitled to know what it will mean in the price of home heating, and, indeed, to know all its other implications.  I want the Taoiseach to give us a fair amount of information in that regard.  Under any of these headings we are not dealing with a matter of optional expenditure.  For most people these are necessary expenditures, either in the course of their employment or domestically. I should like the Taoiseach to outline exactly what the impact of this resolution will be in the different areas which it will affect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to know, in regard to Resolution No. 6, what exactly we are talking about.  The Minister has suggested that the provisions would operate in favour of smaller vehicles.  I should like <Col N="1165" /> some information from him on exactly how he sees these increases in excise duties on motor cars operating.  What exactly, in all cases, is the revenue which he expects to accrue to the Exchequer?</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To deal with the various points raised, first with regard to petrol, the price comparison I used is in relation to premium grade petrol, in order to maintain comparability in different figures.  The position is that pre-budget the retail price of premium grade petrol was 289.1p per gallon.  It will, by the addition of 10p a gallon, become 299.1p per gallon.  That figure compares with the post-budget figure last year of 288.5p per gallon.  This is an increase of 3.7 per cent so that, including the budget increase, petrol will have risen in price by only 3.7 per cent in the past year.  By comparison, the general CPI increase &mdash; the latest figure available is for last November &mdash; is 6.7 per cent in the period. With the budget increase, the increase in petrol price is only half what it is for consumer goods generally.  This reflects the downward trend in petrol prices. Since October last the price has dropped by 6.4p.  It would seem likely to me, speaking now as a layman, that the OPEC decision to reduce their price of oil by $1 a barrel, still leaving it above the spot price, is likely to lead to further reductions in the period ahead.  It seems to me, on the face of it, probable that, allowing for that, petrol prices, within a month or so &mdash; perhaps it will take a little longer to come through the pipeline to reach us from source &mdash; but over the next couple of months, will drop further, which could well mean that between October last and, say, next April, you could have a full 10p reduction in the basic price, offsetting fully the increase in excise duty and VAT of 10p.  That is speculative, I admit.  One cannot be certain of the exact figure.  Already, two-thirds of the increase imposed here has been discounted by the price reductions which have taken place in the last couple of months, of December and January.  In real terms of purchasing power of money and in terms of people's incomes, the <Col N="1166" /> price of petrol is lower, after this budget, than it was after the last budget.  The increase imposed, therefore, is modest in these circumstances.  Another Government, perhaps, could have attempted opportunistically to increase the price by more, while still not raising it above the level, in real terms, that it was at a year ago.  We felt that we should limit the increase to this amount on the basis that over the three months before and after the budget the decline in oil prices will more or less offset this, so you will have a period of relative stability in petrol prices despite the increase to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>In looking for money and obviously we have to raise additional money in order to keep within the parameters of the plan, as we have done &mdash; and at the same time pursuing the commitments in the plan, both to holding down the level of taxation to the same as last year, 36.7 per cent to be precise, and to adjusting bands and allowances with a view to helping people paying income tax, preventing an erosion of their position by inflation, additional funds have to be raised and limited tax increases in this budget include one on petrol.  It is perhaps the most defensible in many ways although, of course, tobacco and cigarettes are health cases as well.  In this instance, because of the trend in oil prices and because the increase in price, even after the budget, will only be 3.7 per cent over the past year, I do not think that anybody could seriously quarrel with this.  I am not too sure that the Deputy is seriously quarrelling with it, although he obviously has to make his point.</P>
      <P>With regard to the effect on consumption, it will be negligible.  It is not possible to measure it because it is so small.  It is expected that there will be increases of up to 5 per cent in the consumption of Derv and any decline in petrol consumption will be so marginal as to be incalculable. This again indicates that it is obviously an area where some tax increases are reasonably justified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the other resolution mentioned by the Deputy &mdash; road tax on private motor cars &mdash; the position is that the increase will be of 50p on cars not <Col N="1167" /> exceeding 8 horse power, which constitute between one-fifth and a quarter of all cars.  That is a 6 per cent increase, which is small again, within the rate of inflation.  The actual road tax on smaller cars will be, in real terms, no higher but fractionally lower than they were a year ago.</P>
    <P>For cars with a horse power of 9 to 15, there is an increase of £1.  That is a large group of cars &mdash; 700,000.  It is the great majority of cars.  The increase per horse power of £1 obviously means paying some £9 to £15 more, depending on the horse power in that range.</P>
    <P>With the larger cars, which constitute quite a small group &mdash; about 7 per cent of the total &mdash; I do not think that any of us would worry too much about the position of this group who have these larger cars and can afford the few pounds extra. There is £2 per horse power increase there, which obviously could involve an increase of £32 to £40.  That particular social group could well afford that.  The increases, therefore, are very modest. They compare favourably with those in other recent budgets.  For cars not exceeding 8 horse power, the increases in the last three budgets have been, respectively, £1, £2 and £1.  In this budget it is only 50p.  For the nine to 12 horse power group, for example, in 1982 and 1983 the increase was £2 per horsepower whereas in this budget, as in the last one, it is £1 only.  Therefore for the great majority of people the increases are modest and compare favourably with those in a number of recent budgets.  I do not think they will involve any severe hardship because of the relatively small amounts involved: a car not exceeding eight horse power, 50 pence per horse power &mdash; then £4 is hardly a heavy impost.</P>
    <P>I think that answers the points raised by the Deputy.  At least I hope I have answered but I am more than happy to come back with any supplementary points he may have or, if I have failed to answer any question, to take it up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the Taoiseach. He said that he did not think that anybody could seriously quarrel with the increase in the price of petrol, that that was one of the more defensible aspects of the budget, that and the decision to increase the price of cigarettes.  I will not comment on the decision to increase the price of cigarettes.  But I should like the Taoiseach to be in absolutely no doubt that I would very seriously quarrel with the increase in the price of petrol by 10p because it will have disastrous consequences for Border counties.</P>
      <P>This time two years ago, in January 1983, just after this Government came to power, as you know, a Cheann Comhairle, most of the trade was coming from the Six Counties to the Republic of Ireland, and with the position of the £ and the punt it was attractive for people to come from the Six Counties to the Republic.  As a result of this Government's action in the month of January 1983 the price of petrol went up by 35p which changed the pattern completely. People living in Border counties and in Border towns crossed the Border for their petrol because it was attractive for them to do so.  Then they took their families, went to towns on the other side of the Border to do their shopping at the weekends.  While there was no great value to be had, apart from electrical goods and spirits, they did most of their shopping there including the purchase of their groceries.  Then people in Dublin, Cork and elsewhere heard about this and there were busloads of people going to the Six Counties to do their shopping over the last two years.  We read yesterday that the town of Newry made £15 million from the Republic in the three weeks before Christmas.  I do not begrudge the Northern towns the extra business.  Nor do I blame people who cross the Border to do their shopping but I do blame the Government for rendering it more and more attractive for people to leave this State and go across the Border to do their shopping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach if he has figures for petrol sales in Border counties over the last two years, if he <Col N="1169" /> is aware of the reduction from 64,000 gallons to 19,000 gallons a month in petrol sales in the first six months after this Government came to power.  For example, is he aware that two petrol stations have closed down in my own town, and in the town next to me, Castleblayney, three have closed down since they came to power?  Is he aware that if one passes any filling station on the Six Counties side of the Border &mdash; one with six fast filling petrol pumps like that at Cullaville &mdash; there will be at least 10 to 20 cars there at any time of day.  All that constitutes a loss of revenue to this State.  The Taoiseach told us that petrol would now be 299.1p per gallon.  He said it was 11 pence more than it was this time last year and he did not think that was too serious looking at price increases generally.  I should like to ask the Taoiseach what is the gap between the price of petrol on this side of the Border and that on the other side.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said he thought petrol would come down in price as a result of the OPEC decision in Geneva.  I should like to ask him how much petrol will come down per gallon, in his opinion, as a result of that decision taken in Geneva.</P>
    <P>One point I would make about the problem encountered in Border counties is that this is the first Government in the history of the State that has not had a Minister from a Border constituency.  I know, a Cheann Comhairle, that you yourself were a member of the last Coalition Government.  I have absolutely no doubt that if you were still a member of that Cabinet we would not be here debating an increase in the price of petrol.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I will leave your good self out of it, a Cheann Comhairle, but were any of the former Ministers from Border counties sitting at the Cabinet table when this budget was being drawn up I have no doubt that we would not be here this evening discussing Resolution <Col N="1170" /> No. 3 because it would not have been included in the Financial Statement of the Minister.  In fact, if anything, I would hazard a guess that there would have been a reduction in the price of petrol in order to reduce the imbalance, ensuring that people remained in the Republic and would not be spending their money across the Border which is extra money for the United Kingdom Exchequer.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach himself should be aware that not alone in Border counties will it have disastrous consequences but it will create serious problems for families and industry.  People need their cars for going to work, to go to town to shop.  Public transport is becoming less easily available in rural areas and a car is no longer a luxury but a necessity for very many people.  This latest price increase will in turn increase the cost of manufacturing goods and services, in that way, causing additional hardship on many people and on many industries already struggling mainly as a result of the Government's economic policies.  Is the Taoiseach aware of the disastrous consequences that his policies are having in the Border counties, if he has any figures for petrol sales in Border counties, of the number of petrol stations that have closed down and how he sees petrol prices developing as a result of the OPEC decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got figures for petrol sales in Border counties.  I have no doubt but that they have obviously been seriously affected, as they always are, by relative price comparisons.  Over my adult lifetime the relative prices of petrol, North and South, have fluctuated in favour of one or other area at different times.  I have been travelling up to the North over the last 40 years and there have always been petrol stations on one or other side of the Border doing a great trade for some period of time and then it switches to the other side of the Border, when they start building them there and the other ones become derelict.  That process has gone on regularly over the period.  Given the price differential at present, there is and must inevitably be, a leakage to Northern Ireland in terms of <Col N="1171" /> petrol sales by people near the Border.  I would not contest that for a moment.</P>
      <P>Without wishing to anticipate debate I would point out that other measures in the budget have very greatly reduced and, in some cases eliminated, the incentive to go North to buy goods.  I think the busloads will be much less numerous from now on then they now are or have been in recent times.  The elimination of those incentives will reduce the attractiveness to people to go across in order to shop and buy petrol.  There will still be people living near the Border who will find it convenient to cross over and buy petrol at the cheaper price &mdash; that is inevitable in the present situation &mdash; but it will be affected only marginally by the difference involved here, 10p, which increases only marginally the differential that exists already.</P>
      <P>With regard to the likely effect of the OPEC price change, it is not possible to forecast that.  One has to recognise that a change in the OPEC official price has a somewhat limited relevance.  They are being forced to reduce their prices because of the fact that the free market spot price is falling and, just as bank interest rates follow changes in the interbank rate, so the OPEC official price follows in the wake of fluctuations in the spot price market.  The fact that the official price has come down by a dollar does not necessarily reflect the actual decline in the price we will be paying or that those who buy oil on our behalf will be paying.  As an example &mdash; a very crude calculation &mdash; if in fact it were a dollar and were passed on, in terms of petrol prices probably it would have the effect of eliminating the other 3½ pence that remains to be eliminated to get petrol prices down by 10 pence since last December and would offset completely the increase here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am only saying that speculatively because obviously one cannot determine in advance precisely what the prices will be with the many complex factors involved. Given the general trend of oil prices, it seems reasonable to assume that there will be a further reduction in petrol prices <Col N="1172" /> here and that its order of magnitude will be likely to be sufficient to effect a total net drop of 10p over some period of months, from December to April, in the price which this duty increase will do no more than offset.  As to whether that will affect the relationship between prices North and South, that is less certain and depends upon the extent to which the British and Northern Ireland petrol prices are affected by North Sea oil prices rather than OPEC prices, although over a period of time the two have to move more or less in harmony.  I could not comment on that aspect of it.</P>
    <P>I recognise the cross-Border problem. I recognise that the effect of this at the point at which it takes place will be marginally to increase the incentive.  But the disincentive to go North, or the removal of the incentive to go North to purchase goods under other headings which we will be discussing later, will greatly outweigh any marginal effect it might have.  That is a personal feel for it, rather than speaking on official advice on the subject.  It is not amenable to close or tight calculation. I have not got any precise data on the actual sales in northern areas.  I am quite sure the Deputy is right in saying they have been greatly reduced because of the adverse relationship which exists at present, just as at other times they have been heavily boosted by the favourable relationship which existed in the past in different periods when the benefit was on our side.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it is much of a defence to tell the Irish people that the improvement in the dollar exchange rate and the OPEC oil decision mean that we cannot allow that sort of reduction to be passed on to the public and that we have to adjust our taxation system, as it were, to make sure that improvements in the dollar-punt position are not passed on.  I was interested in the Taoiseach's comment when he predicted that a further reduction in oil prices will be the trend.  That tempts one to ask the question as to whether it might be the policy of this Government to continue to pump the price of petrol back up if we <Col N="1173" /> are lucky enough to get a reduction because of the dollar exchange position. That would be a curious waltzing arrangement with the Arabs.</P>
      <P>Whenever we are lucky enough to get a reduction because of the exchange rates or OPEC decisions the Government make sure that the benefit to the community is not passed on, but is picked up in extra taxation.  It is a cosy arrangement. The public will not be too pleased about it if it is to continue for any length of time.  The people do not care much whether it is those Arabs over there or our brand of Arabs here who impose the increase.  The fact remains that after this budget there is 10p a gallon extra on the price of petrol over what it was last week. If a person travels an average of 10,000 miles, that involves about 400 gallons of petrol.  We are talking about almost £1 per week in the household budget directly as a result of this decision.  It does not mitigate that to point out that it was almost as dear last year anyway.  People expected the dollar position and the OPEC decision to give them an alleviation in the price of petrol and that has not happened.  They are faced with an extra £1 a week approximately in their petrol bill.</P>
      <P>With the income tax reduction, on the tables presented by the Minister this afternoon, a married man with three children will be saved a total of £70 per annum, which I reckon to be £1.35p per week.  He will now take home £1.35 per week extra on the taxation tables presented to the House.  With an average car with an average mileage, he will have to pay £1 of that immediately to take up the slack in the petrol price.  The £1.35 on average which is put back in the person's pocket is taken out directly again by this measure and a number of other measures which I will come back to later on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proportion of the price of petrol taken in taxation has been increasing steadily despite the comment the Taoiseach made earlier.  In 1980, 50 per cent of the price of a gallon of petrol was made up in taxation.  By 1984 that figure had increased to 56 per cent.  As a result of this decision, it will jump to 58 or 59 per <Col N="1174" /> cent, that is, up from 50 per cent in 1980 to nearly 60 per cent now.  The proportion the State takes on each gallon is increasing quite dramatically.  We must keep a very close eye on this.</P>
    <P>The number of people who can afford to drive cars is declining.  In 1982 there were 775,000 car owners in the State. Two years later there are 710,000 to 715,000 car owners, a reduction of some 60,000 in a period of about two and a half years.  The message is quite clear.  People cannot afford to drive and they cannot afford to put petrol into cars.  This decision tonight will fall very heavily on the backs of three quarters of a million car owners virtually.  That point is worth bringing home to the House.</P>
    <P>On a similar point, in 1982 73,000 cars were purchased here.  Two years later that figure had fallen to 55,000 for the year.  The number of cars being sold and the number of people owning and driving cars show dramatic drops.  One wonders whether there will be any increased revenue, or whether the Government will get the increased revenue they predicted of some £27 million.  I did not notice that figure in the Minister's speech this afternoon, but I noticed it in the appendix. Some £27 million is expected to be taken in under this measure.  I doubt very much that that will happen.  If these trends continue and there is a reduction in the number of cars and drivers, I estimate that that £27 million will be eaten into severely.</P>
    <P>The role of Irish tourism as an essential contribution to the balance of payments cannot be over-emphasised.  It is a major contributor to the balance of payments.  It is an £800 million industry.  It is suffering from tremendous unemployment and it is under enormous pressure.  I do not see any opt out clause, or any voucher scheme, or any suggestion that our biggest customers, our tourists, should be treated in any particularly helpful way to encourage the industry.  As I pointed out in a supplementary question this afternoon, two lines were devoted to the tourist industry in the summary to the national plan.</P>
    <P>The only proposal for tourism in the <Col N="1175" /> national plan which I could identify was the late opening of public houses.  There was no other proposal for one of our major industries.  The decision tonight will be quite a severe blow to the tourist industry.  One has to draw attention to that.  The Taoiseach might ask the Government to consider doing something to help the tourist industry in regard to the petrol price increase announced tonight.  I should like to put those points before the House and particularly the fact that the Government cannot continue to ride on the back of the exchange rates and to claw back in taxation any benefit given to the Irish people.  That policy will catch up on the Government.</P>

      <P>The only relevant point made in the last two minutes has been by Deputy O'Hanlon.  He made a very good point in regard to Border constituencies and I support him.  If the House could look seriously at the problem Border areas have in regard to petrol prices we might be able to come up with a solution.  It does not affect my constituency directly but I know that when people go to the other side of the Border to purchase petrol they make other purchases. The budget has gone a long way to discourage such people from making other purchases.  If we could discourage people from crossing the Border for petrol we could make a substantial inroad on the whole problem.  Could we have certain petrol stations at which people could get VAT refunds?  People might be able to get credits at such stations.  Of course there would be a cut-off problem, in relation to whether we should confine such filling stations to Dundalk or to have them as far south as Drogheda.</P>
      <P>We must try to narrow the disparity in petrol prices north and south of the Border by issuing either refunds or credits to people who purchase their petrol just south of the Border.  All of us should address ourselves constructively to such a suggestion.  Something must be done to benefit traders on this side of the Border.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am compelled to say something on this resolution arising from the dismissive manner in which the Taoiseach dealt with a very serious tax imposition when one looks at its whole implication.  We are dealing with hydrocarbon products in general which all directly affect industrial costs.  This is obvious if one looks at how Irish industry is distributed throughout the country and the dependence of our industry on exports.  Because of our dependence on exports there is a high distribution cost element built into Irish industry: there is <Col N="1177" /> a high element of transport in industrial, commercial and farming businesses. Trucks and vans are widely used for transportation and you cannot dismiss the effects of this resolution in a casual way as if it is a tax that does not matter.</P>
      <P>In his usual breezy way and with his bizarre brand of optimism the Taoiseach suggested that oil prices will fall and that we can look forward to a relatively stable period of oil prices.  If we learned any lesson from the past 12 years we should know of the volatile nature of oil prices internationally and nationally.  I do not think there is a product in the world today that is less stable.  Therefore, to say this tax is justified on the basis of an indefinite period of stable oil prices is nonsense.</P>
      <P>This is not an inconsequential tax.  It will yield £27 million and it will directly affect industrial costs immediately, from midnight, unlike some of the other provisions in the budget which will not have effect for months.  As from tonight these costs will be felt by every sector of our economy, affecting industrial, commercial and farming areas.  It will mean further disemployment.  It cannot have any other effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, it is not a tax that can be regarded lightly.  To decide now to raise the costs of the industrial, commercial and agricultural sectors with immediate effect is a serious decision.  It is an effort to get the Government out of the corner in which they got themselves by cosmetic exercises in other parts of the budget.  It is an easy cop out and cannot be explained by the type of arguments we have had from the Taoiseach and the Minister.  With his optimism about stable oil prices the Minister for Finance now has decided to take the cream while it is going in the hope that stabilised oil prices will be a feature of the international market.  The Taoiseach knows well that is not the case, that we are subject to the most volatile buyers and sellers and marketeers in the world who run a most complex network of international markets. The Irish Government, the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance cannot forecast glibly to the House that oil prices <Col N="1178" /> will remain stable at a low level for some time.  That is not on.  It is not good enough to base the tax on that type of glib assumption.  The Government will get £27 million from this, but they should not run away from the consequences.  The money is being secured to settle accounts in other areas.  It is being obtained as a result of a direct cost imposition on Irish industry, commerce and farming.  The increase will affect costs immediately and will cause a lot of unemployment in the years ahead.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>I note that the Minister proposes to make an order to the effect that petrol retail outlets can increase their petrol charges by 10p per gallon from midnight tonight.  Is that true?  I thought a maximum prices order had to be made by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  What is the position of retailers who purchased petrol today at the old price?  Will they be permitted to make an extra 10p per gallon profit?  If that is the case it is a damnable disgrace.</P>
      <P>I should like to know if red diesel, used for agricultural purposes, is to be increased by 10p per gallon.  It must be remembered that white diesel is used in cars and lorries but the red diesel is used in tractors and other farm machinery.  If red diesel is to be increased by 10p per gallon farmers involved in tillage will suffer because the price of grain and agricultural produce this year will not be increased by the EC.  Have the owners of petrol retail outlets permission to alter their pumps and charge 10p per gallon more from midnight?  I hope the position is that the increase will not come into effect until a maximum prices order is made by the appropriate Minister and that that is made clear to retailers.  I would not like to see motorists being exploited on this issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I note that the tax on agricultural vehicles is being increased by 100 per cent and that once again the motor trade will be crippled by exorbitant taxes.  There is no doubt that more unemployment will follow in that sector.  I understood that the Government decided to reduce VAT <Col N="1179" /> on repairs to 5 per cent to take that work out of the black economy, to stop repairs taking place in backyards, but I have no doubt that the increase imposed today will mean more for the black economy.  I am not in favour of the black economy but the Minister's proposals in regard to car repairs is a receipe to divert motorists to those operating in the black economy. The increases in transport costs will lead to increases in many commodities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to emphasise the seriousness of the increase in hydrocarbon oils.  The taking of £27 million on this is a serious impost because of the impact it will have on various aspects of Irish life.  Last year I dealt with this matter also.  The philosophy of Fianna Fáil over the years &mdash; to some extent we converted other parties also &mdash; has been to decentralise industry.  The result is that some people living in purely rural areas work in industrial centres.  The resolution under discussion will lead to a severe increase in their costs.  We have heard a lot of talk about moderation in wage and salary claims but one thing that pushes trade unions into the position of looking for more for their members is this regular increase in expenses.  Many workers must use their cars to travel from ten to 30 miles to work daily.  Any Member who approaches this city from a 30 mile perimeter is aware of this.  This increase is a blow at the decentralisation thinking which is good for the country in every way, demographically and as far as the social mores of the people are concerned. When one adds that to the increase in car tax one can see how seriously workers will suffer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position in regard to Border areas has been mentioned by Deputies O'Hanlon and Mitchell.  It is a serious problem. Impulsive buying must be taken into account.  The supermarkets have developed a philosophy &mdash; it is a very insulting one to women &mdash; to get, as they describe it, the Nellies in.  Once they get customers in the supermarkets rely on impulsive buying.  It is an offensive term but there <Col N="1180" /> is a phychological reality behind it.  We know from experience that roadside markets in towns near the Border are drawing people.  In some cases people pay more at those markets than they would pay for similar articles at home.  This 10p per gallon is only an added incentive for people to go North for petrol and to buy other goods as well.  The point made by the Minister today that prices have been falling at the pumps is a very shaky reason to give for putting an extra 10p on each gallon.</P>
    <P>We all know that an escalation of the long drawn out war between Iraq and Iran, an escalation that would impact on Saudi Arabia or what used to be called the Trucial States, would cut off a major source of supply and would inevitably result in rising prices.  We have been watching the antics of the dollar and its impact on prices.  That is another area of which we have to take cognisance because, as the House knows, hydrocarbon oil has to be paid for in US dollars. The OPEC Ministers have been trying to sustain prices and they are finding it difficult, but perhaps the Minister thinks they will find it so difficult that the price will fall drastically.  I understand $29 per barrel for light Arabian was the agreed OPEC price up to now but the latest quotation in <i>The Economist</i> was $27.65 and it has dropped below that, but the opposite may happen.</P>
    <P>The dollar has got very strong.  I have pleaded in this House for some attempt within the EC to have an EC petro currency to try to counteract this kind of thing, but at present we are bound to pay for oil in dollars.  The proposition in the Government's plan that US rates of interest would not go up was foolish.  Nobody could say that.  Nobody could say that the strengthening dollar would not affect the price of oil here.  There is the possibility of providing coupons along the Border. At the time of the Suez crisis I remember we got out coupons for the whole country in a very short time and I think the Government should consider such a move.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the young people who have to pay exorbitant car insurance <Col N="1181" /> rates.  These young people who are lucky enough to have jobs not only have to pay exorbitant insurance rates but they have to pay an extra 10p on the gallon of petrol and increased motor taxation.  That is a very heavy burden, most of which is deliberately imposed by the Government. We should be very proud of our industrial workers in manufacturing industry and &mdash; this is seldom said in this House &mdash; the productivity achieved by our farmers over the years.  We should be encouraging them rather than discouraging them by direct Government action.</P>
    <P>There are approximately 5,000 motor mechanics out of work, many of them highly skilled and on the trail to New York, Boston and other parts.  This stab at the motor trade will not help that situation. This trade had a disastrous year as far as selling new cars was concerned and for the first time in the history of the Six Counties, they sold more cars despite all the social, political and economic stresses there than we did in 1984.</P>
    <P>The Government should look hard at this matter and accept some modification of the impost they have suggested in this budget.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to deal with a number of points which have been raised.  Reference was made to the impact of this increase on the cost of living.  It will be 0.2 per cent, and the overall impact of all the tax changes in the cost of living index is .25 per cent, the lowest for the last five years.  I want to deal generally with a number of points.  I did not say that the Government were opportunistically taxing petrol because there had been a decline in basic oil prices in the last couple of months.  The Government's position is that in this budget they had to raise certain money by indirect taxation to finance direct tax reductions.  That may be a simplification of the pattern of the budget, but it is part of its main structure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not clear what the Opposition are suggesting.  I do not suppose they are suggesting more borrowing because already Deputy O'Kennedy complained that we were borrowing too much.  I do <Col N="1182" /> not suppose they are saying we should not have achieved these income tax reductions.  What exactly are they proposing? I do not think they know.  If we are going to maintain the deficit at the planned figure, and that is important, &mdash; the planned figure was 7.8 per cent &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That was not done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We held it at 7.9 per cent and if at the same time we are to maintain the planned figure of taxation, no further increases above last year's level, 36.7 per cent, and if we are to effect changes in the income tax code, which are rightly demanded and which we are committed to in the plan, then arithmetically there is no alternative but to impose increases in indirect taxes, but the question is where are these best imposed. It is our judgment, and it has not been contested from the other side of the House, that increases in duty on spirits would be pointless because we have reduced this duty drastically to try to encourage people not to buy spirits across the Border and that is a proposition with which the other side of the House agree. I do not think it is proposed that we should increase the duty on beer because the beer and spirits differential has been affected by a reduction in the duty on spirits to the detriment of beer.  That was inevitable and it was something we could not do anything about.  We have increased the duty on tobacco and that has been accepted without demur.  I do not suppose that the Opposition would suggest that we increase this duty further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Where then do we look for additional revenue?  It appeared to me that the appropriate area was petrol for several reasons.  First, the price elastically is low, that is to say the increase in tax is not accompanied by a significant drop in consumption and therefore we will get in the revenue and this means revenue increases.  Second, from now and for the immediate future, oil prices are reducing, and this is an area where we can increase taxation without imposing a net extra burden on people by comparison with what costs were, even in current money <Col N="1183" /> terms, two months ago.  In real terms, even after this increase, there is no increase <i>vis-à-vis</i> last year.  On the contrary in real terms the price now is lower than it was last year.</P>
    <P>I am not clear what the argument is from the other side.  Is it proposed that the money be raised by more borrowing? No, because we have already been criticised for the size of the deficit.  Is it proposed that we should not try to achieve an improvement in the income tax code? I have not heard anybody say that we should not have reduced income tax.  We have to get extra money from somewhere and we have not heard any alternative suggestions.  It seemed to me that this was the opportune way to find extra money needed.  I am not quite sure what all the sound and fury is about.  I suppose it is about politics but that is what this House is about and I can hardly complain in that regard.</P>
    <P>Deputy Connolly, who is absent at present, referred to red diesel.  Red diesel is not affected by this.  It is affected by the VAT increase but that is offset by the increase for farmers of 2.2 per cent in the VAT rebate, so that is a self-contained area.</P>
    <P>The other point worrying Deputy Connolly might not have troubled him if he had been following the budget speech more closely because the Minister clearly stated that the question of the price at the pump is a matter to be determined by an order to be made in the days ahead by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and there can be no question of increasing pump prices until that order is made.  Withdrawals of petrol from bond from midnight will certainly bear the additional duty but the Minister will make a judgment as to the appropriate time that pump prices will be increased, taking into account the time lag on average between withdrawal from bond and when the petrol flows from the pump at petrol stations.  Therefore, Deputy Connolly need have no worries on that score: the Government are taking the necessary action.</P>
    <P>Those are the main points which have <Col N="1184" /> been raised in the debate so far and I am glad of the opportunity to explain more clearly what I did not perhaps explain clearly enough at the outset.  The basic thinking behind the budget is the need for a switch from direct to indirect taxation within the tax limits which we have imposed upon ourselves.  We are the first Government who committed themselves to hold taxation down to a specific level. Within that, we have to ensure that there is more discretionary spending, more money in people's pockets and a choice in the manner in which they spend it.  As I said, there is a switch to indirect taxation and some of that must come from petrol and other hydrocarbons.  This will impose the least hardship on people because there are compensatory reductions in other prices.  If any Deputy opposite has any alternative suggestions as to what might be taxed instead of this, I should be interested to hear them.  I have not heard many such suggestions.  I do not fault them for this; normally those in opposition are inhibited in this regard. It is easy to criticise the actions of the Government, and suggesting alternative forms of taxation is not a popular pastime in opposition.  I do not really expect it to be indulged in here tonight but it is our judgment that this combination of taxation, putting the bulk on cigarettes, petrol, road tax and other minor items, is the correct way of handling it and I am perfectly certain that the general public also think so.  If we had decided to put extra duty on spirits, having just reduced it, or to tax beer, not to cut income tax or to borrow more money, it would have been rejected by the public who will give general support to the measures we have adopted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am appalled at the extra taxation on fuel oils and petrol especially when they make such a song and dance about reducing excise duties on television sets because of the big influx of these items over the Border.  There will still be a difference of a couple of hundred pounds between the price of a television set north and south of the Border.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How blind can the Government be?  I <Col N="1185" /> do not mean they have been deliberately blind, they are genuinely blind in increasing the price of petrol and fuel oils, particularly petrol, which involves widening the gap which now comes to the staggering figure of 80 pence in our money between the cost of a gallon of petrol north and south of the Border.  Anyone who knows anything about the Border regions knows that the Government should close the gap to some sort of reasonable proportions in regard to beer and petrol.  These are the items that draw the people across the Border at weekends. If a husband is fortunate enough to be working he drives his car across the Border and fills it up with enough petrol to last a week.  His wife accompanies him to do the shopping and if she visits Derry, Strabane or Enniskillen she buys everything she needs for the week even if in some cases she may pay a little over the odds.  To illustrate the astounding difference in prices, a can of Harp manufactured in Dublin is selling for 27 pence sterling across the Border.  As a big concession before Christmas, supermarkets here were selling the same can at 99p in our money.  That illustrates the crazy difference and, from midnight tonight, there will be a difference of 80 pence per gallon north and south of the Border. Those two items will draw people across the Border on a Saturday afternoon. They will fill their cars with petrol and buy a case of beer each for themselves or their neighbours at this giveaway price. If clothing or shoes catch the woman's eye she will probably buy them as well because she will not bother to shop in towns south of the Border to finish off her shopping.</P>
    <P>Other Members and I were on a deputation to the Minister before these staggering differences arose, although we knew they were in the pipeline.  We talked to representatives of the Government and we told them it would prove disastrous to small businesses and petrol stations in Border areas.  The Government should now be happy as they have closed everything of that nature within a radius of a few miles of the Border.  They are now extending the blight still further <Col N="1186" /> by increasing the difference in those two items.  They made great play of the fact that they have reduced duty on television sets, as if that will make any difference. I can tell the Government that the end result will be that more money will be spent outside the Twenty-Six Counties to our detriment.  Television sets will still be about £200 cheaper across the Border. The Government and their advisers must be aware that if an item is in common usage there will be smuggling and it does not matter if all the people in the customs, the Government and everyone else stood shoulder to shoulder along the Border these people would still come and go.  They always have and they always will.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the Government's double thinking.  We are talking against a background of the Government putting up the price of petrol but leaving the differential on beer.  Is it true that the gravity or strenght of the lager which I mentioned, Harp, is weaker in the Six Counties than it is in the Twenty-Six Counties?  If the specific gravity were reduced here to the level which obtains across the Border it would have a big impact because it would affect the base price on which all duties, excise, VAT and so on are levied.  Is it true that there is a difference?  Is it also true that the manufacturers, Guinness, are aware of this and that previous Governments asked them to level the two off but that they refused to do so?  There was a suggestion rumoured in the newspapers four or five years ago that if they were pushed to do this they would leave this country and do all their brewing in London.  That is the story I heard.  If this is a ghost let us lay it.  If it is the case perhaps someone can tell us why it is so and why we should have the ruinous position in the beer trade further exacerbated by the fact that there is a lower specific gravity being sold under the same label.  The specific gravity is not stated on the cans of lager.  This adds to the belief that the story is true.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>Sometimes there is not a lot of difference between one fuel and another.  I am sorry for transgressing but I was merely following a line of argument. The Government are making a drastic mistake.  If they ruin the Border counties they are adding to the ruin of the Twenty-Six Counties and the entire island.  It will have an ongoing effect on everything that is produced in whatever form.  The further they are removed from our markets the greater the impact this increase will have.  Do not tell me it will not affect the production of goods.  It will, directly or indirectly, because people must travel to work and on average in provincial areas they have much further to travel.  The increased cost will be reflected in the price of the product and the ultimate feature is that more people will be unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This resolution will bring about the reverse of what any Government in their senses would be seeking to do and that is to stem the rise in unemployment.  That is not what the Government or the country want.  Petrol stations and service stations do not exist along the Border.  One has to go back 15 miles before one can get petrol.  Even at that it is not unusual for people to put £1 worth of petrol into their cars at these stations just to take them across the Border.  The Government seem to have got the message and that is why I cannot understand why they have acted in this way on this item.  Allied to all the other increases, the increase in road tax, which might be regarded as small in relation to the others is another straw on the camel's back which is so weak that it is liable to break at any time. It is ill-conceived for all the difference it will make to the Government and their much needed input to the Exchequer. One can only summarise that the Government are not aware that the real problem they must tackle, and which they so far have failed to make any impression <Col N="1188" /> on in this or any other resolution, is unemployment.  They are creating further disincentives by increasing costs and this will be reflected in falling employment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have two brief queries to the Taoiseach.  Before today there was a differential of 65p per premium gallon of petrol between here and the North.  Is the Taoiseach aware that the level of excise duty yield from petrol &mdash; figures that have been confirmed to me by the Revenue Commissioners today &mdash; shows already a tapering off in petrol yield this year?  I will give the Taoiseach the precise figures that have come from the Revenue Commissioners because I consider it important that they be recorded in this House.  In 1982 the amount was £245 million.  In 1983 the amount was £275 million and in 1984 the amount was £281 million.  I am sure the Taoiseach will appreciate that an extra £6 million over the figure for 1983 shows a dramatic decline in real terms.  This information came from the statistics section of the Revenue Commissioners.  Will the Taoiseach not accept that an extra 10p differential will aggravate the problem and it will mean that we will get a smaller return than we have been getting up to now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Taoiseach or any member of his Cabinet visited the cross-Border customs posts they would see that every single car and bus coming across the Border had topped up with petrol.  That is the reality. It will remain the position and it will <Col N="1189" /> be aggravated.  The Border regions that Deputy Blaney and Deputy MacSharry were concerned about will be further decimated.</P>
    <P>That additional increase in the differential will not be compensated in any way by the slight adjustment on television sets.  We are talking about a £50 differential but the differential as regards prices is as much as £300 for colour television sets.  We are already seeing a fall-off in revenue because of higher levels of excise duty on petrol and the Government are increasing that by another 10p.  This will mean a dramatic decline in real terms. We have been talking about selective, self-financing tax cuts.</P>

There is a diversion to diesel and to auto PGL to a lesser degree which is distorting the figures, as well as the general decline in consumer expenditure.  To reply to the point made by Deputy MacSharry, the figure for excise is 8.1 and for VAT 1.9.  I have not to hand the figures in relation to other countries and I cannot answer the question at the moment.</P>

The inevitable result is that we are having levels of tax that are inordinately high <i>vis-à-vis</i> our neighbour, Northern Ireland, and other countries.  That is the inevitable consequence of the policy followed by Fianna Fáil.  We are trying within those limits&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Right.  I am afraid that you have confused me even more in relation to this matter.  This imposition of VAT on footwear is a reintroduction of a proposal which brought the defeat of the last Coalition Government, and rightly so.  It is really brass neck on the part of the Government to reintroduce it.  They are effectively introducing the proposals on which they were defeated in 1982, which was the placing of VAT on <Col N="1208" /> footwear and clothing.  They introduced VAT on clothing at 8 per cent and are now increasing that to 10 per cent.  They are introducing VAT on footwear now. In theory, they are excluding children's shoes, but clearly this will have a very serious affect on the capacity of ordinary working class people to clothe and put shoes on their families.  The fact that the parents will have to pay extra money for their own shoes will reduce the amount of money available to them to provide for their families.</P>
      <P>There is obviously the other angle to this imposition, which is the effect it will have on jobs.  We have heard on the news today that Clarks of Dundalk are closing with the loss of 370 jobs.  We have the Tuff factory in Killarney working on short time.  Is there anybody who would doubt that this imposition of VAT on shoes will have the result of the loss of further jobs in that sector?  This is wrong on a number of counts.  The fact that the Government are increasing VAT on shoes will make it more difficult for people to buy them and will also have an effect on maintaining jobs in an industry which is at this very time on the point of extinction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other angle which also must be dealt with is the process in which this Government are engaged of trying to hoodwink people into believing that they are introducing tax reform.  What, in effect, they are doing is shifting the burden from pay-related income tax on the PAYE sector on to direct tax, which is completely unfair.  Not only are they trying to fool the working class people by effectively trying to give with one hand and take with another, but they are not even going about the reform of the PAYE system in a fair or equitable way. This whole procedure of putting VAT on shoes and raising VAT on clothes is wrong.  I am to speak on all three amendments and I refer now to paragraph (g) concerning fuel and other services, concrete, repair of vehicles and machinery and so forth.  This smacks of a confidence trick, as I said before in relation to this Government.  There is an attempt to present an image of reform when, in fact <Col N="1209" /> what is being done is creating a more unjust tax system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This resolution brings into focus very clearly the whole fraudulent approach of this budget.  This budget is a complex of sleight of hand and conjuring tricks.  To a large extent, it is all done by mirrors.  Resolution No. 7 is probably the clearest example of the whole bag of tricks, because what the Minister is doing here is endeavouring to cloak up a certain situation.  The Taoiseach earlier on spoke glibly about maintaining the promise of the Government to keep taxation in line with last year.  The simple fact of the matter is &mdash; and the blue tables that we all have here show it as clearly as possible &mdash; that, overall, there is going to be £400 million of extra tax revenue taken from the community in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the nub of the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>£400 million more will be taken in tax revenue from the community than was taken from them in 1985.  Specifically, of that, £164.7 million will be taken in extra income tax.  Let the House be absolutely clear about that. All the adding and subtracting that the Minister has gone on with and all the taking away here and putting back there, cannot disguise the simple fact that the Irish income tax payer, namely the PAYE payer, is going to pay £164.7 million more in 1985 than he or she did in 1984.  In addition, under this Resolution the families and households of this country in 1985 are going to pay £122.3 million extra in value-added tax.  These are the net results of all the Minister's manoeuvrings in his budget speech today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to draw attention to something on which Deputy MacSharry sought clarification, to which he was perfectly entitled.  There is a new little trick being played by the Minister in his budget arithmetic this year.  In this matter of VAT he just inserts the net figure of £9.2 million.  Previously a Minister for Finance in his budget arithmetic would have shown what he was giving away under certain <Col N="1210" /> headings and what extra he hoped to take in under others.  That would have been very useful and informative for us.  Perhaps the Minister will give us that figure during the course of the debate on this resolution.  We are specifically concerned to find out what extra he is taking under the different headings, under footwear, clothing and the fuel rate that is going up to 10 per cent.  We would like to know exactly what extra revenue will be raised under those headings and not just have this nice neat net £9.2 million inserted in the budget arithmetic.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest also that this is an anti-family budget.  That will become increasingly clear to people when all the mirage of propaganda that has been engaged in today ceases, all the special interest groups have been paraded before the television.  Families and households will then very quickly realise that they are the people who are being hit by this budget and that under this resolution they are being very harshly treated indeed.</P>
    <P>The principal objective of this resolution is to introduce a new VAT rate of 10 per cent on footwear.  It will also, nice and gently, push up the rate of VAT on clothing to 10 per cent and double the rate of VAT on fuel to 10 per cent.  These three things will directly impact on lower income households and families.  It is quite fair to say that, in so far as there is any particular balance of advantage in this budget, on the whole, it is in favour of the well-off to the detriment of the poor and weaker sections of our community, in particular lower income families. That is exactly what Resolution No. 7 sets out to do.</P>
    <P>I might add that we all welcome the reduction of VAT on newspapers to 10 per cent but I might point out that it is some considerable time since we sought to have that rate of VAT reduced to 5 per cent.  In many parts of this budget introduced today the items being hailed by Coalition commentators and spokesmen are things we have been seeking and demanding over the last two years.  I mention in particular the reduction of VAT on newspapers, though in our opinion it has not gone far enough.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1211" /> I do not wish to take up too much time because I know many Deputies wish to speak on this resolution.  I just want to reiterate that the main thrust of this resolution, and indeed of the budget as a whole, is to take more tax from people both in income tax and in VAT and not less, and that the impact of this resolution in particular will be very severe indeed on lower income families and households. There is nothing in the budget elsewhere which will in any way compensate for the additional expenditures being imposed on that section of our community.  As my colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, was quick to point out today, nothing has been done for children's allowances in this budget in an obvious year in which to effect some improvement in that scheme.</P>
    <P>We will be voting against this resolution as a whole in order to indicate our objection to these particular provisions and our opposition to them.  We feel that to be the quickest and most direct way of dealing with the situation, because in the time at our disposal we do not have time to waste on too many divisions.  Therefore, we intend to vote against Resolution No. 7.  But I want to make it clear that in doing so we are not opposing the other provisions in the resolution which effect a reduction in VAT rates in certain areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the 5 per cent to 10 per cent rate of increase in VAT goes on the cost of buildings?  At a time when the constuction industry is on its knees I am appalled that the Government &mdash; to use the Taoiseach's words &mdash; used their &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; to do something like this.  There was a great chorus of &ldquo;Hear, hear&rdquo; when the grant for first-time buyers of new houses was announced as being increased from £1,000 to £1,750.  The result of the increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent on a house, the average cost of which, particularly in the Dublin region is approximately £30,000, will eliminate the £750 extra grant &mdash; in other words, something in the region of an extra £750 on each new house, but the Minister slipped very quickly over that.  I <Col N="1212" /> do not hear very many &ldquo;hear, hears&rdquo;. Perhaps he will confirm that my arithmetic is correct in this instance.  It is an appalling thing for any Minister to do. Instead of encouraging the building industry, which can provide much badly-needed employment, the Minister has increased the cost of the average house by approximately £750.  Not alone that, but he puts that into every building contract throughout the whole industry.  He talked glibly about the extra 15 per cent on school buildings and claws back 5 per cent straight away.  That is the net input as a result of the &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; of this Government, to use the Taoiseach's words.  I am appalled at this decision.  It is not so long ago since a Government led by this Taoiseach fell on what is happening here this evening.  One wonders how a child will be defined.  Will it be size four, size five, size three or two?  If it is a large child, will he or she be counted as an adult?  If I want to buy a pair of shoes must I bring a birth certificate along with me?</P>
      <P>The clothing and footwear industries are very sensitive.  They have been very good employers.  They are labour intensive industries.  Yet the &ldquo;judgment&rdquo; of this Government is to impose 10 per cent on one section and an extra 2 per cent VAT on the other.</P>
      <P>Paragraph (2) (e) reads:</P>
      <P>the promotion of an admissions to certain live theatrical or musical performances (including circuses) be exempted from value-added tax.</P>
      <P>What is meant by that?  Must they take place in a theatre before they can get the benefit of the VAT exemption?  Many parish halls and community halls are being built at considerable expense to the community.  Will they be eligible for this exemption, or has the entertainment to take place in what would normally be described as a theatre?  In many rural areas and in many small rural towns, unless this reduction applies to rural halls and community halls this provision will have an adverse effect on rural life as happened already in one or two of the other resolutions passed here tonight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1213" /> I would be grateful if the Taoiseach could give us an explanation of the complete folly of a Government who boast of giving £400 million for roads and then claw back 10 per cent.  Instead of encouraging the building industry, this budget has driven another nail into its coffin.  It has done nothing to encourage employment or to assist the many hundreds of young people who are saving to provide their own homes and who will be very worried by the implications in the Minister's speech about what might happen to certain building societies.  It will do nothing for the hundreds of small communities who are awaiting new schools and in many cases it will add another 10 per cent to the cost of local contributions. Rather than helping the building industry this budget is curtailing its progress further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>In making a brief contribution on Resolution No. 7 I should like to welcome the overall change in the VAT rates.  This measure is long overdue. From six rates we are now down to three rates.  I talked to one hotelier who told me about the number of rates on equipment and goods in the sports element of the hotel, and the nuisance and the difficulty of having to consider six different rates on different items.  The changes announced today are most welcome.</P>
      <P>The fact that the 35 per cent rate has been reduced by 12 per cent is a great boost to the economy and to the public. The Government deserve credit for being able to move in the direction of synchronising the rates and we hope that eventually they will arrive at one VAT rate.  The 35 per cent rate was a disincentive and was one of the reasons why there was such an exodus of money from here into the North.  I hope there will be a response from the public and that more money will be generated by the new rates when they are in operation.  The three rates will be easier to operate and the fact that the 35 per cent rate has been abolished will provide a boost which we hope will be reflected in jobs and confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1214" /> I should like to deal briefly with some of the headings and to welcome a couple of items in particular.  A boost for tourism is provided by the reduction from 18 per cent to 10 per cent on the letting of accommodation, the short term hire of cars, mobile homes and boats.  In the past foreigners have complained about our high VAT rates.  If we can now attract visitors a great deal of money will be generated.  The Government have had the initiative and the courage to take these decisions in order to back up our tourist industry.  I hope that in the returns next year we will see extra money coming here in many forms.  If people come here and spend money on the items which have been reduced, money will be spent in other areas as well.</P>
    <P>Like other speakers I welcome the reduction in VAT on newspapers.  Other speakers said they have been advocating this over a period of time, but the fact is that some of them left the rate as it was when they had an opportunity to reduce it.  This Government have delivered and have reduced the VAT rates on newspapers. We all like newspapers.  Some of the smaller ones were in severe difficulties and were making great efforts to keep going and keep their local communities informed.  I hope recognition will be given to the fact that the rate has come down by 13 per cent.</P>

      <P>The Deputy will have his chance.  I also welcome the recognition given to live theatrical performances and to circuses which are to be exempted from VAT.  It is always a boost to the Irish economy when our artists are performing.  Many of them have gained recognition abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>None of us can be overjoyed at the fact that the rate on some items has had to be increased.  We have made a start.  We have made an effort in relation to the overall reduction of high VAT rates.  I hope that more money will be generated <Col N="1215" /> and confidence will be restored in business as a result of the move towards the restructuring of the VAT rates.</P>
    <P>The slight increase in the rate on clothing will affect certain people but I hope, with the benefits given and the restructuring of the bands, that increase will be offset.  The Government have started down the right road.  There have been many calls for the restructuring of VAT and the lowering of tax on this and that. The gentlemen on that side would like tax on everything to be reduced to 5 per cent, but what about VAT at the point of entry?  I repeat that the budget has reduced VAT rates by 12 per cent on many items and by more, and I welcome the decreases, which are part of our overall taxation strategy.</P>

      <P>Some of the changes in VAT rates today hit at the poorest sections, some of whom will be faced with 10 per cent more on footwear, increased VAT on fuel and a 2 per cent increase in the price of clothing.  They have already faced cuts in the health services which do not appear in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I must point out to the Taoiseach that in the past three budgets the total increases given to social welfare recipients have been less than that given in the last three years by Fianna Fáil when in office.  In the last three years of office Fianna Fáil gave increases totalling 25 per cent to the social welfare section, those increases to date from 1 April, unlike this budget which provides for the increases from July.  The Taoiseach said earlier there are elements in the budget <Col N="1216" /> which will eliminate the differential between prices here and in the Six Counties. Which reductions in VAT will eliminate differentials in prices?</P>
    <P>A document circulated to us yesterday gave the estimated revenue from VAT in 1985 as £1,475 million.  Today the Minister for Finance told us that it is estimated the net effect of these changes in VAT in 1985 will be a reduction in revenue of £9.5 million.  The post-budget figures for revenue given to us today show a decrease of £8.9 million in VAT takings. Therefore, the Government estimate that they will take in from VAT a total of £1,483.9 million if the figure for VAT is £8.9 million rather than the £9.2 million given to us by the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NeilTCBlaney" hpid="Mr. Blaney Mr. Blaney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of the few occasions on which I will say something in favour of the Government.  It is in relation to their movement downwards from the exhorbitant 35 per cent VAT rate on a number of items to certain lower figures.  There is a reduction from 18 per cent to 10 per cent in the VAT on hotel accommodation and related services. This is going in the right direction &mdash; but it is the only thing that is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are offset by increases in respect of other commodities.  These increases are totally anti-family, whether the Government intended them to be or not, I refer to the increased VAT rate on clothing and the introduction for the first time of VAT on footwear for children of more than ten years of age.  According to the blue document there is a discrepancy; because it refers to 11 years as being the age up to which there would be exemption. There has been exemption in relation to clothing for children.  The Financial Resolution, however &mdash; this may be an oversight &mdash; provides exemption for children up to ten years.  If the feet are small and the shoes fit them and if the size marked on the shoes is appropriate to ten years and a couple of weeks or a couple of months, the children will be exempt.  If I did not say it in the House before I said elsewhere that it is the craziest thing to try to relate exemptions for children according to the <Col N="1217" /> size of their feet.  This qualification varies so widely that it must have been some daft screwball who came up with something like this.</P>
    <P>Here in the Financial Resolution we have the age of ten years, plus a few weeks or a few months, but we have 11 years in the blue document as the age of exemption.  Clothing and footwear are being VAT rated, one being increased and the age of exemption in the other reduced.  Fuel comes into the picture of family costs.</P>
    <P>I should like to know how it has become cheaper to maintain a child after he or she has reached ten or ten and a half years?  How is it sane to imply that this is so as children get older, up to the age of 18 years?  That applies to both clothing and footwear and it was daft in concept and will be daft in its application.</P>
    <P>The building and construction industry was referred to and we have been told it has been boosted by a lower VAT rate on the cost of concrete blocks.  You would have to be a blockhead if you took that in as meaning very much because blocks are the cheapest part of any house.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Blaney</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be.  In fact if they are not careful they might fall down on them, but that is another day's work. There has been talk also about increased expenditure on roads.  As far as the building industry is concerned if the Government believe that any of these cosmetic operations they engaged in in the budget will help that very sick industry they have another think coming.  It is in a bad state but it is the one industry that in the midst of our depression if aided properly by the Government, would reduce unemployment and redound to the credit of the Government, even to the point of disregarding many of their past deeds that must bury them at the next election whether that is held next year or the following year.  It does not matter when the election is held because we will have another 1977 all over again and the <Col N="1218" /> Government will be replaced, regardless of what they do in the meantime.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Government why is it that they do not try to put our people back to work.  Why not try to help the construction industry?  Why are they trying to get the impression across that they are doing something, because they are not?  They are doing a lot of fiddling around, exchanging, distributing and redistributing but the end result is that the Government will take more money at the end of the day, and very often from those who can least afford it.  They are not helping the building industry even with the increased grants because they will not meet the increased costs that will result from the extra duties and taxes.</P>
      <P>The Government had a good idea some time ago when they decreased the VAT rate in respect of car repairs from 18 per cent to 5 per cent.  The idea was to try to bring back to the established garages the business that was going from them to the back streets and laneways.  That move was effective, but now the Government are doing the reverse: they are increasing that 5 per cent rate to 10 per cent.  At the same time the Government are telling us that the increase is being offset by a reduction in the excise duty on parts. Those parts are available to the people who operate in the backyards and backlanes and they will continue to take business from the long-established legitimate garages.  The move is self-defeating.  I suggest to the Government that they had the right idea but got it the wrong way around.  One does not compensate for the other.  The reduction in the VAT rate on parts is available to those who will not be paying the 10 per cent VAT on repairs. Those people whose overheads are lower and who will not be paying VAT will be able to wipe out the legitimate struggling garages who had been helped by the reduction in VAT last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to see one rate for VAT. Perhaps the Government would like one rate also but we may have different ideas about the figure.  One rate of VAT would make life so much easier for business <Col N="1219" /> people, who have been turned into book-keepers in recent years.  If we had a realistic flat rate I have no doubt the Government would reap immense rewards.  They would get a lot more than they are getting with the fiddling about that is going on at present.</P>

      <P>I should like to put a question to the Taoiseach, one I tried to raise at the outset of the debate on a point of order.  It is difficult for us to deal with these matters when we do not know the cost involved.  This is the first time in my 16 years here when this information was not made available in the Minister's speech.  It is deplorable that no allowances were given for the new taxes on footwear, clothing or fuel.

I will give figures for the yield in 1985, which I believe will be sufficient for the Deputy.  The figures are as follows: (a) -£67.1 million; (b) -£6.7 million; (c) -£7.0 million; (d) -£0.3 million; (e) -£0.1 million; (f) +£6.9 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  In respect of (g), fuel, the figure is +£54.4 million.  That <Col N="1220" /> figure covers all the items covered by the 5 per cent.  With regard to (h), clothing, the figure is +£5.7 million.  In addition there are other effects which net out at an additional +£5.0 million.  So that the House will have the full picture I will outline them.  It is estimated that there will be a once-off VAT at import loss of -£13.0 million arising from these changes.  I should mention that the total cost of putting right the damage done by Fianna Fáil in February 1982 would be about £200 million.  We have not got £200 million at this stage but what we are doing here does in a very small way reduce it. It reduces it by £13 million.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The other two figures that are necessary to complete the picture that are part of the net £5.0 million addition are increased revenue from purchases diverted from Northern Ireland etc., +£3.0 million, and increased revenue from reduction in evasion, +£15.0 million. Those three together give an extra +£5.0 million.  If the Deputy adds up all the figures I have given him as far as (h) &mdash; there is no effect for (i) &mdash; he will get -£9.2 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been asked a question as to how it is that, if one takes £9.2 million off VAT when one starts at £1,475 million that one ends up with £1,483.9 million. This is a question which requires an answer, and the answer is quite complex, but I will endeavour to get it across to the House.  You start with pre-budget figure £1,475 million, the actual effect of the VAT changes in themselves is a net reduction in VAT of £9.2 million composed, as I explained to the Deputy, but there are two other factors.  One is that the excise duty increase has a VAT component, <Col N="1221" /> but for technical reasons part of the increase comes in as VAT for the purpose of achieving 10p on cigarettes and 10p on petrol.  That means that £4.7 million of the excise duties increases are technically VAT and the other thing is that the overall buoyancy effects of the budget on VAT are +£13.4 million because of the buoyancy effects of the budget on the economy as a whole.  As the Deputies will recall from the table with the budget, the impact of the budget on the tax revenue buoyancy is £58 million, an indication of the extent to which the budget will be stimulating the economy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Because there is a net reduction in tax, the tax reliefs exceed the tax increases on the one hand and there is an impact from considerable provisions for this year's expenditure in terms of social welfare, public service pay, grants to local authorities and so on, on the other side.  The stimulatory effects of the budget are such as to increase buoyancy of revenue generally by £58 million of which £13.4 million comes under VAT.  That is the reconciliation asked for of the £1,475 million we start with and the £1,483.9 million we end with.  The actual reduction in VAT rates is £9.2 million.  I hope that is clear but if Deputies want me to go over it again, I will be happy to do so because I am anxious that they will understand it fully.</P>

      <P>On the contrary, I have been trying to get to my feet for the last half hour to give the House the figures. The Deputy is less than fair to me in that respect.  I have been endeavouring to catch the Chair's eye in order that the House should have the full figures which I feel are necessary to the debate.</P>
      <P>Deputy De Rossa spoke about the increases in footwear.  He said they were unjust and asked about their effects.  In the case of footwear, 90 per cent of home consumption is imported and two-thirds of home output are exported.  The economic effects of VAT increases on footwear are relatively small and 90 per cent of the burden falls on imports and there is no VAT on exports.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I was asked about the economic effects on employment and I am trying to answer the question.  The effects are relatively small in this instance because the bulk of the economic effects on employment of this increase falls as to 90 per cent on imports.  As far as exports are concerned, they are not subject to VAT.  This increase has an exceptionally small impact on either production or employment.  The benefits of the reductions are much greater on employment and production because of the diversion back to domestic outlets of purchases of goods and the stimulation of domestic production.  Many goods come under the 35 per cent rate, pottery, glassware and so on.  In the case of clothing the figures are similar but not as extreme; 70 per cent are imported and so the impact of <Col N="1223" /> the VAT falls mainly on imports.  More than 55 per cent of home production is exported and is not affected by VAT.</P>
      <P>The effects of this budget on the consumer is an increase of ¼ per cent of the CPI, the smallest increase in any budget since 1978.  The effects on the consumer are extraordinarily small.  They are almost imperceptible.  The economic effects on clothing are also imperceptible for the reasons I have mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Calleary and Deputy Blaney spoke about building.  The Government's plan, and the budget implementing the plan, involve a very substantial increase in Exchequer expenditure on construction, an increase of 11½ per cent.  What is the effect of the increase to 10 per cent in the VAT on building?  Obviously it was not the Government's desire to increase the tax on building, but there is clearly no way that we can arrive at a simplification of the VAT structure without some going up and going down.  There is no way this can be done in a way which balances out without a significant net loss of revenue unless the lower rate is about 10 per cent and the higher around 23 per cent.  If we try to minimise the effect on building by having a rate of 7 per cent or 8 per cent, you would not have a 23 per cent rate; it would be around 30 per cent. The Government had to make a choice as to what the two rates would be.  In achieving that simplification the figures that emerged to give a balance in revenue between losses and gains were 10 per cent and 23 per cent.  The Government recognised the increase as potentially adversely affecting the construction industry and sought to mitigate that. Where do those effects fall?  Let us be clear where they do not fall.  There will be no effective increase in the amount of tax borne by the industrial sector or by the commercial sector in respect of hotels and shops or in respect of offices used by registered persons, since in all these cases the tax borne on building work qualifies as a credit against the tax due on supplies. Second, the increase will apply to all supplies not completed by 1 March.  If completed on or after 1 March the new rate <Col N="1224" /> applies.  If the sale of a new house is completed before 1 March, the old 5 per cent rate will apply.  The burden of this falls on supply of buildings and building work in the areas of housing and public authority construction work, in buildings for use by unregistered persons, such as public authorities, banks, insurance companies, schools and hospitals, which come into the public capital programme, and churches.  Leaving aside the banks, insurance companies and churches the two areas left are housing and public authority construction work.  In the housing area we sought to compensate to a significant degree by an increase in the grant of £750, or 75 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>From 1 March also, to tie in with this.  That accounts for more than half the additional cost in that instance.  In regard to the public authority construction programme generally, that programme is planned to increase by 11½ per cent so that even if this has some impact on it, the net increase in this programme will nonetheless be significant. Taken overall, the impact of the budget on the construction industry is positive in terms of Exchequer expenditure&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's Exchequer spending on the construction industry is up to 11½ per cent and even allowing for the impact of this increase, incidental to our simplification, falling on the public authority area, it still leaves an increase which is in excess of the rate of cost increase in the industry this year. There will still be a net volume increase in public contruction.  There is a £750 increase in the housing grant.  There are also other measures, such as the new incentive for letting, new tax incentive for multiple residential occupation and a reduction in the price of concrete blocks although this is quite small and I do not place great emphasis on it for the reasons mentioned by Deputy Blaney.  There is <Col N="1225" /> also an increased sum provided for fishery harbour development works.  Taken overall, the net effect on the construction industry is positive.  We managed to simplify the code in a manner which was bound to lead to an increase in the building rate of 5 per cent and at the same time to ensure that the impact of the Exchequer on the construction industry is positive.  That is a considerable achievement by the Government, even if the Opposition are slow to recognise the fact.</P>
      <P>The question of children's shoes was raised by Deputy Calleary.  I wondered if that old chestnut would come up again but I thought after the drubbing the Opposition got last year that they would be slow to raise it again.  I am sure Deputy O'Rourke remembers the exciting debate we had when she asserted that there was no way in which children's clothing could be distinguished.  I made the mild suggestion that children's clothing is labelled by age and size and she denied any such thing.  I came in the next morning with the labels in my hand from a shop in Grafton Street and Deputy O'Rourke was nonplussed.</P>

The manner of determining the distinction between children's and adult's clothing is quite clear.  It refers to shoes up to the size appropriate to a child of 11.  The same method is employed in Britain.  They have the wit which Fianna Fáil do not have, to exempt children's clothing and shoes from VAT.</P>

    <P>Deputy Blaney raised a number of points and I have dealt with them.

Deputy Blaney also raised a point upon which we should all reflect.  He mentioned the desirability of a single rate of VAT.  As far as I can recollect, that has been recommended by the Commission on Taxation.  However, the difficulty is that if one were to impose such a rate, to achieve the present revenue gained from <Col N="1227" /> this source, it would be strictly a rate of 14 per cent but the savings through eliminating evasion would perhaps allow a rate of 13 per cent to be imposed.  Do Deputies consider that imposing a rate of 13 per cent on food in order to reduce the 23 per cent rate is a policy that they would wish to see followed?  I have considerable hesitation in that regard considering the reaction to the very modest change in food subsidies which involved an increase of 1½ per cent to 2 per cent in the price of food.  If it were increased to 13 per cent, I am sure Deputies would not greet it with much enthusiasm.  If the Deputies opposite wish to advocate this and to support Deputy Blaney, I should be interested to hear their views.  The impact on social groups at different levels would be considerable and it is certainly not something which one could embark on overnight.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey argued that because the level of taxation is £400 million higher than last year, we have raised the burden of taxation. He must think that people are extraordinarily simple if he thinks he can put that across.  He knows perfectly well that the increase in taxation arises from the combination of increased consumption and increased national output in the year ahead and inflation at a very low rate which is now estimated at 5¾ per cent for the coming year.  This combination automatically yields an increase in revenue even if taxation is kept at the same level.  In fact, the budget marginally reduces taxation because the table attached to the budget shows that the new tax increases involve £66.1 million and the new tax relief is £75.3 million. Therefore, there is a net reduction of £9.2 million in the burden of taxation between tax increases and tax relief.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister for <Col N="1229" /> Finance said on a number of occasions that the effect on the consumer price index would be a quarter of 1 per cent.  I understand they are assuming that the £67.1 million saving and all the VAT changes will result in price reductions to that extent.  That is absolute and complete nonsense.  It is ridiculous to assume that the goods affected in the change from 35 per cent VAT to 23 per cent VAT will result in consumers who buy those goods saving £67 million.</P>
    <P>The same applies to the prices that will be charged for accommodation.  The benefit of £6.7 million which will be enjoyed by those who own hotels and so on will not be passed on to their customers nor is there any guarantee that the price of newspapers will be reduced as a result of the change in VAT.  We welcome the reduction of VAT on newspapers. It is no harm to point out that VAT on newspapers went from 15 per cent to 18 per cent under a Coalition Government and from 18 per cent to 23 per cent under a Coalition Government. It is about time they brought them down to 10 per cent or even 5 per cent as suggested by us.</P>
    <P>This is an anti-family budget.  There is no doubt but that £6.9 million will be collected through VAT on footwear. The consumer will pay that increase.  A further £54.4 million will be brought in through the increase in the price of fuel, houses and so on.  The increased VAT rates will be passed on to the consumer through increased prices but there is no guarantee that the VAT savings will be passed on to the consumer.  This totally undermines the consumer price index given in the budget.  It is ridiculous for the Government to suggest such nonsense on budget day.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach tried to put it over on us a few moments ago but I wonder if we are moving to a stage where VAT will be put on food.  It would have just the same impact on household budgets as putting VAT of footwear and clothing will have.</P>

      <P>With respect, might I say to the Taoiseach that it would be very difficult for me to be nonplussed on the day following budget day because I was not in the House.  It would be a new experience to be nonplussed <i>in absentia.</i></P>
      <P>The Taoiseach said I did not know what I was talking about when I spoke about clothing and footwear for children. I know that the people living in terraced houses and small farms around the country will not understand when the Taoiseach says this will have no economic effect on their budget.  A woman who goes into a shoe shop to buy shoes for her 12 year old or 18 year old who is unemployed will have to pay the increased VAT rate.  No gobbledygook in Dáil Éireann will convince her otherwise.</P>
      <P>I have two children with great big feet. The Taoiseach knows that boys and girls of 13 years of age and upwards are at their most expensive age.  Their parents have to pay for school books, school transport and so on.  No matter how the Taoiseach tries to present it, VAT on footwear will represent a huge burden on a family's budget.  This is the first time in many years that there has been no increase in children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The increase in the VAT rate on clothing will affect teenage children.  They are the ones who put the greatest strain on a family budget.  The VAT rate on fuel has been increased to 10 per cent.  Let us take an average family of a mother, father and four children sitting around the fire as we like to think our constituents do.  The fuel for their fire will cost them more tomorrow.  Their shoes and clothing will cost more as and from tomorrow.  How can the budget be described as a family budget?  It is not.  No matter what the Taoiseach says the net effect is that the <Col N="1231" /> family purse will be worse off.  I hope parents know what is contained in these resolutions.  I am totally opposed to them and will present them at every forum where I get an opportunity of doing so.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>Since I came into the House I have, on a number of occasions, spoken about the complexity of VAT rates and the different VAT rates.  We are now back to three rates and I welcome the fact that there is some uniformity in the rates.  I should have liked to see the exemption limits for registration of VAT increased in the budget but this is not the case.</P>
      <P>I heard the Taoiseach say in reply to a question from this side of the House that the VAT rate on building will be increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent from March-April 1985, the normal period at which VAT changes will take place.  This will increase the price of houses.  The Taoiseach in reply to a question said that the date of application for the new grant will probably be from 1 March 1985.  I can foresee grave problems in the next six or seven weeks if that is the case and the building industry will grind to a halt.  People will not close deals until after 31 March 1985 if their grant will be increased from £1,000 to £1,750. On the other hand, if they wait until after that date to close the deal the builder will have to put up the price because of the VAT increase.  I ask the Taoiseach to recheck the matter.  There will be much confusion in the next six or seven weeks because people will not know whether to go ahead and close deals on houses.  If they do that now they will get a grant of only £1,000 whereas if they wait until after March it will increase to £1,750. That point should be clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that if a contract is entered into before the end of February the person will pay VAT at the rate of 5 per cent and get a grant of £1,000.  After the end of February the person will pay VAT at 10 per cent and will get a grant of £1,750.  Obviously the advantage lies in completing the contract as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlieMcCreevy" hpid="Mr. McCreevy Mr. McCreevy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the situation there will be a lot of confusion and consternation regarding the matter.  Deputy MacSharry asked the Taoiseach a question regarding the VAT increases.  To compensate for the reduction in the VAT rate from 35 per cent to 23 per cent, which will mean a loss of revenue of £67 million to the Government, the majority of the money will be made up by increasing the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent under paragraph (g).  The present 5 per cent rate includes building, motor repairs, agricultural contractors, accountancy fees to farmers and so on and obviously the greatest part will relate to the building industry.  As Deputy Blayney pointed out, it does not make any difference to registered builders if there is an increase or a reduction in the rate of the various materials.  There are various other items that will be caught in the increase of 5 per cent to 10 per cent, but the largest figure is the increased VAT in relation to building.  In the case of a house costing £30,000 the price will increase by £1,500 because of the VAT change from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  The person concerned will get a grant of an extra £750 but he will suffer a net loss of £750.</P>
      <P>To complicate matters further it is proposed that the grant will increase from March 1985 while the VAT rate will increase also from that date.  The builder who has agreed the price will have to change the VAT rate or else have the contract closed before that, but the purchaser knows that if he closes the contract before that date it will cost him an extra £750 or more.  I know the Taoiseach does not deliberately intend to mislead the House but I do not think it could be the intention to apply the grant from March. Whenever there has been a change in grant regulations it has always been done on the date announced in this House and I hope that will be the situation now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No matter what happens with regard to the increase in the grant and the increase in VAT, house prices will increase.  All Members are aware of the mass unemployment in the building industry and if house prices increase it will lead to a further recession in the <Col N="1233" /> industry.  Otherwise the builders will have to take the increased VAT out of their profit margins, but they are very small at the moment.  Most contractors are liquidating their land banks to keep their cash flow going.  We know that only 50 per cent of the people who should be employed in the building industry have work at the moment.</P>
    <P>We have been told that it will cost the Government £67 million to decrease the VAT rate from 35 per cent to 23 per cent but I think that figure was picked out of the sky.  I do not think it was possible to estimate the figure.  However, an estimate can be made of what could be obtained by increasing the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  House prices have to increase when one takes into account both the extra grant and the increase in VAT and there will be a further depression in the economy.  If the changes are carried out as the Taoiseach announced, there will be total confusion in the next six or seven weeks.</P>
    <P>The increase in VAT on footwear will lead to a deepening of the recession in that industry, apart from the effect it will have on ordinary people as was pointed out by Deputy O'Rourke.  Today a major footwear factory in Dundalk closed, but one factory has survived.  It is situated fairly near my constituency.  However, what is being proposed in the budget will affect that industry also.</P>
    <P>It was a good idea to reduce VAT rate on motor repairs in the second last budget.  I accept the point regarding having a uniform and streamlined VAT rate but because of the recession in the motor repair industry, which is also affecting garages, probably on this occasion it would have been better to have a zero rate rather than increase the rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  I know that it would be a matter of judgment, that the Government of the day must make a decision as to what would be the best way to do it, but I would approach it in that way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably the most ominous part of the Minister's statement is that he <Col N="1234" /> is using a certain amount of stealth in this VAT reorganisation.  He said that he would like to see the introduction at some future date of a single rate of VAT, and the Taoiseach would seem to be canvassing that idea.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>On the contrary, I explained why it was not on at this stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>We must be somewhat suspicious of the resolution in this regard. Last year he brought in VAT on clothes, this year he is bringing it in on footwear, and we feel because of its introduction and the reference to it in the Minister's speech that he is contemplating the introduction of a single rate and including food in his calculations.  That, together with the removal of the subsidies, is typical of the stealth in so far as the penalty being applied to families is inherent in the speech and particularly in this resolution.</P>
      <P>There seems to be a strange logic in the reductions in VAT contemplated today. The Minister is reducing the levels of VAT on certain luxury goods and increasing them on essentials.  From the Minister's blue book it can be seen that he sees it as reasonable to reduce the level of VAT from 35 per cent on such items as cosmetics, jewellery and watches, but he thinks nothing of increasing it on footwear and clothes.  That is a strange thing to sell to the housewife who is having some difficulty in making her household budget match up these days. He persists also in giving the relief in VAT to the fur coat but is at the same time increasing the VAT on clothing and footwear.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Financial Resolution No. 7 (2) (a) and (b) we have a strange situation this evening.  The Minister is claiming that as his original thought.  I put it to him that those paragraphs in the resolution have been Fianna Fáil stated policy for some time.  Only last week the Minister for Finance said that this was an impossible thing to do and castigated the Fianna Fáil side of the House for even contemplating these selective reductions in taxation. Now they are taken on board one week later and offered up as some panacea <Col N="1235" /> for our economic ills.  It is strange that Deputy Cosgrave could state that he expected recognition from the newspapers of what Fine Gael had done for them.  That is a type of insidious blackmail: &ldquo;You print us right tomorrow for what we have done.&rdquo;  I hope and pray that the newspapers, as they always have been objective and fair in their assessment of these matters, will not be taken in by that kind of threat from a backbencher.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is not much fear of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Bear in mind that we have been saying that the reduction of VAT for the tourist industry and for newspapers was and is stated Fianna Fáil policy.  The Minister now is trying to find some soft comfort in taking it on board because it suits his political purposes.  The whole thrust of the resolution is for a political purpose.  Let the Government remember that, as they are reducing the level of VAT on hotel accommodation and they expect it to cost £6.7 million, the argument can be made that the hotel industry puts the figure at £4.6 million. We will not argue about it this evening, but will it attract any increased tourist traffic to the country?  There is no recognition or suggestion in the Minister's statement that it will be passed on by way of tariff reduction to the consumer. From my knowledge of the tourist industry they are in dire straits and need the extra revenue to stay afloat.  Consequently, it was preached by two Government backbenchers that this would result in a huge inflow of revenue and tourists. I do not believe that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister made a pretty detailed analysis to his own liking of the buoyancy situation but we put it to him that it was purely a balancing act on both sides of the balance sheet at the end of the Minister's statement to make the books balance today.  It is not possible to create so much stimulation in the economy considering that IR£400 million extra is being cut out of the economy by way of taxes, direct <Col N="1236" /> and indirect.  How can you have extra disposable income to create this stimulus that will generate the extra £58 million buoyancy?  There is no way to rationalise that to the satisfaction of the people unless the Government are going to do something drastic, like the first thing I referred to.</P>
    <P>Consequently, we believe that this is another bookkeeping exercise and that the Government have balanced the balance sheet at the back to suit their own purposes, using the trick of unseen revenue by way of buoyancy and conning the electorate further by saying that £28.6 million will be introduced sometime in the near future.  That is not the way to stimulate the economy and the people will see through it for what is is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance is now here, but I will deal with the points raised up to this stage since I last intervened.  Deputy MacSharry and Deputy Flynn have stated in relation to hotels and others that the reduction of VAT will not be passed on but that, of course, the increases will be passed on. It is an interesting thesis.  I do not believe that in the very competitive situation that Irish industry and businesses find themselves in at present, where they are struggling for survival and in competition in most cases with goods or services from abroad, there will be any slowness in passing on reductions.  Some domestic industries, such as construction, are protected but most of them are highly competitive. The assumption that the firms will grab these reductions as profits and not pass them on when they are faced with such pressure and competition is unrealistic.  It is a barefaced political point to suggest that if you increase taxes in respect of domestic industry in the home market, such as building, every penny will be passed on, whereas if you have reductions where there is competition from outside then they will not be passed on.  That point does not add up and I do not take it seriously.  In present circumstances reductions in taxation will be passed on.  We are not now in a boom period when there is fat in the economy. <Col N="1237" /> All these firms need every penny they can get to get their prices down to stay in business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in a competitive situation.  In any area where there are dominant firms or semi-monopoly situations, the prices commission will operate as they always do but in most of the areas we are talking of there is a high degree of competition.  The Deputy knows that we do not have price control in so far as every individual or sector is concerned: far from it.  We have selective price control in the areas where it is needed &mdash; where there are dominant firms or where there is a monopoly.  In those cases there is control and we ensure that the reduction is passed on.  For the remainder, competition will do the trick, as happens in a free economy which, thankfully, ours is.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Rourke referred to the tax on footwear as being a terrible burden. If footwear for children under 11 is zero rated while footwear for those older than 11 carries a 10 per cent VAT, I do not consider that the burden for children as a whole can be much different from what it was when Fianna Fáil VAT-rated all children's footwear at 5.26 per cent.  The Deputy is chancing her arm somewhat in suggesting there is a distinction between the two.</P>

      <P>Yes, but I am merely pointing out to the Deputy that the party opposite are in no position to criticise taxation on footwear because that taxation is almost identical to what it was when Fianna Fáil applied it originally.</P>
      <P>Deputy McCreevy welcomed the three VAT rates and went on to say that he would favour an increase in the exemption limits for registration.  I note the point.  This is something that will be looked at in due course though obviously not at this stage when the budget has been fixed.</P>
      <P>With respect to the Deputy, I had difficulty in following precisely his point about complications in the building industry because of the date of the introduction of the grant coinciding with the date on which VAT is applied.  It seems to me a fairly simple proposition that if the two coincide, people are in a position where if they can complete a contract before 1 March, they pay 5 per cent VAT and get a grant of £1,000 whereas if they cannot complete a contract by that date they pay at the rate of 10 per cent but get a grant of £1,750.  For reasons relating to the grant itself not being the subject of VAT, the actual extra cost involved is not £750 but £631.  The synchronising of the two would seem to be an incentive to complete contracts before 1 March. Therefore, I do not see any reason for confusion.  Obviously, Deputy McCreevy is much better equipped with the details of this than I am so if I have failed to grasp the point, I am sure he will pursue it with the Minister who will be taking over in a few moments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the change will involve any decrease in the volume of housing. The £631 on a house costing £30,000, that is, an increase of 2 per cent in the price, will hardly lead to a reduction of more than 1 or 2 per cent in demand, given the elasticity of the demand for housing.  I would consider the reduction in demand to be well below 2 per cent.  The scheme we introduced of paying £5,000 to local authority tenants buying new houses we <Col N="1239" /> anticipate would be taken up by about 700 people.</P>

      <P>Obviously, there is a problem of comprehension.  The net increase after 1 March, allowing for the grant, in the cost of a £30,000 house will be 2 per cent or £631.  The question is what effect that will have on the demand for housing.  I am simply suggesting that the demand would be reduced by no more than some fraction of that so that the figure would be less than 2 per cent.</P>

      <P>On the other side, the measure we are taking of offering a £5,000 grant to local authority dwellers buying private houses was expected by us at the time of its introduction to lead to a demand of the order of 700 in the current year.  The applications for the grant to date are closely in line with that expectation. That would represent a 3 per cent increase in demand for private housing from that source alone.  The net effect of the two provisions is likely to be in the region of a 2 per cent increase in total housing demand.  The 3 per cent increase by way of the £5,000 grant will exceed whatever reduction in demand there <Col N="1240" /> might be because of the increase in housing prices.</P>

      <P>The suggestion of a drop in the demand for housing is not well taken.  Deputy McCreevy says he would prefer if car repairs did not attract any VAT.  I do not know whether he noticed that there is to be a reduction on the exise duty on car parts.  This reduction is designed to compensate for the increase from 5 to 10 per cent on car repairs.  The compensation will be equivalent to the increase in the duty on car repairs.  Our aim is to achieve an equitable balance so there should be no adverse effect.</P>
      <P>Deputy Flynn raised a grand hare but a hare that was raised by Deputy Blaney and not by us in regard to the taxing of food.  Deputy Blaney proposed a single tax rate but I put it to him and to other Deputies, some of whom have shown a disposition to talk in these terms, that there is a real objection and difficulty in this regard.  While the attractions of a single rate are great, this could only be achieved if a rate of about 13 per cent applied to everything, including food.  I do not consider that to be something that would be acceptable or that we could possibly move to it except on a very gradual basis during a long period of years, regardless of whether the Deputies think it would be a good idea.</P>

      <P>The next point made was that we are reducing taxation on luxuries and increasing it on footwear. Deputy O'Kennedy in his opening speech welcomed the reduction in the number of VAT rates.  Other Deputies have welcomed the change also including Deputy McCreevy and Deputies cannot have it both ways.  If we are to have a small number of VAT rates the rates on some items must go up and on others must go down.  Obviously, the demand from every source, including Fianna Fáil, has been to reduce the 35 per cent rate.  We have done that, bringing the rate down to 23 per cent but for Deputies to complain <Col N="1242" /> then is an attempt to have it both ways. Fianna Fáil are either for or against in respect of the 35 per cent rate.  Let them tell us straight where they stand but let them not say that while they are in favour of a reduction to 23 per cent, they do not wish the tax on luxuries to be reduced. They must make up their minds before the question is put.</P>
      <P>The only other point made by Deputy Flynn was his suggestion that he does not believe our figure of buoyancy of £58 million.  I must tell the Deputy that since this Government came into office, no figures have appeared in any budget document or statement that have not been verified by and supported by the work of civil servants and experts.</P>

The point was raised that a suggestion was made that the figure for buoyancy in the budget table is in some way phoney or incorrect or decided by us to fill a gap and to bridge the gap in figures. Since I came into Government I have made certain that no figure appears in any budget document that has not been verified by the advisers and experts in the Department of Finance.  I will not ever allow that to happen.  The Deputies will recall that last year there was provision in the budget for unemployment based on 227,000 people on the live register. I contested that strongly with the civil servants at the time and said that I thought that the figure was far too high and that it would be under 220,000.  I could not persuade the civil servants in the Department of Finance and in the Department of Labour of that fact and accordingly I said that, as I could not persuade them, the figure must go in because this Government will not twist <Col N="1246" /> or turn any figure or fake any figure in any budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been less than severe on the Government for this scandalous imposition.  I do not know where the Labour Party Members are.  Deputy Bell has arrived in here.  Is there anybody left over there with a social conscience? Is there anybody left to stand up for the people who are no longer able to afford this kind of impost which the Government have put on to them?  Where is Jim Kemmy?  He brought the Coalition Government to their senses some time ago.  Why is there nobody in the Labour Party to do so?  There are people in the Fine Gael Party who have social consciences. Why are they not speaking up on this?  We here should be addressing ourselves to that and not listening to the Taoiseach quibbling and twisting and turning with facts, figures and statistics until he winds himself up into a ball and cannot make his own way out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy O'Rourke put to him the question of an impost on shoes he started talking about the average impost put on by the Fianna Fáil Government in 1972.  Does he realise what he was talking about a few minutes ago, that there are 225,000 people unemployed?  There were <Col N="1252" /> not 225,000 people unemployed in 1972. Are those 225,000 people better able to take a 10 per cent impost on shoes than the people were in 1972?  We in this House are not standing up for the people for whom we should be standing up and the Labour Party, in particular, have a serious obligation with regard to this 10 per cent imposition by the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I see Deputy Bell on the opposite side, a distinguished trade unionist who represented the leather workers at national level with the Transport and General Workers' Union.  I would like to hear from him, because I know him to be a man with a social conscience.  Was he consulted about this? Was anybody consulted?  Where is Deputy McLoughlin from County Meath?  Where are the other members of the Labour Party?  Where is the Whip, Deputy Taylor?  He is not here now.  He was here today and sat as if he had a stroke affecting both his hands when the Minister for Finance sat down.  There was no applause there, because he realises the harm that has been done.</P>
      <P>We should not allow this occasion to pass without condemning this out of hand, in particular in relation to the large number of people who are unemployed. For a while at least, when they get their unemployment benefit and their pay-related money, they will not be doing too badly, but the moment of truth arrives when the redundancy money is spent and they switch from unemployment benefit to unemployment assistance.  They have to cope now with an extra cost on shoes. I know people in my constituency who have to bring a sack to the shop at the beginning of the school term in September to bring home shoes.  Those people have a very heavy burden placed upon them by this extra 10 per cent.</P>

      <P>It so happens that a Minister for Education on this side of the House extended the period for education here substantially many years ago and by providing the first grant for third level education extended it still further.  The imposition on clothes is not quite so bad as that on shoes, but it is an increase of 2 per cent.  Again, the hardship will fall upon the unemployed in particular.  It will be felt right around the population, but they will be the most severely hit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me say this.  As Deputy O'Rourke said last year, the teenage period is a period when the clothes bill is the highest for families.  The young people today are much more choosey than they were years ago with regard to clothes and change their gear much more regularly.  A crafts exhibition was held here recently, with many young people who were being trained in schools of design &mdash; textile design and clothes design.  You would not call it <i>haute couture</i> quite yet, but they are tending in that direction.  This is a damper on their enthusiasm to develop themselves and get jobs going in situations where there are very few jobs available.</P>
      <P>There is one further point.  The Six Counties situation has been mentioned time and time again during the course of this debate.  Why can we not, even in some areas such as shoes and clothing, keep an advantage over the Six Counties? Why can we not have some lodestone here to pull the people towards the South rather than towards the North?  If we stole the pass on electrical goods and on cheap beer, to which Deputy Blaney referred, why could we not steal it with clothes and shoes, so that something would draw people down here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Could the Minister tease out section (g) where there is a colossal amount of money involved &mdash; £54.5 million, we are told by the Taoiseach.  This section has not been adequately explained.  All the things to which the increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent VAT applies have not been clarified.  It mentions fuel, excluding <Col N="1254" /> electricity and certain candles, if you do not mind.</P>
    <P>There is a story told about a Greek philosopher who used to go around with a candle looking for an honest man and he spent all his life doing that.  I shall tell you one thing, he will not find him where a constitutional crusade was promised. He will not find him where fiscal rectitude was promised and reneged on.  He will certainly not find him in the architect of this budget and these taxes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the yield on VAT generally I want to make a a point to the Minister.  When the increase projected for 1985 is of the order of £122 million over the outturn for 1984, I presume the Minister will accept from me that that represents just short of a 9 per cent increase.  Unless he can do his figures in a different way he must come to that conclusion.  If it represents a 9 per cent increase over the outturn for 1984, if the Government are telling us that we will have a 6 per cent inflation rate, does that <Col N="1255" /> not clearly indicate that the take from VAT in real terms &mdash; adjusting downward for the impact of inflation &mdash; will be considerably more than last year?  While we have acknowledged that the move towards narrowing or reducing the bands is welcome, because we have called for it, this was the Minister who introduced the six rates or bands.  We argued it on the budget last year and the previous year.  We argued it in the course of the Finance Bill and the Minister down-faced us all the time.  The record of the House is there to prove it.</P>
      <P>Naturally we welcome the belated conversion of a Minister who previously told us that this was not possible. Allowing for the fact that we have now at least some degree of normality in the range of bands, will the Minister acknowledge &mdash; for the sake of honesty, so that we all know where we are going &mdash; that within the new banding system he will take more from the consumer than he did last year. That is my first point.</P>
      <P>In view of the reduction in other bands would the Minister acknowledge the introduction of VAT on footwear?  I do not know if the Minister has given any figures yet as to what he projects will be the take from that imposition &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Between the two we are talking about something over £12 million. It is quite clear from what the Minister has been saying that, if anything, those estimates probably are understated at this point.  If the Minister is going to make the case on the one hand that the whole trend here is downward in the VAT impositions &mdash; and he said that <Col N="1256" /> not just here, that as a result of the whole level of indirect taxation and taxation generally, people would be paying less next year than this year; he said it on radio and television this evening &mdash; if it is down and he is providing £12 million only in those two areas I must suggest to him now that those are under-estimates and that the yield at the end of the year will indicate that the imposition on these categories will be considerably more than the figures he has now indicated in the House.</P>

      <P>I might make one further point in relation to this area, that is in terms of the need for taxation of this kind to meet the current expenditure obligations of the Government.  I am not sure that we have been given by the Government an accurate picture of what the public expenditure outturn will be.  It is very important that I give this single, concrete example.  I do not think the tax we are speaking of here would be adequate to meet what will be the Minister's expenditure in 1985.  One example will suffice.  As we speak now 225,000 of our people are unemployed.  Nonetheless this Government have made provision in this budget, in the Estimates for 1985, for an average of 7,500 to 8,000 fewer &mdash; 217,000 is the provision they have made in their public expenditure programme, on average, for 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that.  As has already been pointed out, the increase in the rate of VAT from 8 per cent to 10 per cent will increase revenue by £5.7 million in 1985 and the CPI effect of that in a year will be one-tenth of 1 per cent, 0.1 per cent.  It has already been pointed out that, as half of the output of our clothing undustry is exported, that half of the output will not be affected in any way by this change in VAT.  With VAT on clothing as we have proposed it here, where it applies we will again have the <Col N="1261" /> lowest rate of VAT on clothing in the EC countries.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They all have higher VAT rates than we have, including the United Kingdom, our nearest neighbour. Deputy O'Kennedy is trying to do many very fancy sums arguing from the basis of an increase of 9 per cent in the total take of VAT.  Deputy O'Kennedy knows perfectly well that what we are doing here is reorganising the rates.  Deputy O'Kennedy has this lovely habit of turning around and laughing at the press gallery when a point is coming up which he does not like.  If we were to leave the VAT rates unchanged, the revenue from VAT during 1985 would be £9 million higher than the figure the Deputy is talking about.  That is the post-Budget forecast for VAT revenue if we were to leave the rate unchanged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Why would the revenue form a tax increase while the rate of tax remained unchanged?  The only reason why that would happen would be that the tax base was increasing.  Specifically in the case of VAT, revenue will increase at unchanged rates for one reason only, that is, that people are spending more money on the items which are subject to VAT and you inevitably get an increase.  That is not fiscal drag.  That is not hidden taxation. It is simply a reflection of the fact that the volume of demand for the products being taxed is increasing and, as expenditure increases on the products, you get more tax inevitably.  What we are actually doing is changing the rates and bringing about a substantial improvement in the <Col N="1262" /> pattern of the rates and reducing the revenue below what it otherwise would have been.  If we did not change the rates in the way I am proposing.  VAT revenue in 1985 would be £9 million higher than the figures the Deputy has taken out of this.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy is making the cardinal and very simple mistake of confusing tax rates with the tax base.  I am more than amused at the Opposition's position on this.  Of course they want to have the bits in this resolution which reduce VAT rates and they do not want to have the bits that increase VAT rates.  The Opposition have been touting around for the past few months something they never had the guts to implement when they were in Government, what they call self-financing selective tax cuts.  We have decided that we will not go for that kind of mickey mouse package which Deputy O'Kennedy said he wanted.  I am sorry, Sir. That is an unparliamentary word for the rather tattered package which Deputy O'Kennedy claimed he supported a couple of weeks ago and, having met all the interests involved in the trade, he gave a press conference.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>(1)  That section 16 of the Finance Act, 1983 (No. 15 of 1983), as amended by section 10 of the Finance Act, 1984 (No. 9 of 1984), shall have effect as if the definition of &ldquo;contribution year&rdquo; substituted by the said section 10 were amended by the insertion after &ldquo;1984-85&rdquo; of &ldquo;or the year 1985-86&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(2)  That the proviso to subsection (2) of section 16 of the Finance Act, 1983 (inserted by the Finance Act, 1984) shall apply in relation to the contribution year 1985-86 and shall be construed as if, in relation to that contribution year, the reference in paragraph (a) to &ldquo;£96&rdquo; were construed as a reference to &ldquo;£102&rdquo; and the reference in paragraph (b) to &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo; were construed as a reference to &ldquo;£5,300&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>(3)  It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act, 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</P>
      <P>This resolution anticipates legislation to continue for the year 1985-86 the 1 per cent levy on income.  The levy will be applied for that year on the same basis as it applied for 1984-85, except that the exemption in relation to those on low incomes, which I introduced last year, would be increased from £5,000, or £96 per week, to £5,300 or £102 per week. The yield from the renewal of the levy in this year, that is, from April to December 1985, will be about £41 million.  Some 764,000 people would be liable to pay the levy and the calendar year yield for 1985 is estimated at £77 million.  The renewal of the exemption will exclude from liability some 380,000 people who would otherwise have been liable and the change in the level of the levy will account for about 30,000 of those.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In the last resolution we were talking about VAT and the fact that despite all the protestations by the Minister, this budget will take £122 million more in VAT from the community during 1985.  We now turn to the income tax side.  We have already pointed out that the Minister will take £164 million more in income tax in 1985.  That means that income tax yields will rise by 8.4 per cent compared with the 1984 outturn.  In other words, despite all the conjuring tricks and sleight of hand engaged in by the Minister, unscrupulously and dishonestly, income tax payers will pay 8.4 per cent more this year.</P>
      <P>Many promises were made about indexation but they have not been kept. The concessions given in income tax are nowhere near what indexation would involve.  That is another dishonoured promise. When taxpayers analyse their position they will see that the vast majority are worse off in spite of the very clever presentation and selling which has been done this afternoon and evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By a strange coincidence, if the Minister had abolished the 1 per cent income levy, he would have come very near indexation, thereby compensating for the gap between what he had done and indexation. We are opposing the extension of this levy.  It was imposed originally as a temporary measure for one year but it has now been extended.  It is a very insensitive mechanism without any regard to the capacity of the taxpayer to pay or without any regard to the circumstances of the taxpayer.  It is undesirable as a tax because of its flat rate quality.  We opposed it when it was first introduced and we have no hesitation in oposing its extension in this budget especially as taxpayers, particularly the PAYE sector, will be paying £164 million more during 1985 than they did last year, in spite of the attempts of the Minister to mislead them into thinking that they will be better off.  It would have been a reasonable concession to that hard pressed section to let this levy lapse.  When it was introduced it was ostensibly to meet a temporary budgetary situation but the Minister has extended it once and is now extending <Col N="1271" /> it for the second time.  It will bring in approximately £41 million, in other words it will take that amount from the taxpayer.  The sum of £41 million will be extracted on a flat rate basis without any regard to ability to pay.</P>
    <P>The reimposition of this levy is in line with the general approach adopted by the Minister in the budget.  This levy, the youth employment levy, income tax and VAT will impose a very considerable burden on the average family and household. When it is all added up and when this levy is added to all the other items in the budget, it is quite clear that the whole balance of the budget is in favour of the better off section of the community in relation to the poor and weaker sections.</P>
    <P>It is very difficult to find anything in the budget which will ultimately rebound to the benefit of the lower income section.  The budget is anti-family and will do nothing to improve the hard pressed lower income section.  These levies were originally introduced on some vague notion that they would be used to help <Col N="1272" /> people to find employment but that has been completely abandoned.  There is no attempt being made now even to pretend that these levies will do anything to promote employment.  There is nothing anywhere in the budget which will contribute to the creation of one single job or which will make any contribution whatsoever towards the appalling problem of mass unemployment facing us at present.  There are 225,000 people unemployed and, as Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out, despite the Taoiseach's constant protestations of honesty and integrity in regard to figures, there is a grave doubt as to whether the budget provides fully for the levels of unemployment which will obtain during the coming year.</P>
    <P>I will conclude by reiterating that this levy is just a further imposition on one particular section of the community who are already burdened in the budget with £164 million extra directly and with £122 million extra indirectly in the form of increases in VAT.</P>

      <P>To attempt a comprehensive quantification of the scope and nature requested by the Deputy would require the application of resources of time and manpower which would be totally disproportionate to any possible benefits which might accrue from such an exercise.</P>
      <P>I have already answered a question posed by the Deputy on the subject of financial transfers from the European Economic Community, and the significance of these data is self evident.  However, these financial transfers, while impressive, represent only part of the financial benefits to Ireland.  Account must also be taken of the very advantageous effect of EC membership on the development of our exports and on the attraction of foreign investment to Ireland.</P>
      <P>In short, therefore, a wholly accurate response to the Deputy's question is virtually impossible, while an approximation could only be attempted in the context of a major research exercise.  All one can say in the absence of such an exercise is that, generally speaking, a unilateral withdrawal from the European Economic Community on the part of Ireland at the present time would in all probability have the most serious consequences for the country and for its economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1961 the Central Development Committee was given general responsibility for overseeing the affairs of inhabited islands off the west coast.  In practice this has meant that the committee has concerned itself primarily with non-Gaeltacht islands as the affairs of Gaeltacht islands have tended to be looked after by Roinn na Gaeltachta, Gaeltarra Éireann and subsequently Údarás na Gaeltachta.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Government policy in relation to non-Gaeltacht and indeed Gaeltacht islands is reflected in the policies of the various Departments and State agencies concerned with development.  In addition as <Col N="1053" /> the Deputy will be aware the Government decided in 1979 on a number of measures aimed at improving living conditions on inhabited non-Gaeltacht islands off the west coast.  These measures embraced such areas as increased new house loans and grants, increased house improvement grants, increased grants towards the provision of supplementary holiday accommodation, the provision of electricity on certain islands and some proposals in regard to the provision of water and sewerage facilities.</P>
    <P>With regard to the question of the funding available to the Central Development Committee, no specific provision is made for projects in island locations.  The committee examines and advises me on projects in the west generally in relation to grant assistance from the Western Development Fund (including island projects). The amounts allocated to that fund in the period referred to by the Deputy was as follows:&mdash; 1979, £230,000; 1980, £400,000; 1981, £410,000; 1982, £680,000; 1983, £572,000; 1984, £510,000; 1985, £500,000.</P>
    <P>There are at present no projects that have been considered by the CDC in respect of inhabited islands and not acted upon.</P>

      <P>Under the terms of the Statutory Order (S.I. No. 22 1975) establishing the Health Education Bureau, the bureau has a legal responsibility to advise the Minister for Health on the aspects of health education which should have priority at national level, to draw up programmes of health education for promotion at national and local level and to help statutory and voluntary <Col N="1055" /> bodies carry out their local programmes of health education.</P>
      <P>In 1984, the bureau established a committee to advise it on relationships education as part of a health education programme for post primary schools.  No report has yet been prepared by this committee. It is entirely a matter for the bureau itself to decide on the composition of any advisory group it might bring together to assist it in devising programmes of health education.  I have no ministerial powers of direction in regard to such detailed aspects of the normal working of the bureau, nor do I think it appropriate that I should have.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit <Col N="1056" /> from 15 August 1984 and her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment.  She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her case on 22 January 1985.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of widow's contributory pension provides that there must be a yearly average of at least 39 contributions in either the last three or five full contribution years prior to the husband's death or his reaching 66 years of age, whichever is the earlier, or alternatively an average of at least 24 contributions over the period from his entry into insurance up to the end of the contribution year before his death (or reaching 66 years of age).</P>
      <P>This condition is not satisfied in this case.  The late husband's insurance record gives an average number of insurance contributions in the forty-five year period from 1937-38 to 1983-84 of only seven. The only employment contributions recorded for him were during the years from 1937 to 1952 when he worked with Galway County Council.  The claimant is not therefore entitled to a widow's contributory pension, and has been notified accordingly.  An earlier application from her for a widow's non-contributory pension was also refused because her means, derived from a farm holding and some capital, exceeded the statutory limit for receipt of this pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The late husband was in receipt of unemployment assistance from 10 March 1970 until the date of his death.  Credited contributions could not be allotted to his record in respect of this period, however, because no contributions had been paid or credited in respect of him for the two <Col N="1057" /> previous complete consecutive contribution years.  The regulations provide that in the latter circumstances 26 employment contributions must have been paid in respect of the person in question before credited contributions can be subsequently allowed.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit on 29 October 1984 in respect of an incapacity resulting from an accident at work on 8 June 1984. Following confirmation of details of the accident, injury benefit was allowed from 8 October 1984, 21 days before the date of the claim in accordance with the normal practice where claims are made late without a satisfactory explanation of the reason for the delay.</P>
      <P>Benefit has now been paid to the person concerned for the period from 8 October 1984 to 6 December 1984 (the end of the 26 weeks injury benefit period for 26 weeks from the date of the accident) with the exception of the period when she resumed work from 15 October to 21 October 1984.  The delay in issuing payment arose from the need to clarify the situation regarding this period of employment in respect of which medical evidence of incapacity had been furnished even though the employer had stated that the person had worked during that period.  The total amount of injury benefit paid is £310.89.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pending the completion of investigations her entitlement to disability benefit on an interim basis was considered.  Her <Col N="1058" /> contributions in the governing contribution year were at Class D1 only which do not reckon for disability benefit purposes and she was not therefore qualified for disability benefit.</P>
    <P>While she is not qualified for disability benefit as she does not satisfy the contribution conditions she may be entitled to disablement benefit under the occupational injuries benefit scheme if she is at the loss of physical or mental faculty as a result of the accident.  A claim form for disablement benefit has been issued to her for completion and return.</P>

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that by failing to furnish details of his means he failed to show that his means did not exceed the statutory limit.  He appealed against the disallowance of his unemployment assistance claim and his case was referred to a social welfare officer to afford him a further opportunity of co-operating in the investigations and revealing details of his means.  Following the completion of <Col N="1063" /> extensive inquiries a deciding officer revised his decision and assessed means at £10 weekly derived from fishing.  He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at £69.50 being the appropriate rate £79.50 less £10 means.</P>
      <P>All arrears due, less an amount refunded to his local health board in respect of supplementary welfare allowance which he received pending the outcome of his unemployment assistance claim, have been paid and further weekly payments will be made as they become due. He has been advised that if he is dissatisfied with the amount of means now assessed against him it is open to him to appeal and to have his means assessed by an appeals officer.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 12 May 1983 following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work. She appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also considered her to be capable of work.

She continued to submit medical certificates and has appealed against the decision to disallow her claim from 16 June 1984.

The appeals officer decided on 17 December 1984 that the claimant was incapable of work from 24 February 1984 to 15 November 1984 and is entitled to be paid disability benefit for that period.  All disability benefit payable from 24 February 1984 to 17 January 1985, the date of the latest medical certificate received, less the amount of unemployment benefit already paid, has been issued.  The delay in issuing benefit was due to the late receipt of medical evidence of incapacity from the claimant.</P>

He subsequently applied on 22 October 1984 and the case was referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of his means.  Inquiries are still being made and when these are completed his means will be assessed and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined accordingly.</P>
