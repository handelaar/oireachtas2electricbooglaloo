      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware of reports that up to 50 carcases at a Dublin meat plant were recently found to contain growth-promoting hormone pellets; if any steps have been taken against the suppliers of these animals; the measures the Government are taking to protect consumers against abuses of this nature; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I understand that the carcases referred to were disposed of for pet food.  Under present legislation no action can be taken against the suppliers of the animals concerned. I am, however, arranging to make regulations shortly to control more strictly the availability and the use of veterinary medicines, in particular hormonal substances and antibiotics.  The regulations will ensure that these substances are used responsibly in livestock production and, in the interests of domestic consumers and the maintenance of export markets, will prevent any undesirable residues getting into the food chain.</P>

      <P>A spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said last January that it was proposed to make a ministerial order shortly to deal with this problem.  At that time the general principles underlying the ministerial order were outlined as confining the use of anabolic agents to prescription only, administering under veterinary supervision and recording on animal identity cards.  Why has nothing happened in the meantime?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is our intention to introduce the orders referred to by the Deputy within the next few weeks.  It has not been as straightforward as we thought at the time to draw up the orders and, in addition, the matter has been complicated by ongoing decisions being made in the EC.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is aware that people's health has been endangered in the meantime.  Is the delay because of pressure from certain pressure groups?  Is that the reason the orders have not been brought in?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly not.  I am particularly concerned that our exports of meat <Col N="305" /> should not be in any way endangered or put at risk.  I am very anxious that the orders be brought in as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister's plans include a streamlining of the various agencies with responsibility for the monitoring of our foodstuffs at present?  As the Minister is aware, we have the Department of Agriculture veterinary inspectorate, the Department of Health, the health boards and the local authorities veterinary inspectorate.  I might suggest streamlining of the area with rigorous monitoring to ensure that consumers get uncontaminated food.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a division of responsibility between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health.  Of course the Department of Health are responsible for any health implications that may exist.  While the streamlining to which the Deputy refers may be desirable there is a division of responsibilities.  I am afraid that nothing can be done in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the only way in which this could be effected would be for suppliers to be penalised in a similar way to those who use antibiotics in milk, that if they must pay for their mistakes that will ensure that there are no hormone residues in the cattle they sell, that they would be implanted in animals in sufficient time to be absorbed?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture, in view of the decrease in processed beef exports in 1984, the steps he proposes to take to have more of our meat sold in processed form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Exports of beef other than in the form of carcases, sides or quarters were in fact about 30 per cent higher in 1984 than in 1983.</P>
      <P>On the whole the EC support system favours exports of beef in processed form.  So far as the provision of processing facilities is concerned, grants are available from both the IDA and FEOGA.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, according to a CBF report, a copy of which I have before me, exports of processed meat showed a slight reduction? Furthermore would the Minister <Col N="307" /> agree that this is serious at a time when emphasis is being laid on added value products and additional processing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much aware of that.  In reply to the latter part of the Deputy's question, there was a decrease in the total amount of beef exported in 1984.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Processed?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the total amount of beef in 1984 in comparison with 1983; there was a 30 per cent increase in processed beef exports in 1984 over 1983.  I will give the Deputy the specific figures.  Total exports of processed beef in 1984 were 114,000 tonnes compared with 87,000 tonnes in 1983, so that there was a 30 per cent increase.  The point the Deputy makes would be correct in regard to total exports but not in regard to processed beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to get into argument with the Minister and I am sure the Chair would not allow me to, but I am going on the statistics available.  I take a very serious view in that we are getting statistics specifically for processed and vacuum-packed meat.  Would the Minister not agree that, in the area of processed and vacuum-packed meat, there is the greatest labour content, which we are advocating, and which increased from 5.2 per cent to 12.4 per cent only, that is of our total dead beef exports over the last eight years?  Is the Minister satisfied with that rate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy looks at the figures he has just quoted, it amounts to approximately a 150 per cent increase. There could be some confusion here because of the definition of processed beef.  We regard processed beef as beef other than carcases, sides and quarters only.  Perhaps if sides and quarters were included in processed beef the Deputy's figure might be more correct &mdash; I am not sure of that &mdash; I am giving the Deputy the breakdown as we have it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 9 together.</P>
      <P>Supplies of finished cattle are seasonally low at this time of the year and slaughterings normally decline to a half or less of the level reached in the late autumn.  This situation inevitably involves a reduction in meat factory employment throughout the country.</P>
      <P>My Department's functions relate primarily to the EC support and trading conditions under which the meat industry operates.  In this connection every effort continues to be made to ensure that these conditions are as favourable as possible for the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did not refer specifically to the decisions taken by the Canadian authorities some months ago.  Has there been any positive indication from the Canadians with regard to their response to proposals made to them following their decision in December last?  I might add that this question was down for Private Notice on 23 January last when it was evident that closure was about to take place in a number of areas and it was disallowed on the grounds that it was a private company.  I should be grateful for that information now.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered a question specifically about the Canadian problem yesterday.  I shall deal with it very briefly now.  The EC quota was reduced by the Canadian Government on 21 December last.  Ireland had the bulk of that quota over the last couple of years but they reduced it to 2,700 tonnes.  Obviously this has caused problems for a number of meat processing plants here.  We strenuously objected to this measure at the EC.  I raised the matter specifically myself on two occasions in the months of January and February last.  The EC are the people who do the bartering when it comes to trade with third countries and there have been continuous, prolonged <Col N="310" /> discussions with the Canadians.  The outcome has yet to be decided.  A figure has been mentioned which would be reasonably satisfactory but the Canadians are anxious to attach strings to the deal.  It is not as clearcut as we would like.  The EC have indicated that if the Canadians do not allow what we regard as a reasonable amount of beef from the Community into Canada, retaliatory action will be taken in regard to Canadian goods coming into the EC.  There has been no final decision on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>What has been the Canadian reaction to the retaliatory suggestions that have been put to them? While I accept what the Minister says in relation to a valley period for slaughterings in beef at this time of the year, quite a number of meat processing plants are still operating at a fairly high output.  I am referring particularly to a plant which has a large amount of its business carried on in Canada.  Unless something is done fairly dramatically a very serious situation might develop in which the future of the plant may be in jeopardy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach has been fully briefed on the matter and will be taking it up with the Canadian authorities during his visit.  I do not want to say anything further on the Canadian situation because the negotiations have not been finalised.  During the late autumn the average kill in plants here comes to about 30,000 to 35,000 head of cattle. During the spring and early summer that number falls to something like 10,000 or 11,000 head of cattle.  There is bound to be a cutback in the numbers employed in each plant as this is a seasonal operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not sufficient for the Minister to give the reasons for a fall off in the work at the meat plants. What is the Minister doing about this problem which has been with us for many years?  Has the Minister a plan to ensure a continuing supply of finished beef or has he plans to ensure that at least there will be no exportation of finished cattle at a time when there is a slow supply?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="311" />
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one of the things over which a Government or a Minister has no control.  The market dictates the trend in price whether it is in terms of live exports or killings in factories.  A lot of people got their fingers burned in this area last year because of the drop in prices in March.  They were trying to do what the Deputy would like.  People were fattening cattle in the winter on the assumption that the price of meat would be high but instead it dropped.  This is a practical difficulty about which it is hard to do anything.  The market place dictates the price.  We got such heavy support from the EC last autumn between intervention and aids to private storage that there was a tremendous amount of beef taken in.  A lot of that has been released now so there is not the same demand for cattle as we would have liked.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Is the Minister optimistic with regard to the ongoing negotiations between the EC and the Canadians?  Is the Minister happy that we are promoting and marketing our beef products as vigorously as we could in order to ensure that what happened this year will not happen again?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to comment further on the negotiations and I do not want to create optimism or pessimism.  I am just expressing my concern.  We have indicated that we will take retaliatory action against the Canadians if they do not agree.  With regard to marketing, the meat board was specifically set up to get involved in the marketing of Irish beef, sheep meat and so on.  I am satisfied that they are doing a good job and I do not see why the situation should be changed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that never in our history was there more disarray in the beef business than there has been over the last six months? Will the Minister agree that there must be regulations or else we will have a complete fall off in winter feeding and a consequent fall off in the demand for grain <Col N="312" /> and that that will have serious implications? We must get some regularity into the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is rather alarmist.  The beef industry went through a phase which it often goes through.  To say it is the worst in history is ridiculous.  The situation in 1974 was a great deal worse. From the statistics the lowest price for beef in March, when prices were at their lowest, was 102p per pound.  In the last week or so the price per pound has risen from 107p to 109p per pound and one factory is currently paying 110p per pound.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that the cost of winter fattening of cattle is much higher than the cost of summer grazing?  The Minister said that he could not dictate the situation.  But incentives were available last autumn to take the glut of cattle off summer grazing and surely he could have forseen that if similar incentives were not available in spring we would run into this situation. Can the Minister assure the House that there are no constraints on the chief executive or the members of CBF in promoting livestock marketing here and abroad?  Can the Minister assure the House that the staff and chief executive of CBF have his total support?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputy of that.  I do not interfere with the operations of CBF; the board of CBF make their own decisions.  In relation to winter feeding and summer feeding, the market dictates the price.  It was obvious to many people in the cattle business that prices being paid last autumn were too high.  In view of the additional aids provided from the storage aid scheme it was obvious that there would be a glut of meat and that there was a danger of a price reduction.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture the steps he is taking to ensure that the necessary market supports are implemented quickly so that the current crisis in the Irish beef industry may be speedily resolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>In response to sustained pressure on my part, measures were taken recently by the EC Commission to support the market and these have had the effect of raising the market price of slaughter cattle.  I think that is what I was saying in reply to the previous question.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Is the Minister aware that the effect that he intended has not taken place with regard to the introduction of aids to private storage? Is he happy that the intervention that has been introduced has solved the crisis in the beef industry?  It is a crisis, as has already been outlined today. Would full intervention have solved our problem to a far greater effect than the APS and partial intervention?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, of course full intervention would have improved our marketing situation, but for two reasons this was not allowed by the EC Commission. (1)  The cost to the Commission would have been prohibitive in their view, because you cannot have selective intervention. It must apply to the whole EC <Col N="315" /> and very large sums of money would be involved.  (2) We offered to subtract any intervention that we might get at this time of the year from what we would normally get in the autumn, but they would not agree to that because of the cost of bringing it in at the moment and they were not happy that they could cut back in the autumn.</P>
      <P>I am sure, and the statistics prove, that the aids to private storage scheme has been a big help.  Remember that increased refunds for live cattle were introduced previous to the aids for private storage. I will give a run down on that.  Late in March the export refunds for cattle were increased by £45 a head and then in April we had the aids to private storage which was worth an extra £330 a tonne and, as I said yesterday, that gave a price increase in beef of approximately 5p a lb., maybe a little more, because the price was as low as 102p and now it is as high as 109p or 110p per lb.</P>

Let me point out that from next Monday intervention will be changing from hindquarters to forequarters and that again will give a fairly considerable boost to the cattle trade.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 12 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's policy for increasing cattle numbers and promoting development in the agriculture sector in general was set out in the national economic and social plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, which recognised that the main emphasis for future development in agriculture must be on the beef sector.  To support such development the Government are making a sum of £11 million available in the year commencing 1 January 1986 to increase the headage grants on beef cows under the disadvantaged areas scheme from the present level of £32 to £70 per cow.  This substantial increase provides a worthwhile incentive to producers in the disadvantaged areas, where over three-quarters of beef cow herds in the country are located, to take the appropriate steps to increase beef cow numbers.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that in the 1984 livestock census the total number of cattle was reduced to 6.75 million, the lowest since 1974? Would he agree also that all the indications are of a continuing decline, because we had a 1.8 per cent decrease in calf numbers or 44,000 in-calf heifers fewer? Would he not agree that in those figures everything points to a continuing decline in cattle numbers over the next year?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister stated that three-quarters of the beef cow herds in the country were located in the disadvantaged areas.  That in itself does not indicate the number of beef cows in the national herd.  Has he any figures for the number of beef cow herds on his file?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not got the figure for that on the file.  I appreciate the point the Deputy makes and what he says is true and I would not argue with it.  Going back to Deputy Leonard's question, I am not avoiding the fact that there was a slight decrease last year in the overall number of cattle in the country in comparison with 1983.  The numbers last year fell 0.2 per cent from 6,770,000 to 6,760,000, a very minor drop, but nevertheless it was a drop.  The Deputy is right, but it is still an increase over 1982 and 1981.</P>

You do not grow cows; you grow heifers at first and they grow into cows.  Where is the Minister to get the extra numbers? Will he explain?</P>

      <P>I would dearly love to do that but to get the money is another day's work.  I do not see a great possibility of getting it, because £11 million is a great deal of extra money to get.  Let me point out in respect of the number of cows in the country that, whereas the cattle numbers have fluctuated slightly, there has been a constant increase in the number of cows and the number of cows in the country in 1984 was higher than the number in any previous year in recent times.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going to argue the figures the Deputy has given about the Iberian Peninsula because I do not have figures before me, but my information is that the structure of the Spanish sheep production is such that the potential for Spanish lamb exports making serious inroads into the French market, which is the principal market, are extremely limited.  Only 10 per cent of Spanish lamb is suitable for that market but that 10 per cent is consumed in Spain.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The slaughtering capacity available to the sheepmeat industry is more than adequate for current requirements and the question of making greater use of this capacity is primarily one for the individual factory proprietors.  In fact, slaughterings at export factories in 1984 showed an increase of some 11 per cent over 1983.</P>
      <P>While the market situation for sheepmeat has been difficult recently, efforts to relieve the situation are being made in the current negotiations in the Council of Ministers.  There is also a need for further improvement in the quality of Irish lamb to meet the high standards required by our main export markets.</P>

If anything happened to our two customers the Irish sheep industry would be thrown into jeopardy.  The fewer people there are in the industry the greater the chance that the market will become depressed.  Would the Minister agree that lambs this year are making at least £10 to £20 less than they were this time last year?

      <P>Almost 50 per cent of our sheep production is consumed at home and the French consume the other 50 per cent.  We have no other outstanding exports.  The Belgians take a very small percentage of our sheep compared with the French.  We really have only one customer abroad, and that is France.  We have a difficulty on the French market at present and I would not like to underestimate it.  British ewe meat is being sold on the French market at a very low price and this is causing considerable difficulty for our trade.  As I said, talks are taking place at present in the Council of Ministers and we are objecting very vigorously to this cheap ewe meat being allowed on to the French market.  A great deal of this meat is of very good quality, we probably would not describe it as ewe meat but as something a lot better.  The British have support systems which are giving rise to problems for our sheep industry, but there are other factors involved.  With the recession there is a resistance to buying lamb because it is a pricy item.  Far too much of our lamb is fat and unacceptable to the French consumer and therefore is not fetching a premium price.  Until we can get the correct quality of lamb we will have serious difficulties on the French market.</P>

I have repeatedly made my displeasure known about this trend and I have asked ACOT and An Foras Talúntais to do everything possible to see that the quality is improved and they are working very hard in that direction.  I suggest that they establish transmission farms in every county in an effort to emphasise to producers how essential it is to have the leanest lamb which will sell abroad.  This morning I attended the Spring Show and spent a considerable time at the sheep section. I made my views known to the people present.  There is a very keen awareness in the industry that what we were doing in the past was not good enough and people are trying very hard to improve the situation.  As regards exports, the market dictates the trend.  We will do everything we can through CBF and any other agency to help, but the quality determines the situation at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>It is not just selling policy &mdash; it is also a matter of breeding policy. I have repeatedly raised the matter with ACOT and An Foras Talúntais and they have shown a very keen interest in improving the breeding quality.  It is a matter of good breeding policies together with good marketing policies.  Very often farmers hold on to lamb too long until it becomes heavy and fat and it is not sold at the opportune moment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is, no doubt, a very honourable viewpoint but I would point out that the butter is eventually sold, maybe at half price, to countries such as the Soviet Union and other places in the Eastern Bloc, the Middle East and the Caribbean.  If it were not sold, even at half price, financing of the Community and in particular the common agricultural <Col N="325" /> policy would be seriously undermined. That should be borne in mind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Mr. Deasy Mr. Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied but I am reasonably happy.  Our problem is that we are not producing the type of products that sell freely on the open market.  I have repeatedly stated the need for diversification. We are producing huge amounts of butter and skimmed milk powder which are not readily saleable.  There is a vast world surplus of these commodities.  We need a whole variety of cheeses, yogurts and other dairy products.  We are producing less cheese to day than 12 or 13 years ago.  That is a very unfortunate situation. I am not satisfied with the situation that pertains in the market place.  As regards intervention, we are lucky it is available because otherwise we would not be able to sell what we are producing.  We would be able to sell some of it but not all.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 are related.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>What we are seeking to do in these two amendments, Nos. 22 and 23, is to substitute a new rate of 45 per cent for the rate of 48 per cent proposed in the Finance Bill.  Deputies are aware that the Finance Bill will now propose three rates for income tax: 35 per cent, which is the standard rate and which is on the first £4,500 of taxable income; 48 per cent, which will be applicable to the next £2,800 after the first £4,500; and a rate of 60 per cent, which will be applicable to the remainder of the income.  In this current year the Minister proposes to have these three income rates &mdash; 35 per cent, 48 per cent and 60 per cent.</P>
      <P>On this side of the House we are very conscious of the fact that to interfere at all with income tax rates is a very expensive matter.  The smallest changes can be very expensive indeed.  For instance, we would very much like to reduce that 35 per cent to 25 per cent. We are not, perhaps, terribly concerned with the 60 per cent, although I suppose ultimately everybody would like to see it coming down too.  To change the 35 per cent would be enormously expensive. Perhaps the Minister would give us the figure of the cost that would be involved in reducing it from 35 per cent to 25 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At this stage I should remind the House that Fine Gael and the present Taoiseach fought an election on the basis of introducing a standard rate of 25 per cent.  In one of their election campaigns in the past few years they solemnly promised that, if elected, they would make 25 per cent the standard rate.  That is a Fine Gael promise which has gone the way of so many other Fine Gael election promises. Deputies will also recall that, in the general election campaign in the summer of 1981, Fine Gael also promised to give every housewife £9.60 into her hand as soon as they were elected to office.  That promise was also forgotten as soon as they got into office.  That is the history of at least two specific electoral promises on taxation by Fine Gael.  I <Col N="372" /> suppose there is not much point in talking about them now.</P>
    <P>It is in that context that we want to propose this reduction in the middle band, as it were, from 48 per cent to 45 per cent.  A party with such a history of promises about taxation should be very responsive to this proposal on our part. This 48 per cent from the point of view of the majority of taxpayers is a very aggravating figure.  For the PAYE sector it is a rate which is very penal indeed.  We would like to reduce it to 35 per cent or 40 per cent, but we are very conscious of the state of the Exchequer and the enormous borrowing which the Minister for Finance has undertaken this year and last year in order to balance the national accounts.  We are very conscious of the fact that this Minister for Finance has borrowed more at home and abroad, relatively speaking, than any of his predecessors. In fact, if he were to last his full term in office and keep on at the rate he is going, he would have borrowed more than all his predecessors put together.</P>
    <P>We are conscious of that background to this Finance Bill.  Therefore, we do not want to put forward proposals which would have very serious repercussions on the Exchequer position, much as we would like to.  It would be very attractive to us to be able to put forward proposals which would reduce considerably the burden on the PAYE sector.  That is what Fine Gael did time and time again in this House when they were in Opposition. We are a bit more responsible than that.</P>
    <P>We decided on this aspect of the Finance Bill to confine ourselves to a very restricted, limited proposal and within this pretty key central range to ask the Minister to reduce the rate from 48 per cent to 45 per cent.  Our information is that that reduction would cost the Exchequer £18 million this year in tax.  I do not think that is a figure which the Minister need shy away from.  Some of the things he is proposing this year are costing a great deal more than that.  This is one reform, one amendment to what the Minister proposes which would be infinitely preferable to some of the other things he is doing, and which he should <Col N="373" /> substitute for some of the other things he is doing, if he cannot take aboard an extra £18 million of loss of revenue.</P>
    <P>I have a feeling that, if he were to reduce this rate, it would very soon be self-financing.  The Minister is aware, as everyone else is aware, of the fact that returns from income tax in the first quarter of the year were substantially down on estimates.  The Exchequer returns which we have been getting do not show that there has been any great improvement in that position since.  It is obvious that the rates which the Minister is implementing at present are having an unnaturally depressing effect on incomes.  In a long, long time there has not been a falling off of the sort that is occurring this year in returns from income tax.</P>
    <P>As far as we can interpret it on this side of the House, that falling off in income tax returns is not due, as the Minister would probably like to suggest, to some anomalies or some exceptional features.  It is mirrored by a falling off in the returns from the 1 per cent income levy, which, incidently, we will be opposing later on.  We will be opposing the maintenance this year of this 1 per cent income levy.  The same reduction which is taking place in the returns from income tax is also evident in the returns from that employment levy.  Therefore, it seems fairly clear that the outcome of this Government's general economic and financial policies is to depress the level of economic activity to the point where income are being seriously depressed. That is reflected in the returns both from income tax and from the employment levy at this stage in the year.</P>
    <P>From the point of view of returns to the Exchequer, what we are proposing in regard to the 48 per cent band is not a black and white issue.  The cost of our proposal is estimated at £18 million for this year but having regard to the fact that we are in a diminishing returns situation in so far as income tax is concerned, we need not necessarily accept that the cost of our amendment would be a full <Col N="374" /> £18 million.  My instinct tells me that the buoyant effect of a reduction in the rate, if that reduction were to be effected at this stage, would be considerable and that we could possibly anticipate it making up for a fair proportion of the £18 million which, on paper, our amendment would cost.</P>
    <P>We are putting this proposal very specifically to the Minister.  If any concession can be made, the place to make it is in regard to the 48 per cent band because the operation of that rate is pressing most heavily on the PAYE sector.  It is resulting in practically no alleviation of the tax burden on this sector.  The reduction to 45 per cent would be very welcome in so far as the hard pressed PAYE sector are concerned having regard to the point in the income structure at which the rate operates.  In amendment No. 21 The Worker's Party propose that the 48 per cent rate be abolished and that a new rate of about 45 per cent be substituted. Therefore I presume that The Worker's Party will support us in this amendment. One would expect, too, that the Labour Party would be inclined to support our amendment purporting as they do to represent the working population, the trade union sector and those who are at present being particularly hit by the rates of PAYE.  However, it would be too much to expect that the present Labour Party would show sufficient spunk to support an amendment of this kind, one which would be in alleviation of trade unionists generally.</P>
    <P>What we are proposing could be done, perhaps more as a gesture than anything else.  At a cost of £18 million it would not have any significant across-the-board impact but it would indicate to the PAYE sector that we on this side of the House recognise that the rates are too high, that they are oppressive and are beginning to give effect to diminishing returns.  Our income tax rates are so high that they are counter productive.  We on this side of the House have been advocating constantly the theory that if rates were reduced very quickly there would be an increase in returns to the Exchequer which would more than compensate for <Col N="375" /> the immediate loss of revenue.

      <P>I realise that but if you were sitting on the benches across the House at this time I would be appealing to you to support our amendment since you come here with the support of trade unionists and of the PAYE sector.  Our amendment is not outrageous.  It is a reasonable amendment.  In the normal course of events it would not throw out of line completely the Minister's calculations. There are some other items in his general budgetary proposals that could be sacrificed in favour of this proposal. We are recommending our amendment very strongly to the Minister because we believe the reduction in the rate would have a very good impact on output and economic activity generally.  It would provide an incentive to people throughout the economic process, an incentive that is very much lacking now.  If we could effect this small amelioration of the PAYE sector, there would be an all round beneficial effect.  The Minister should not regard the cost of £18 million fixed but even if it were to work out to that full extent it would be well worth-while in the present depressed circumstances of the economy and in the present state of national output.  All we are proposing is that for the very important middle sector, the rate of 48 per cent is reduced to 45 per cent for this year.</P>

      <P>At <Col N="376" /> the beginning of his remarks, Deputy Haughey asked what the cost would be of reducing the standard rate from 35 per cent to 25 per cent.  The full year cost is what is of most interest and in 1985 that would be £370 million which, as the Deputy says, is a not inconsiderable sum. On the question of the rate itself, there are a couple of points which I made last evening to Deputy O'Kennedy which seem to have escaped Deputy Haughey's notice as far as the cost of their proposal is concerned.  The amendment before us at the moment would cost about £15.4 million in 1985 and just under £26 million for the full year.  That is information which I gave last evening to Deputy O'Kennedy and not quite the figure about which Deputy Haughey was talking.</P>
      <P>I do not know if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will allow me latitude to go into some of the areas into which Deputy Haughey strayed in the course of his remarks.</P>

      <P>They had to do with some matters which are not entirely germane to the amendment before us.  As far as the first quarter figures are concerned, the Deputy has suggested that he draws an inference, from the first quarter figures, of revenue for the year being behind expectations.  That is a matter on which we have touched in the House on several occasions since the figures were published.  Again, as I said to Deputy O'Kennedy last night, I have no reason at this stage to be other than confident that the overall budgetary figures will be on target, so Deputy Haughey may be assured that that is the conclusion which I have drawn from an examination of the various factors which went into making up the first quarter figures as they turned out and were published.</P>

      <P>As I said two minutes ago and last night, I have no reason to be other than confident that we will keep to the budget targets for this year.</P>
      <P>There was some discussion last night also as to whether the move of which this 48 per cent rate is a part, represents &mdash; as I would claim it does &mdash; considerable progress in the direction of tax reform and could be seen as a move in the direction pointed out by the Commission on Taxation.  Deputy O'Kennedy did not seem to believe that, but I would point out that we now have a three-rate income tax system.  This is the first time that we have had such a system, as opposed to one with a larger number of rates, since the unified tax structure was put together in 1975.  There are very many arguments in favour of moving from the system as it was last year in the direction of a single rate of taxation although there are difficulties about doing it at this point.  I shall not repeat all those arguments.  It is obvious that if we want to move towards that kind of system, the initial part of the process must consist first of reducing the number of rates and then of widening the bands.  That is what we are doing.  It would be a little premature at this point to indicate just how quickly we will go along that path, but I certainly have the intention of moving in that direction and this year's move is a first step.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I also indicated last night the effects of these changes, including the 48 per cent rate and the marginal rates on which people will be paying tax during the course of this year.  Again, I made the point that 25,600 people will move out of liability, 15,400 will move from tax liability into a situation in which they will benefit from marginal relief, 205,000 will move to lower marginal tax rates, 481,000 will remain liable at the same marginal rate as previously and 149,000 taxpayers will be taxed at higher marginal rates but, nevertheless, will have a lower tax bill than they would have without this change, owing to the fact that the allowances have been increased and <Col N="378" /> bigger slices of their income have been taxed at lower rates than was the case up to now.  When we take all these things together, it seems perfectly clear and true to say that this represents a substantial move in terms of reform of the system.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey, in arguing for a 45 per cent tax rate, relies very heavily on the way that particular change would be perceived by taxpayers and I can agree entirely with him.  There is no doubt that a 45 per cent rate, from the taxpayer's point of view, is preferable to a 48 per cent rate.  I am not giving away any secrets or making any momentous declaration in saying that I also would like to have a 45 per cent instead of a 48 per cent tax rate.  However, we must look at these things within the limits of the amount of financial elbow room we have for making changes in the system.  As I pointed out last night, the changes proposed in the Bill, compared with the system as it was before, will cost the Exchequer just over £44 million in 1985 and over £90 million in a full year.  Deputy Haughey is proposing now to add £15.5 million, roughly, to that in 1985.  That kind of figure cannot be accommodated within the budgetary constraints which we have to observe this year and which Deputy Haughey and his colleagues have been very careful to outline in recent weeks.  Curiously enough, they appear to have had a conversion on that matter.</P>
    <P>The extra cost of the proposal could not be contained within the limits we have to work within this year.  I say that with some regret because I can see, just as much as anybody else, that a 45 per cent rate would be less uncongenial than a 48 per cent rate.  Having regard to the fact that the proposals in the Bill itself represent such a major improvement in the structure of the system and have the effects of reducing the marginal rate being paid by large numbers of taxpayers and of reducing the total tax bill for every taxpayer, it seems that what is in the Bill is drafted reasonably well within the framework of our budgetary constraints. As I said last evening, taking all that into consideration I regret to say that I cannot accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Sunday following the budget there was an article in the <i>Sunday Press</i>&mdash; I do not have the exact reference with me and, therefore, I cannot quote from it but I shall have it shortly and will be able to quote it under another section.  In the article written by Brian O'Connor he assumed a 6 per cent rate of inflation for the tax year 1985-86. Assuming a 6 per cent rate, which the Minister admitted last night was his own assumption and that of his Department, Brian O'Connor pointed out that the result of the tax changes in the budget was that real purchasing power would fall.</P>
      <P>I must confess I was somewhat surprised yesterday morning when I saw Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  As Deputy Haughey has pointed out, it proposes an extremely moderate and small change.  Our figures suggest it would cost £18 million and the Minister contends it would cost £26 million.  However, whether it be £18 million or £26 million, in terms of the benefit that could be achieved the cost is relatively small, certainly in the context of the total amount of money being dealt with in the budget. I was surprised Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment was so mild and moderate. In fact, I told the Deputy I thought he was going to extremes of moderation in proposing simply that the 48 per cent rate of income tax be reduced to 45 per cent. If it is the Minister's intention to give consumers more purchasing power, to increase retail sales which have been depressed for the past five or six years and generally to boost the economy, then I am afraid the tax changes he has brought about will result in his being doomed to disappointment in that regard.  A far more radical approach to the income tax system is needed to bring about that result.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has said he cannot accept the very moderate and mild amendment we have proposed because of financial constraints.  Even though this does not answer the question, nevertheless I put it to the Minister that the budgetary and financial constraints under which the Government are labouring are largely of <Col N="380" /> their own making.  A reply to a written question tabled by a Fianna Fáil Deputy elicited the information that this Government have been borrowing an average of £9 million per day since they came to office.  Against that background and against rising interest rates, it is little wonder the Minister feels compelled to come here and to talk about constraints. However, in order to get ourselves out of this situation of increasing taxation, increasing borrowing and further increasing taxation to pay the interest on the increased borrowing we need to break out of the vicious circle at some stage. While I am not suggesting that Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment would, in itself, take us out of that vicious circle, nevertheless it would be a beginning.</P>
    <P>Deputy Haughey mentioned the psychological effect of the 48 per cent rate. Since the new tax-free allowance certificates were issued, many people who were previously in a marginal tax rate of 45 per cent, which means they got the allowance and were then taxed at 45 per cent on their taxable income, are now in the 48 per cent tax bracket.  The psychological effect is quite considerable and this has been pointed out to me by people who have come to me in regard to the matter. I am not saying that all taxpayers who were previously in the 45 per cent rate are now in the 48 per cent rate but many are in that band.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned we are moving in the direction of accepting the recommendations of the Commission on Taxation in that we have now three separate rates of income tax instead of four or five as was the case previously.  We now have only three rates instead of five but I do not see that as having any intrinsic merit in itself.  The Minister seems to assume that to arrive at the situation in respect of income tax as recommended by the commission we will gradually have to reduce the number of rates, that we cannot make the move at once, but I do not accept that for a moment.  We are not talking here of the number of rates of tax but the size of those rates.  If those rates are too high they will have profound economic implications.  Members here <Col N="381" /> who represent ordinary people are well aware of the effects.  In order to make a start to get away from that situation we are proposing this very moderate amendment. It will not be very costly and it will remove the damaging psychological effect of the increase from 45 per cent to 48 per cent on the second band of taxpayers.  In all fairness, the Minister should give serious consideration to the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now clearly understood that we have reached the point of diminishing returns with regard to income tax.  According to my information, in the first four months revenue from income tax is not running as projected. There is much talk about people being better off under the changes proposed but that is not so.  Let us take the case of a married couple, one of whom is working, earning £8,000 and having two children.  An increase of 6 per cent will bring their income to £8,480.  Under the Government proposals they will be £29 worse off.  A person could not go very far on an income of £8,480 when he has to care for two children.  In our amendment we are asking for a very modest concession, of reducing the 48 per cent band to 45 per cent.  The Minister tells us it will cost approximately £15 million.  I presume he has gone to the higher end of the bracket and I have some reservations with regard to that figure.</P>

That was not the case when the party opposite sat on these benches when they put down some very irresponsible amendments.  However, that is another day's work.</P>
      <P>This involves a tiny amount only and, in order to create more purchasing power, I would ask the Minister to give our amendment sympathetic consideration. We should have liked to go much further but we realise that the Exchequer, in its present plight, does not allow much room to manoeuvre.</P>

      <P>Deputies on the other side refer frequently to this concept of diminishing returns and most often misuse that concept.  The situation in relation to income tax, in particular, is one to which that description cannot be applied.  Had Deputy Connolly been listening to his colleague, Deputy O'Kennedy, last evening, he would have realised that Deputy O'Kennedy's contention is not that there is a situation of diminishing returns from income taxation but that we have a situation of increasing returns.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I suggest that they might give it a little thought so that there would be some consistent approach to the matter under discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Connolly referred to the position of a married couple with two children and one spouse earning £8,000.  From the tables we produced with the budget speech it will be seen that a married couple with two children, earning a constant £8,000 this year, will pay £70 less in taxation this year under the system proposed in the Bill than they would have had we made no changes.  Of course one can elaborate on the argument and examine the other factors that enter into it.  If one examines their position, comparing the pre-budget and post-budget positions, taking account of income tax, PRSI and the social welfare child allowance, one will find that the increase in disposable income is a little greater than the reduction in taxation.  Then we come to the nub of the problem.  Quite a number of people will actually have larger tax bills this year than last year because they have an increase in income.  If one indexes the rate bands and allowances in order to keep the real burden of taxation roughly static, and the taxpayer has an increase in total income of approximately the same amount as the rate of inflation, then a couple of things happen.  The taxpayer has a higher tax bill, total tax revenue increases &mdash; if we assume that we are talking about 6 per cent indexation &mdash; the taxpayers' bill goes up by approximately 6 per cent, total tax revenue goes up by approximately 6 per cent and after tax income also goes up by about 6 per cent.  What we provided for in the changes we made this year is the equivalent of a bit more than the indexation, as I pointed out on budget day.  Therefore the taxpayer stands to gain a little extra <Col N="384" /> over and above what he would have gained from indexation from the changes we have made here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy spent a lot of time yesterday claiming that, because he had discerned that there is an increase of just over 8 per cent in the total forecast of tax revenue for this year, that meant that we are taking that much more from each taxpayer, that we are taking a bigger bite out of each taxpayer.  As I have said to Deputy O'Kennedy on a number of occasions, and to some of his colleagues, that totally ignores the fact that the total base of taxation is increasing.  If incomes increase by approximately the rate of inflation, and one indexes the tax system, total tax revenue goes up by 6 per cent. We have done a bit more than indexation so that, on that basis, tax revenue would go up by somewhat less than 8 per cent but there will be more income in the system, subject to taxation, and that gives us the difference between a little less than 6 per cent and the increase in revenue of over 8 per cent which Deputy O'Kennedy rightly pointed out is included in the forecast for this year.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues cannot have it both ways, claiming on the one hand that I am taking a bigger bite out of people's incomes and, on the other, that when they look at the first quarterly returns, I am not going to get all that tax.  The two things do not hang together.  I appreciate that each one may provide the pretext for an argument of circumstance, depending on which point one is making, but to use the two and at the same time to make the same case does not seem to me to be all that sensible.</P>
    <P>Having said all that I go back to where I started.  I would agree with Deputies opposite, and I know that all of my colleagues on this side of the House would agree, that it would be desirable to get that rate down to 45 per cent instead of 48 per cent.  But, given the effects of the very substantial changes we are making in the system &mdash; which represent very real progress this year &mdash; given the overall budgetary constraints, within those limits, what is proposed in <Col N="385" /> the Bill seems to me to be the best use of the available resources that can be put together.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I too have sympathy with members of the PAYE-paying public who continuously carry this high burden of income tax.  There are areas within the system which give rise to difficulties.  In this amendment Deputies opposite seek to maintain a figure of 45 per cent.  Certainly there is a case to be made for that. As the Minister has already pointed out, he is rationalising the rates under the provisions of this Bill.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister what preparations have been made for an overall check on the PAYE certificates that are issued.  The letters applied in the computer system are sometimes in error and PAYE taxpayers find at the end of the year that they have been undercharged or overcharged for tax depending on whether or not they got the correct letter on the PAYE cert issued by the Revenue Commissioners.  In some companies employees have presented tax certs and have been charged&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As Deputy Carey said, it appears that the tax certs relating to the S bracket seem to be incorrect.  The Minister said that people, particularly those in the £8,000 bracket, are better off.  The facts do not bear that out.  I am sure that is a problem that can be sorted out.  A significant number of people are taxed at 48 per cent, especially people who are lucky enough to get overtime. People on a certain income are discouraged from working harder by this tax <Col N="386" /> disincentive.  This does not benefit the economy.  The Minister gave the impression that, due to the changes in the taxation system, the vast majority of taxpayers would benefit.  On the assumption the Minister made that there would be a 6 per cent increase in wages this year, I came to the conclusion that people generally will pay more tax and that only about 5 per cent or 6 per cent of taxpayers would benefit from the changes.  If the tax rate were changed from 48 per cent to 45 per cent it would give benefit to a greater number of people and the benefit to the economy would be greater.  The Minister has given the impression that everybody will benefit from the changes in the tax bands.  He said that the system was simpler, but a simpler system does not necessarily mean it is a fairer system. Will the Minister implement Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment, which is not excessive and which would result in benefit for the country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Carey referred to a series of cases where it appears that the code number at the end of the RSI No. inserted on a tax free allowance form was incorrect.  Some appear to have been incorrect last year and that is creating problems for taxpayers in the calculation of their tax free allowances for this year. These are specific cases which are best dealt with on a case by case basis.  However, the tax table designation for any given taxpayer and the insertion of table allowances are being done on the basis of a computer programme and also on the basis of estimated income for 1985-86. That is the normal procedure.  The intention as far as is possible is to make sure that there is an even deduction of tax throughout the year.  It is not always possible because if there is difference between the estimated income and the actual income as it goes through the year the one gets out of line with the other and that can in some cases present difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as Deputy Ahern's remarks are concerned, all I can say is that Deputy Ahern cannot convince me and would find it hard to convince himself that the situation is other than I have set out.  This <Col N="387" /> year every single taxpayer will pay less tax under our new system than he would have paid had we not changed the system. There is no escaping that fact and there is no denying it.  There is no point in trying to deny it because it would be totally at variance with what we have done.  The effect of the changes is that every taxpayer will have his tax liability reduced below what it would have been otherwise.  I have no doubt that there are numbers of taxpayers who will find that their tax bill this year will be greater than it was last year.  That is the inevitable result of the fact that in most cases there will be an increase in income.  How that impacts on taxation depends on the circumstances of the taxpayer.  These taxpayers, the same as any others, will be paying less tax under the restructured system than they would have paid if we did not restructure the system.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with some of the Minister's figures.  Married people at the middle and upper end of the tax scale will pay £1 or £2 a week more on average.  We can bandy figures around here but everybody knows that PAYE taxpayers will pay more.  The Minister is talking about a tiny minority outside of the tax bands, but the middle income people will pay more.  All the people are saying it.  The Minister cannot beat the public.  The public are a great judge of everything.  They are very intelligent and they will get an opportunity to show that in the near future.</P>

      <P>No, but we will refer to the section, of course.  It all combines. Take a man who was earning £8,000 on 1 January, married with two children.  He got a 6 per cent increase.  I may have confused the Minister somewhat on this with the figures.  I am allowing that a 6 per cent increase on £8,000 gives him £480 more, so that brings him to £8,480. I am only going on the standard, I am not taking in mortgage or anything like <Col N="388" /> that, I am taking the standard allowances, levies and so on.  He will be £29 worse off.  That is my reading of the situation. Take the middle and upper income groups.  I will deal with the middle income group who are the very poor in our society now because they are the targets who have to carry everything.  This is a very modest amendment we have put down.  The people outside are saying that half of their money is going in tax, 48 per cent at any rate.  If you want to get into the mathematics you can say that it is 2 per cent short of 50 per cent.  While the introduction of the three bands is welcome, the people are considering what these bands are.  They are still extremely high and we accept that because the state of the revenue and the Minister's Department with a borrowing capacity of £6,000 a minute put the Government completely off target in their finances after they came into office.  We all know that before they came into office one of their planks in the election had been the basis of taxation. We have seen no new relief on that, so we are back to where we were.  That promise, like the promise of the £9.60 per week to every housewife&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Connolly's point is that even if we agree that a person's after tax income will rise, which the Minister is saying, nevertheless the fall in the value of his after tax income due to inflation will be insufficient to compensate to keep it even at its present level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea is mixing up a few things and not taking enough account of the factors I mentioned.  I said that if a person's income increases in line with the rate of inflation and if at the same time you index tax bands and allowances, not only do you index a person's income and his tax bill but you also index his after tax income.  In that situation you get an increase by the amount of the index increase in tax revenue and you get an increase by the same percentage in after tax income.  You can see it by using the very simplest rule of thumb.  It follows automatically that if everything is being indexed every single component is being indexed.</P>

      <P>The question then arises which I think Deputy Ahern is coming to, whether everybody is getting indexation of wages.  The total base for income tax would increase by more this year than the rate of inflation, so that on the whole people are getting increases in money incomes that go beyond this.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No, because the tax revenue I have forecast and which is included in the budget already takes account of the effects of the tax expenditures that we provided for in the Bill, so that the £15.4 million cost of the amendment that the Deputies are putting forward would be extra.  It would be a further reduction in tax revenue below what is provided for in the budget.  Deputy Connolly referred to the case of the married&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister estimate the wage increase to be 6 per cent? If the wage increases are to be more than 6 per cent and he is going to take in extra revenue he can afford to give that extra by reducing the 48 per cent to 45 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy just did not bother to listen.  I have already taken account of that in the figures.  The forecast for tax revenue already includes the effects of what the Deputy is talking about, so that the amendment the Deputy is talking about already takes a view of what the change in incomes is going to be.  The amendment being proposed by the Deputies would be a net reduction in tax revenue below the figure we have forecast.</P>
      <P>Deputy Connolly talked about the £8,000 income earner with spouse working and two children.  I cannot see the relevance of that case to the amendment we are talking about because that person stays in the 35 per cent tax rate anyway.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>But we must allow for <Col N="391" /> a 6 per cent increase plus the inflation. The Minister did not follow me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the calculation checked again.  That taxpayer who gets an increase of 6 per cent this year to bring it to £8,480 still stays in the 35 per cent bracket.  He is not affected by the 48 per cent rate.  His increase in gross income is £480; his increase in income after tax is £382.  Had we not changed the system his after tax increase in income would have been £312.  Therefore he has gained £70 out of the transaction by comparison with what would have been the case had we not made the change.  The other point I made is that there is an increase of £382 after tax out of his increase of £480.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may use a rule of thumb but the people use the rule of the wage packet.  That is not coming across.  This is a very modest amendment. It was difficult for the Minister to calculate early in the year what the wage increases would be because the Minister for the Public Service agreed to a 6 per cent increase.  Some semi-State bodies got 8½ per cent increases which will mean more tax for the Minister and many private industries have reached agreement on pay increases way above 6 per cent. This too will mean extra tax for the Minister. I accept the reason for the early agreements in the public sector pay negotiations, but you are sticking to a hard line.  If I am not reading the situation correctly, and most financial commentators agreed you were digging your heels in as far as a 6 per cent increase was concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am doing that.  We are <Col N="392" /> talking about a buoyancy in revenue to make up this £15 million. My interpretation of the Government's announcements &mdash;&mdash; very crude announcements &mdash; in regard to pay was that first they agreed to 3 per cent, then 5 per cent and finally 6 per cent but now some semi-State companies have agreed to settlements of 8½ per cent.  I maintain that this figure, which is above the Minister's projected increase, will yield extra tax for the Exchequer.  I am not sure if the Minister was aware that these higher increases were being agreed; perhaps he told the semi-State companies in private that they could grant these increases if it appeared that the employees were taking to the road.  Only the Minister and the Government can say if that is so.  As far as I can see the Minister now has room to manoeuvre and many commentators and financial correspondents agree with me.  We have given this matter very serious consideration and ask the Minister to accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I do not want to get into that area because the Ceann Comhairle could rule me out of order, but I will deal with that later.  Unemployment may be the underlying cause and if it is maybe the Minister would let me know.  I know the Government have under-projected the unemployment figure but I will not get into that subject at this time.  I will <Col N="393" /> deal with it later.  When the Finance Bill was prepared many of these pay increases were not confirmed.  The Minister must have some leeway since some of the semi-State and private organisations gave increases from 8½ per cent to 10 per cent.</P>

If they could make up their minds what they want to believe, we could have a discussion about it, but since they cannot make up their minds, this is a factor I will leave out of my considerations at the moment.  I was unable to resist the opportunity to say that.</P>
      <P>If it is any consolation to Deputy Connolly I thought very carefully about the 48 per cent rate and I can assure Deputies that the 45 per cent rate was very much a part of my consideration of the matter. Before we drew up the budget the Government and I came to the conclusion that the rate would be 48 per cent which represents substantial progress in the structure of the system.  I have found no sufficient reason to depart from that, particularly given all the factors I mentioned in my four interventions in this debate so far.</P>

      <P>That would be a highly speculative exercise which would not serve any useful purpose.  Deputies opposite have been seduced for some time past by the notion that there exists an animal called the &ldquo;self-financing tax cut&rdquo;. Deputy Haughey referred to it earlier. He seems to believe it would produce such a rapid reaction that we would more than make up the revenue difference in one year.  I do not accept that and I would not see any point in going down the hypothetical by-road mentioned by the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Deputies may well ask about spirits and I will be happy to tell them what I have already told the House on several occasions.  I reckon that the change in spirits duty reduced excise revenue by about £9 million for the short part of last year for which it was in force. I expect that we may by the end of this year get back to a position where revenue will be restored.  It might take a little longer.  That is the best example, the nearest thing to the kind of creature Deputies opposite keep chasing.  It takes time.  In that case I think it will take a bit <Col N="395" /> more than a year and in all the other cases where the elasticities are totally different and much less favourable it would take considerably longer.</P>

      <P>I wish to refer to the Public Service pay award of 6 per cent earlier in the year.  There has been a lead off of 8.5 per cent recently.  I do not begrudge it because those people work hard for their living.  There will now be other pay settlements in the public sector following this lead off &mdash; when one gets it the others follow.  There is every reason to believe that the increase in the public sector will be in excess of 6.2 per cent. However, taking a figure of 6.2 per cent across the board, would it be true to say that our amendment would not cost anything at all?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it would serve any useful purpose to estimate either what the total wage increase would have to be or the total in the public sector in order to produce £15.4 million extra revenue to compensate for the cost of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's back-up service should be able to provide computerisation in this regard.  I am talking about a mere 6.2 per cent which would bring the base down to 45 per cent.  I am sure Members would approve of this because it would create more purchasing power.  This affects everybody who is lucky enough to have a job.  Deputy O'Dea and Deputy Ahern dealt with this in a most constructive way and pointed out that if it was a 6.2 per cent wage increase across the board it would cost the Exchequer nothing.  Some people think that the wage increase will be substantially more than 6.2 per cent and, if <Col N="396" /> that is the case, not alone will it cost £15 million but the Minister will take in even more on the figures he projected.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said before, it is a hypothetical question.  In addition, doing that kind of calculation in public would not be particularly helpful for the course of public expenditure or industrial relations. However, we built into the budget figures the expected cost this year of the changes made in relation to public service pay on the expenditure side.  As Deputy Ahern said, we included a sum of £50 million for revenue buoyancy which, among other things, took account of the effects on revenue of the changes made on budget day, including public sector pay.  All that is already taken into account in the revenue and expenditure projections on which we are working and against which we are measuring the course of revenue and expenditure, quarter by quarter, as the year goes on. Therefore, the amendment proposed by the Deputies would reduce tax revenue below a figure which already takes account of the factors that were known when we put the budget projections together.</P>
      <P>If the Deputy were to ask what other trends in the economy would be required to produce an extra £15.4 million, I could not answer because there are a whole series of things which might produce that. However, having looked at the first quarter's returns and at the trends in a number of factors, I have come to the conclusion that, broadly speaking, we will be on target as far as the budget figures are concerned for this year.  The amendment the Deputies are proposing would reduce tax revenue by £15.4 million below a kind of point that we need to reach in order to keep the budget figures on target.</P>

      <P>His reference to our attitude on public service pay implies that <Col N="397" /> we are in favour of very high wage increases in the public sector but nothing could be further from the truth.  Indeed, I do not know why he mentioned it as we only wish to take account of reality. Labour is one of the primary factors of production and its cost must affect the competitiveness of the goods and services produced here.  For that reason, the cost of labour should be kept as low as possible, particularly in the present economic circumstances.  Deputy Connolly pointed out that some workers received an increase of 8½ per cent and that negotiations are starting in many other cases. However, the Minister is sticking rigidly to a projected wage increase figure of 6 per cent although there is more than an even chance that it will be more than that figure.  If it went as high as even 6.2 per cent, our amendment would, in effect, cost nothing and we could gain from it in terms of the psychological impact of a reduction in the 48 per cent rate to 45 per cent and also in terms of the other beneficial factors which Deputy Haughey outlined at great length this afternoon.</P>

      <P>In the budget the Minister allowed for a wage increase of a certain limit but that has now gone by the board.  We have always agreed with arbitration and we have been very responsible in that regard.  However, recent increases had to have the approval of the Government and the Minister. Bord na Móna workers are the hardest working semi-State employees in the country and they received an increase of 8½ per cent as recommended by the Labour Court.  We fully accept that they were entitled to that but the award exceeded the guidelines laid down by the Government.  I am sure the Minister will correct me if I am wrong but my information is that the Minister for Energy gave the go ahead for this award by telephone. When you open the gate a lot more follows. That is what I call the base rate. Many more are under negotiation.</P>

It would balance out, given the projected figures. The PAYE sector could be given a boost. I spoke earlier about the middle income group who are carrying many burdens and are now known as the new poor.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputies opposite only like to see one side of the simple arithmetic.  There are two other things to <Col N="400" /> be remembered.  If wage rates in either the public or private sector increase by more than they think they will, that could bring about some costs on the expenditure side.  There is not an unambiguous gain in terms of tax revenue and balance in the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Deputies referred to some specific wage changes.  There are other areas where wage changes are less than the ones they spoke about.  The effect this year of the public service 6 per cent is not a net 6 per cent increase in the level this year over last year.  This year it turns into 4½ per cent looking at the extra effect through the year.  If the Deputies are relying on factors like that to find a reason for claiming that this amendment would produce a self-financing tax cut they are on very shaky ground.  There is no foundation for it.</P>
      <P>The broad estimate I have given of the extra cost of their amendment this year is one which has been reliably calculated taking account of all factors.  There are good reasons for putting this amendment down but the question is: can we afford it within the parameters of the budget this year?  My answer is &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Perhaps by calling a quorum, we will put manners on those who are creating the noise.  The reasoning behind the amendment is that it is no less costly for widows or single parents with children to live than it is for two-parent families.  All must meet mortgage repayments and pay the same prices for food and clothes for themselves and their children.  The same applies to school fees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It can be argued that there are very many extra expenses involved for the <Col N="404" /> single parent family because a parent in such circumstances who is working may very often have to engage a housekeeper or someone to clean the house or may have to make special arrangements for children to be taken to school.  Therefore, in many cases it is more expensive for the single parent family to survive.</P>
    <P>In previous years the Minister, as was the case also with his predecessor, argued that there was a constitutional obstacle to providing for these double bands for this category of taxpayer.  During last year's debate on a similar amendment, Deputy O'Kennedy as spokesman for the main Opposition pointed out that in his view the interpretation that the proposal would be unconstitutional was incorrect. I quote from column 196 of the Official Report for 3 May 1984.  Deputy O'Kennedy said:</P>
    <P>...I was a Minister in government when the Murphy decision was made. It was to apply the same allowances to a married couple, both of them earning outside the home, as if they were two single people earning.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy was giving his interpretation of the Murphy case.  He is a lawyer and I am not, so I cannot say if his interpretation is correct but I would assume that at least the Minister will have checked out that statement of the Deputy's and will be able to indicate whether previous interpretations of the Murphy case in terms of blocking this proposal are correct.</P>
    <P>I would draw the Minister's attention also to section 4 of this year's Bill and my reason for doing so is that last year in his opposition to an amendment similar to the one before us, the Minister implied that if he were to provide for double tax bands, his action could be construed by the courts as being in some way inimical to family life.  The reference is to providing additional allowances for widows and <Col N="405" /> others in respect of children.  Section 4(2) of the current Finance Act says: these special allowances which are being allocated to widows and others will only be paid &ldquo;provided that this section shall not apply for any year of assessment in the case of a husband or wife where the wife is living with her husband and in the case of a man and woman who are living together as man and wife&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Surely the Minister cannot argue that providing double tax bands to widows, widowers and single parents is inimical to the Constitution and the keeping together of families if, on the other hand, he is providing in this year's Finance Bill that special allowances will be paid to widows or widowers providing they are living alone, provided husband and wife are not living together or a man and woman are not living together as man and wife?  There is a contradiction here and I am anxious to hear the Minister's explanation of how that section&mdash;and presumably he must have checked it with his legal advisers&mdash;is in order and not contrary to the Constitution or inimical to the family, if the amendment we are proposing is out of order as far as he is concerned.</P>
    <P>As I said previously, it may very well be that the wording of our amendment is not perfect.  However, if the Minister were to concede that there is justice in argument, then it is up to him to come forward with wording which would have the same effect and would alleviate considerable hardship on widows, widowers and single parents who are working and paying tax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment before us proposes to extend the double rate bands which are applicable to married persons to single and widowed parents.  One of the consequences of doing this would be that married couples with children, where each spouse had an income, would find it vastly more to their advantage to be assessed for tax as single persons under section 193 of the Income Tax Act of 1967 than to be assessed in any other way. If each spouse accepted responsibility for one or more of the children they would then obtain the benefit of two sets of increased rate bands compared with a married couple who would have either one source of income or who are jointly charged for tax in respect of joint incomes under section 194 of the Act.</P>
      <P>If the wording of the amendment were altered in order to prevent married couples from claiming two sets of increased rate bands, that measure could be regarded as being repugnant to the Constitution on the grounds that it was inimical to the institution of marriage following on the court decision in the Murphy case.  For example, where a widow and a widower, both with children, wished to marry, with that proposed change they would be discouraged from doing so by the fact that as a married couple they would be entitled to only one set of double rate bands or two sets of single rate bands as single persons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under that amendment a man and woman living together who have care of children would be accorded two sets of increased rate bands rather than two sets of single bands.  Quite apart from the constitutional implications, it would clearly give rise, as I said during the course of the debate last year, to a link problem situation which under the wording of the amendment would be absolutely impossible to stop.  The amendment is technically defective in that it proposes to alter section 8 of the Finance Act, 1980, which has been overtaken by section 2 of the Finance Act of 1984.  That <Col N="407" /> is a minor and technical matter.  The fundamental aspects are those which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>For those reasons, I shall not accept the amendment.  I fully appreciate that in many cases there is a problem.  Deputy De Rossa in this case is choosing the wrong way to go about dealing with that problem.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Very briefly, while I understand the points the Minister has made, perhaps we would be more inclined to support this amendment if Deputy De Rossa were to confine it to widows and widowers rather than bringing in single parents.  From my own recollection and interpretation of the Murphy case, the Minister could bring in legislation to prevent some of the anomalies he mentioned in relation to widows and widowers.  However, it would constitutionally be very difficult for him to do so in relation to single parents.  Perhaps Deputy De Rossa would give further thought to bringing in an amendment, perhaps on Report Stage, and confining this to people whose spouses are deceased.</P>

      <P>As I have already indicated, the purpose of our amendment is to achieve some relief for persons who have care of children on their own, whether it be a man or woman, whether their children be the result of a marriage or whether they be unmarried.  I have no allegiance to the wording of this amendment.  I am not a lawyer or a parliamentary draftsman.  I am in the hands of the Minister as far as going about it the right way is concerned, since he indicates that we are perhaps going about it in the wrong way.  Could he indicate what he considers to be the right way of going about it and when to adopt those means to achieve the relief about which I am speaking?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not keen on leaving out single parents&mdash;the unmarried parents, if you like&mdash;who have children.  These people have the same problems in relation to the rearing of their families as have married couples.  Indeed, in many circumstances <Col N="408" /> they have more expenses because of their circumstances.</P>
    <P>The Minister and Deputy O'Dea referred to the Murphy case and the constitutional difficulties which arise.  As I understand it, the Murphy case referred to married couples who were working and being paid for work outside the home and who were being discriminated against because only one of them was entitled to qualify for allowances.  The decision of the case in the High Court was that they were both entitled to single allowances.</P>
    <P>The people about whom we are talking here are single people, either as a result of a death of a spouse or of never having married.  Perhaps in my ignorance of the law, I cannot see how giving double tax bands to people who effectively are not married can be inimical to family life.  It is also difficult to see why it is not possible for the Department of Finance to devise a means whereby the abuses to which the Minister referred&mdash;in other words, widows and widowers wishing to marry and claiming four times the bands&mdash; would arise.  There are likely to be abuses of any system which is brought in.  All Government Departments are adept at rules and regulations to exclude this, that and the other abuse.  I cannot see why it is beyond the competence of the Minister and his Department to devise a system to achieve the effect we are looking for in our amendment.  The Minister has indicated we may be choosing the wrong way to go about it.  We freely admit we may be choosing the wrong way and we would welcome enlightenment as to what is the right way.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate what that is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Murphy judgment dealt only with tax bands, not with allowances.  I think it would probably be unconstitutional to deal with single parents in this context.  The matter is quite complicated in view of the court's judgment.  I have considerable sympathy for the Deputy in regard to the amendment. Perhaps he should give consideration to allowances for widows and put down an appropriate amendment on Report State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have here the conclusion of the judgment of the Supreme Court in the Murphy case.  The concluding paragraph reads as follows:</P>
      <P>The court accepts the proposition that the State has conferred many revenue, social and other advantages and privileges on married couples and their children.  Nevertheless, the nature and potentially progressive extent of the burden created by section 192 of the Act of 1967 is such that, in the opinion of the court, it is a breach of the pledge by the State to guard with special care the institution of marriage and to protect it against attack.  Such a breach is, in the view of the court, not compensated for or justified by such advantages and privileges.  The court will, accordingly, declare that sections 192-98 inclusive of the Act of 1967 in so far as these sections provide for the aggregation of the earned incomes of married couples are repugnant to the Constitution</P>
      <P>While that states fairly clearly what the court wanted to state, there are some of us&mdash;I am not a lawyer myself&mdash;who are left wondering just how far we have to interpret that and how far we can go without running the risk of the censure of the court in the terms in which it gave that decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The court objected to provisions in the Income Tax Acts which produced a situation in which a married couple paid more tax than two unmarried persons with comparable incomes.  The amendment put forward by the Deputy would create that situation again and, for that reason, I am not able to accept it.  The Deputy has also asked me to state what is the right way of solving this problem, if this is not the right way.  I would like to be in a position to give him an answer. <Col N="410" /> However, many people other than myself have tried to find a way to answer that problem but have not yet found it.  What I can say is that the way of dealing with it is not within the scope of this Finance Bill.  It would require action along a number of different lines.</P>
    <P>I conclude with the observation that tax law operates within the framework of our customs, beliefs and our general approach to the way we want society to be organised.  If we want to change the way society is organised, I do not believe the tax law is the right tool to use.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say I am disappointed because I thought we were going to get an indication of the right way.  I appreciate there are difficulties.  I do not know if it was by oversight or if it was deliberate but I am pleased the Minister has not said it is not possibly because of the cost.  I understand that last year the cost was between £3 million and £4 million and that simply covered widows, widowers and single parents. Presumably the door is open and perhaps the Minister will take the matter on board in the coming six or seven months when he is considering his next budget.  Perhaps he will ensure that some steps are taken to rectify what is a grave injustice to the people with whom we are trying to deal in the amendment.  However, I think the amendment should be pressed, simply to make the point that there is need for change and urgent need for the Minister to take some action on it.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes to increase the personal allowance, in addition to increases already provided for in the Bill, by £200 for a married couple and £100 for widowed and single persons. The cost of the changes advocated in the amendment would be £28.3 million in 1985 and £47.2 million in a full year. I notice &mdash; particularly after, I think, Deputy O'Dea's remarks on the last amendment &mdash; that Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues did not seem to be proposing a corresponding increase in the single parent allowance provided for under section 4 of the Bill.  If that were to be added the total cost would be £28.6 million in 1985 and approximately £47.7 million in a full year.  I would have to say on this, as indeed on some of the other matters we discussed earlier, that the budget proposals, as they have been put forward, in combination with the other tax changes, represent the maximum we can fit in this year within the framework of the budgetary constraints on us.  I might point out that the total cost of my proposals in this Bill, taken all together, would be £113.8 million this year and just under £190 million in a full year.  I regret to say that to add almost £30 million this year and approximately £48 million in a full year to the cost of that is far and away beyond what we could cope with given the constraints we have at present.</P>

      <Col N="412" /> In reply to me last evening and again today the Minister admitted that the expected rate of inflation for the period to be covered by the provisions of this Bill will be 6 per cent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it would be less than 6 per cent for this year and approximately 5½ per cent next year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that is the Minister's expectation because the increases the Minister is proposing in the married and single allowance come to less than 6 per cent; according to my quick calculations they amount to approximately 5½ per cent.  The Government appear to be marking time.  Even on the Minister's own admission, if he happens to be right &mdash;and I think most economic commentators do not agree with his projections&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I could quote a few who think the Minister's figures are on the low side also.  Even if they are correct the Government are just marking time, not giving any relief to the hard pressed PAYE sector.  I notice that the increase in the widow's or widower's allowance will amount to just over 4 per cent.  The attitude of the Government appears to be weighted heavily against unfortunate widows and widowers.  Perhaps Deputy De Rossa will have something to say about that.  The Minister has mentioned that the inflation figures will be something less than 6 per cent.  Could he give some thought to ensuring that the rises in taxfree allowance will at least match inflation, leaving a reasonable margin for error.  Can he adjust the situation in relation to widows and widowers, at least bringing their increase into line with those given to single and married persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As we have set out in the national plan, it is our intention to adjust rate bands and allowances each year in order to ensure that the real burden of taxation of income tax payers does not <Col N="413" /> increase.  What we have provided in this year's budget and in this Bill matches up to that fully.  The total effect of the changes in the income tax structure, and in the rates and bands of allowances, come to more than the effect of indexation this year.  The Deputy need have no worries whatsoever.  We are keeping fully in line with that commitment and intend to continue doing so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For the past three years we have heard much about the taxation system, how the Minister will change it to render it more efficient, reliable and make people better off.  We heard it again approximately four months ago, that this budget would bear goodies for all of the PAYE sector as well as those assessed under schedule D. But when we see what has emerged then we realise that the promises do not live up to the reality.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Dea has said, the increase for a married man is 5.5 per cent whereas a widow or widower receives an increase of 4.35 per cent.  Why does a widowed person receive an increase of only 4.35 per cent?  It seems strange that they should be singled out to receive less than the rest of us.</P>
      <P>I would request the Minister to reexamine our figures.  The amendment put down by Deputy O'Kennedy is quite reasonable.  The Minister talks about a 6 per cent projected inflation rate.  Why then does he not meet the 6 per cent inflation rate in the increases in personal allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Our intention, as set out in the national plan, was to adjust tax bands and allowances each year in order to bring about the results I mentioned. Of course there is a judgment to be made on each occasion as to what balance one strikes between changes in allowances, on the one hand, and changes in bands, on the other.  In a sense this year we decided to attach particular importance to changes in the structure of the rates and associated changes in the bands.  In itself that had a very significant influence on the question of the balance as between allowances and bands.  The total of the <Col N="414" /> two amounts to more than the effect of indexation.  We maintain a situation in which widowed persons with children get the same aggregate allowances as a married couple.  It is important that we should do so.  It is in that light that Deputies should look at the changes in each specific head of allowance.  We get to the situation in which a widowed person with children receives the same aggregate allowances as a person whose spouse is still living.</P>
      <P>I might point out to Deputies that one that has not been mentioned at all is the allowance available in respect of a housekeeper taking care of an incapacitated spouse which this year is being increased from £2,000 to £2,500.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I was afraid it might not get into the record.  I just mention that that allowance is being increased by 25 per cent.</P>
      <P>The allowance under section 11 of the 1971 Finance Act for a blind person is being increased from £500 to £600. Again, lest Deputies opposite might neglect to mention it, that is an increase of 20 per cent.  And in cases where both spouses are blind there is an increase of £200 which represents 16.6 per cent, just in case the House might get the idea that all the percentages are in low, single figures.</P>

      <P>I am reverting to the situation of a single person earning £12,000 on 1 January last.  That person received a 6 per cent increase giving him £720 extra, rendering his total gross income £12,720.  Without allowing for a house mortgage or anything like that and assuming that the projected inflation rate is 6 per cent, that person will be £80 worse off.  I can appreciate that it is difficult for the Minister to project an inflation rate of 6 per cent for this year as that will depend on price increases, the economy and the financial climate.  However, I will not dispute the 6 per cent figure given by the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 5 April last, the people have been <Col N="415" /> saying that this is not as rosy as it looked. A single person with a gross wage of £12,000 per annum on 1 January getting a 6 per cent increase, would take home £12,720.  Allowing for tax levies and standard deductions and allowing for 6 per cent inflation that person will be worse off.  In our amendment we are attempting to give him some kind of relief.  The middle income group are being hammered by taxation.</P>
    <P>Nearly every PAYE worker today uses transport to get to work whether it be private or public transport and the cost of transport has increased savagely. Petrol has gone up by 12p a gallon and diesel by 9p a gallon.  Costs are rising continually and people are lucky to have jobs.  Another area where costs have increased dramatically is in the area of motor car insurance.  Insurance on an average motor car now costs about £400. The implementation of this budget will mean substantial additional costs to employees, companies and so on. Employers are also affected by it because they too are covered in the tax system.  In many cases wage increases have already been wiped out by increased costs.  That is what everybody is saying, and one cannot beat the public who are the best judges. When employees get their wage packets they can do simple calculations to see how they are being affected by the budget.  All these people cannot be wrong.  They thought the system was grand on 5 April but now they know that things are not so rosy.  That is why we put down these amendments.  We wish to help the hard pressed PAYE worker. Many of the wage increases granted are backdated, so that requires another calculation. Some of the increases are backdated to last November and some to last September in the semi-State sector.  You would be getting additional revenue here and that should also be looked into.  We are going by the figures the Minister gave us.  Financial correspondents have maintained that the figures in the Minister's budget will not stand up.  You say they will stand up.  I say that you say they will stand up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is giving a sort of biblical status to this promise the Government made not to increase taxation. The Minister in his previous capacity as a professional economist must know better than I know that you cannot give that categorical assurance because you must make a number of assumptions to say that you are going to bring about a situation whereby taxation will not increase.  Some of the assumptions that this Minister has made have been so far out of line as to be just unreal.  We should get away from just the figures we are talking about here and look at reality. We could argue all night about figures. The Minister's approach seems to be that we will adjust the bands and allowances to keep people standing still so that taxation will not be increased, but of course we will base our calculations and adjustment of the bands on the minimum assumption for inflation which is the major assumption to be taken into <Col N="417" /> account here.  I plead with the Minister, let us go outside this Chamber and look at reality.  With 240,000 unemployed we are on the brink of social revolution due largely to unemployment.</P>
      <P>There are many reasons for our present level of unemployment but the major reason, and every economic commentator from the left to the right, whether he be a professional economist or just somebody who is in touch with the ordinary people, agrees that one of the major reasons for the stifling of economic development is the crushing disincentive of the Irish tax system.  We ask the Minister if he is seriously interested in turning this situation around.  If he were he would not be coming in here fiddling around with bands and rates just to ensure that people stand still.  If people stand still that means the present situation is maintained and that situation is totally unsatisfactory.  It has given rise to 240,000 unemployed and to a near total breakdown in law and order.  It has brought us to the brink of social revolution, and the response of the Minister for Finance, the man who is in charge of managing the country's economy, whom we look to to turn the situation around, is to come into this House to tell us that the allowances for two blind people have been increased by 16.6 per cent.  For goodness sake, let us face reality and try to start before the situation becomes worse to do something positive about the tax system.  To accept our very minor, very moderate amendment here would be a very small start but at least it would be a step along the right road.</P>

      <P>I would have thought it fairly evident that if you increase gross income by 6 per cent and index tax bands and allowances, at the end of the day you will have 6 per cent more tax revenue and after tax income will have increased also by 6 per cent.  If the Deputies opposite do not accept that they had better go and write a few new rules of arithmetic because there is no way out of it.  As I have said, the measures that we have in the Bill do a little more than would be required to bring about indexation so that as a general rule the proposals we have in this Bill will keep people if anything a little ahead of inflation.  That seems to answer the kernel of the points being made by the gentlemen on the opposite side.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>As it turned out I was, if anything, a little on the pessimistic side in the forecast.  Deputies on the other side of the House then, of course, picked out things that were increasing by fairly large percentages and said, &ldquo;Is that what you mean, that inflation is running at the kind of level you are talking about?&rdquo; just as Deputy Ahern has done here today.</P>

    <P>If Deputy Ahern wants a discussion on the composition of the consumer price index there will be an occasion for that, <Col N="420" /> but it is very wrong to pick specific little items included in the index and ignore the rest because the Deputy knows as well as I do that it covers a very wide range of items.  I am prepared to admit, in case Deputy Ahern has not thought of it, that it is a general index and the effect of the changes in the consumer price index is different for different people.  It would be different for Deputy Ahern than it would be for me.  It would be different for Deputy Ahern than for another person with exactly the same income because that person might have different tastes and choose to spend his money differently.  But this is the best global indicator we can get of the effect of price increases on society in general and on incomes.  I am confident, given the trends I have seen so far, that I will not be too far out in that forecast of inflation.  Deputies opposite may choose to disagree with me for the tactical purpose of an argument, but that does not shake my belief in the reliability of the forecast.</P>

      <P>I have my feet firmly on the ground as the Minister learned when he came to Laois/Offaly last January.  We are talking about increases in the tax bands and in allowances.  Since the beginning of the year, and especially since the budget, petrol has increased by an average of 14p per gallon.  Workers from the <Col N="421" /> midlands who travel 30 or 40 miles a day to work tell me that before the increases it cost them £25 per week for petrol but since the increases were introduced it is costing them another £2 to £2.50 per week.  As Deputy Ahern said, car insurance has also increased substantially. Nobody can deny that.  The cost of fuel in the home has increased substantially &mdash;turf, briquettes, gas, electricity and coal.  We had two substantial gas increases recently.  Where is the Minister getting his figures?  The Minister was speaking earlier about the rule of thumb. That is all right when one is dealing with mathematics but we are talking about increases in the cost of living which are affecting people who have to travel long distances to work using private transport. Even if they use public transport it must be remembered that there has been a substantial increase in these costs too&mdash; I think 8 per cent.</P>

      <P>We are not repeating our arguments; we are getting to the kernel of the problem.  Earlier we were dealing with tax bands and allowances, but I have mentioned the increases which have to be borne by the PAYE taxpayers who are lucky enough to have jobs.  They tell me their petrol has increased to £27 or £27.50 per week instead of the £25 they paid some months ago.  Can that be denied?  It cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been in politics a long time but I could not sell this to my constituents, who are very intelligent people, and I <Col N="422" /> have no doubt that applies to the people in Kildare too.  I am talking about increases in very essential items.  Many financial commentators say, and I agree with them, that the Minister juggled with the figures and with the tax bands.  I accept that.  I wonder if the increases in incomes will continue at the projected rate.  It seems the Government have drawn back from the stand they took on pay.  That has been thrown out the window, as have many other parts of their package.  If the Minister for the Environment increases rents of local authority houses by 18 per cent where will we be?  It is possible that these increases will not be brought until after 20 June&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The PAYE taxpayer fully realises that because of the increase in the cost of living since the budget was introduced he is worse off.  I say that even allowing for an increase of 6 per cent or more in salaries.  I am giving the Government the benefit of the doubt in saying that the rate of inflation may be 6 per cent.

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Youth Training and Employment Schemes: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy B. Ahern on Tuesday, 7 May, 1985;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann calls on the Government to rationalise and co-ordinate the multiplicity of different schemes of youth training and employment by the different Government departments and agencies in order to concentrate on the provision of permanent sustainable employment for the greatest possible number of our young people.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann notes the action already taken by the Government to improve the co-ordination of services in the area of youth employment and training and looks forward to further improvements in the context of the development of manpower policy.&rdquo;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The first speaker, Deputy Frank Fahey, has ten minutes.  The Government side will speak from 7.10 p.m. to 7.40 p.m., the Opposition from 7.40 p.m. to 8.10 p.m., the Government from 8.10 p.m. to 8.15 p.m. and the Opposition from 8.15 p.m. to 8.30 p.m.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with two aspects of the question of youth training and manpower policy.  The whole area of youth training and manpower policy has been in a state of chaos, particularly in the last few years.  We have a multiplicity of schemes dealing with youth training, youth employment placement and youth employment.  Many of the schemes overlap and attempt to do the same job.  The vast majority of the schemes are simply an effort at fire brigade action to keep <Col N="424" /> down the unemployment statistics.  The Government have no manpower policy. A new scheme is born every couple of months when somebody has a brainwave. Money is poured into these schemes which could be better spent in the creation of long-term sustainable jobs.  I should like to ask the Minister exactly how many schemes are in operation designed to create short-term employment which is not of a productive nature. I could mention framework, teamwork, the social employment scheme and the employment incentive scheme.  I would accept that some of these schemes are beneficial but they are mainly designed to provide short-term employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two such schemes.  The teamwork scheme is aimed at those under 25 and the social employment scheme is aimed at those over 25.  There is no other scheme aimed at temporary employment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of other schemes which are supposed to give long-term employment but there is no evidence to suggest that they do so.</P>
      <P>I welcome the employment incentive scheme but let us consider how it has developed.  We have offered £50 a week to people who become involved in this scheme.  They are then supposed to go about running their own business, but according to a recent reply to a Dáil question we have given them no after care service.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of people who are running their own businesses under this scheme yet they do not even know how to write a cheque.  That is sending good money after bad.  A person cannot be expected to run a successful business in the current difficult climate without a proper back-up service, particularly in the first vital year.  I hope the <Col N="425" /> scheme will be successful but I am already seeing numerous people going nowhere under this scheme.  They are being handed £50 a week and told to get on with the job but nobody is interested in how they are doing.  The Minister will admit that they are beginning to come back, even before the end of the twelve months, saying their business venture has failed and seeking to be put back on the unemployment register.  The main cause is that there is no after care service. People must be given the care and attention they need in the initial stages of these ventures.  This is one example of lack of co-ordination.</P>
      <P>The proposal before the House is that a manpower authority should be set up to co-ordinate the efforts of the various agencies.  I am not being critical of agencies such as the YEA, AnCO and Manpower &mdash; they are doing their best in a difficult climate.  However, I am critical of the organisation under which they operate and of the resources at their disposal. A person in Dublin who goes into a Manpower office has very little hope of finding a proper job, the reason being that there are hundreds of lists of vacancies and thousands of lists of unemployed people.  It would be impossible for the Manpower personnel to have an efficient, co-ordinated placement service.  They should have at their disposal a computerised nationwide system which would make all the relevant information available at every Manpower office.  A person seeking employment would then be given information about the type of vacancies available.  Such a system does not as yet exist and people approaching Manpower are experiencing much frustration.  I do not lay the blame on the personnel in Manpower &mdash; they are doing their best in difficult circumstances.  A co-ordinated body would improve the performance not only of Manpower but of the YEA and AnCO as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is not much point in putting thousands of young people through training courses when there are no jobs available for them at the end.  I have always been critical of the expenditure of the youth employment levy.  It must be used <Col N="426" /> for employment creation rather than training.  There must be a significant change from training to employment creation in the expenditure of that levy. Young people finishing most of the training courses find that no jobs are available for them and they are going on the boat to England and America.  The value of their training is being lost to this country. Of course it is better that these young people should have some skills but we spend somewhere in the region of £200 million per year in training and the vast majority of people on whom we are spending that money have to go abroad to find employment.</P>
    <P>Therefore, there is not much point in continuing all those training courses in order to keep the unemployment register as low as possible unless we are prepared to put the money into long term sustainable jobs.  Statistics show quite clearly that we are not interested in doing this and the redeployment of the youth employment levy in the last two years is nothing short of a disgrace.  That levy is used to pay teachers' salaries and this is not acceptable.  The Minister can excuse this by saying he is putting it into the Department of Education for training in that area but, once the money is taken away from employment creation and direct training for jobs, it may as well not be spent on employment creation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to begin, as the Minister for Labour did last night, by expressing the view that this debate is timely and opportune.  It is appropriate that the Oireachtas should look at the whole question of the co-ordination of employment and training. I should like to echo his remarks about the very positive and constructive approach adopted by the Opposition during the course of this debate.  The tone of the debate was set by Deputy Bertie Ahern last night, which clearly showed the depth of his knowledge on the subject. I should like to respond to a number of the points raised by him.  The issues which he raised concern us, and in many instances the road along which he pointed <Col N="427" /> us towards a solution is a road that we have already been travelling.  Given the degree of consensus existing in the House, it would be inappropriate to divide at the conclusion of the debate and, while I think that my amendment has a better formula of works than the motion in the name of Deputy Ahern, I will not quarrel with him in that regard and we will not be dividing on this motion.</P>
      <P>Inevitably in a debate of this nature some Members took the opportunity to broaden the discussion and to address themselves to the wider question of employment and the quest for permanent, sustainable jobs.  That is a natural approach and it would have been quite extraordinary if that did not happen. Deputy Ahern rightly said that this is not really the place for a debate of this kind. In recent times the House has had other opportunities to debate the wider issue of employment and, no doubt, will have further opportunities in future.</P>
      <P>However, we are concerned with something different, the interventions of the Government in the area of youth employment and training and the way in which those interventions can best be targeted and directed.  That is not to say, of course, that all our quest must be in the area of sustainable jobs, although that is what we must all seek.  I am sure all Members accept that permanent, sustainable jobs will only come about as a result of economic growth, and the whole thrust of the Government's approach is spelt out clearly in <i>Building on Reality.</i> The thinking behind our budgetary strategy, which is central to our industrial policy is geared to the central objective of creating a climate for sustainable employment.  We can take some satisfaction from the fact that some of the most material indicators seem to be flashing in our direction, such as the falling level of inflation, which was under discussion before the change of business, and the export figures, which give us some reason for hope and confidence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The most recent school leaver survey has shown that more young people are <Col N="428" /> getting jobs than was the case in the early years of this decade.  As the Minister said last night, in European terms, in comparison with our partners in the Community, we have done far better than them in relation to the problem of youth unemployment.  Of course not everything in the garden is rosy and the fact that we are doing better than France, Germany or other countries is no consolation to the person who does not have a job, to the parents of those who do not have jobs, or to the parents of young people about to sit the inter or leaving certificates who wonder what their prospects are in the future.  However, we are always very good at highlighting our own shortcomings and it is not inappropriate to take a collective pat on the back for the fact that, as a country relatively less well off in terms of resources, we have managed to do much better than any of our neighbours. Of course, our demographic structure and growing labour force will ensure that there is no room for complacency.</P>
    <P>Tonight we are discussing the question of the co-ordination of youth employment and training measures.  I have lived with this over the last 12 months and one of the things which has heartened me is the extent to which the debate has proceeded without reference to mythology. Twelve months ago I was asked by the Taoiseach to direct my attention to this question and to consider the matter in some detail.  One of the things of which I immediately became aware was that over a period of years all sorts of perceptions, doubts, fears and suspicions had grown up.  Taken at its most extreme, I think there were people in the educational world who believed that there were big bad AnCO people, usually wearing raincoats, outside school yards trying to entice pupils into AnCO courses.  For their part some of the people in the training field tended to believe at times that in the world of education many people wanted to get technologists operating in the higher reaches of high technology and to return them to the study of second steps in Latin or whatever.  Of course, I exaggerate.  But those fears are there and <Col N="429" /> it is significant and worthwhile that those myths did not feature substantially in the course of this debate.</P>
    <P>Because of the slack in the labour market the Government have provided resources for training and work experience for as many young people as possible. In the current year about 69,000 young people will benefit and that figure is slightly more than the total number of young people leaving the educational system this year.  It would have been possible for the Government to say that our future is in economic growth and that they were concerned to get the engine of the economy running.  Last week I referred to the philosophy of the rising tide which would lift all boats.  This Government rejects such a philosophy because we are satisfied that not all boats will rise on the tide.  We are satisfied that some of the boats are so fragile, some so poorly constructed or holed that the rise in the tide will be of no avail.  For those groups a particular response and intervention is required.  We have identified two such groups as requiring that response and support: the young unemployed and, within that group, the early school leaver without qualification and the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have addressed themselves to the problems of the long term unemployed and, in particular, to the new social employment scheme.  On a very rigid interpretation of the rules it might be that the Chair would rule out any such references on the basis that the social employment scheme is specifically targeted at those who are not young unemployed.  The concern of this motion is with the young unemployed.  However, as everyone else has addressed themselves to this subject, perhaps I could also do so in passing.</P>
    <P>I accept there have been delays in getting the scheme going and I regret those delays.  I wish we were further along the road than we are, but members will be aware of the reasons for the delays.  There were difficulties within the National Manpower Service for historical reasons which we do not need to go into and, as a result, schemes took longer to get off <Col N="430" /> the ground than we would have wished. More than twice the targeted number of people, some 20,000 have contacted the Department to express their interest in participation.  Hundreds of potential project sponsors have been in contact with the Department.  Now that the scheme is under way I am confident that the target set by the Government will be achieved and perhaps exceeded.</P>
    <P>Deputy Fahey referred to the teamwork scheme which I launched a few weeks ago.  It has drawn a staggering response by any standards and indicates the depth of interest there is among voluntary and community groups and their anxiety to play a role in providing employment opportunities for young people.  I am convinced they will be equally anxious to help the long term unemployed. The evidence available suggests the scheme will prove very successful.</P>
    <P>We cannot wait for the tide; we must intervene.  A number of Members expressed concern about the diverse range and multiplicity of schemes that are provided for young people.  I understand that concern. However, it stems from a somewhat superficial examination of the position.  I do not use the word &ldquo;superficial&rdquo; in a pejorative sense.  The depth of research displayed by Deputy Ahern displays how inappropriate it would be.  However, it does not take account adequately of two factors.  Firstly, it does not take account of the fact that the funding for all these schemes comes from a number of different sources: the Exchequer, the youth employment levy and the European Social Fund.  It is necessary to tailor the schemes to take account of the requirements of the European Social Fund and the age qualifications that apply for the various forms of activity supported by that fund.  Secondly, we must have a range of options because of the varying educational levels of young people and the different requirements and aspirations they may have.  The multiplicity of responses follows from the fact that the Government quite rightly put a lot of emphasis on categories of young people with particular disadvantage and a number of schemes are tailored to meet <Col N="431" /> their special needs.  A number of responses are designed to familiarise young people with new technology.  That will be a key element in the labour market in the future.</P>
    <P>I have been living with this problem over the last 12 months.  When I addressed myself to the problem it seemed that it fell into two parts.  One was some anxiety between the educational world and the manpower world and a feeling on the part of the educational world that their territory had been invaded and that work was being done in the manpower area that they could do more effectively and at a lower cost. Within the manpower area there was some lack of clarity of roles on the part of the various manpower players on the pitch.  It was to those two issues I addressed myself and had two objectives in mind.  The first was to try to ensure that as far as possible the young person would get the best possible service and the other was to ensure that the tax paying public would get value for money. Many of the conclusions I arrived at, which have been the subject of discussion with almost all the people involved in this area, echo the thinking suggested in contributions earlier in the debate.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers expressed concern at the fact that a young unemployed person seeking assistance from the State may find himself in a position where the possibility of mainstream employment would be available and he would be placed by the National Manpower office or there may be a question of work experience or participation in a short term employment programme or the question of a training course with AnCO, ACOT, CERT, and so on.  Concern has been expressed that such is the range of options available that it is possible for someone to get lost.  That danger is greatest in the case of young people who most need support and assistance.  The young person who leaves school ill-equipped for the world is most likely to be bemused and bedazzled by the range of options available.  I have been anxious to ensure that the National Manpower Service and <Col N="432" /> the schools work in the closest possible harmony and that in the first instance the co-operation and partnership should take effect in the case of early school-leavers.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say my thinking on that has been taken up by the Youth Employment Agency in their social guarantee programme now operative in a number of parts of the country on a pilot basis.  It will be nationwide by the end of the year and has an essential element to it &mdash; the fact that the schools and the National Manpower Service should work together in the case of the priority client group: the young person leaving school without any certificate.  That is one aspect I identified as being important and which the Government are committed to.  It will find favour with Deputy Ahern on the basis of his contribution last night.</P>
    <P>The second aspect I regard as important is that the young person should not have to go from office to office to find out what was on offer.  The National Manpower Service should serve as a single point of contact.  A young person could present himself there and the range of options could be reviewed there.  The placement officer, having discussed the young person's interests, aspirations and so on, would direct him towards the most appropriate response, be it an AnCO course, mainstream employment or whatever.</P>
    <P>The other area which it is fair to say has been central to my work was to ensure value for money.  Concern has been expressed particularly by people in the educational world that a great deal of training has taken place in the past without reference to the expertise and the resources available in the world of education.  They pointed to the availability of skilled educationalists, tutors, teachers and to the possibility of resources in terms of classrooms, laboratories, and so on.  I am glad to say I have secured the agreement of the agencies in the field. When it is proposed to take on a training module using external trainers, AnCO will in the first instance address themselves to the question of whether or not those resources are available within the world of education and will offer the <Col N="433" /> opportunity of providing the training to the world of education on a first option basis.  That course of action should find wide favour in the House.  We have been able to secure the agreement of all participants to it in the course of the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>What I have been engaged on in the past 12 months has not been the root and branch type exercise which Deputy Ahern called for in his opening remarks in this debate.  I accept that.  Perhaps that is a criticism although, given the task that faced me, I do not think that was a realistic option.  Quite consciously I operated on this basis: &ldquo;There are a number of players on the pitch.  Let us now see how we will get them to play most effectively as a team.&rdquo; What we have done in the past 12 months ensures that the various bodies in the educational world and the manpower world concerned with providing a service for young people co-operate more effectively and will continue to co-operate more effectively.</P>
    <P>That is not the last word on the subject and it was never intended that it should be the last word.  The Department of Labour are engaged on the completion of their work on a White Paper on Manpower Policy, the first such White Paper in 20 years.  The change in circumstances over that 20 years is so obvious that it hardly needs to be stated.  The concern was about the possibility of job shortages and skilled shortages, but now the emphasis inevitably will be on an interventionist approach by the State in the labour market.  Those 20 years have seen the role of a number of bodies evolve in response to changing circumstances.  The National Manpower Service, from being a placement agency matching vacancies to applicants have become involved more and more as the provider and the administrator of schemes, first with the work experience programme and more recently with the employment incentive scheme and the enterprise allowance scheme.  The staff of the manpower service have responded quite heroically to that change of role.</P>
    <P>So too the role of AnCO has changed significantly.  From a time when they <Col N="434" /> might have seen their role as providing the requisite skills for an anticipated industry, increasingly they have become involved in the area of services for the unemployed and a response to the needs of the disadvantaged to provide some sort of equality of opportunity.  In those circumstances the approach suggested by Deputy Ahern was: &ldquo;Let us get them all together, wipe everybody off the pitch, amalgamate them and have a new manpower authority.&rdquo; That would approximate quite closely to the approach which has been taken in Great Britain.  I have no hang-ups about it, as the Minister for Labour indicated last night.  I have qualms and reservations.  My concern is that such an amalgam might prove to be a soulless monster and that in such an amalgam the expertise and enthusiasm which are the hallmark of a number of those bodies would be lost.</P>
    <P>I think of CERT, a very small, trim, tidy, cost-effective organisation who know the tourist industry and the catering industry inside out and have done a superb job over the years.  I am not sure that it would be possible for them to maintain that close contact with the industry as part of a much wider organisation. Perhaps it would.  It is not as simple as is sometimes suggested.  Mixing everybody up together and saying we have a brand new authority does not get us anywhere.  All of the jobs which are now done will still have to be done.  We will still need a training division, a division particularly concerned with the disadvantaged. Presumably for the foreseeable future we will need to provide short term employment.  We need a placement service. I am not convinced that causing all these bodies which now provide those services to lose their identity and merge into one great monster is the way forward. I accept that the last word has not been spoken on this.  I certainly accept that there is nothing sacrosanct about the present structural arrangements.  It is time to reconsider those structural arrangements.</P>
    <P>I have only a few moments left so perhaps I could take up three or four points mentioned by various people.  One was <Col N="435" /> the question of the relationship of the link programme and COMTEC.  There is a misunderstanding there.  The link programme is an AnCO programme which operates on the basis of bringing training to people rather than the other way around.  It is a very effective programme as is shown by the number of enterprises it has spawned.  I see Deputy Flynn in the House and I know he has some knowledge of the operations of that programme.</P>
    <P>The COMTEC programme is quite different. It is not the programme of any one of the participants in the field.  It seeks to bring them all together and operates on the basis that the training and employment needs of any area are best determined locally, that Dublin does not know best, that it is much more appropriate to get local participants together to decide what is the most appropriate response for the area in which the COMTEC is established.</P>
    <P>Another issue was raised by several speakers who, I am glad to say, expressed appreciation of the various temporary employment measures.  While accepting their limitations, there was the difficulty of insurance.  This is part of the wider problems facing the insurance industry. It is a problem to which the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has been addressing himself in relation to the social employment scheme as I have been in relation to team work.  We have now got to the stage where we will have a solution to those difficulties within the next day or two.</P>
    <P>Deputy E. O'Keeffe raised the question of the community youth training programmes? I very much appreciate his kind remarks and the tribute he paid to AnCO.  I agree it is a very worthwhile programme and that much of value has been done around the country.  He expressed the hope that the programme would expand into the heritage area.  He referred to the very fine monuments and buildings around the country.  He also talked about the possibility of historical research as distinct from construction activity.  I am not clear about that.  AnCO are in agreement with him about the prospect <Col N="436" /> of providing worthwhile training opportunities in that area and it is already in hand.</P>
    <P>I wanted to take up a number of other specifics but time does not allow me to do so.  I express my appreciation to the Opposition for putting down this motion which is a subject of concern to all of us.  The Government recognise that this matter requires attention.  It is receiving attention and will continue to receive it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is always gratifying for the Opposition to have a motion like this accepted by the Government.  The indication from the Minister of State that the House will not be dividing this evening is a clear acknowledgement by the Government and the Minister of the inadequacies of the existing system. When the Government say it is not their intention to divide the House this evening, they are accepting the motion as tabled by Deputy Ahern on behalf of this party.  The Government are also accepting everything contained in that motion and that means that they accept that there is complete fragmentation in the area of activity under the Minister's control in dealing with youth training and employment and generally related matters.  That is to put it mildly but it is some element of self-condemnation of the Coalition's performance in regard to tackling the employment problem.  It is pleasing that, even at this late stage in the life of this Dáil, we have a Minister of State who, on behalf of his Minister and the Government is prepared to indicate that the Government have failed to address themselves adequately to dealing with the unemployment crisis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only outlining in practical terms what acceptance of our motion entails.  It means that the Government realise that the system they have been operating for the past two and a half years <Col N="437" /> has failed and failed to the stage where they could not even frame an amendment by way of trying to gloss over their failure and of trying to make some case for dealing with the problem.  We take it in good faith that the Minister accepts that the Government have failed in their efforts to deal with the unemployment crisis.</P>
      <P>At least the Minister is admitting that failure here but of course his attitude is entirely contrary to the outpourings of the Taoiseach and of other Government Ministers in the recent past who have been preaching to all and sundry that the tide has turned, that the crisis is over, that unemployment is now under control and that all the agencies are functioning at maximum output.  We are being told that the Coalition are doing an excellent job in the matter of unemployment but&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister failed to indicate what he proposes to do about the crisis.  He refers to suggestions offered by Deputy Ahern, suggestions which he finds praiseworthy but he does not indicate whether he intends taking on board those suggestions.  He tells us he is open to all kinds of suggestions but we are not here to listen to that kind of bleating as to what the Minister might consider appropriate.  In his admission of guilt in so <Col N="438" /> far as the administration of the agencies within his control are concerned, we are asking him what his intentions are.</P>
      <P>The Minister continues to talk about considering further options.  While his admission is praiseworthy in its frankness, it must be condemnatory in so far as his party and the Government are concerned. One can only assume that what the Minister has been saying this evening will only add further to the frustrations of the people he purports to support and help in the job marketplace.  These people had been told by senior Ministers that everything was changing and that they could expect to be guaranteed placings on the job market in the immediate future but now they hear from the Minister of State that not only are matters not well but that they are out of control, that there is no co-ordination and that there is a multiplicity of different schemes.  In other words, by accepting our motion, the Government are agreeing that we have been right in what we have been saying for the past two and a half years. However, it has taken a long time for the Government to recognise what is a fact of life.  How can one expect young people to be anything but cynical when all the outpourings of the Government of the past six months in relation to dealing with the unemployment problem have been shattered by the admission of the Minister this evening?</P>

      <P>Having accepted our motion, one would have expected the Minister to set out his programme.  Later I shall have some harsh words to say by way of indicators as to where his performance might be improved.  If the Minister had set out a programme of activity we might have been able to judge him in regard to how he intends implementing the terms of the motion he has accepted. However, the Minister chose to deal in generalities and in ambiguities.  I expect he was mandated to do so because of the <Col N="439" /> Government not having a clear enunciated policy.  They are still searching about, making trawls internationally and at home as to what the best <i>modus operandi</i> might be in terms of implementing what is contained in our motion.  It is regrettable that more time and study was not devoted to this matter by the Government so that they might have set out clearly what steps they propose to take. If they had done so I am sure they would have had the full support of this side of the House.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State rejects the rising tide philosophy.  There is no tide in that context at this time.  The commercial life of the country is grinding to a halt and has virtually reached the stage of no return. Consumer spending is well down.  There is no buoyancy in the economy despite the prediction of the Minister for Finance in his budget statement.  I do not know whether there is a lack of awareness on the part of the Government in regard to all these matters or whether they are not prepared to accept the position that exists in the marketplace but the country is in dire straits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>One would have hoped that in accepting our motion the Minister would have accepted these factors and would have indicated whatever plans there may be by way of schemes, training and so on, to deal with the problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was always intended that the manpower services would reduce the unwarranted recourse to the social welfare system and would provide training, work and analagous schemes as an alternative to unemployment benefit and assistance. We would have expected that there would be a great need for the manpower agencies.  There is a need also for a great training agency.  One complements the other.  They should not act exclusively of each other but that is what has been <Col N="440" /> happening to a great extent in recent times.</P>
    <P>In these circumstances one must ask what are the real unemployment figures. In reply to a written question here last week the Minister left us in no doubt that the unemployment figure is seriously in advance of the figure quoted in the live register.  I say this because even in the list of schemes outlined in the tabular statement supplied, it is indicated that there are almost 20,000 persons involved in the various schemes to which the Minister referred.  These schemes are costing about £45 million.  In effect therefore, there are 250,000 people unemployed. It is time someone would admit that.  There is nothing wrong in saying what the true position is.  When one adds to that the emigration figure, one realises the true picture and that is that one in five of the population has no job.  Our demand is that the Government provide schemes of training and of jobs that will deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>One must ask whether the money should be used to organise and to administer a variety of schemes when the proportion of the money spent on the jobs provided is totally out of focus.  The Minister last week gave an answer beyond yea or nea.  The question must also be asked if it can be shown statistically that we are getting value for the money spent.  The two criteria on which the Minister bases his activity are value to the consumer and value to the taxpayer. He did not give a positive response to his own questions, which is an indication that he is far from satisfied.</P>
    <P>Would the Minister accept that there is a certain amount of empire building going on with regard to some of the organisations mentioned by the Minister? People are saying that these organisations are developing cosy little schemes to perpetuate their existence.  I am happy that the Minister recognises the multiplicity which is there and is going to do something to reduce it.  In the recent past, whatever age group or pressure group demanded a particular scheme to deal with the situation they wanted addressed, <Col N="441" /> a scheme was always devised to accommodate them.  That is bad planning and bad usage of public money.  If the Department and the agencies are fully aware of the demands in our society, they will recognise these situations and, rather than having pressure brought on them by select groups, would be providing arrangements to deal with these matters. Otherwise there is the piecemeal response to the national crisis which we have been getting for the past few years. It is time that was changed.  It would be Parkinson's law gone mad, feeding on itself.  The danger that exists in organisations is that they will create their own momentum without a necessary accounting for value for money given.  There is public expediency in the devising of certain schemes and the allocating of funds to them, without proper evaluation of the end result.  If the Minister accepts our motion, he must also admit that that has been happening and that he is not satisfied that value for money has been achieved.</P>
    <P>I draw the Minister's attention to the question of apprenticeship schemes.  The number of apprentices in training has been decimated for quite some time.  We now have a plethora of short term training courses.  I see this resulting in a certain type of tradesman being created who is unable to hold down a permanent post which requires qualifications.  These people add significantly, later on, to the black economy so that we are creating our own monster which has been hurting the economy at both ends.  I should like to see a complete apprenticeship scheme implemented.  Could the Minister arrange to provide a finishing off of apprenticeships for those who, through no fault of their own, have become redundant or have gone out of business and find themselves with a year or a year and a half of unfinished apprenticeship?  It has become increasingly difficult to place such people in positions where they can complete their apprenticeships.  I can understand the reluctance of employers to take on somebody whom they did not train initially, but this is the type of service <Col N="442" /> which the Minister could arrange and which would help enormously to reduce the frustration of those people.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the Minister would accept a recommendation which I have been asked to put to him, to allow apprentices a release for the first year of their apprenticeship rather than the block release lasting six or seven weeks at a time.  This causes quite some pressure in job places and with employers.  Apart from the apprentices getting the theory right initially, they will be much more useful to their employers when they return and have not this shunting backwards and forwards which disrupts the workplace.</P>
    <P>It is generally believed that we have somehow smothered initiative with much red tape and administrative barriers, not just the Minister's Department and the agencies involved with it, but in many other areas, including the Industrial Development Authority.  People trying to get a start and get discretionary money from whatever source would benefit from greater powers being placed with the Minister's local managers and development secretaries generally throughout the country, to give the initial push to these entrepreneurs or young beginners who want to take a chance in life.  The people interviewing such people feel curtailed and consider it is not worth all the paperwork involved.  Something could be done there as well.  There is no condoning sluggishness in creating job opportunities or the environment to motivate self-movement by the unemployed young or over 25 years of age.</P>
    <P>Commercial life has suffered greatly, it has almost ceased.  To put it colloquially, it has been asphyxiated by overtaxation and over-administration.  It has certainly been brutalised by the huge wall of bureaucracy which has grown up.  A large measure of this exists in the Minister's Department.  Take as an example the National Manpower Service.  There is insufficient staffing to deal with the multiplicity of schemes which has been foisted on them.  Each additional scheme has stretched their resources to breaking point.  The service is aimed now at <Col N="443" /> temporary schemes such as cleaning up graveyards. That is necessary work, but it has always been done in the past.  They are now taking it on instead of seeking placement in permanent jobs.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service, because of the multiplicity of schemes, have no time to do what they were set up to do, to interview applicants properly so that they can be channelled to the appropriate training scheme or job. Whether the Minister knows it or not, what is involved is an applicant filling in an application form and hoping for a response at some other time.  The service was never intended to be like that and the Minister must bring it back to taking a personal interest in the applicant and his or her proper interviewing and subsequent advice.</P>
    <P>The employment incentive scheme has not increased the workforce.  It is the same employers who are benefiting from the scheme year after year.  It is not having a beneficial effect on the number at work because the Minister is doing away with the base level each year or each period that he chooses.  The employer who gets the grant one year for increasing the number employed can get it again when the Department alter the base level and that is what has been going on.  Consequently, no additional jobs are being created.</P>
    <P>AnCO have been referred to.  They have their own training centres with full time instructors and I must put it on record that they do a good job.  They are a vital, integral part of the whole scheme of things.  They deserve our compliments and I gladly give them.  However, there is over-use of outside consultants.  These consultants are putting on programmes and courses and certainly have excellent PROs and excellent brochures.  There is no question about that.  However, I must ask if the Minister thinks we are getting value for money.  Does he think there is that great need for all these outside consultants being used in the system?  It would be interesting if the Minister took a look at that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="444" /> The Minister said I would have firsthand knowledge of the AnCO link programme and that is the case.  It operated in south and east Mayo in 1984.  It provided opportunities for people to go into a kind of training for a certain period but I should like to ask the Minister if he has carried out any monitoring of the follow-up of that scheme.  For instance, so far as the south Mayo scheme in 1984 was concerned, will the Minister say how many people ended up in employment at the end of the course and how many of those who participated in the scheme are in employment today?  I realise that that is too much to ask the Minister to reply to this evening but there are not that many link programmes.  I should like to know the answer to my query so that we might consider what benefit has accrued from the money spent.  Can the Minister tell me the number of people in permanent or semi-permanent employment who have participated in the link scheme one day after the scheme finished and one year later.  The work committees are not working.  They are supposed to function after the link programme moves on but that does not happen.  It is not right that we should try to put a smokescreen around what happens after such schemes cease to operate.  While they are in operation they are all right but the question must be asked if they are really only a stopgap to reduce the numbers on the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>The special employment schemes are not being taken up and the Minister mentioned one of the difficulties in that connection. The major reason they are not taking off is because there is only class J contribution under the PRSI system available to those participating and that allows a person to qualify only for occupational injury.  It does not entitle a person to benefit other than by way of assistance after participation in the scheme.  The Minister and the Government will be disappointed in respect of the numbers who will participate.  If that scheme had come on stream as indicated in the budget, it would be in full operation now.</P>

      <P>The scheme is not taking off in the way necessary to make it a working model to solve the unemployment crisis.  At this time there is a graduate drain from the country and I should like the Minister to apply himself to that matter.  The Minister will accept that it is necessary to have higher levels of manufacturing to provide jobs and the living standards to maintain graduates in employment.  We hear much about ordinary schemes for people under and over the age of 25 but we cannot forget that the universities are turning out thousands of graduates.  As far as I am concerned, we are just exporting highly skilled people who have much talent.  We are sending these people abroad to work with our competitors who will face us in the marketplace.  There is a great need to devise a new arrangement that will help to keep those people here.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he was extremely happy with the teamwork scheme, that it had had a staggering response.  I do not know what the Minister regards as staggering but the figures in a reply I received from the Minister's office suggested that there are 400 people participating in the scheme.  I suggest to him that 400 young people is not a staggering figure when up to 70,000 young people under the age of 25 are unemployed.  I should like to think the Minister would revise his estimate of what he considers a staggering figure. In the administration of that scheme, I should like him to make one change. When schemes are contemplated under the teamwork heading, an official from Dublin has to come down to the country to decide whether the scheme will proceed. When the local National Manpower Service office can deal with the SES schemes and make decisions regarding large amounts of money, I cannot understand why they are not allowed to handle this little scheme.  I ask the Minister to do something about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like the Minister to clarify the position concerning the National Manpower Service.  What is his priority list so <Col N="446" /> far as their functions are concerned?  As far as I am concerned the list of priorities he has given the National Manpower Service is back to front.  The first priorities with which he has charged them and the ones to which they must give the most urgent attention are the social employment schemes, followed by employment incentive schemes, social guarantee schemes, work experience programmes, enterprise allowance schemes, Youth Employment Agency schemes, community youth training schemes and job placement in permanent positions is in eighth place.  I do not think the National Manpower Service should be asked by Ministerial diktat to apply priority number eight to this important matter.  That is not giving the proper priority in dealing with our employment crisis and youth training.  I should like to see item No. 8 take its proper place at the head of the priority list.  I should like the Minister to have permanent job creation as his first priority and to so indicate to the National Manpower Service offices.  Social employment schemes should be given their proper place in the queue but not in advance of permanent job placement.</P>
    <P>A practical example of the Government's inactivity and inefficiency in dealing with the National Manpower Service can be given by me.  This organisation deal with the ever-worsening unemployment situation which this evening the Minister, on behalf of the Government, at last admitted exists.  This is the first time it has been admitted in two and a half years.  People will recognise that the Minister of State at least had courage, something many of his colleagues have not got.</P>
    <P>The National Manpower Service are responsible for the administration of major employment schemes costing millions of pounds of taxpayers' money.  Yet, the 44 permanent offices are operating with archaic filing and administration methods.  They do not have even the proper office technology that one would expect in a small office.  Simple dictaphone equipment is not available in these offices.  One would have imagined that, in dealing with a crisis where 70,000 young <Col N="447" /> people are unemployed, at least the National Manpower Service would have a computerised filing system linked to a central terminal in the Minister's office or in some other office in Dublin.  However, the offices are being denied proper levels of manning and the equipment to deal with the problem.</P>
    <P>Since the Minister will not allow his Deputies to go through the lobbies this evening&mdash;and obviously quite a number of them were not prepared to vote on the Government's side on this occasion &mdash; I will put to him the Fianna Fáil position&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I might make a few brief points in the time available to me.  I would suggest to Deputy Flynn that the present Minister for Labour and his Minister of State have done quite a good job in regard to the whole question of social legislation and employment schemes. That is generally recognised by the public.  I might put on record the fact that most or 75 per cent of the social legislation introduced in this House over the past 20 years was introduced by Ministers of the Labour Party.  That is a fact of life that cannot be denied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While people criticise the activities of AnCO, the moneys spent on the training of people, one should remember that 50 <Col N="448" /> per cent of those operational costs comes from EC funds which means that they cost the taxpayer 50 per cent only.  I was chairman of the Louth/Meath AnCO link programme.  Other Members of the Oireachtas served on that committee, including Deputy Faulkner.  It provided an opportunity to co-ordinate training at local level rather than continuing the institutional type training that obtained heretofore.</P>
    <P>I was a member of AnCO from their inception and am familiar with their developments over the past 20 years. Much of the original training provided by them is no longer relevant to industrial or commercial activity here.  For example, many thousands of young people were trained in all sorts of engineering activity, using very expensive equipment, only to discover that when their training was completed there were not any jobs for them.  There were not any jobs then and there are not any now.  There would not be sufficient engineering works in the whole of Ireland and the United Kingdom put together to cope with the number of people trained in that way.</P>
    <P>I always felt, and still feel, that programmes like the link programme define the type of training required within a community, that we should gear our training programmes to areas in which there will be vacancies.  I notice that clothing companies are looking for skilled people.  At the same time that there are 500 or perhaps 1,000 young girls or women unemployed signing at the employment exchanges on a weekly basis, the textile clothing industry experience difficulty in recruiting people.  The reason for this is obvious: that there is very little, if any co-ordination between the various Manpower offices and the employment exchanges.  In former years when one became unemployed, whether on a parttime or fulltime basis, one signed on on X number of days; in fact at one stage one signed daily.  When jobs became vacant employers were obliged to notify the local employment exchange, such notices being listed in the exchanges and when people went into sign they were obliged to go from the employment <Col N="449" /> exchange to that job at least to be interviewed. That is no longer the case. Through no fault of theirs one will find on the records of Manpower large numbers of people who are unemployed &mdash; some have emigrated &mdash; and the records are absolutely out of date.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that the enterprise allowance scheme has been a huge success and has encouraged young people to commence much entrepreneurial activity, much of which has succeeded in my area.  The new &ldquo;work worth doing&rdquo; scheme has been a huge success also, in respect of which I congratulate the Minister for Labour.  It will take people off the dole, even if only for two and a half days and will deal a mortal blow to the black economy, meaning that people can work in an effective way particularly on environmental schemes and be paid for doing so, rather than hiding or doing anything illegal.  I strongly recommend that scheme.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Flynn in his reference to the position of redundant apprentices. There is a scheme under the aegis of the Department of Labour, the redundant apprenticeship scheme, which is not nearly sufficiently used.  For example, local authorities can avail of the scheme for the reconstruction of old housing and other public buildings.  The position is that, while AnCO pay the trainees who complete their training under the scheme, the supervisor and part of the administrative costs, the problem arises with regard to material costs and it is those that prevent local authorities from availing of the scheme as they should.</P>

      <P>This motion on behalf of Fianna Fáil has drawn recognition from the Government benches of our responsibility in putting it down in a timely way, expressing what is the widespread concern felt throughout the community about youth unemployment, the complexity of agencies, the multiplicity of schemes and so on.  The Government <Col N="450" /> must have experienced some difficulty in the wording of their amendment because it is so similar to the motion itself.  Indeed, to admit that the House will not divide is clear recognition that the problem obtains, that it is a serious one.  At last it has come to the attention of the Government that they should see the wisdom and constructive approach of Fianna Fáil in putting down this motion, having it debated and well thought out.</P>
      <P>There is widespread concern, especially as we find ourselves now in an unemployment emergency.  That is what it amounts to at present, its dimensions being in the region of 250,000 people unemployed.  If one were to add on to that figure the thousands of young people not receiving any unemployment assistance because they are living at home with their parents &mdash; their parents' means are supposed to be sufficiently good to maintain them and keep them off the unemployment list &mdash; plus a realistic figure for emigration, now running close to 30,000 annually &mdash; illegal emigration to the United States, legal to Europe and the United Kingdom &mdash; had we to face those sorts of figures here then I have no reservations in saying that we would be sitting on a time bomb with a slow burning fuse. Before that fuse blows there is a responsibility on this House, and a bigger one on the part of the Government, to respond to that unemployment emergency, to be seen to take effective action rather than concerning themselves as unfortunately they have for much too long, in good public relations exercises, glossy brochures, a multitude of schemes, all of which add to the confusion and cynicism in the minds and hearts of all our young people and their parents as well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are failing in our duty and responsibility in this House, but the overall responsibility must lie at the feet of the Government.  For the two and a half years they have been in power they have closed their eyes to the reality of the situation. They are more concerned with perception than with performance in Government. When one hears the utterances of the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance one begins to wonder if they are living in <Col N="451" /> a real world at all, are they living with the real problems obtaining here at present? Not alone does one wonder if they are living here but one wonders if they are on this planet at all.  We have had the Taoiseach say time and time again that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  We heard that last year.  I saw the Fine Gael document &mdash; the Democrat or whatever it is called &mdash; shoved into every door around the country, contending that the economy is up, up and away; 15 months ago it was on its way and it has not yet taken off.  Yet repeatedly we hear the Taoiseach preach to the people that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  I doubt if the Taoiseach has even found the entrance to the tunnel, never mind finding his way out of it.  The light at the end of the tunnel is being hung out again because June 20 is approaching when the people will have an opportunity to cast a vote of no confidence in the Government. We will again see all the brochures and statements in all the pigeon holes in this House.  Every member of the House got a document from Minister Liam Kavanagh listing his achievements since 1982.  That is not what Government is about.</P>
    <P>This motion addresses a hodge podge of multiplicity, duplicity, complexity, all adding to the confusion.  What are the Government doing about it?  Last night I listened to the Minister for Labour. Sometimes I wonder if in this Government the left knows what the right hand is doing.  The left was here last night saying that there was no duplication or waste, and now this Minister is saying that he accepts the basis of our motion, that there is duplication and waste.  There is waste to the tune of £160 million being spent by various Government Departments and agencies on a multiplicity of schemes.  We put down a well presented motion saying that the time has come to call a halt, the time has come to do what my good business man would do, to set up a manpower service under one single authority.  The expertise from all the individual agencies could become an arm of the new authority.  That authority should have a central computer containing all <Col N="452" /> the necessary data so that clerks would not spend endless hours writing lists of names over and over again.  No wonder the young people are turned off.  The Government should set up the single authority along the lines I have outlined so as to avoid confusion.</P>
    <P>While the Minister is at that, he might tell his other colleagues not to run flashy advertisements on the television offering to develop ideas for people.  The young people in the streets will say that they go into the agencies to see what is available. How can we expect a young person coming out of third level or second level education to be able to focus immediately on a whole new world of work or business if somebody is not there to look after him?  There should be personal care for these people to help them get under way.</P>
    <P>I have not time to go back to the root causes of the situation, but certainly some of it rests with the educational system. Sustainable jobs relate to products and services that sell, but look at the third level education, look at what happens. The people who develop ideas in the science and physics sections do not know anything about business, and on the other side are the commerce students.  They should be brought together for a six months post graduate course.  People should not be paid £30 a month to stay on in seventh class.  That sort of nonsense will get us nowhere.  If the people with the ideas and the people with the business minds are put together they will emerge better equipped to get a new project under way.</P>
    <P>In the schools we should encourage the students to think of themselves as being employers rather than employees.  In any secondary school today 70 per cent of the pupils will say that they want a job in an office and so on.  The academic jobs they are aspiring to are not available and will not be available.  It is up to the Government to make use of all the money available, to get value for money on behalf of the taxpayers.  Everybody accepted the 1 per cent youth employment levy in good faith because everybody knew the reality of the problem which loomed.  About £160 million is being spent, and nobody <Col N="453" /> can see the value for money so the taxpayers are now cribbing about the 1 per cent levy; they do not want to pay it.  We are training people for jobs that do not exist.  The Government are talking about social employment schemes which will add to the black economy.  We have three types of economy.  One is the export economy.  When a local authority are told to introduce a scheme and that the Government will be responsible for 53 per cent of the cost, and they are starved of money, where will they get the 47 per cent needed to start the scheme?  In these circumstances the scheme will not start. Everybody knows that the trade unions have put up barriers to stop this scheme working.  If a person gets a project going, what is happening in the insurance world? Employers' liability is going up by 300 per cent this year and some of the schemes set up under the enterprise allowance scheme are already being put out of business this year.  In many instances they cannot get cover, and when they can the cover is so expensive they cannot afford it.  If the Minister wishes this scheme to work he should put in an after care service. There is no point in setting up young people for three or four months and then running away.  These people will have cash flow problems and they will need after care service.  That is the only way to achieve success.</P>
    <P>The Government should not say that this economy is rising, because it is not. We are talking about an increase in exports coming from two sectors of industry, electronics and pharmaceuticals only.  The money that is being created here is not coming back to this economy, and that is why there is no uplift in the economy.  The other economy here is our indigenous economy which is not rising at all.  Consumer spending for the first three months this year shows that.  When Deputy Bell talks about traditional industries, the only way they can succeed is if consumer spending rises.  The third economy is the black economy, which is the only one doing business at the moment because the policies being pursued by this Government are creating a bigger black economy every day of the week.  The <Col N="454" /> white economy is being squeezed to death while the black economy flourishes.  The white economy is being squeezed to death by penal taxation and by more and more Government interference.  If the Government want enterprise to flourish they should remove the heavy hand of Government.  The Government should introduce selective reductions in taxation so that enterprise will be rewarded. Without investment today we cannot have jobs tomorrow.  We should invest in the areas which produce results.  If we carry on in the present fashion the country will go further down the tube.  People who do not want to go into the black economy are being forced to engage in it to survive.</P>
    <P>Yesterday in the House I heard the Minister for Agriculture, who could make a significant contribution if he addressed himself to the problems and to the opportunities that exist in small farm enterprise.  The Minister when asked about aid from Europe said that not alone did it apply to mares but it applied to jackasses, mules and jennets.  That is not the sort of glib reply we expect from a Minister for Agriculture, a Minister in charge of our greatest industry who could make a significant contribution to the economy.  There are far too many Departments and far too many agencies with their finger in the pie.  The Government should get the job on the road in the manner promoted in our resolution moved by Deputy Bertie Ahern here last night.</P>
    <P>If they want evidence to suggest that they have too many agencies, let them go to the Committee on Public Expenditure of this House where Deputy Hugh Coveney, being the honest man he is sometimes, says that there is no need at all for the YEA.  We told them that the day they started it off.  It is a brainchild of my friends in the Labour Party, another stillborn child like the National Development Agency with phantom policies, phantom jobs, phantom everything but get the perspective right to keep the socialist souls happy.  That is what those boys said.  It is a non-runner, and the same end result will be forthcoming from <Col N="455" /> the National Development Corporation if it ever sees the light of day.  They have spoken about it for 10 years and Deputy Bruton is going to ensure that it never materialises.  I wish that the man who is away abroad would come back and realise that we live in this little country, that we have real problems here.  There is plenty of evidence of that.  There is plenty of evidence in the papers where we read about a £100 million jobs scandal. They do not have to take it from us.  If they want to continue their public relations exercise they are only codding themselves and the time bomb they have laid will explode in their faces and all the PR releases that they issue between now and 20 June will not stop that explosion but the real explosion will come in autumn 1986.</P>

      <P>It is the responsibility of individual sanitary authorities to provide a supply of pure and wholesome water and to carry out periodic bacteriological tests of the supply at regular intervals together with occasional chemical tests when the sanitary authority considers it desirable. Following the discovery of the pollution of the water supply serving Ballyshannon in January, 1984 the sanitary authority discontinued the Ardpatton Lough source as a public water supply.  The county medical officer arranged that a number of samples be taken from the water system and sent to the public analyst for testing.  These samples were subjected to chemical and physical analysis, examination for bio-chemical oxygen demand and bacteriological analysis. These sampling and testing procedures were carried out on a daily basis until the county medical officer was satisfied that the water supply was fit for human consumption. Further tests were carried out following restoration of the supply and these confirmed that all traces of the pollution had disappeared.</P>

      <P>Enforcement of the provisions of the Litter Act, 1982, is a matter for local authorities.  I am satisfied that the powers conferred by this Act to control and prevent litter are adequate. Detailed statistics on implementation aspects are not available in my Department but I understand that 429 prosecutions for various offences were taken by local authorities in the first two years of operation of the Act.</P>
      <P>While I have repeatedly urged local authorities vigorously to enforce the provisions of the Act and to make maximum use of the strengthened powers which it gives them, I am convinced that litter problems can only be solved fully with the support and co-operation of the general public.  It is vital that schools, residents' associations and other community groups become actively involved in measures to improve the tidiness and quality of their local environments.  I recently launched a special environmental awareness programme which is aimed at developing a greater appreciation of environmental values and of the need to safeguard our environmental resources.  The programme is being funded by my Department and I anticipate that the litter problem will be one of the areas to which attention will be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Arbitration finding to which the Deputy refers related to a claim by Garda staff interests that all allowances paid to members of the force should be reckonable for superannuation purposes. The claim was submitted to arbitration, and the arbitrator recommended that a number of the Garda allowances should be so reckonable.  However, the arbitrator specified 1 October 1982 as the commencement date for the settlement recommended by him.  Accordingly the finding is directly applicable only in respect of members who retired on or after that date.</P>
      <P>Subsequent to the publication of the Arbitration report, the Garda Síochána Pensioners' Association requested that the scope of the finding be extended to include Garda pensioners who are not covered by its terms i.e., members who retired before the commencement date specified by the arbitrator.  Unfortunately, because of the number of pensioners involved, such extension would have entailed considerable extra costs for the Exchequer.  For that reason, having regard to the current position in relation to the public finances, I regret that it was not possible to accede to the association's request.</P>
      <P>I sympathise with the Garda pensioners and widows affected by this outcome. Moreover I wish to assure the Deputy that the decision in this case, which was necessitated by budgetary constraints, was not due to any lack of appreciation on the Government's part for the sterling service given by the members of the Garda Síochána since the foundation of the State.</P>

Accordingly the amount of unemployment benefit which he received from 15 January 1985 to 27 February 1985 was treated as paid on account of disability benefit.

      <P>To qualify for a free telephone rental allowance a person in receipt of a qualifying payment must be living alone or only with children under 15 years of age or other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon aid in an emergency. According to the Department's records the person concerned is residing with his wife and their fourteen year old son. From the medical evidence furnished the applicant's wife is not incapacitated as required by the scheme and his application was therefore rejected.  The applicant was notified of this decision and the reason for it on 29 January 1985.</P>

      <P>The person concerned had been in receipt of widow's non-contributory pension at the weekly rate of £44.65 in respect of herself and two qualified children.  One of her children reached 18 years on 6 April 1985 and in the absence of evidence to show that he is receiving full time education by day (in which event payment would be made for him up to 21 years of age) he cannot be regarded as a qualified child from that date.</P>
      <P>The rate of pension payable to the widow was consequently reduced to £27.05 a week.  This is the appropriate rate for a widow with one qualified child and whose weekly means exceed £28 but do not exceed £30.  She is assessed with means of £28.61 a week, derived from a farm holding.  If the child in question is still in full time education, the form which was sent to the person concerned should be certified by the school authorities and returned to the Department.

      <P>Evidence of satisfactory title to the additional land being acquired for the extension of Murlog national school, County Donegal, has not yet been furnished to my Department on behalf of the school authorities.  It is understood that following the recent grant of planning permission the transfer documents have been executed and the required evidence will be submitted to my Department on completion of the usual registration formalities. My Department will then be in a position to sanction a grant for the proposed extension and to arrange for the detailed planning of the project to be undertaken.</P>

The next stage in the planning process is the submission by the school authorities of the bill of quantities and the tender documents.  These documents are awaited in the Department.  Pending completion of the planning process I am not in a position to say when the building of the new school will be commenced.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">

      <P>Scoil Ard Mhuire, Oberstown, Lusk, County Dublin is a certified reformatory school for boys and, together with Trinity House School, Oberstown, forms the Oberstown youth centre.  Scoil Ard Mhuire is an `open' special school and boys are referred there by the courts and by the health boards.</P>
      <P>The decision to close Scoil Ard Mhuire was taken as a matter of policy for the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
      <P>1.  Though able to accommodate 60 boys Scoil Ard Mhuire has seldom if even had more than 45 boys on its books at any one time.  Indeed in recent years this figure has dropped to 30 boys and below.</P>
      <P>2.  The level of referrals to Scoil Ard Mhuire has dropped substantially in recent years.  It is now clear that there is more than enough accommodation available in the other `open' special schools to cater for all referrals from the courts to `open' residential settings.</P>
      <P>3.  There is a strong trend, not only in Ireland but elsewhere, against the treatment of comparatively minor young offenders in centralised, `open' institutions.  The thrust now is towards small, community-based interventions.</P>

      <P>The following are the criteria applied by AnCO in engaging outside firms or consultants to provide external training:</P>
      <P>&mdash;the competitiveness of the fees they charge;</P>
      <P>&mdash;their particular training expertise especially as regards training the unemployed;</P>
      <P>&mdash;the training facilities available to them;</P>
      <P>&mdash;their performance and results in respect of previous training undertaken by them;</P>
      <P>&mdash;their ability to operate in locations where training needs exist which cannot be met more efficiently or effectively from other AnCO programmes;</P>
      <P>&mdash;their knowledge of industry's skill needs and their supporting contracts in industry;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;the need for a particular skill in the labour market which may not be <Col N="361" /> readily available from within AnCO's other programmes.</P>
    <P>Appropriate firms or consultants are selected on a tendering basis.  Tendering documents in respect of each course give the following details:</P>
    <P>(a)  Resources &mdash; both physical and manpower,</P>
    <P>(b)  Course design,</P>
    <P>(c)  Cost of providing the course.</P>
    <P>Based on the criteria as outlined above and the tendering information, AnCO appoints the most suitable firm-consultants to provide the course.  At present 102 firms-consultants are providing courses.</P>
    <P>From January 1 1984 to date a total of 449 firms-consultants were engaged to provide external training courses.  These provided 875 courses.  A wide range of courses were provided under four categories:</P>
    <P>&mdash;Enterprise programmes,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Business programmes,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Career development programmes,</P>
    <P>&mdash;Equal opportunity programmes.</P>
    <P>From January 1, 1984 to date the total amount paid to firms-consultants was £11,850,000, out of which their costs of instructors, administration, training, materials, equipment and accommodation have to be met.  The amount of fees paid to each firm-consultant is not readily available but I will forward it to the Deputy as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>My Department have not received an application for redundancy lump sum payment <Col N="362" /> from the employee concerned.  Such application would, in any event, have to be accompanied by a redundancy certificate issued by the liquidator of the company as the employer's representative.</P>
      <P>I understand that a redundancy certificate has not yet been issued in this case as the employee is in dispute with the liquidator in regard to the date of termination of his employment.  If agreement cannot be reached, it is open to the employee to appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal for a determination of the case.</P>
      <P>When the employee's entitlement has been determined, an application for payment from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund should be submitted to my Department, accompanied by the relevant redundancy certificate.  Such application will be dealt with expeditiously by the Department.</P>
