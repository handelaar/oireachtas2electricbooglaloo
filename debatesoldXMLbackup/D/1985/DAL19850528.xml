    <Speaker pid="FrankFahey" hpid="Mr. F. Fahey Mr. F. Fahey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if he had any discussions with politicians or emigration authorities in the United States in an effort to ease restrictions on the number of illegal emigrants at present in the United States; and the numbers now emigrating on a daily basis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not raise the question of illegal emigrants in the United States.  I was concerned to get an enlargement of the legal quota of summer work visas for Irish students.  As the Deputy will recall, I announced during my visit there a decision by the American administration to increase this quota to the extent that Ireland now has the benefit of one half of all summer student visas allocated to European countries this year &mdash; an increase of 70 per cent over last year's Irish figure.</P>
      <P>As to the second part of the Deputy's question, I understand that 555 immigrant visas were issued last year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that a very large number of young Irish people who are at present in <Col N="2194" /> the United States are in difficult circumstances?  Can he tell the House of any efforts which he or his Government might make to alleviate or improve their position?  I want to make it clear to the Taoiseach that I am talking of young people who are already in the United States as distinct from any young people who may yet go there.  I am talking about a number of people who are there, some of them perhaps illegally, and who are in a very unhappy and difficult position.  I should like the Taoiseach to tell us if anything can be done to improve their situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that if he is talking about people who are in the United States illegally obviously there are severe limits on the action our Government can take in relation to people in that position.  The only thing that might be helpful in that regard would be if the United States Government were to decide to introduce an amnesty for those who are there, as distinct from those who might go there in the future.  However, I have no reason to believe that is probable.  Otherwise, we are limited in what action we can take if people are in the United States illegally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach will recall that legislation was brought forward on one occasion to grant an amnesty but unfortunately it fell because of developments in regard to the presidential election.  Would the Taoiseach not agree it would be desirable that the Irish Government should make every effort to have some such legislation reactivated so that the position of these young people might be put on a proper basis?  The Taoiseach is probably aware that many of them cannot return home, even in the most distressing and humanitarian situation, in case they will not be allowed to return.  Further, will the Taoiseach agree that, of course, the right solution to this whole problem would be for him and for his Government to change their policies completely and pursue rational, economic policies that would provide employment for these young people, rather than forcing them to emigrate?</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a separate question.  It does not arise on Question No. 1.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, I am aware of his view that simultaneously we should reduce borrowing, increase expenditure and reduce taxation but he has not yet enlightened me on the arithmetic behind that calculation or how he can do anything about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach should not be smart.  He should just answer the question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be nice if the Taoiseach did something useful in America.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The question raised by the Deputy with what would appear from his last remark to be a certain lack of sincerity is a serious matter which should not be treated in the way the Deputy is now treating it.  Obviously there is a problem in respect of young Irish people who may be in the United States illegally and who may hold employment there. We must have regard to what action on our part, if any, might be helpful and what action on our part might be unhelpful in respect of raising the profile of the problem.  That is why I hesitated in developing the issue.  With regard to an amnesty, obviously it would be very helpful if that came about.  It is a matter that came up for discussion in the United States with members of Irish-American organisations there who are particularly concerned with the problem.  The Government would have to consider carefully whether it would be opportune to raise that matter with the United States Government or if it did not succeed whether it might make more problems for the people concerned than those existing already.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; to establish the true extent of the numbers that are there and if the Taoiseach will accept from me that the numbers run into thousands and thousands, that there has been a mass exodus from this country to the United States?  I know he prefers not to know <Col N="2197" /> about it.  It is easier to bring down the unemployment figures &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware, as are most of my colleagues, of the Taoiseach's genuine concern for the thousands of young Irish people in the United States at present who are regarded as illegal immigrants and are, if you like, only one step ahead of the posse in order to remain.  Would the Taoiseach reinforce his efforts to get an amnesty for these young people, many of whom &mdash; through taxpayers' efforts here &mdash; have professions which would be very valuable in the States, have employers prepared to employ them but, because they cannot get work permits, are working in bars and other places not suited to their qualifications?  As the Taoiseach well knows the United States &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to the substance of Deputy Glenn's question, I accept the genuineness of her concern about the problem, and we are concerned about it, but what we have to consider is the extent to which raising a question about amnesty with the United States authorities would be likely to be helpful in the circumstances.  I certainly am giving consideration to that.  As I said, it is a matter that came up in my discussions with Irish-American organisations there. We have to make a judgment on what might be the best way to proceed in that matter in the interests of the people we are talking about here.</P>

      <P>What is wrong about raising an amnesty?  It was raised before by the Americans themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is one thing for the Americans to raise a question about amnesty for illegal immigrants generally but it is another thing for the Irish Government to draw particular attention to young people there in a manner that might be inimical to their interests, as they perceive them, which the Deputy does not seem to be very concerned about&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That figure would be very improbable because there is no way in which the number could be of that order of magnitude given the fact that the total flow of people emigrating from the country that we know about is so <Col N="2199" /> much smaller than that.  For example, the labour survey of 1983 showed the total number of school leavers emigrating at 1,500.  Therefore the Deputy's figures are completely&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that it was his sole intervention which persuaded the Americans to grant the extra 700 work permits this summer, which is much appreciated?  But, in view of the fact that there are over 1,000 people who still have applied for such permits, would the Taoiseach be prepared to explore other possibilities to increase the Irish quota?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>We have increased the figure by 70 per cent by comparison with those for last year and with the figure initially proposed for this year.  We now have half the European total, which is a remarkable achievement, as I think Deputy Manning was indicating.  The question of whether there is any possibility of improving on that is a moot point.  I certainly would like to do so if I could and I am looking at the position at present but I am not certain that we will be able to do much more than we have done already.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not encouraging illegal immigration.  The student work <Col N="2201" /> visa arrangements are operated in conjunction with the organisations here and in the United States and do provide an opportunity for Irish students to work remuneratively in America, to assist them with their studies and indeed in some cases to help them accumulate savings.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 3 together.</P>
      <P>My Department have already proposed the introduction of a temporary lamb classification scheme which would be brought into operation quickly pending the introduction of a full scale scheme at a later stage.  This temporary scheme, which would relate to conformation and fatness, would provide a basis for reflecting market requirements and allow for pricing arrangements related to quality. Regrettably, however, the proposal was not acceptable to certain sectors of the sheep industry and further consultations are now taking place with them.  The introduction of classification arrangements is most desirable in the interests of our export trade.  I would hope that agreement on an appropriate system can be reached at an early date.</P>

      <P>We suggested a simple type of scheme.  As the Deputy is aware, the more elaborate scheme would involve approximately 25 different classes.  We opted for a much simpler scheme which could be carried out with existing departmental staff at the meat factories, with the veterinary inspector in charge, but with the support and assistance of the Department's classification personnel. This could be introduced quickly &mdash; as soon as the autumn &mdash; being a trial scheme and its entire cost would be borne by the State.  However, the IFA indicated that they could not opt for this scheme <Col N="2203" /> and sought a more elaborate one using the Euro-grid and insisted any scheme should be implemented by the Department's classification staff instead of the vet staff.  We got over that one.  The very elaborate one would involve legislation. We threw out that suggestion to them and it was rejected.  We have had talks with the IFA again and asked them to spell out in writing their commitment to a classification scheme and their views on the nature of such a scheme.  Above all we want to know whether they would be prepared to subscribe, in the event of extra costs, to a full scale scheme.</P>

      <P>Our lack of success is something that occurred recently.  In fact, we were more than optimistic because what we had to offer was very simple. We were talking about three fat classes and two conformation classes.  It would be a trial and error type of operation and people would be gradually introduced into it.  The difficulties about forging ahead without the co-operation of the industry are so great that I would not even contemplate them.  For instance, the bulk of lambs are bought live.  We need co-operation.</P>

      <P>There is a demand for high quality on the French market.  They are looking for lambs of approximately 40 lbs. dead weight while the average carcass here would be about 50 lbs.  We are engaged in an educational programme &mdash; it was evident at the Spring Show &mdash; to encourage our producers to breed the type of animal suitable for the French market.  It is very difficult to compel anybody to do anything.  At the moment factories are paying by weight and there is not a lot of cribbing about what is being sent in.  If we are to get our rightful share of the French market we will have to aim at producing the type of animal required by the French.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>A comprehensive range of facilities and incentives is already available from various State agencies to assist and encourage the processing and marketing of agricultural products.  The level of grant aid available to the food industry for investment in facilities for the processing and marketing of agricultural products is, in fact, more favourable than that available to industry generally. This is due to the fact that grant aid from the IDA is supplemented in many cases by additional aid from the EC Commission under Regulation 355/77.  The IDA also makes grant aid available to individual firms to carry out research into new products and new markets.  This is in addition to the facilities provided by bodies such as An Foras Talúntais, UCC and the IIRS for product research and development.</P>
      <P>With regard to marketing, exports of most of the main agricultural products are already being promoted or carried on by centralised bodies such as CBF and Bord Bainne, while assistance to exports generally is provided by Córas Tráchtála.</P>
      <P>The level of State assistance to the food industry for processing and marketing is substantial despite the difficult Exchequer situation and bearing in mind the constraints imposed by EC regulations as to the type of assistance which can be provided.  It is, of course, a matter for the industry itself to make the fullest use of the facilities available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is the policy of my Department to <Col N="2206" /> encourage the food industry to diversify away from commodity type products such as carcase beef, butter and skim milk powder, and to move into consumer type products which are less vulnerable to changes in EC policy and have a much greater employment and value-added content.  Because of the importance which the Government attach to this strategy, the grant-aiding agencies have been asked to give priority to investment projects related to consumer-type products and to satisfy themselves that the marketing arrangements of individual firms seeking grant aid are adequate.</P>

While it is important to get all the various strands together, as suggested by the Deputy, it is very difficult to see how one can bring all the groups together.

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No specific sum is allocated to this country for the promotion of the school milk scheme.  The quantity of milk supplied under the scheme in 1984 was 1.7 million gallons which received an EC subsidy of just over £2 million.  If all eligible schoolchildren were participating some seven million gallons of milk would be utilised and the EC subsidy would be <Col N="2209" /> about £8 million.  There is already provision in the scheme whereby certain milk products such as cheese and yoghurt may be substituted for whole milk.</P>
    <P>I have repeatedly encouraged greater participation in the scheme and in this connection I have had discussions with representatives of teachers and the dairies.  The National Dairies Association and the National Dairy Council have also been most active in seeking to increase participation and their efforts in this respect are to be commended.  The NDC have, in fact, recently recruited some 70 unemployed young people to canvass schools and help with the distribution of the milk.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> In view of the fact that we could have attracted a subsidy of £8 million from the EC surely there is room to promote the scheme more positively than it is being promoted at the moment?  Can the Minister say why the scheme is not being taken up by the various schools?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a lot of reasons.  In the past few years the NDC have been extremely active in promoting the scheme.  One of the problems identified is the lack of refrigeration and canteen facilities in schools and the extra work involved for teachers in distributing milk and collecting money.  To offset these difficulties quite a number of dairies are now offering incentives to schools, such as refrigerating units while others are supplying milk free of charge.  The Minister had talks recently with the dairies and with the teachers' union and in the course of public addresses both he and I stressed the benefits of the scheme and encouraged greater participation in it.  The greatest single problem is the lack of refrigeration.  I look at some of the schemes in the UK where it is more successful.  Many of the schools there are fitted with refrigerated containers where milk is supplied in five gallon cartons. Flavouring is also supplied separately. Apparently that is a way to encourage greater participation.</P>

      <P>Issues relating to the reopening of these plants are matters for the receiver of the Clover Group and the various firms which are understood to be interested in purchasing the plants.  My Department's functions relate primarily to the health and hygiene aspects and activities at meat plants as well as to the EC support and trading conditions under which the meat industry operates.  Every effort continues to be made to ensure that these conditions are as favourable as possible for the industry.</P>

      <P>Why is the Minister of State trying to wash his hands of this issue which is a basic one for the Minister for Agriculture and the meat factory in Waterford?  Is he aware of the rumours in the Waterford-South Kilkenny area in particular to the effect that the recent purchaser of Clover Meats put down a deposit and does not intend to complete the purchase?  The rumour is that the purpose is to ensure that it is never opened so that it will not be a rival to his existing meat companies.</P>

      <P>We are meeting Bord na gCon in order to try to work out something.  Falling attendances and consequential reduction in betting turnover have affected the board's finances seriously and, as a result, prize money grants have had to be reduced and amenity grants frozen except for essential equipment at the tracks.  In 1984, in an effort to reduce tax avoidance and increase levy returns, the board introduced an incentive scheme whereby amounts which exceeded levy targets set for individual tracks were divided equally between the board, the tracks concerned and the prize money at the tracks.  In addition the Government this year decided to remove the 1.5 per cent stamp duty from on-course betting with the bookmakers.  The board responded by reducing the levy by 1 per cent thereby reducing the overall take from bookmakers to 5 per cent.  Early signs indicate that these remedial measure are having the desired effect.  Bord na gCon have been asked to furnish a memorandum on the <Col N="2216" /> present state of the greyhound industry and particularly on their own overall financial situation.  It is expected that this report will come to hand shortly.</P>

      <P>There is a backlog of outstanding cases.  Is the Minister aware that at least 6,000 farmers were denied grant aid because of the introduction of a prior written approval clause on 9 February 1983?  Will he now pay those farmers their due entitlements under the scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Aid for farm buildings and equipment under the scheme was suspended in the budget of 9 February 1983.  Applications on hand on 9 February 1983 where approval had not been issued were not further proceeded with. A revised farm modernisation scheme was introduced with effect from 3 January <Col N="2223" /> 1984.  Farmers whose applications had not been processed when grants for buildings and fixed assets were suspended on 9 February 1983, and who did not proceed with the works during the suspension, qualify for grants under the revised scheme provided the works in question still qualify and provided the farmer remains eligible.</P>
      <P>Investment aid under the farm modernisation scheme is paid only on works carried out with the prior written approval of the farm development service. Works undertaken during the suspension of the scheme, where written approval had not issued by 9 February, are therefore not eligible for grant aid.  Representations have been made to have all applications lodged with the farm development service on 9 February 1983 processed.  At that time it would have cost about £5.5 million.  Information is not available as to the number of these farmers who have gone ahead with their projects since 9 February 1983.  It is estimated, however, that grants represented by projects undertaken would be of the order of £3 million.  The matter is being considered and that is all I can tell the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am objecting to this procedure whereby the words, &ldquo;by <Col N="2333" /> agreement are used at the outset of what is a guillotine procedure.  The motion represents a major change in Standing Orders in relation to that most vital aspect of business, Question Time, which is the only time in the House, apart from budget day, when the Public Gallery is likely to be full.</P>
      <P>This item proposes to alter Question Time fundamentally, to make a major change of a most undemocratic nature. The use of the guillotine is perhaps an appropriate undemocratic and jackboot method of pushing through this undemocratic change.  On behalf of The Workers' Party I must object to this guillotining of an item to which we have tabled 29 amendments.  We have not played any part in this motion being brought before the House.  We were not advised of it at any stage.  Even when the Committee on Procedure and Privileges reached their decision regarding this change, that decision was not conveyed to us.  A week or so ago you advised me that the decision could not be communicated to anyone other than members of the committee but apparently news of the decision was available to members of the press and to practically everybody in the House but ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is being proposed is an attempt to prevent us from moving the amendments we have tabled to the motion and from demonstrating the point that the change is a drastic and most undemocratic interference with the rights of Members of the House.  If the House agrees that there shall be no amendments other than those set down by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, who of course has no amendment to put down, we will be specifically pushing the motion through but not allowing any amendment to be voted on.  Only a minority of Deputies make use of Question Time but I trust that those who are in that category would support us in the amendments we are attempting to have accepted.  Specifically what I am objecting to now is the guillotine or the jackboot method of the Taoiseach, obviously with the agreement of the Leader of the Opposition, to have the motion accepted.  Since we are told <Col N="2334" /> that there has been agreement on this matter, it is obvious that both Government and the main Opposition agree that the motion should be put through the House as rapidly as possible, with a minimum of fuss and without allowing opportunity for voting on amendments.  The attitude is, &ldquo;let us hope it will not be noticed.  Then we will have total control again of the proceedings and will silence all opposition&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>
        <i>Dún Laoghaire):</i> I reject the accusation that the proposal in regard to the motion is in any way undemocratic or designed to silence any Deputy.  The whole purpose of the changes being proposed is to assist Deputies in putting questions to Ministers on a more regular basis.  That could not be deemed in any way to be undemocratic.  Anyone who reads the motion will find that there is no reduction in the amount of time being allocated to Question Time.  On the contrary, the Government have decided to extend Question Time by 15 minutes.</P>
      <P>I suggest that a three and a half hour debate on any item is generous.  It is a matter for the Deputy concerned and for the Chair to decide on the way in which the amendments will be taken.  The wording used in proposing a limited debate on this motion is the standard wording in these cases.  We will be representing the motion to the House and hoping that any Deputy who wishes to contribute will do so.  There is no question of trying to push the motion through the House.  I reject totally the allegation that we are behaving in a totally undemocratic fashion. When we are speaking to the motion, I shall deal with the other aspects of Deputy Mac Giolla's remarks.</P>

      <P>(1)  In relation to Questions for oral answer appearing on the Order Paper, the following provisions shall apply as and from 11 June, 1985, and for a period of one year:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  Questions addressed to the Taoiseach may be asked only on a Tuesday or Wednesday and shall be placed on the Order Paper before Questions to other members of the Government to be asked on the same day;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  Questions addressed to other <Col N="2339" /> members of the Government may be asked on the basis of a daily rota as set out in the Schedule hereto and shall be in two categories:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Questions, the sequence of which shall be decided by lottery, and</P>
    <P>(ii)  Questions nominated for priority by a group [as defined by Standing Order 85 (1)] in Opposition;</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>(c)  In relation to Questions comprehended by subparagraph (b) (i) of this paragraph, the following provisions shall apply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  No Member may put down more than two Questions to each member of the Government for answer on any one day;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Questions must reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth day preceding that on which they are to be asked, not reckoning a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday;</P>
    <P>(iii)  Where the rota set out in the Schedule hereto provides that Questions to two members of the Government are to be asked on the same day, Questions to the member to whom the lesser number is addressed shall be placed first on the Order Paper and shall be allocated not more than one half of the time available to both;</P>
    <P>(iv)  The sequence in which the Questions addressed to each member of the Government will appear on the Order Paper shall be determined by lottery, at which Members may attend, which shall be held on the fourth day preceding that on which the Questions are to be asked, not reckoning a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday;</P>

    <P>(b)  such answer would, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle, prejudice the answering of a Question which has been entered in the lottery or which has been nominated for priority for the next day on which the member of the Government to whom the question is addressed is to answer;</P>
    <P>(d)  The provisions of subparagraph (c) (ii) of this paragraph shall also apply in the case of Questions addressed to the Taoiseach;</P>
    <P>(e)  In relation to Questions comprehended by subparagraph (b) (ii) of this paragraph, the following provisions shall apply:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(i)  Each Question shall be in the name of a Member nominated by a group and must reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the third day preceding that on which it is to be asked, not reckoning a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday;</P>
    <P>(ii)  Questions nominated for priority for any one day shall be placed on the Order Paper so as to rotate between groups in Opposition, with preference being given to the larger group: provided that the number of such Questions for any one day appearing on the Order Paper shall not exceed five;</P>
    <P>(iii)  Supplementary questions may be put only by the Member in whose <Col N="2341" /> name the Question appears on the Order Paper;</P>
    <P>(iv)  If any Question is not reached, the member of the Government to whom the Question is addressed shall cause an answer to be provided in the Official Report of the Debates unless</P>
    <P>(a)  the Member in whose name the Question appears on the Order Paper indicates, before 4 p.m. on that day, that the Question has again been nominated for priority or requests that the Question be entered in the lottery for the next day on which the member of the Government to whom the Question is addressed is to answer, or</P>
    <P>(b)  such answer would, in the opinion of the Ceann Comhairle, prejudice the answering of a Question which has been entered in the lottery or which has been nominated for priority for the next day on which the member of the Government to whom the Question is addressed is to answer;</P>
    <P>(f)  The Order Paper governing each sitting of the Dáil on a Tuesday or Wednesday shall also contain Questions, other than Questions nominated for priority, for answer on the following day;</P>
    <P>(g)  Questions shall be taken from 2.30 p.m. to 3.45 p.m.: Provided that the time allowed in the case of Questions comprehended by subparagraphs (a) and (b) (i) of this paragraph shall not exceed one hour; and the time allowed in the case of Questions comprehended by subparagraph (b) (ii) of the paragraph shall not exceed fifteen minutes;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Barrett</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> The motion before the House seeks to alter quite substantially present practices and procedures in relation to oral Parliamentary Questions.  I should like to point out that there is practically no alteration to the procedure dealing with written Parliamentary Questions.  The reasons for the change in the oral Parliamentary Questions system are self-evident. Because of the large number of questions on the Order Paper, there is a very slow rotation of Ministers during Question Time.  Moreover, at the beginning of each new Dáil session, the existing rotation system starts anew.  Consequently, Ministers near the end of the sequence who are not reached at the end of the previous session begin the next session again at the end.  To give an example of the delays which occur between Ministers answering oral questions under the present system, the Minister for Justice, Education and Labour have not answered oral questions in the Chamber since the beginning of 1984.  It is evident, therefore, that there is need for change so that there can be a quicker rotation of Ministers answering questions.  As a result of the slow rotation of Ministers, when oral questions are eventually answered, they are frequently out of date and have lost <Col N="2344" /> much of their relevance.  In these circumstances the Committee on Procedure and Privileges considered ways in which procedure could be improved.  The most efficient method of improving the rotation of Ministers at Question Time is to introduce a rota system under which each Minister is allocated a specific day on which he or she will answer as many oral Parliamentary Questions as time permits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The committee also considered the problem which the Ceann Comhairle has in relation to dealing with supplementary questions and it was felt that he should be given support in trying to get through questions as quickly as possible so that as many as possible can be answered in the hour allowed for Question Time.  Of course, that depends on the co-operation of the House and on each individual Member.  It is to everybody's advantage that we get through as many questions as possible, at the same time giving the Deputies, especially the Member who tabled the question, the right to ask a supplementary question.  The rotation system was decided on by the committee and we then had to deal with the problem of how questions could be listed on the Order Paper.  The obvious and most simple method would be by the first come, first served basis.  However, this would have been unfair to Deputies who, for one reason or another, could not queue outside the questions office to ensure that their questions were submitted early enough to be at the top of the list.  In other words, a rural Deputy who was not here on the appointed day would be at a distinct disadvantage if he or she had to depend on the goodwill of other Deputies to allow their questions to appear high up on the Order Paper.  The only solution we could find, which is fair to everybody, is the lottery system and also to restrict the number of questions per Deputy to two.  Because of the new system of rotation of Ministers, they will be in the Chamber more frequently answering questions and, therefore, the present system of questions remaining on the Order Paper for anything up to two years will disappear and every Deputy <Col N="2345" /> will have a better chance of having his or her question answered.</P>
    <P>An important feature of oral Parliamentary Questions is the asking of supplementaries.  As Ministers will, under the new scheme, be answering oral questions much more frequently, briefing on very complex questions will also be required more frequently.  Accordingly, the Committee on Procedures and Privileges agree that the period of notice for oral Parliamentary Questions should be extended by one day, that is from three days' notice to four days' notice.</P>
    <P>However, in a further effort to provide time for debate on important questions which might not have obtained a high enough place in the lottery, the Government and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided that an additional 15 minutes Question Time would be provided each day under which groups in Opposition could ask the Minister or Ministers to answer not more than five priority questions.  There has been some misunderstanding about the reasons for our change and for adding 15 minutes priority Question Time.</P>
    <P>In devising the new system we were very conscious not to interfere with the right of every Deputy, irrespective of party, to ask a question.  Question Time is not for political parties.  It is for individual Members to ask a question.  We were very conscious not to interfere with the one hour Question Time being provided each day.  To suggest that this new system will discriminate against smaller parties is inaccurate for the simple reason that every Deputy has the right to table two questions and every Deputy has an equal chance of coming out of the lottery high on the list.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i>&mdash;&mdash;that he, as Leader of The Workers' Party, regards Question Time as the period during which parties ask questions.  Individual Deputies have the right to ask questions, irrespective of the party he or she belongs to and if one checks the Order Paper it will be clear that Deputies of all parties and Independents ask questions.  Each Deputy should have the same right and under this new system every Deputy will have the right to ask two questions and every Deputy has the same chance of coming out of the lottery.</P>
      <P>In providing an additional 15 minutes the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Government recognised that parties in Opposition from time to time have important national questions to ask. We applied the same principle as applies in ordering Private Members' Business or in dealing with Private Members' Bills. This means that a party, parties or group in Opposition could ask up to five priority questions.  I will remind the House that this in no way interferes with the hour already provided for individual Deputies to ask a question.  This additional 15 minutes is to provide groups in Opposition with the opportunity of asking important national questions which may not have come up high enough in the lottery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new system is experimental and will be for a period of 12 months with the commencement date of 11 June.  The reason for starting the new system on that date is that we want to have some experience of how it works before the summer recess.  We are often accused of spending time discussing matters the importance of which has since passed. The new system coupled with the additional time for priority questions and existing procedures in relation to Private Notice Questions should help to provide the basis for more up-to-date and relevant debate.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges and all the parties were conscious of the need to change the present system.  This attempt to draw up a new system on a trial basis for a 12 month period was to ensure that every Deputy had the right to ask a question, <Col N="2347" /> and we did not interfere with the hour for Question Time provided each day.</P>
    <P>If we are to rotate Ministers there must be a new system.  It would be extremely unfair to have a system of rotation where people would be queueing up to get their questions in first so that they would be on the top of the list.  This would mean that Deputies not living in the Dublin region would be at a distinct disadvantage.  If I had to have a question in by 11 a.m. on Friday and I was in Kerry, Cork or somewhere else, I would be at a distinct disadvantage compared with the person who lived a mile from this House. The only alternative we could come up with was the lottery system, which was fair.  Everyone had the same number of questions in the lottery and everybody had an equal chance of coming out of the lottery.  Every question in the lottery will be listed in the order in which they come out, from one to 50, one to 20 and so on, depending on the number of questions. It is up to the House and to Deputies to get through as many questions as possible during that one hour period.  I think this is a very fair system and I strongly recommend it to the House.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;he has agreed to the whole procedure and all he can say is &ldquo;I agree with what the Minister of State said&rdquo;.  Obviously this has been agreed for some months past.  On 15 December 1982, at column 70 of the Official Report, the Minister of State, Deputy Barrett, <Col N="2349" /> said &ldquo;I want to assure him that the Minister for Industry and Energy will guarantee that any consultations in regard to Dáil reform will be done on an all-party basis&rdquo;.  We understood from that that everyone, including Independents, would be consulted on any changes in procedure and Dáil reform.  We were totally disillusioned when the first Dáil reform came up &mdash; the new Oireachtas committees.  Not alone were we not consulted and were matters not discussed with us, but we were totally excluded from every committee, including the most recent one, Comhchoiste don Ghaeilge, established last November which I was involved in endeavouring to get established.  Committee procedure obviously was a method of ensuring that Independent Deputies and parties other than the Government and Fianna Fáil parties would be excluded from participation in all Oireachtas committees. Despite the assurance of the Minister of State on 15 December 1982, it appears that the same procedure has occurred in relation to the reform of the procedure for Question Time.</P>
      <P>Nobody denies that there is need for reform of the system in operation for Question Time.  We raised this matter about two years ago because under the existing system a Minister could evade questions for 12 months or more.  The Minister of State in moving this motion made great play of the fact that there was need for reform, as if this were the only method of reform possible.  We have shown in the 29 amendments that we have put down to this motion that there are other methods of reform which would be democratic &mdash; and let the Minister not tell me that lotteries are democratic. What is democratic about a sweepstake? Did the majority ever win in a sweepstake?  Your name is pulled out of the hat or is not pulled out of the hat and that is it.  It is extraordinary that such a system should be brought into this House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have suggested a weekly system of ministerial appearances, of allowing questions to remain on the Order Paper if Deputies so wish, to come up after, say, 15 or 16 weeks.  That would ensure <Col N="2350" /> that they would come up a couple of times a year to each Minister.  That would be quite democratic and every Deputy would have a fair chance of getting an answer to his or her question without the long delays under the present system.  We advocate also alterations in regard to the time allowed by the Ceann Comhairle and so forth.  We certainly recognise the need for reform and have emphasised this previously.  The rules of the House are based on old procedures of the British House of Commons but that Parliament have updated their procedures away ahead of ours.  Like Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael politics, our procedures appear to have remained fairly rooted in the twenties.</P>
    <P>There are many areas needing reform which have not been touched on, such as the length of recesses and the number of sitting hours.  At the moment I understand that the Dáil sits on fewer days for shorter hours in the week than almost any other Parliament in Europe.  There are widescale opportunities for reform in this area, to allow more time for debates, for Question Time and anywhere it is needed.  Nothing has been done about that.  I suppose that the present sitting arrangements suit those who are double-jobbing.  It is useful for them to be part-time Deputies.</P>
    <P>When a vote was called half an hour ago, Deputy Andrews referred to wasting time.  Voting procedures in the House should not be seen as a waste of time. There are widespread opportunities for reform in that case.  The voting procedure takes 15 to 20 minutes of the time of this House.  Vast technological improvements have taken place and no opportunity has been used to improve the voting procedure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This is taken to be an opportunity for reforming the system and there are other opportunities for giving more time &mdash; which could be another method of reform &mdash; and saving time in different ways, such as in voting <Col N="2351" /> procedures, to allow more time for Question Time.  It is much more democratic to allow questions rather than to cut the opportunity for asking questions and the number of questions which Deputies can put down.  When one restricts Deputies in regard to Question Time one must bear in mind that Private Members' Time is monopolised by Fianna Fáil to the exclusion of everybody else.  The Workers' Party have never been allocated any time since they first had a Deputy in the Dáil in 1981.  Our party have had co-operation from Deputies with regard to having amendments down to specific motions put down by Fianna Fáil during Private Members' Time.  We have been allowed five or ten minutes on occasion, with the co-operation of some Deputies and of the Ceann Comhairle.  However, we have no right to any Private Members' Time and have not had since we were elected.</P>
      <P>The only alternative method by which we can elicit information or use the opportunities of this House to fight a case on behalf of our constituents or make a policy point in regard to a ministerial area is by use of Question Time, when we have not the opportunity of Private Members' Time.  Question Time then becomes more important for Deputies of small parties and for Independent Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the area of Question Time, there are many Deputies who never ask a question. There are others who ask a few questions in the year.  There are still others who make very good use of Question Time and are very active in that area.  A look at the Order Paper will give an indication that there is a relatively small number of Deputies who are constantly on the Order Paper asking questions.  The Minister of State is being a little naive and attempting to put one across on people in saying that this new method is being fair to everybody and is not restricting Deputies but is giving everybody an equal chance.  The position is, of course, that, say, with regard to Fianna Fáil Deputies who constitute half the House, ten, 15 or 20 of these would normally be asking questions and a half dozen others would <Col N="2352" /> occasionally ask a question and quite a few would not bother at all.  Now, of course, every Deputy will be entitled to two questions under the Minister of State's procedure, so it will be Deputy Brady's job to ensure that every Fianna Fáil Deputy has two questions down every day.</P>
    <P>That will make sure that they have the best chance of being drawn out of the hat.  The Deputies who never have had the slightest idea of asking a question will be handed two questions to put down in their name.</P>

      <P>What is this lottery about, that we are all supposed to say is a great democratic procedure &mdash; pulling a name out of a hat?  The whole thing is a sham and a fraud and is an attempt to ensure that we are restricted in the number of questions we put down.  What chance have two Deputies out of 166 Members, when all of those Deputies could have two questions down making a total of 332 questions in the hat or the drum or whatever will be used to hold them for the famous lottery every day? How can anyone think that is democratic or that our party will have the same chance as anyone else?  It is obvious that this is an attempt to silence and stifle us who have made particular use of Question Time because we have been restricted everywhere else.  We are excluded from all the committees and we are not allowed the facility of using Private Members' time.  There is nothing else we can do except to ask questions.</P>
      <P>These so-called democratic reforms will mean a restriction on the most basic democratic procedure, namely, the right of Deputies to ask Ministers questions. For the first time that right is being restricted in the name of democracy.  It is the most undemocratic attempt ever to restrict Deputies in this House.  The Government cannot stand real opposition.  Fianna Fáil and the Government have got together on this.  The cosy club system is getting all worked up now because other voices are being heard, but neither the Government nor the Opposition want these embarrassing voices to be heard.  The Government do not want embarrassing questions to be asked and Fianna Fáil and they have got together to ensure that the old club remains in power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a very black day for democracy and for the credibility of this House. There has been a lot of talk in the past few years about the alienation of our <Col N="2354" /> youth, of making the House relevant to the people and so on.  All of that talk has gone out of the window now.  The youth are alienated to an increasing degree every day by what they see happening here.  It is not making the House more relevant or more democratic when people see that their Deputies are being restricted in their right to ask questions in the House on issues they have been asked to raise or which they are interested in emphasising.</P>
    <P>This motion which the Government are bashing through this House by way of guillotine is an attempt to restrict the most basic right in the most ridiculous fashion.  We will be the laughing stock in any parliament in the world that has some concept of democracy when they see the procedure here, of the bingo balls being called out at Question Time every day to see whose question is pulled out of the hat or the drum.  Will it be a question about whether the parish pump is working?  We will not know what kind of question will be selected until the day arrives. Then there will be cheers for the winners and the winners will always be in the same category except that some day, by accident, our questions will be pulled out and we will be told that will be a big day for democracy.  We may win once or twice but we may not be called for the entire 12 months.  As I see it, that is the likely position that will arise when it is well worked by both Whips to ensure that their Deputies have their questions in the hat.  Thus, there is little chance that our names will be pulled out of the hat.</P>
    <P>Another question arises: who will pull out the names?  Will it be the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle or will the staff of the House be hauled in to do the work?  Who will mix the questions in the drum?  Who will put in the questions?  How will we know our question is included?  The first thing one wants to know about any sweepstake is whether the operation is run honestly or is it merely a racket?  How will we know our questions are in?</P>

The Ceann Comhairle has referred to us frequently as &ldquo;ruly&rdquo; Deputies.  We will not be so &ldquo;ruly&rdquo; in the future if this measure is bulldozed through the House.</P>
      <P>We have endeavoured to use the procedures that exist to carry out our duty to our constituents and to our party.  In here we have used the procedures and the rules that exists but now we find the rules keep changing.  If we get more Deputies into this House the rules will change yet again.  At the moment it is necessary to have ten Deputies before calling for a Vote, as was evident 30 minutes ago.  Of course, if we had ten Deputies in the House that rule would be changed to require 15 or 20 Deputies before calling for a Vote.  The Government's concept of democracy is to change the rules when somebody comes in who might be a threat to the procedures built up here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am told I have to go through all the amendments.  It is a very strange procedure that all the amendments have to be taken together.  We have tabled 29 amendments and I will have to go through them all to explain their purpose.  We would have preferred to have a vote on them to allow Deputies to explain their position on each amendment.  However, I have been informed by the Ceann Comhairle that I must speak on all the amendments together and that there will be no vote on any of them.  Apparently there will be only one vote at 7 p.m.  It is an extraordinary procedure.  I do not want to create a row about it but I should like to know under what Standing Order this procedure is laid down.  If I have to go through all the amendments without getting a response from the Minister of State in respect of each of them, obviously that will be a most restricted <Col N="2356" /> procedure.  I am asking the Chair if I am correct in thinking that I cannot ask the Minister of State for a response after I have moved one amendment?</P>

      <P>The first amendment in the name of Deputy De Rossa and in my name is in relation to the time this new procedure will operate. According to the motion agreed by the Government and by Fianna Fáil and by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, this new system will begin on 11 June 1985.  Our amendment seeks to substitute the first sitting day after the 1985 summer recess.  The Minister of State will note that, once the Minister for Agriculture has finished, which will be tomorrow &mdash; there are only a few questions left to him &mdash; the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Education are next and their questions would be taken in the course of the month of June.  It would be important that those two Ministries be allowed to be taken, that the procedure be allowed to continue, so that those two Ministers might answer the large number of questions put down in their cases.  Having been on the Order Paper for so long it would be unfair that they would get away with this new lottery system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our amendment seeks the deletion of the words &ldquo;11 June 1985&rdquo; and the substitution therefor of the words &ldquo;the first sitting day after the 1985 Summer recess&rdquo;.  We first saw this motion on Thursday last, although it has been in existence for a number of weeks.  Indeed, rumours have been floating around since last Christmas that Fianna Fáil were proposing this system of priorities and the press had various suggestions as to what would be in those proposals.  The committee sat down and agreed their proposals.  We asked the Ceann Comhairle if we could have a copy of them and we were told no, we could not.  The first we saw of this extraordinary document was on Thursday last, leaving us only 24 hours to assess it, go through it in detail, and to put down amendments acceptable for <Col N="2357" /> today.  We had to have our amendments in on Friday last.  Democracy is right.  But they did not catch us with our pants down, we were ready for them, we have 29 amendments down and they are now doing the best they can to boot them all out without even a comment.</P>

      <P>In paragraph 1, line 5, to delete the words &ldquo;one year&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;sixteen sitting weeks&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We believe that the new procedure, whether for good or bad, will be ascertained within a short time.  The Minister has proposed that it obtain for one year, presumably to be renewed by ministerial order thereafter.  Incidentally, ministerial orders have proven to be totally undemocratic because we have been refused our rights as Deputies to introduce a motion to annul a ministerial order within the 21 days specified.  All of these ministerial orders can be bulldozed through this House without us being allowed to put down a motion for their annulment, as the Ceann Comhairle ruled a couple of weeks ago in relation to a decision of the Minister for Social Welfare when he wanted to overrule a decision of the High Court.  Therefore one must ask will this procedure continue unless a Deputy puts down a motion for its annulment.  If that is to be the procedure then it will be a wash-out because we will not be allowed to put down a motion annulling it having regard to what happened a few weeks ago.</P>
      <P>The 16 sitting weeks referred to in our amendment is the period it would take to go through all the Minister's questions. Thereafter we should be able to assess within that period whether the system is working, is democratic and is in the best interests of this House.  Certainly that is something we should examine closely.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2358" /> I would ask the Minister to review the situation after the first period of ministerial questions, that is, after 16 sitting weeks.</P>
    <P>Our amendment No. 3 reads:</P>
    <P>In paragraph (1) (b), line 3, to delete the word &ldquo;daily&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;weekly&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The proposal is that a different Minister come before the House daily whereas we are asking that that be done on a weekly basis, with each Minister answering questions on a weekly rather than on a daily basis.  If the lottery system is removed, as we will be suggesting under other motions further down, then a Minister should be allowed answer questions for the week, that is, on whatever days the Dáil is sitting within that week, with a new Minister coming in the following week.  This would mean that questions remaining on the Order Paper from the previous Minister would continue to remain there and that Minister would be back 16 sitting weeks later.  If it were done on a daily basis there would be different Ministers popping up and down with ensuing chaos.</P>
    <P>The weekly basis would afford both Ministers and their Departments a better opportunity of dealing with a number of questions, particularly similar ones, which is something the proposed procedure does not envisage.  For example, on many occasions something may occur in an area and Deputies will put down questions in regard to it.  Sometimes there may be four or five Deputies asking questions about the same subject, or even up to ten, if it is something of very great concern &mdash; perhaps some disaster or whatever. Under the Minister's proposed lottery one Deputy only will be chosen with the others being excluded.  Sometimes it is necessary for even one Deputy to ask three or four questions in order to elicit the appropriate answer to one subject. For example, in regard to agriculture and the eradication of bovine TB and brucellosis I had to put down a number of questions &mdash; one in regard to the eradication of TB, another in regard to the brucellosis, another in regard to vets, and yet <Col N="2359" /> another in regard to farmers &mdash; in order to elicit the amount paid to vets for the eradication of TB and brucellosis and the amount of compensation paid to farmers.</P>
    <P>This clearly demonstrates that a series of questions must be put down to elicit information on one subject whereas the Minister's procedure would throw that out the window completely because one would only be picked out of the hat.  A Deputy would be afforded no opportunity of asking a Minister questions in relation to other aspects of the subject on the Order Paper because the Minister will say &ldquo;That is not on the Order Paper.  I am being asked only about vets with regard to the eradication of bovine TB and the Deputy is asking about farmers' compensation for brucellosis.&rdquo;  The whole thing would turn into a real mess and no Member would get answers to the questions.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Question Time is to get answers, obtain information and not just to have one's name printed on the Order Paper.  Under the new proposal if one's questions are pulled out one will only be allowed ask two questions, but under the present procedure one is allowed put down five questions.  The chances of one having two questions selected under the new system are out the window.  I cannot see this information procedure being of benefit to any Member.  Everybody will lose out, nobody will get information and the Press will not get information.</P>

      <P>Amendment No. 4 seeks to delete subparagraph (i) and substitute, &ldquo;(i) Questions, other than those covered by subparagraph (ii)...&rdquo;. Amendment No. 5, a very important one, is as follows:</P>
      <P>In paragraph 1 (b) (ii), to delete the words &ldquo;by a group [as defined by Standing Order 85 (1) in Opposition&rdquo; and substitute the following &ldquo;by a Party in Opposition&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Under the Minister's proposal a group can put down &ldquo;priority questions&rdquo;.  I am sure the Minister will agree that other than Fianna Fáil there is no other group, as defined by Standing Order No. 85, in the House.  Standing Order No. 85 (1) states:</P>
      <P>For the purpose of this Standing Order a group shall mean&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a) any Party which had not less than seven members elected to the Dáil at the previous General Election or which, if it had less than seven, attained the number of seven members as a result of a subsequent by-election, or</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b) all Members of the Dáil being <Col N="2363" /> not less than seven in number who are not members of any such Party.</P>
    <P>Under that Standing Order there is no group, other than Fianna Fáil, in Opposition. I do not know why the Minister inserted that in the motion, giving the impression that groups were being given an opportunity.  Such groups do not exist, with the exception of Fianna Fáil.  We are asking in this amendment to delete the words &ldquo;by a group [as defined by Standing Order 85 (1)] in Opposition and substitute &ldquo;by a Party in Opposition&rdquo;.  That is a reasonable amendment and I hope the Minister will take it on board when he is replying.  That is a most important amendment because if the Minister restricts this procedure to groups covered by that Standing Order he will be restricting the whole procedure to the Fianna Fáil Party.  Neither ourselves nor any of the Independent Deputies will have an opportunity of availing of this section. The Committee on Procedure and Privileges were well aware of that when they inserted that wording.</P>
    <P>Our next amendment was to delete subparagraph (c) (i) which says:</P>
    <P>No Member may put down more than two Questions to each member of the Government for answer on any one day;</P>
    <P>When one considers our earlier proposed amendment to delete the word &ldquo;daily&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;weekly&rdquo; in relation to questions addressed to a Minister one will realise the importance in this section of removing that restriction on Deputies putting down no more than two questions.  I explained why even on one issue Deputies may wish to put down more than two questions.  I have frequently put down five six or seven questions in one day.  To restrict Deputies to two questions is putting a severe restriction on a number of Deputies who make great use of question Time.</P>
    <P>Amendment No 8. on the Order Paper proposes: In paragraph (1) (c) (ii), lines 2 and 3, to delete the words &ldquo;the fourth <Col N="2364" /> day&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;the third day&rdquo;. This paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>Questions must reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the fourth day preceding that on which they are to be asked, not reckoning a Saturday, Sunday or public holiday;</P>
    <P>The existing procedure is that questions must reach the Clerk not later than 11 a.m. on the third day preceding that on which they are to be asked.  That is a sufficient length of time and we do not see why an extra day would be required.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 10 proposes: `In paragraph (i) (c) (iii), line 5, to delete the word &ldquo;day&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;week&rdquo;.' This paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>Where the rota set out in the Schedule hereto provides that Questions to two members of the Government are to be asked on the same day, Questions to the member to whom the lesser number is addressed shall be placed first on the Order Paper and shall be allocated not more than one half of the time available to both;</P>
    <P>In line with our original proposal to have a Minister answering for a week we have asked that that be changed.  We also propose in paragraph (1) (c) (iii) to delete all the words after &ldquo;day&rdquo;.  The paragraph reads:</P>
    <P>Questions to the member to whom the lesser number is addressed shall be placed first on the Order Paper and shall be allocated not more than one half of the time available to both;</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 11 proposes at paragraph (1) (c) (iii) to insert the following subparagraph:</P>
    <P>(iv)  Where a member of the Government answers all his questions before the end of the week, the next member of the Government on the Schedule shall commence answering questions, and shall continue to answer until the end of the following week.</P>
    <P>Amendment No 12 proposes: In paragraph (1) (c) (iv), line 5 to delete the word &ldquo;lottery&rdquo; and substitute the words <Col N="2365" />&ldquo;the Ceann Comhairle&rdquo;.  We wish the sequence to be determined by the Ceann Comhairle.  With the aid of Standing Orders the Ceann Comhairle is the best equipped to decide.  It should be done by the Ceann Comhairle rather than by lottery.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 13 proposes: In subparagraph 1 (c) (iv) to delete all words after &ldquo;lottery&rdquo;.  This also relates to the lottery.  Everything related to the lottery should be deleted.  There should be some other procedure.  Amendment No. 14 proposes: In paragraph 1 (c) to delete subparagraph (v) and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>(v)  All Questions tabled by Members, other than those ruled out of order, shall be published on the Order Paper.</P>
    <P>Paragraph 1 (c) (v) says:</P>
    <P>(v) A Member nominated by a group in Opposition may, on request, be provided with the texts of Questions put down by Members of that group;</P>
    <P>This paragraph indicates that all questions will not appear on the Order Paper but only those produced from the lottery. Am I right?  We want all questions to appear on the Order Paper and we do not see a reason why they should not appear on the Order Paper.</P>

Despite requests to the Ceann Comhairle and to the committee for copies of the approved decision which had been made some weeks previously and despite efforts to find out over the last couple of months what was happening on this score, we got nothing on this until we were presented with this on Thursday last and had to work to produce amendments in 24 hours.  Therefore, maybe the Minister should have given us some indication in his opening remarks about what his proposals are if they could make any sense, or was he ashamed to describe them in detail here to the House?</P>

      <P>The Minister has suggested that I read the motion.  Perhaps I should read the whole motion out to the House.  Members have copies of it, but if the Minister wants me to read the motion I will read it.  I have read that section and the Minister has failed to explain why, if all the questions are on the Order Paper, somebody nominated by a group in Opposition could request the text of the questions.  It is a simple thing to explain if he would explain it, but I still do not understand it.  In any case, we are endeavouring to ensure by that amendment that all the questions be on the Order Paper.</P>
      <P>The next amendment is in connection with the next paragraph (1) (c) (vi) (a), again to delete the words &ldquo;in the lottery&rdquo;.  We are opposed to the lottery system, in other words, we seek that questions be just re-entered, not in the lottery, for the next day on which a member of the Government will be answering questions.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. 19 is in paragraph (1) (e) (i), line 3, to delete the word &ldquo;group&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;party&rdquo;.  The motion states that each question shall be in the name of a Member nominated by a group.  That group, I presume, in that case would also be a group as specified in Standing Order 85 (1).  We are asking that the phrase &ldquo;nominated by a group&rdquo; be altered to &ldquo;nominated by a party&rdquo;.  In paragraph (1) (e) (ii) we seek similarly to delete the word &ldquo;group&rdquo; and substitute the word &ldquo;party&rdquo;.

      <P>No, I am not down as far as that, Amendment No. 24 as on the Order Paper is in paragraph (1) (e), to delete subparagraph (iii) which provides that:</P>
      <P>(iii) Supplementary questions may be put only by the Member in whose name the Question appears on the Order Paper;</P>
      <P>I am asking that that be deleted and that that they be unrestricted in the use of supplementary questions as has always been the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In amendment No. 25 we are seeking in subparagraph (1) (e) (iv) (a) to delete &ldquo;4 p.m.&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;4.15 p.m.&rdquo;, that is to extend Question Time where the Member in whose name the question <Col N="2371" /> appears on the Order Paper indicates before 4 p.m. on that day that the question has again been nominated for priority.  We are asking that that be altered to 4.15 p.m.</P>
    <P>Amendment No. 26 is again in paragraph (1) (e) (iv) (a), line 7, to delete the words &ldquo;in the lottery&rdquo;.  We have done that previously in another section.  It says here &ldquo;that the Question be entered in the lottery.&rdquo;  We want to say &ldquo;that the Question be entered for the next day on which the member of the Government to whom the Question is addressed is to answer&rdquo; without any lottery.  Amendment No. 28 reads:</P>
    <P>In paragraph (1) (g), line 2, to delete the words &ldquo;from 2.30 p.m. to 3.45 p.m.&rdquo; and substitute the words &ldquo;from 2.30 p.m. to 4 p.m.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>We want to extend Question Time from an hour to an hour and a half, whereas the Minister is extending it from an hour to an hour and a quarter.  This would mean that the questions could be completed without restriction.  Amendment No. 29 reads:</P>
    <P>In paragraph (1) (g), line 6, to delete the words &ldquo;one hour&rdquo; and substitute the following &ldquo;one hour and a quarter&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That is in line with the extra quarter of an hour.  Amendment No. 30 reads:</P>
    <P>After paragraph (1) (g) to insert the following subparagraph:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(h) When the Dáil sits on Friday, Questions shall also be answered on that day&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>There is ample opportunity to provide more time for questions and to speed up the whole process.  When we sit on Friday there is no Question Time.  I do not see any reason for that.  We suggest that when the Dáil sits on Friday there should be a Question Time.  We could then get through questions in a democratic manner without restrictions and without <Col N="2372" /> lotteries.  Amendment No. 31 proposes to delete paragraph (2) which reads:</P>
    <P>(2) The member of the Government concerned shall, in respect of each Question appearing on the Order Paper governing the sitting immediately prior to the coming into effect of paragraph 1 of this Order and not reached, cause an answer to be provided in the Official Report of the Debates for that day.</P>
    <P>In amendment No. 32 we are suggesting that the schedule should be altered.  We want to delete the schedule and substitute:</P>

    <P>Those are the 31 amendments we put down in an attempt to restore some elements of democratic practice and procedure to Question Time.  The Minister has produced an extraordinary document restricting the number of questions a Deputy can put down, having them pulled from some type of lottery, restricting Deputies in asking supplementary questions for another quarter of an hour. Those are grave restrictions on the rights of Deputies at Question Time.</P>
    <P>Our amendments are designed to endeavour to restore democracy during Question Time.  The Minister may not agree with our amendments in which we want to delete the lottery system and <Col N="2373" /> extend ministerial answers for a day to a week.  Although we believe they are reasonable proposals, the Minister may not agree with them.  We ask the Minister to take on board other amendments such as postponing the implementation of this proposal until the autumn which we believe is essential and extending the period of Question Time and having Question Time on Fridays.  We have made a whole series of suggestions which would ensure that Questions went through more rapidly, that Deputies were given more time to ask questions and that Ministers came into the House every week to answer them.  After 16 weeks their turn would come around again.  This would be a much more democratic method of reform than the one the Minister has produced.</P>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla has made a very strong case for major reform not only of Parliamentary Question Time but also of many other aspects of Standing Orders and activities within the House.  There is hardly any Deputy who would not agree that the whole system of Question Time requires a very radical and major change.  The sooner we introduce such change the better for this House and for democracy as a whole.  At one time Question Time was looked upon quite correctly as one the principal features of Dáil business.  The whole purpose of Question Time was to enable a Deputy to pursue a particular matter which he or she considered vital at international, national or constitutency level.  Originally questions of a local nature were submitted only when a Deputy was unable to obtain a satisfactory reply from a Minister on a matter of some importance.  When I first came into the House on 1977, Question Time was much more relevant.  I can recall many Ministers anticipating having to take questions with certain amount of trepidation and unease.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government had to deal with a tough Opposition in those days.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition spokesman or a backbencher generally on the Opposition side asked these questions. Naturally most questions come from the Opposition side so the relevance of whether the Opposition were tough or otherwise did not arise.  Deputy Kelly provides tough Opposition on the Government side so I will agree with him on that point.  Unfortunately much of that has changed in recent years.  Question Time has become very irrelevant.  If we are interested in making the business of this House more relevant we should look at our procedures from time to time.  If we feel it is necessary to introduce changes in the interests of good business, we should not hesitate to do so.  We should accept that they are for the good of the House and the good of democracy.</P>
      <P>For far too long we have all been aware of the fact that the procedures in the House have become somewhat outdated and somewhat irrelevant in many ways. Therefore it is necessary and in the interests of democracy that the Minister of the day with responsibility for Dáil reform, in agreement with the Dáil, should be seen not to be slow to introduce whatever changes are necessary at any given time. When this Government took office we were assured that one of their top priorities was to reform the Dáil and make it more relevant to day-to-day activities. Many people outside the House have adopted a very apathetic approach to the Dáil.  On matters of urgent and grave importance, as legislators we have a responsibility to ensure that other pressure groups outside the democratic process cannot direct public opinion without Members of the Dáil being able to discuss whatever matters of urgent and national importance arise from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the responsibilities given to the Minister was that of Dáil reform.  In two and a half years the only serious proposal for that reform was to enlarge an already existing committee system.  Now we have this proposal before the House to change the system of answering parliamentary questions.  Prior to the 1982 general election, Fine Gael talked about longer hours in the Dáil and probably a five day week. <Col N="2375" /> It is obvious that the intentions were good at the time.  I do not deny that.  Since then in two and a half years hardly any suggestion for reform has come before the House except the enlargement of the committee system and now this proposal to alter the method of answering parliamentary questions.</P>
    <P>Regarding Dáil reform, on the Order of Business each day we are all reminded, and no one more so than the Ceann Comhairle, of how relevant or otherwise the Dáil can be.  Various urgent matters cannot be raised by any Member.  Therefore it is impossible for this, the elected Parliament, to express any view of a serious current issue.  But that does not prevent Deputies, and especially Opposition Deputies, from endeavouring to raise such matters.  It is their right to do so but that leads to confrontation with the Chair who is put in an impossible position in terms of remaining within Standing Orders.</P>
    <P>Apart from Question Time there are many other areas requiring urgent reform.  Very often many hours and even days are absorbed in debating legislation which has long lost its interest not only for Deputies but for the general public. Too often the result is that the Dáil must tolerate undiluted waffle that is of little or no value and which is merely enabling the Government of the day to fill in time before they are ready to take the next piece of business.  It is not difficult to understand people being very cynical at these happenings.  Therefore, there is an onus on all of us to strive to make this Parliament more relevant, more interesting and more businesslike.  Democracy is very precious.  It is a symbol of freedom and free speech.  As elected representatives, we must guard jealously against any possible erosion of that system and to that end we must make the Dáil more relevant.</P>
    <P>The proposal before the House is somewhat different from what was proposed first.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges have taken a long time to reach agreement so as to enable the motion to be put before the Dáil.  One of <Col N="2376" /> the reasons for that delay was to ensure that the rights of all Deputies would be safeguarded.  Earlier this evening Deputy Mac Giolla made the point that it would not be sufficient to restrict a Deputy to tabling only two questions.  I note from today's Order Paper, for instance, that even in the present system only two questions of the first 100 listed are in the name of the Deputy.  In the normal course perhaps up to three weeks would elapse before Deputy Mac Giolla's questions would be reached.  I cannot see what advantage that type of system can have compared with the new proposals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>At least Deputy Mac Giolla has had the opportunity to ask questions up to now but that will not be the case if the system is changed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>He will continue to have that opportunity.  It was obvious that a major change was necessary because the present format had become a farce and a total waste of time so far as the House was concerned.  There have been days when we have been able to dispose of only eight or nine questions.  The whole matter has become a total nonsense.  It was only bringing the Dáil into disrepute. Deputies will be aware that Question Time is the time when most visitors visit the House and these include many schoolchildren.  These visitors witness this spectacle taking place in the Chamber in what is masqueraded as Question Time.  That has been the case for far too long.  From time to time I have brought groups of visitors to the House and they have expressed to me their disappointment and their resentment at having spent 30 minutes or so in the Public Gallery listening to four for five questions being dealt with.  The fault in this regard must be laid squarely on all sides of the House.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not unusual to find, as we find today, almost 600 questions tabled for oral reply.  This involves expenditure of about £40,000 in respect of the Departments concerned examining, researching and providing replies to those questions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately during the past year or so replies to many questions have been anything but satisfactory.  These kinds of replies are what have lead to the shambles that we have been witnessing for too long. Another reason for Deputies being anxious to table questions is their inability to receive a satisfactory reply or indeed any reply, from a Minister to their representations.  There are some Ministers and some Departments who are especially culpable in this regard and I include among those the Departments of Health and Social Welfare, the Environment and Justice.  I have often waited for four or five months for a reply to a representation and despite repeated reminders and telephone calls received only a further acknowledgement.  Deputies will understand that nothing can be more frustrating or annoying than having to tolerate that sort of situation.  Consequently, Deputies consider that the only alternative for them in such cases is to <Col N="2378" /> table questions for either oral or written reply, a procedure that is much more expensive.  However, even in that regard the system has fallen down because the replies being given are totally inadequate and in many cases misleading.  All of this marks a further derogation of the obligations of a Minister and puts a further dent in the democratic process of the House. This, too, is an area that will have to change because unless Ministers regard questions seriously and endeavour to give reasonably accurate and full replies, the new system will fail also and we will continue to experience the same frustration and unsatisfactory situation that pertains now.</P>
    <P>Some Deputies may consider a restriction to include only two questions in the lottery to be an attack on their rights but that is far from the truth because every Deputy will have the right to participate on an equal footing in the lottery.  If some are not fortunate enough to have their questions placed in a high priority order on the Order Paper, they will continue to have the opportunity of receiving immediately a written reply or of participating further in the lottery 15 days later. While there may be misgivings initially about the proposed system, it is a step forward and very much so in the sense that there will be a different Minister in the House every day at Question Time and that every Minister will have participated in Question Time after 15 sitting days when we return again to the rota. Initially there may be some hold up but given time I am confident that the system will work reasonably well.  It cannot be anything but a tremendous advance and improvement on the present system.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposal to allocate an additional 15 minutes to priority questions.  It is right and proper that during this time priority be given to the larger group in Opposition.  Fianna Fáil, being that larger group, have 75 Deputies whereas the Workers' Party have two Deputies.  I cannot understand how anyone in his right senses would advocate that a party of two Members be given the same rights as a party of 75 Members.</P>

      <P>Some Deputies advocate that the system for Question Time should be based on other Deputies asking supplementary questions in that 15 minute period.  The purpose is to enable Front Bench spokesman who may not have an opportunity of having their question placed high on the Order Paper to have an opportunity to ask a question on a matter of particular urgency at that time.  Democracy could not argue with that.  That is the situation at present in some circumstances but under a lottery system it is quite possible that a Front Bench spokesman would put in two questions in the same way as any other Deputy and it could happen that his questions would not be placed sufficiently highly on the Order Paper to be taken that day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we look at today's Order Paper it will be seen that there are a large number of questions to Ministers who have not come into the House.  There are 150 questions down to the Minister for Justice but he has not been in to answer questions since last October.  There are 100 questions down to the Minister for Education who again has not been here to answer questions since last October.  There are 50 questions to the Minister for Labour. Many of these questions have been on <Col N="2380" /> the Order Paper since last October, but as a result of the way the system has become bogged down there is no way in which the Minister for Education or the Minister for Labour will be in here to answer questions before the summer recess.  Admittedly, the Minister for Justice will be here this week.  A year will have passed and Deputies will not have had an opportunity of questioning such important ministries.  That is a massive condemnation of the present system.</P>
    <P>Other Ministers will have come into the House to answer questions only once a year whereas under the proposed system every Minister will have to answer questions at least six times a year, if not more often.  That is a major advance and improvement and I cannot understand people arguing against it.  I do not know what alternative could be brought forward.</P>

      <P>The new system is worth giving a trial period of one year to.  If it is to be relevant and successful the Government must play their part and Ministers must be co-operative in dealing with questions addressed to them and endeavour to give full replies to Deputies.  The Minister of State should impress on his colleagues the importance of dealing with Deputies' representations as speedily and as fully as possible.  I am certain that by doing so the number of questions Deputies are compelled to table in the absence of a reasonably prompt and full reply to their representations would be considerably reduced.</P>
      <P>I hope that this proposal to reform the business of the House and make it more relevant to present day needs is only the first move in Dáil reform.  The Minister's commitment of two and a half years ago to reform the House is long overdue.  We look forward to many other proposals which will in the final analysis maintain and strengthen our democratic process and make the House much more relevant to the people outside as well as for Deputies elected to represent those people.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, who has taken a particular interest in the matter of Dáil reform, is a member of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  This is unusual.  I do not recall a Minister having been a member of that committee before.  I may be wrong about that.  However, he will be generally credited with the initiative, whatever about the mechanics, behind the move to try to rationalise Question Time.  In saying that I do not detract from the contribution made by the Minister of State or that made by Deputy Brady and his party in trying to arrive at a more rational way of carrying on the business of Question Time in the House.</P>
      <P>I compliment Deputy Bruton on his sustained interest.  I emphasise &ldquo;sustained&rdquo; because we all have rushes of interest in this or that subject but do not always sustain them.  He has shown a sustained interest in reforming Dáil procedures over the years.  Everyone wishes him well in that and I compliment him unfeignedly for his work so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, I am not entirely happy with every aspect of it.  In connection with the motion before the House I am equally far from being 100 per cent certain that the committee have chosen the right way of doing the job.  He has made a brave effort and a lot of work has gone into this proposal, but I can see flaws in it.  Some of them are the flaws which Deputy Mac Giolla identified and which I suspect Deputy O'Malley will also identify.  Another flaw which no one has identified is that the system is hellishly complicated, or so it seems.  How much more will the State have to pay as a result of this system being adopted?  I accept that if the gross number of questions is reduced and if Deputies are dissuaded from asking questions, there would be a saving made in that way.  However, that is not the purpose of the reform.  What worries me more is what demands will be made in the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for extensions of staff.  With respect to the Chair and without knowing very much about the mechanics from the inside, I do not believe the resources in <Col N="2382" /> the Chair's office will be equal to the tasks of conducting lotteries, priority tests and the devil knows what apart from the purely interpretive problems of making sense of the motion, which runs to three pages.</P>
    <P>I congratulate Deputy Bruton but do so with the reserve which later ages must have exhibited towards Columbus who, having crossed the Atlantic and entitled to congratulations for that, nevertheless thought he had arrived in India whereas he was about 14,000 miles short of that goal.  It is an effort and a praiseworthy one.  It is an experiment and is being tried out.  The committee do not pretend to know the answers and are not pretending to amend Standing Orders for good.  They merely purport to introduce an experimental temporary change.  That is something we should see far more of in this country, not only in Dáil procedures but in governmental procedures generally.  I cannot understand why we are afraid to experiment and why we are afraid to try something out on the dog, so to speak.  If we have an idea about saving money or doing something more efficiently we are not required to extend it to every Department.  We could try it out in one Department and pretend it is the dog for the purpose of my argument.  We could see how it worked and if it worked well it could be extended gradually.  That is the businesslike way of doing things.</P>
    <P>We have done this before and I must claim some credit for it.  With a lot of difficulty I got the House to change the sitting hours ten years ago.  It was represented then by the Opposition as being the end of democracy as we knew it and that we should sit the same number of hours but distributed more rationally.  It was presented to the House as an experiment for a year and has been continued since then.  It has worked all right.  The temper of the House and the health of Deputies has improved compared to what it was ten years ago, given the constraints we were then living within.</P>
    <P>I realise that other Deputies wish to speak and I will not hog all the time. However, I want to look briefly at the <Col N="2383" /> reasons for the dimension of the explosion in questions, and when the year is up perhaps the committee might adopt an improved system having regard to the reasons which resulted in this explosion. I made a little statistical inquiry today &mdash; if that is not too grand a term to apply &mdash; and I have the figures regarding the number of questions on the Order Papers for the last Tuesdays in May in 1975, 1965, 1955 and 1945.  I thought if I produced figures for 1935 and 1925 that I would be regarded as going back into prehistory, although in my book these were brave years in which the State, the Dáil and people generally knew what independence was all about, which does not seem to be the case now.  However, I appreciate that conditions have changed so much since 1935 and 1925 that it would be regarded as irrelevant to introduce statistics for that period.</P>
    <P>We will start after the war with the last Tuesday in May 1945.  The newspapers of the time show grinning, disarmed German soldiers being marched back to their homeland from the relatively friendly western countries &mdash; those in the east had to wait for 12 years or thereabouts before they got that chance.  On that day there were 21 questions on the Order Paper.  All were answered that day and not a single one reappeared on the Order Paper on 30 May.  De Valera was Taoiseach and of course there was a Fianna Fáil Government.  Ten years later there was a Coalition Government, led by John Costello, and on Tuesday, 24 May 1955 there were 32 questions on the Order Paper, a very slight and insignificant increase because the pattern in those days was that there were hardly ever more questions on the Order Paper than could be disposed of that day.  That day the 32 questions were easily disposed of and not a single one appeared on the following day's Order Paper.</P>
    <P>We now come to 1965, the year of the rising tide lifting all boats.  It was the Lemass era, the pragmatic party opposite, and of Taca although all that flowed from that was no bigger than a man's hand on the horizon albeit being blown, <Col N="2384" /> by a fairly strong wind of greed and anti-national self interests of various kinds which, if I were to describe, would take me away from the motion.  On 25 May 1965 there was quite a large increase on that of 1955 in that there were 72 questions on the Order Paper which were not all disposed of on that day, although most of them were.  Between 1955 and 1965 there had been the advent of the electronic media and the rest of the media had suddenly decided that it was time for them to show a somewhat more human face than they had previously shown. They decided to include a bit more gossip, life and style and referred to people by their Christian names.  They affected to know where they came from, their associates, what their hobbies were and so on.  Politics was becoming something of a chat show by 1965 and I suspect that the slight increase in the number of questions in that year is not entirely disconnected with the higher profile which individual politicians had.  Their higher profile, which we were tending to have as a class, although I had not even joined the party then, was a contributory factor in asking more questions.</P>
    <P>In 1975 the fruits of whatever forces were at work in 1965 were now hanging richly from the tree because on 27 May 1975, when I held the position that Deputy Seán Barrett now holds, there were no fewer than 260 questions on the Order Paper, nearly four times as many as there had been in 1965.  In 1975 that was considered to be phenomenol and I remember distinctly on one occasion, when the Government were discussing Dáil business, drawing the attention of the House to the fact that we were within spitting distance of having 500 questions on the Order Paper at one juncture.  That was partly accounted for by the fact that in the previous era of Fianna Fáil Government the practice had grown up of allotting the last hour and a half of Thursdays to a continuation of Question Time.  In other words, the ordinary business of the Dáil ended at lunch time on Thursdays and the time from 2.30 p.m. to 5 o'clock was given over to questions.  Deputy Jack Lynch was Taoiseach at that time.  I do <Col N="2385" /> not know how far back the practice went, I suppose from the time when questions started to get out of hand around 1970.</P>
    <P>We discontinued that practice in 1975 or 1976 because &mdash; I do not want to attribute praise or blame &mdash; we had a lot of very bad medicine during those years and there was some very obstructive behaviour on the part of the party opposite, who wanted to break our necks physically as well as politically.  They began calling quorums at 4.30 p.m. on Thursday afternoons while their questions were being answered.  As a result we abandoned this concession to the Opposition and we decided that if a quorum had to be kept here on Thursday afternoons we would do Government business during that time.  Since then we have had just the three hours devoted to Question Time every week, but that has not damped down the flow of questions because on today's Order Paper there are 751 questions, almost three times the number which there were on this day ten years ago.</P>
    <P>What is the reason for this?  It would not be a contemptible subject matter, although admittedly rather impressionistic, for a project by a sociology or politics student.  I wondered whether there is more press reportage than there used to be, and undoubtedly domestic politics get more coverage, although it tends to be snippets on the back pages about somebody's breakfast habits.  This coverage is of a kind which the journalists of 30 years ago would have thought contemptible and beneath them, but that is what goes now.  I have looked through the yellowing pages of <i>The Irish Press</i> and the <i>Irish Independent.</i> The <i>Irish Times</i> is perhaps not representative for 1946 as up to 1945 it still printed a court circular.  In case I give myself a black eye with <i>The Irish Times</i>, I recognise that they have turned over several new leaves since then.  The other two newspapers did not give much more space to questions in 1975 than they did in 1945, so I cannot allege that there is more press reportage.  I had a lot of amusement from looking at these yellowed pages.  I saw that Deputy Brian Lenihan, the then Minister for Justice, <Col N="2386" /> said on 23 May 1965 that under no conditions could one admit the right of free testamentary disposition.  He was in charge of the ill-fated Succession Bill and his line was that we should go for the continental system whereby everybody was, more or less, tied to allotting his property according to the way the civil code said.  Little things like that are oases in the desert of old newspapers.  If I were vindictive I would make notes of them, but I do not believe in hounding Deputy Lenihan into the grave or spending the rest of my life doing it if he outlives me.</P>
    <P>It also occurred to me that the reason for more questions might be because of increased secretarial help.  When I leave my own parliamentary questions on the table in the General Office I have often seen other Deputies questions and, as often as not, they appeared to be hand written by the Deputies.  I do not think the increase in secretarial help has made a difference.  In 1975 we had very little secretarial help &mdash; there was almost none for ordinary Deputies &mdash; but even then this matter had begun to get out of hand.</P>
    <P>I cannot believe that Deputies today are more attentive to their constituency problems or more alert to public questions than they were 20, 30 or 40 years ago.  All the heroes of all the parties in this House were active in those years and they were at least as alert to what was going on around them as well as to their constituents as Deputies today.</P>
    <P>What I think it may be is increased spoofing of constituents, irrespective of the cost to the public.  Once upon a time a Deputy had a modest conception of his status.  That did not mean a humble view of what a representative of the Irish people had as his rights, but a modest conception of the degree to which he was entitled to spend, or occasion the spending of public money.  He would not put down a question which cost £40, £50 £60 or £70 on average, and some much more than that, if he could get the same information by means of a letter or a telephone call.  That vestigal self-restraint seems to have gone out the window.</P>
    <P>There is a tendency for the press to play up the gossipy, human interest side <Col N="2387" /> of politics.  This increase has gone hand in hand with the increase in the number of journalists.  That is a factor on which one might get a student to try to write an interesting project.  There has been a growth in the numbers of people whose profession it is to make stories out of the doings of Deputy Brady or&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Putting down questions and pursuing them by the &ldquo;shambolic&rdquo; series of supplementaries that Deputy Brady so rightly castigated, is one way of putting yourself high in the running for mention in a sketch, or a box, or in a column on a page of a newspaper the following day. To a certain extent, Deputies play up to what the press expects of them and the press show dividends on what can be earned by delivery.  We have the Order of Business everyday at 10.30 a.m. or 3.30 p.m.  When I first came into the House that was a relatively quiet time. As often as not, the Order of Business was agreed in seconds.  I do not say this in a contentious spirit, but the comments on the Order of Business began with Deputy Lynch.  He suddenly noticed that if he scored a tuppeny-halfpenny point the press gallery, who at that early hour of the day are bright eyed and bushy tailed, their pencils nicely sharpened, ready for a little gas &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The press were inclined to make a meal out of a silly exchange on the Order of Business.  They could write about 500 words on this but the rest of the day's business, especially a report on the Committee Stage of a Bill which gave the reader an idea of what was going on, <Col N="2388" /> went out the window.  Like everybody else I depend on the press.  I do not want to make enemies there any more than anybody else but it was far more interesting to do that and unfortunately Deputies began to play up to the press.</P>
      <P>I think the same thing is, to a large part, responsible for the explosion not merely of bad manners and disorderliness on the Order of Business, but, the explosion in questions.  This is an instance of trying to regulate by a rules what we should regulate by a degree of self-control.  I wish this new regulation well.  It will cost a lot of money and will give frightful headaches to the Ceann Comhairle's Office, but I am not sure it will be satisfactory.  Among all the people I have heard it as being unfair to, not a word has been said about Government backbenchers. Naturally they are in the lottery but they do not have any rights.  Suppose Deputy Shatter and I are Fine Gael Dissidents over some matter, we have the same non-rights as Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa, although I am sure they do not like to find themselves in the same pot, as the Germans say, as us.  That is a point more might have been made of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a good deal to be said for the resentment Deputy Mac Giolla showed about the priority to groups of seven but giving no look in to groups with fewer than seven.  It is unfair that The Workers' Party do not have some presence on committees and some status with regard to them being accorded Private Members' Time, and this unfairness is being continued here.  Needless to say, it is not a deliberate unfairness and what they lose on those swings they gain on other round-abouts.  Although he speaks only for himself and Deputy De Rossa, Deputy Mac Giolla has a privilege which no two, three, four, five or 25 Government backbenchers have, namely whenever statements are made Deputy Mac Giolla's views are canvassed and widely published and reported, although we might have views which might, in many important nuances differ from those expressed by our front benchers.  I do not quarrel with these privileges, I am only pointing out that it should not be all whingeing from <Col N="2389" /> The Workers' Party.  Although I accept that the system of priority by groups is unfair to them in regard to membership of committees, questions and Private Members' Business, they have other privileges which I think are more than fair to them, too fair perhaps.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>My suggestion is this, and I admit it is open perhaps to more objections than the system now proposed.  I suggest that each Minister, in rotation, has a slot of ten questions.  The people who get to the slots first win.  I have heard pleas for Deputies who live in Cape Clear or Spike Island and so on, who cannot get to the Dáil Office in time for 11 a.m., but there is the telephone and there are colleagues.  If a system like that did not work, we could have a committee of honour.  I would be quite happy to have a committee consisting of the Ceann Comhairle or the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on one side and a former Ceann Comhairle, say Deputy Faulkner, on the other, decide on the fairness of questions. Such a committee, together with a little self-restraint, should be tried.  Deputy Brady says this has become farcical, but we had to face this problem in 1977-81. At that time the number of questions had risen to the astronomical level of 300, 400 or 500, and frequently the Fine Gael front benchers got together and said they could not have this happening.  It could happen that the Opposition might think a certain Minister was hiding behind seven or eight of his colleagues and that meant that this question would not be taken before Christmas.  We decided to scrap all our questions and put them down for written reply.  As a party we exercised self-control.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with all who have spoken about the very unsatisfactory nature of the present situation in regard to Question Time.  One has only to look at today's Order Paper which has been referred to already to see the vast number of questions on it and how less than worthy of a parliamentary question many of those questions are, or notice the size of the Order Paper which today runs to 72 pages and has a total of 751 questions in all, to realise that changes will have to be made, and perhaps quite drastic changes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am somewhat dubious about the type of changes proposed here and about some of the motives.  It seems to boil down to this &mdash; that this procedure, if adopted, will create two classes of Deputies, as it were, in this House&mdash;those entitled to priority and those not.  Those entitled to priority will consist of the Opposition Front Bench of the day and those who are not will consist of everybody else.  It seems <Col N="2391" /> to introduce a very dubious concept into parliamentary representation to say that there is a certain class of Deputy here who has greater rights and privileges than another.  I am not talking about the Government here, because the Government of the day must always stand in a particular position.  It is not just a question of distinguishing between individual Deputies, their status, or their standing, or their rights.  Remember that every one of us who sits here does so only because he or she was put here by the people and because he or she reflects the views of the people or the rights of the people in terms of representation.</P>
    <P>Why is it that one group of people in a particular constituency, 8,000, 10,000 or 12,000, who elected a particular Deputy are seen, in a sense, as having fewer rights and effective representation within this House than a similar or even much smaller group somewhere else who elected somebody who happens for the moment to be on the Front Bench of the Opposition party or parties, whatever they may be?  That principle is wrong.  If it is started, it may not apparently be terribly serious at the beginning, but it could lead to various other distinctions being made in the future.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to see how this problem was looked at by a committee established in 1971, under my chairmanship, as it happened, to consider reform of Dáil procedure.  I see that we were very tentative indeed in our proposals, which would hardly be described as revolutionary.  On re-reading the report I see that we were very anxious, first, to get agreement between all concerned on the committee and, secondly, not to undermine what we saw as long established and important parliamentary procedures and parliamentary privileges.  I see, for example, that we were not prepared to give priority to any one Deputy or group of Deputies as against any others in terms of questions.  The only suggestion in regard to priority made in that report was that Deputies who were in the House should have priority over those who were actually not present at the time the questions <Col N="2392" /> were asked, which was not a very revolutionary proposal but which was not adopted.</P>
    <P>I notice, from that report and from other references, that it was particularly thought inappropriate to abolish or fetter in any way the right of a Deputy to ask a Private Notice Question.  It is a little disturbing to find that under the terms of this motion which begins &ldquo;That notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders 31, 34 and 35.....&rdquo;&mdash; the Standing Orders relative to public business &mdash; the Standing Order which contains the right to ask a Private Notice Question would seem to be overriden.  The fact that Private Notice Questions are not referred to in the lengthy motion does not get over the fact that Standing Order 31 which contains the right to ask these questions is superseded by this motion.</P>
    <P>If the Minister of State wants to argue in his reply that they are not superseded, he had better put that into the motion because everything else in Standing Orders 31, 34 and 35 is superseded by the terms of this motion, the first three lines of which are very broad and obviously take precedence over the three Standing Orders concerned and amend them in numerous ways, making it clear that this motion, assuming it is passed will be effectively the Standing Orders under which all aspects of questions will be asked in the next 12 months, at least.</P>
    <P>I have four amendments down, two of which are similar to amendments in Deputy Mac Giolla's name and I do not propose to go into those in great detail. I would like briefly to refer to the other two amendments.  First, there is a proposal to delete in paragraph 1 (b) (ii), the words &ldquo;group as defined by Standing Order 85 (1)] in Opposition:&rdquo; and to insert instead that the priority questions should be asked by a &ldquo;Member and certified by the Ceann Comhairle as being appropriate to be afforded priority&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>If and when this proposal comes into effect, the only really effective questions are those which will come in under paragraph (b) (ii) on what are called the priority questions.  The others will not be of much significance.  All the topical <Col N="2393" /> questions will come in under that and all those of any importance.  Public and media attention will, understandably, be devoted to those asked under this priority rule.  Those questions under that priority rule can only be asked by a member of the Opposition Front Bench and only a member of the Opposition Front Bench can ask a supplementary question.</P>
    <P>I happen at the moment not to be on the Opposition Front Bench.  If something of enormous importance to my constituency, for example, were to arise after this comes into effect, I am precluded from asking a question about it.  Even if somebody on the Opposition Front Bench at the time decides to ask a question, I am precluded from asking a supplementary question.  Indeed, it may even be that something of importance will come up relating to me and I cannot ask a question, nor can I ask a supplementary question, nor can I intervene in any way.  I wonder if this is the right way of going about solving what I accept are undoubted difficulties.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Opposition Front Bench are worthy people.  I do not know that I can go into defining their qualifications in every case: if I were to do so it might be suggested that was unbecoming. I think it is somewhat arbitrary to decide that such a group of people who were not elected to that position but were appointed to it, should have virtually the exclusive right of asking significant questions.  I think that is wrong.  In 1971-72 we veered away from anything of that kind.  We made various other suggestions but we recognised the right of each individual Deputy to be equal in the House in terms of what he could ask or raise here.  That is no longer the position and that is very serious.  In my amendments I have proposed that the provision whereby only supplementary questions can be asked by such Members should be deleted.  That is only fair and reasonable. In one of my amendments I suggested that such questions should be allowed to be asked by any Member provided that the Ceann Comhairle certifies them as being appropriate for priority.</P>
    <P>When Deputy Kelly was speaking he <Col N="2394" /> said that perhaps we could have a committee of some kind.  I think he had a somewhat similar idea as myself as to what kind of questions should be allowed and who should ask them.  He suggested that Members who were previously the Ceann Comhairle should act as a small committee who would decide on these matters if the Ceann Comhairle of the day found he did not want to do that.  I am open to any reasonable suggestion of that kind.  There should be some approach of that type.  If the proposals go through, the result will be that many Members will regard Question Time as entirely futile.  I know many of us so regard it at the moment.  That is why I hardly ever put down anything other than questions for written reply.  I know that for an answer to an oral question I would have to wait for six months and then the answer would be totally out-of-date.</P>
    <P>I should hate to see a change from one ridiculous situation to one that may well turn out to be equally ridiculous.  Lotteries are not very satisfactory.  We are a Parliament, dealing with the affairs of the nation.  On today's Order Paper there are 751 questions and to put all of them into a lottery in order to draw a few is not satisfactory.  It may be fair in a vague kind of way but it is not satisfactory.</P>
    <P>I ask the House to look at page 2320 of today's Order Paper which lists questions Nos. 743 to 751 as an instance of what I am talking about.  Each question asks the Minister for Labour the reason redundancy payments have not been paid by An Bord Telecom to a person, details supplied, in County Tipperary who has worked for many years as a night telephone operator at the telephone exchange in Clonmel.  Everyone of those questions is the same except that it is about a different person.  I know that that matter is of great importance to each of the individual night telephone operators in Clonmel, but why should a serious question of national importance relating to national policy be put into the hat with the seven questions on page 2320 of today's Order Paper?</P>

      <P>I know that, but there are many oral questions of the same type. Indeed, the oral questions go to No. 570. Deputies will say that they have to put down these questions because they cannot get answers from Departments. From my own experience I know that is the case, that one cannot get answers from a Department or that one has to wait for months.  However, even if we have this lottery system, if the same kind of questions are put down we will not be any better off than we are now.  The whole situation will be totally unsatisfactory and perhaps rather farcical.  My point is that if we are going to change the system, let us have a sensible radical change rather than something that may well turn out to be just as unsatisfactory.</P>
      <P>The Minister of State or the Government should give serious thought to the kind of amendments I have suggested.  I am not tied to the detail of my amendments by any means and I am sure there are many variants that might be more satisfactory.  The motion before the House is a detailed lengthy one which seeks to repeal for a year at least three Standing Orders and which seeks to reenact them in a completely different way. To my mind that motion is very doubtful. Simply changing something radically will not cure what, I admit, is a serious problem.  It will create other problems.  In particular, I do not like the situation that establishes two classes of Deputies.  This is the first time anything like that has happened and I do not think it should happen.  The Government should think again about what they propose.  It is unfair and undemocratic.  It is not just a reflection on individual Deputies but is a reflection on those who elect them.  That is not right and the matter should be reconsidered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The use of the definition of a group in Standing Order 85 (1) for the purpose of putting down priority questions seems rather doubtful.  That Standing Order relates only to Private Members' motions <Col N="2396" /> or Private Members' Bills.  It is a very limited provision.  When those Standing Orders were drawn up and revised it was never envisaged that that definition would be applied suddenly and arbitrarily to the right to ask the most significant questions.  While I am glad that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges and the Government want to change the present very unsatisfactory situation, I regret they have seen fit to do so in the way they are doing it.  I ask them to think again about the matter and to carry out the change in a more even-handed and a more democratic fashion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am here especially today because I have a contribution to make on this matter.  I read with great interest the terms of the motion before the House and I was most anxious that what I had to say should be on record. First, the right of a Deputy to ask a parliamentary question is fundamental to democracy.  All Deputies should be regarded as equal, no one with any great authority over the other.  All were elected by the same procedure, the ballot.  All Deputies represent their constituents; and if all of us together comprise a democratic Parliament, I seriously ask the Minister of State to consult with the Opposition and with whatever committee he has been dealing with in this matter and not establish a band of Deputies with stripes superior to others.  I foresee a grave danger of this; and here I speak with experience, being the longest serving Member of this House.  For many years I regarded myself as a specialist on parliamentary questions because probably I asked more in my time then any other ten Deputies put together.  In recent years I have put none down on the Order Paper because I considered the whole system of questions to Ministers had become a complete and utter farce. For example, when one put down a question in relation to any serious topic in one's constituency one saw that remaining on the Order Paper after six or eight weeks, which did not make sense to me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Question Time is the most important time in Parliament, affording a Deputy <Col N="2397" /> the only opportunity of coming face to face with a Minister, asking him or her to prove their responsibility to the House and the country.  Under no other parliamentary procedure can an ordinary Deputy, as the representative of his constituents, come face to face with a Minister, who, in turn, must get from his superior civil servants the entire file on the subject and every iota of information in regard thereto.  Anybody who has served any time as a Minister will know that the one matter about which civil servants in all Departments are extremely anxious is that full information and the complete background be supplied in relation to the subject of a parliamentary question.  I often saw panic obtain in relation to a parliamentary question.</P>
    <P>In recent times Deputies have lost their sense of responsibility in regard to parliamentary questions.  For example, there are at least 60 questions on today's Order Paper in respect of which a courteous note to the secretary of the various Departments would have extracted a complete explanation and answer.  There is very little about which we in this country can boast, but apart from our cultural heritage, one thing we can boast about is the superiority of our civil servants.</P>
    <P>The matter of the right of Ministers to reply to questions has been raised here. When I first became a Member of this House I never dreamt of putting down a parliamentary question without having exhausted all possible resources in order to extract the information from the Minister to whom a question might subsequently be addressed.  Now the practice is quite different &mdash; the Minister and his Department are by-passed and the parliamentary question is put down without having had recourse to any of the other proper procedures.  The parliamentary question should be the last resort; it is the greatest weapon a Member of Parliament possesses.  We have no other weaponry. There is no other way in which we can bring a civil servant face to face with his Minister or bring a Minister into the House to give the full facts relating to the subject of the question.</P>
    <P>Without meaning to be critical but <Col N="2398" /> rather in a friendly spirit, one of great affection, I might say that the office of Ceann Comhairle is not without some degree of fault in relation to this matter. For example, the number of supplementary questions now allowed would never have been admitted in the forties and fifties.  It is my opinion that the Chair is allowing too much latitude.  If there is a backlog of questions it is due, first, to the relevant Deputy not using his office to obtain the necessary information without resort to Parliament and, second, the Chair allowing too many supplementaries.  The number of supplementary questions I have seen allowed from all sides of the House in recent times makes it impossible for some Deputies to have their questions answered and makes a complete farce of the hour made available for questions.</P>
    <P>In this respect Deputy John Kelly is quite right.  In the forties and fifties I remember every single Minister answering his questions within the hour.  I remember numerous occasions questions commencing at 3 o'clock sharp and finishing at 3.50 p.m. However, at that time no Deputy would dream of putting a parliamentary question on the Order Paper unless it related to a matter of grave importance to his constituency, himself and the public at large and unless he had first in his possession a file from the Minister responsible from which he could not extract the information he sought. That is not the practice today.  Deputies take the easy way out.  They do not consult a Minister or his senior civil servants, but simply put down a parliamentary question.  Deputies will have to use commonsense in this regard.  I can remember 50 and 60 questions having been answered in one hour.</P>
    <P>I also remember the late Ceann Comhairle, Frank Fahey, who was exacting and precise, like all other Cinn Comhairle who followed him, and who knew procedure.  But there were questions on which he would not allow a supplementary if he felt that the question had been answered fully by the relevant Minister.  If the Chair felt a complete explanation had been given by the Minister, that was the end <Col N="2399" /> of it, and that was then accepted by Deputies on all sides of the House.  Now there is a song and dance about every parliamentary question, with Deputies springing up on all sides of the House, some having no connection whatever with the constituency or the problem on which they are addressing such supplementary questions.  It is wrong.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and the Opposition in endeavouring to come to grips with what I perceive to be a hopeless situation and which does not in any way add to the dignity of Parliament.  It has lessened the importance of the one method Members have to question Ministers &mdash; the hour allotted at Question Time.  Are we now not endeavouring to restore confidence in Question Time, having seen that the position has fallen into serious decay?  I do not think there is anything wrong with allowing a Member to ask two questions per day because something must be done to restore confidence in Question Time.</P>
    <P>Members should endeavour to obtain as much information as possible before tabling a parliamentary question which should be the last resort.  The Minister should give serious consideration to increasing the time allotted at Question Time from 2.30 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. in order to restore confidence in that aspect of Parliament and to clear the backlog.  If Parliament is to be used as a democratic institution we should respect it and not, through curiosity, jump up and down in the Chamber utilising all the time available thereby depriving other Members of an opportunity to ask questions.  The Ceann Comhairle, and his office, should give serious consideration to a complete curtailment of supplementary questions. I make that suggestion based on my long experience as a Member.  The Chair is the best judge of order, but my view is that many of the supplementaries do not bear any relation to the subject matter under discussion.</P>
    <P>This reform is very necessary.  I hope other reforms will be implemented before long.  The Chair, with the help of <Col N="2400" /> the Minister of State, and the Opposition, should endeavour to restore respect at Question Time.  The procedure at Question Time today does not bear any relation to the Question Time in the forties, when I was first elected to the House.  Parliament has belittled itself. Dignity has gone.  Dignity for the Chair and the Minister involved has taken an extraordinary change.  Members do not appear to have much self-respect.</P>
    <P>I hope that those intending to ask questions at Question Time present themselves in accordance with what one would expect a dignified Member of Parliament to do.  I can recall at Question Time some years ago seeing many lady Members, such as the late Mrs. Reynolds, the late Mrs. Redmond of Waterford, Mrs. Rice of Monaghan, Mrs. Ryan of Tipperary and Mrs. Celia Lynch, who is still alive, in the Chamber.  I can recall one occasion when the late Mrs. Redmond drove from the Curragh to deal with questions she had on the Order Paper.  Unfortunately, she had forgotten her headgear.  She consulted with General Mulcahy as to whether she should enter the Chamber without having her head suitably covered to address the questions, and he replied, &ldquo;No; it would not be proper&rdquo;.  I can recall Mrs. Redmond going across in haste to Brown Thomas where she purchased what I can describe as a most becoming little hat from Senator Ned Maguire and returning to appear in the Chamber in proper dress.</P>

      <P>I am not proposing an amendment, but if we are thinking of having some form of dignity at Question Time we ought to restore some of the lost dignity.  We must remember that this is not a county council chamber.  It is the Parliament of the nation and its Members are supposed to set the example for all outside.  We are supposed to set the example for the Press.  Deputy Kelly referred to the reporting of Question Time in our national papers.  Some of the <Col N="2401" /> modern, liberal and up-to-date journalists report the seriousness of Question Time as a comic sketch.  That should not be permitted by the editors of the newspapers.  There is nothing pertaining to comedy in Parliament.  It is in Parliament that the laws are made and at Question Time Ministers are made account for their actions.  To me that should not be the subject of a comic sketch similar to Denis the Menace, Mutt and Jeff or any of the other comic strips.  It appears that if comic strips are to be written now they come from Parliament, which is supposed to be the most serious assembly in the nation.  I hope that the long established and experienced journalists will whisper into the ears of their editors that if we are to maintain proper respect for Parliament the proceedings of that institution should be portrayed to the reading public with a high degree of respect.</P>
      <P>I hope the Chair, and the committee responsible for this change, will ensure that at Question Time, which is witnessed by members of the Diplomatic Corps and groups of schoolchildren, dignity for Parliament is displayed.  Has any Member asked, what is the purpose of Question Time?  It appears that there is a complete loss of contact between ordinary Members.  If there was proper contact we would not have up to 700 questions on the Order Paper.  The position in regard to Question Time is a farce.  I can recall that when one tabled a question many years ago one could approach the late Mr. Frank Geoghegan or Mr. Jack McGowan-Smyth of the General Office, or the late Clerk, Mr. Peter O'Connell, for assistance.  When one went in with a parliamentary question one could ask for five or six copies of it and they were immediately made available so that one could send a copy to a constituent or to the local papers.  I do not know if those facilities are still there but if they are it would be a help for the enthusiastic, energetic Deputy who wanted to get some publicity as a result of his question, to get a copy when he is putting down his question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the lottery, I have never been successful in a lottery and it would <Col N="2402" /> be too much for me to hope that I might be successful in the proposed question lottery.  As far as I know, all questions will appear on the Order Paper and the lottery is only for the granting of the question.  I do not see anything wrong with that.</P>

      <P>However, the question of a lottery should be reconsidered as a small committee comprised of people who know the procedures and who would be able to judge the importance of the question might be better.</P>
      <P>I would ask both the Opposition and the Government not to create two grades of Deputies.  I welcome changes and I know a change must come.  I agree with the terms of the motion with only one objection which relates to the priority of questions.  It would be a very strange position if a question arose relating to my constituency for instance and there was not a Front Bench Member representing that constituency and the Deputy representing the constituency could not open his mouth on the question.  This is very wrong and it will put Deputies in a very embarrassing position.  We should not create two kinds of Deputies, Deputies with the influence of his right to raise questions in this House and Deputies without the right.  Rights and privileges should be the same for all Deputies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Chair who has a long experience and is a highly respected Member of this House to intervene here. The Ceann Comhairle is the custodian of Deputies' rights and we look to the Ceann Comhairle for protection.  I appeal especially to the Ceann Comhairle to make sure that we do not have two grades of Deputies in this House, the Deputy who can raise the question under the priority section and the Deputy who cannot do it.  It will create endless difficulties in operation.  Much confusion will be avoided by eliminating that section and <Col N="2403" /> by both the Government and the Opposition coming together to straighten this out.  A Front Bench Deputy should not have more rights and privileges than any other Deputy as we are all elected representatives representing the people.</P>
    <P>I am glad this occasion arose and I hope other occasions will arise when we can reform other procedures to ensure the smooth running of this House.  Unless Parliament functions properly the results cannot be felt outside.  We should respect and endeavour to strengthen Parliament so that what must be spoken will be spoken here and the questions which need to be asked shall be answered here.</P>

That is why we extended Question Time by 15 minutes. There is nothing devious in it.  It was a genuine attempt to meet a problem that we came across when we were dealing with these changes.

That is all.  The alternative is to get more people elected.

        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> We did, in trying to devise a new system.  We were conscious of how we would deal with the questions coming in from individual Deputies.  The lottery system is not ideal, but every other system we thought about equally had its deficiencies.  I am quite certain that if the motion read differently other Members would be in here, including the Deputy, complaining that this other system would not work just as he is complaining that the lottery system would not work.  I want to explain briefly how the lottery system would work. Every Deputy who hands in a question would hand it in to the Questions Office as at present.  A note would be taken of that question, the questions would be listed 1 to 50 as they come in and on the appointed day at the appointed time those questions would be drawn in number out of a hat or anything you like &mdash; as is done in Westminster incidentally; they have a lottery system for Question Time &mdash; a number would be drawn out and if Deputy Mac Giolla came out as No. 1 his question would go as No. 1. If Deputy Flanagan's question came out No. 2 his question would go as No. 2, and if Deputy Haughey had a question in, his question if it was No. 3 would go No. 3 and so on.  We list all the questions to No. <Col N="2408" /> 50 depending on the number of questions that are in to a Minister.  That is a fair system.  No preference is given to one Deputy against another.  You have an equal chance of coming out with anybody else.</P>

They suggested that Members should be able to table questions for written reply when the Dáil is not in session and that this would help to avoid the backlog and so on.  They suggested also that consideration should be given to allocating Question Time each day to a different Minister.

      <P>
        <i>(Dún Laoghaire):</i> They suggested it.  Now they suggest in an amendment that it be done on a weekly basis.  If we were to do it on a weekly basis over a period of 16 sitting weeks from the beginning of the autumn session as proposed it would run to Easter 1986. Therefore if a Minister did not get in in the autumn session it would be Easter 1986 under that system when he would get in.  That would not be a good idea; in fact it would be nearly as bad as we have at the moment.</P>
      <P>Amendment No. 3 again deals with a weekly instead of a daily rota.  Again I maintain that the daily rota system is far better than the weekly system because we get a quicker rotation of Ministers and it is more beneficial to the Dáil.</P>
      <P>I have dealt with the lottery.  It is a method of trying to deal fairly with everybody.  Probably it is not ideal, but none of the other systems that we thought about is ideal either.  If it does not work we can always change it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to a group in Opposition consisting of seven Members, Standing Order 81 laid down certain conditions and we felt that, in view of the purpose <Col N="2411" /> of priority Question Time, the same principle should apply here, because it is dealing with priority questions which would be tabled mainly by spokesmen on behalf of the Opposition as distinct from their right as individual Deputies which they can deal with in the ordinary hour period. For that reason the same principle applies and it was felt that that Standing Order should apply in respect of priority questions and I think it is reasonable.  Of course, if I were an Independent Deputy, or a member of a small party, I would have objected to it and I would look to have a change, but it is a Standing Order that applies to Private Member's time and Private Member's Bills, and if the Committee on Procedure and Privileges decided to review that Standing Order and change it, it will apply not alone to Private Member's time but also to the priority questions.  That question must be decided in the future.</P>
    <P>There is no change in questions down to the Taoiseach.  The Taoiseach will answer questions on Tuesday and there will be no change.  There is no change basically in the procedure dealing with written questions.  In reply to Deputy Mac Giolla and his worry about who will look after the lottery, it will be under the control of the Clerk of the Dáil who will see to it that all procedures are dealt with fairly and that a proper system will be implemented.  I have no worries.  I am quite confident that the staff of the House will be very fair and deal with this new system strictly in accordance with the Standing Order.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I did not have sufficient time to deal with the many other points raised.  I hope I have outlined clearly to the Dáil the reasons for the change. There is nothing devious in it.  We have tried to be fair.  We have recognised the difficulties that can arise.  I am quite confident that this new system will restore dignity to and a level of interest in Question Time which has been disappearing slowly certainly since I became a Member of this House.  If after 12 months we feel there is a need for further change, or <Col N="2412" /> that we should change the system around again, we can do that.  Therefore, I recommend the motion to the House.</P>

      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its decision to reject the Hyster Industry for Limerick and the surrounding area in view of the disastrous unemployment situation in that region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Coalition Government's decision in cutting a grant agreed already between the IDA and the Hyster Corporation by £1 million, resulting in the loss of 800 jobs for Limerick, was a monumental error of calculation and of commercial judgment.  The miscalculation arose <Col N="2413" /> from the Government decision to reduce the grant in the mistaken belief that the Hyster Corporation would pay an additional £1 million for the privilege of setting up their project in Ireland when in fact better terms were available in Holland.  The bad judgement arose from the fact that the project did represent good value for money and was a low risk project.  When one examines statements made at the time it is clear that it was a low risk project.  On 15 May the Minister said that, following negotiations between the IDA and the Hyster Corporation, the Government in June 1984 considered proposals for grant assistance for the project, that the proposals would be very expensive in terms of Exchequer cost and would have resulted in a very high grant cost per job.  The Minister went on to say that there was considerable risk attaching to the project because its success depended to a large degree on the company's ability to establish themselves in a market for spare parts which up to then they had not serviced and in which there was considerable competition.  The Minister stated also that the making of parts for other manufacturers' machinery was an inherently difficult business area in which there would be natural resistence to new entrants.  Therefore, the Minister's opinion was a very considerable risk attached to the project.</P>
    <P>Let us compare his statement with a statement issued by the IDA on the following day in which they said they were satisfied that the package recommended to the Government represented the best deal that could be negotiated with the company, that it represented good value for money and that the project as negotiated was soundly based.  The fact that the company decided in the event to locate in another country is an indictment of the IDA view that the package was the minimum necessary to secure the project for Ireland.  Here we had the IDA, an agency set up by the Government to make value judgments, disagreeing with the Minister in relation to the evaluation of the project.</P>
    <P>In an interview with <i>The Irish Times,</i><Col N="2414" /> the President of Hyster, Mr. Bill KilKenny, said, as reported in that paper on May 20, 1985:</P>
    <P>...the spare parts project was not high risk as has been suggested by the Minister for Industry, Mr. Bruton, and that to suggest that it marked a new departure for Hyster was untrue.</P>
    <P>It was a very serious matter for an international investor to have to put on public record the allegation that a statement made by the Minister was untrue.  The report continued:</P>
    <P>The Company, he said, saw the total project of providing spare parts for competitors equipments as being in two phases.  Phase one, establishing a presence in the marketplace through buying-in components and selling through dealers in the US and Europe, &ldquo;is active and has been profitable for quite some period of time.&rdquo;  The lower risk second phase, manufacturing the components itself, was what had been offered to Ireland and rejected.</P>
    <P>Though the Minister had said the project was high risk, the president of the company said that what had been offered to Ireland was the lower risk second phase which involved manufacturing components for a market that had been proved already.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's statement was contradicted flatly, first by the IDA and then by the president of Hyster. Was the project good value for money? Was it a low risk project or was it, as the Minister claimed, a high risk project?  It is quite clear that it was a low risk project and that it represented value for money. I trust, therefore, that the Minister will be able to tell us how he arrived at his judgment which was to the contrary.</P>
      <P>If the Minister were to sit at the Cabinet table and undertake a simple cost-benefit analysis on the project he would find that to remove 800 people from the unemployment list would involve a net benefit to the Exchequer of £5 million.  If that does not appeal to the Minister I can assure him that it appeals to the hard pressed taxpayers and that he will have difficulty convincing them of his justification for throwing away 800 jobs for the sake of £1 million.  If the job had only lasted one year it would have netted the Exchequer £5 million and this is made up by way of a saving of £2.7 million in social welfare payments and in a net contribution, at the standard tax rate, of £2.2 million.  It was a simple sum but obviously the Minister did not do it.</P>
      <P>When this news broke the Government responded in a panicked hysterical fashion &mdash; excuse the pun &mdash; in an effort to cover up their disastrous error of judgment and in an attempt to mislead the general public the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach issued a succession of collaborating statements using selected financial statistics to a point bordering on the untruthful.  That is a serious thing to say and I do not say it lightly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can only put on the record of the House what I understand to be the factual position of the grant agreement agreed between Hyster Corporation and the IDA.  The structure is not unusual.  It is very similar to that put forward in large scale multinational agreements.  In my short time as Minister I had the experience of looking at projects and proposals like this one.  I am quite certain my predecessors and the Minister had similar type <Col N="2416" /> proposals put before them.  As I understand it, the proposal was a progressive investment one which was to include annual instalments of investment.  I understand the proposed annual investment by the company and the State was something like this: year one, a grant approved of £902,000 and an investment by Hyster Corporation of £1 million; year two, a grant approved of approximately £2½ million with a corresponding investment from Hyster of £2½ million; at the end of year six a £7.9 million grant approval and an investment by Hyster of £8 million; at the end of year ten, a grant approxal of £10.7 million and an investment by Hyster of £10.6 million.  Minister, they are, as I understand them, the true facts of the proposal that your Government rejected.</P>

      <P>Hyster's investment on an annual basis was to come from company profits, bank guarantees and other financial commitments.  The Minister and many Members of the House are familiar with this kind of investment proposal.  It is important that there are bank guarantees and financial commitments in place and that grants are paid only when the IDA are satisfied and when the company have complied with their legal obligations under an agreement to be entered into.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism would have had us believe that £14 million would be paid <Col N="2417" /> out the first day with an investment of £1 million from Hyster.  They pulled back from that position later, when the panic had subsided, to a ratio of £11 million: £1 million.  Anyone who knows anything about industrial investment projects or the manner in which the IDA operate would not attempt to tell the House or people that the IDA, operating under statute and within guidelines and criteria laid down for them, would attempt to put up a proposal on the basis of a ratio of 11:1.  That is a totally misleading statement and it illbehoves the Minister with such a statement, backed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, to set out to undermine the credibility and professional integrity of the IDA.</P>
    <P>For many years they have been recognised not only here but throughout the world as the most professional industrial development agency in the world.  That compliment has been paid to them many times.  Many countries have tried to copy their strategy and the successful manner in which they have brought international investment here since the sixties.  It is despicable in the extreme for any politician to try to undermine their credibility with a statement such as that when dealing with an international company which had already set up in Ireland and whose bona fides was known to the Government.  Surely the Minister was not unaware of the consequences of his statement and surely the Taoiseach was not unaware of the damage he would do to this organisation who time and again have successfully negotiated good investment projects.  Where would we have been for the last 20 years if we did not have the IDA to bring in large scale investment? It was easy to come along and in order to protect their political scalps, to try to pass the buck and leave the IDA the pawn in a situation which demanded a little more integrity and statesmanship than that shown by the Taoiseach and the Ministers concerned.  It was a sad reflection on the Minister.</P>
    <P>Is that the truth of what happened?  Let us look at what the sequence of events were more than likely.  There were difficult and tough negotiations between the <Col N="2418" /> IDA and Hyster.  I would be the last to say that Mr. Kilkenny, President of Hyster Corporation, ably abetted by his top management executive, is not the toughest negotiator I ever met.  In the <i>Sunday Independent</i> he was classified as the best poker player in the world.  I do not know if he is or not, but he does his job properly on behalf of his company. The IDA carry out their job just as efficiently and professionally on the other side of the table.  Agreement was reached between them.  In a situation such as this, which involves a large project and continuous negotiations, the Minister is kept informed of the likely outcome and if he is not satisfied with what he thinks that likely outcome will be he has an opportunity to consult his Government colleagues and get guidance on what State investment they would be happy to go along with.  If that did not happen the Minister did not do the job properly.  I may have the wrong Minister in the dock.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>What I think happened is that the project was brought to the Government table by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  Either he approved of the project in bringing it to Government or he did not. If he did not, why did he bring it to Government?  I believe he approved of it but, having brought it to the Cabinet table, he found arraigned against him one or two of the senior members of Government, whatever way one wants to count seniority.  I do not know how they do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another factor came into play and that is that it is now an established fact that a former economic adviser to the Taoiseach in the period 1974-1977 and 1981-1982 was appointed by the Government as a director of the IDA.  He quarrelled with the credibility of this project at the IDA authority level.  He lost out there and the IDA approved the project to the Government.  He went behind their backs to his political masters and urged the Taoiseach and Minister of Finance that <Col N="2419" /> Ireland was paying too much for international projects and that they could be got cheaper.  The result was the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance decided against the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and decided that the IDA should tell Hyster they were happy to accept the project provided Hyster would up their £1 million initial investment.  If the Taoiseach and the members of the Government believed this was a high risk project and was too expensive it was their prerogative to refuse the investment.  However, the Minister should not con the people into believing that it was too expensive or too high a risk to be taken on board and then say they would accept it with all its warts if Hyster would put up a further sum of £1 million.  The Minister lost at the Cabinet table because the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance accepted the opinions of economists who are responsible to nobody, who do not go into the public arena looking for investment, who make judgments from a sheltered viewpoint and yet can tell everybody how to run his business.  The Minister gambled and lost.  It was probably not the Minister's decision and he is not the one who should be here this evening.</P>
    <P>It is well know that the Department of Finance and certain economists believe that we are paying too much for international investment.  If that is the Minister's decision, let him say so in a policy document instead of ruining the credibility of the IDA and spoiling their efforts to try to bring investment here.  It is obvious that the Minister accepted the view of one economist to knock this project for the sake of a sum of £1 million. I am sure that the IDA knew, as I know having negotiated with them, that the Minister had not a pup's chance of getting the project back on the rails.  There were already better terms available in Holland and the Minister asked Hyster, who had already brought a very significant project into Blanchardstown, a company who had lived up to all their responsibilities here, to put up a further £1 million.  That conclusively shows that the Minister is <Col N="2420" /> totally incompetent in assessing commercial judgment.  It was a calculated risk going back to Hyster and the Minister lost.</P>
    <P>I have already stated the facts of the proposal before the Minister.  State funding is never paid out in the first year of investment but in annual payments and if the company do not match their investment, the State grant is not paid.  I can only come to the conclusion that using their own selective statistics of £11 million funding to the sum of £1 million from Hyster, was a deliberate propaganda ploy by the Government to undermine and discredit the expertise and commercial judgment of the IDA.  It was to bolster flagging public confidence in the Government, to show that they could effectively manage the country's affairs and that they were in a position to tackle the unemployment crisis.  The Minister knows very well that it was within the criteria and guidelines of the IDA, that it was not a high risk operation and that it was value for money.</P>
    <P>If the Minister had not accepted the project at the very beginning, there would have been some credibility in his stand.  There is no credibility in saying that he would have accepted it if Hyster had put up a further sum of £1 million.  On a close analysis of the facts, any normal person would conclude that the Minister made a miscalculation and that the commercial judgment within the Cabinet is nil.  Indeed, it is also dangerous when it results in losing good projects like this.  I challenge the Minister to give us all the facts.  For the first time in the history of Government Ministers, Deputy Bruton destroyed the confidentiality of negotiations between the IDA and a commercial concern for political ends and the repercussions will be felt for many a long day.  Having selectively broken confidentiality, the Minister then took the ratio of £1 million to £11 million or £1 million to £14 million.  I ask him to fill the gaps and to let everybody make his own judgment as to the facts.</P>
    <P>It is not the first project which has been lost.  The week before, a canning plant for Guinness's Brewery went to Belfast <Col N="2421" /> providing jobs for 270 people.  At the press conference in Belfast, it was clearly stated that they were delighted to wrestle it from the Republic.  The Minister should spell out his policy and if he does not want any more international investment here he should say so.  However, the Minister and the Government should know that we will need large scale international investment for quite a long time to come and we are failing to capitalise on the benefits of the large scale investment which has gone on here for many years. Under successive Fianna Fáil Governments, very large industrial projects were brought in and are still in place with many spin-off benefits.  The black hole in the economy is a clear indication that we are not capitalising on the benefits of large scale investment.  We have succeeded only to a very limited degree &mdash; about 20 per cent &mdash; in supplying the services, components and the needs of large scale investors and that is why the black hole exists.  There is also lack of confidence for further investment here.</P>
    <P>The Minister's disastrous decision in relation to Hyster cost the Limerick region 800 jobs.  The IDA own the factory and it is lying idle.  The Minister took two selective figures, one at each end of the spectrum, and misled the people of Limerick and his own backbenchers in the area.  I cannot understand how he misled the Minister for Justice if he can read figures and I do not know if he can. How did he let that happen to his own region?  It did not happen when Fianna Fáil were in office and it will not happen as far as they are concerned in the future.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 20 May 1985 the Taoiseach said that the decision to seek additional investment from Hyster was one shared by this whole Government. While denying that Deputy Bruton's statement last Friday undermined the credibility of the IDA he said that one thing that was never made clear is that the Government make policies and the IDA execute them.  He also said &mdash; wait for it &mdash; he was afraid that over a long period of time the Government have abdicated their functions and that Ministers have not carried out their functions <Col N="2422" /> in determining the policies which should operate, under what circumstances grants should be given and the kind of input which is needed by a firm coming in here.  He went on to say that they had to exercise their responsibilities in Government, that they were acting responsibly and that the IDA had to accept that.</P>
    <P>The first criterion for any Minister in Government is to respect confidentiality between a firm negotiating a package and the IDA.  The Minister has broken that confidentiality and he has also misled everyone by saying that former Governments did not carry out their duties and responsibilities in relation to the Irish taxpayer.  The Government must have very short memories.  The Minister for Justice must have a short memory and the Taoiseach must have a short memory, but this is what we have come to expect from him in his continuing propaganda exercise in relation to this disastrous decision.  It is dishonest for any Taoiseach to say previous Governments did not carry out their responsibilities. He should remember that the Government of the day did not take on board the De Lorean project.  I am not in a position to know if the Learfan jet was offered to the IDA &mdash; perhaps the Minister knows and will tell us.  He should look at the history of different Ministers and then try to convince us that this is the only Government which turned down IDA projects.  Instead he continues to make these propaganda statements using his Ministers and many well known sources&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He chose to give out information and challenged the basis of the Hyster project in Blanchardstown. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what the <Col N="2423" /> average cost of these 800 jobs in Limerick would have been.  Tell me if the facts I have given are wrong.  It is not good enough for him to stand up and say I am wrong while hiding behind the seal of confidentiality, because he has already broken this seal.  It is time for him to be honest.  I do not believe he is responsible. I believe the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach are responsible.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism was sent out to defend the indefensible.  When these statements are read one after the other, it can be clearly seen that the Minister put his foot in it when he said that the project was so expensive he would not take it for an additional £1 million.  All this panic and hysteria can be seen when one reads these statements.</P>
      <P>Where does the Minister for Justice fit in?  I understand he was in Limerick when the bad news broke but he refused, as he consistently refused, to accept any bad news.  We all know where he wants to go. As I said, he refused point blank to make statements on this matter and he said to his Cabinet colleague that, as the Minister responsible for this area, Deputy John Bruton must issue a statement.  Perhaps the Minister had to be persuaded to make that statement or perhaps he was pushed, I do not know, but he stepped into the breach to defend the indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister issued a statement on Thursday night, and on Friday morning I read the IDA's statement which clearly showed their total dissatisfaction with the Minister's statement.  I understand that the chief executive of the IDA contacted him, told him about the genuine concern of the authority as regards their credibility, professional expertise and future negotiating practices.  They told him the damage that had been done and said they would have to put the record straight. The Minister, according to Press reports, said he accepted that position and told them to issue their statement, which they did.  It was unparalleled in the history of the country for the IDA to make a statement clearly rebutting what the Minister said the day before, and backed up fully by Mr. Kilkenny and the Hyster <Col N="2424" /> Corporation in their statements to <i>The Irish Times.</i> The Minister has an obligation to people of Limerick, to the nation and to this House to admit he has made a <i>faux pas,</i> to admit that the calculated risk taken by the Government at the behest of an economist who does not know what real commercial life is like, who never went abroad to negotiate anything, who does not know how to play the odds and make a value judgment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is for certain. During the last few days that man tried to pour cold water on the Hyster project at Blanchardstown.  I was proud to have been associated with that project in 1982 as are the IDA.  That man has tried to discredit that business project and is trying to mislead the public into believing that the money to be paid by the State, if that project is successful, will be paid on day one, but that does not happen.  I am not breaking the seal of confidentiality when I say that the Hyster project was structured in such a way that the low risk investment &mdash; training grants, research and development grants and so on&mdash; would be paid in the first phase of five years, and after that period there would be a full appraisal.  If the project is successful we will have protected the taxpayers against a heavy State pay out on the second half of the project, when it went into production, and enormous capital grants would be involved &mdash; we all recognise that we are ably assisted by the EC as regards training grants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Hyster project at Blanchardstown was a calculated judgment by the IDA and the Government of which I was proud to be a member.  I have little doubt that the same situation applied in this case, and at any stage along the way the IDA could have decided to cut their risks, not a 14 to one ratio or an 11 to one ratio, but a good project which could have been secured if the Government knew their business.  Over the last two and a half years they have clearly demonstrated that they do not know their business.  They <Col N="2425" /> lost a project to Belfast last week but how many more miscalculations were made in the chambers of power which we do not know anything about?  Is it any wonder that the people ask if the day will ever come when the Government tackle the unemployment crisis which confronts us? Are the Government bereft of ideas and confidence to do the job they were elected to do?</P>
    <P>I honestly believe the Minister was caught in a vice.  He was sent out to defend the indefensible.  I believe the Minister for Finance has reflected the true voice of the Department of Finance that Ireland could secure projects at a lower price.  He is the man who wielded the axe in Limerick, aided and abetted by the Taoiseach, who was badly advised by an economist who has been advising him for far too long.  The country is paying a very dear price for that advice and, worse still, for the acceptance of the kind of advice which created the present disastrous unemployment situation.</P>
    <P>The Minister would be better off if he had made that £1 million investment rather than sending a Minister to Cork yesterday in an attempt to turn the tide by trying to convince the people that the Government will make a £60 million investment down there.  If the Government had spent £1 million in Limerick that would have brought them a great deal more credit and more real jobs.  This would have given the people some confidence in the Government to do the job they were elected to do.  The Minister should not berate the House any more. He should give us the true facts.  I cannot accept that the Minister will hide behind the excuse of confidentiality because the seal of confidentiality has been broken. Put the facts on the floor of this House and stop this misleading propaganda which could blow up in his face, because the unemployment crisis is a time bomb. No amount of misleading propaganda or complaints in the economic world will convince the people that things are different.</P>

      <P>To delete all the words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>Recognises the right of the Government, pursuant to Section 42 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969, (as amended by Section 3, 1975; Section 6, 1978 and Section 3, 1981 Acts) to approve grants in excess of £2.5 million and endorses the policies being pursued by the Minister and the Government in line with the White Paper on Industrial Policy and in the National Plan&mdash;<i>Building on Reality</i>&mdash; in order to promote investment and create the economic and financial conditions in which sustainable new employment can be created throughout the country, including the Limerick area.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Industrial Development Acts empower the Government, in respect of particular industrial undertakings, to permit the making of a grant or grants in excess of certain statutory grant limits imposed on the IDA.  This provision does not in any way conflict with the autonomy and independence of the Industrial Development Authority.  What is clearly intended by the Legislature &mdash; and much of this legislation was passed when Government other than mine were in office.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>

This intention of the House could not be reflected by a mere rubber stamping process, which would of course be the case if the Acts did not allow any response <Col N="2427" /> from Government other than straightforward approval.  The effect of the exercise of this power, therefore, is not to undermine the Authority's position, but rather to indicate that the Authority operates within parameters established by the Government in their policy making role. It is for the Government to make these decisions and for the Government to account for them by their statements here and elsewhere.</P>
      <P>As long as I have been Minister for Industry, any proposal coming to me from the IDA where the Government's responsibility was to approve it has been subjected to the most rigorous examination by me and by my Department.

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as a Minister appointed by it.</P>
      <P>Briefly, the background to this subject is that, following on negotiations between the IDA and the Hyster Corporation of Portland, Oregon, USA, the Government in June 1984 considered proposals for grant assistance for an &ldquo;all makes parts&rdquo; venture to manufacture a wide range of parts for forklift trucks and other handling equipment, to be located at the Annacotty Industrial Estate, Limerick. The Government decided that the project relative to the risks and the cash contribution of the company, was very expensive to the taxpayer in cost per job. Hyster's upfront initial contribution of only £1 million, when compared with a possible total State expenditure on the project of up to £14 million, seemed very disproportionate and would have exposed the State to an unacceptably high degree of risk if the project had failed.  It would, conversely, have made the abandonment of the project by Hyster financially easier than was prudent from our point of view &mdash; that is, the point of view of the State.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to elaborate here on the disparity between the proposed State exposure versus the company cash contribution involved.  While the total State exposure involved could have run to £14 million if the project ran its course, naturally, as in the case of all such projects, all of these moneys would <Col N="2429" /> not have been going in in the first year of the project.  Rather, the State money would be paid out over a period of time as the project progressed.  Nevertheless, the State was being asked to guarantee a provision of up to £14 million of taxpayers' money should the project progress suitably, whereas the company were guaranteeing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The position is, if I may repeat this because there was an amount of sound off-stage while I was speaking, that the only cash contribution coming in from the company was £1 million initially.  Any subsequent moneys coming in from them to match hard cash coming from the Government in grants were going to be in the form of retained earnings.  If they did not make those earnings they would not and could not put in the money, even though the project might be making, say, 1p profit per year.</P>

Companies usually would be tied into the project but that, unfortunately, in not the way it was in this case, because of the fact that there was only £1 million coming up front from the company.  For instance, by the end of year three of the project the State would have invested over £7 million of Exchequer funds in the project as against only £1 million cash from the company, plus a possible additional company contribution from retained earnings in the event that the project would be earning profits by that time; and who can guarantee that they would have earned profits?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This type of high State front-end exposure, without equivalent equity contributions from the company, was considered by the Government to involve a considerable degree of risk for Exchequer funds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In addition to this, it was recognised that there was a further significant risk factor attaching to the project in so far <Col N="2432" /> as its success would depend to a large degree on the company's ability to establish themselves in the &ldquo;all makes&rdquo; spare parts market, which they had not hitherto serviced and in which they could be expected to encounter considerable competition.  In view of the high cost and the relative degree of risk attached to the project, the Government was concerned that in the proposal put to it the Exchequer was being asked to contribute a disproportionately large share of the financing requirements, compared to the contribution that the promoters themselves were prepared to make.  In all these circumstances, the Government indicated to the IDA that they would be prepared to approve grant assistance for the project only on the basis of an increased up front cash contribution from the company as evidence of their confidence in the project's success.  In so deciding, the Government recognised that there was a risk that the project might not proceed.  However, the Government considered that, in view of the high Exchequer cost and the disproportionately high degree of risk that the State was being asked to bear, such an approach was totally justified.</P>
    <P>At that point I might correct one point that Deputy Reynolds made.  There was no offer on the table from the Netherlands at that time.  That was subsequently negotiated by Hyster.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is contradicted by Mr. Kilkenny in his interview with <i>The Irish Times.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The negotiations conducted between Hyster and the IDA were conducted on the understanding that the negotiations were being exclusively conducted with the IDA and with no other authority up to that point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a result of the Government's consideration of the matter, the promoters were asked to put in an additional £1 million equity contribution but they declined.  Any project involving as much State finances when compared with such a low amount of the promoter's initial <Col N="2433" /> cash involved deserves to be considered most carefully from the Exchequer's point of view.  The company expected to recover their investment in less than four years while the State would have had to wait at least twice as long to recover its investment.  Furthermore, if the project failed to achieve its targets, the company stood to lose very little compared to the significant State exposure involved, for example, £7 million after only three years.</P>
    <P>Apart from this clear financial risk there were the considerable commercial risks attached to the project.  It has to be borne in mind that the making of parts for other manufacturers' machinery is an inherently difficult business area.  For example, Hyster could guarantee only a minority share of the use of the plant's output in 1987.  Furthermore, some lift trucks have a very short working life and the advent of low-cost standardised trucks could in time reduce the demand for replacement parts.  Added to all this was the fact that Hyster were entering a market of &ldquo;all makes&rdquo; spare parts which it had not hitherto serviced and in which there would be considerable competition.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonsense.  The project was recommended by the IDA, not by a bunch of amateurs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Apart from the question of the financial and commercial risks involved in this project, the Government also had to consider the likely number of jobs to be created by the project and the very high grant cost of those jobs involved.  Although the figure of 800 jobs has been much touted in the past few days, in fact nothing near that figure would have been created in the early years of the project.  Deputy Reynolds' calculation was based on the assumption of 800 jobs in one year.  His argument does not stand up because that number of jobs would not have been achieved until the tenth year, that is, if everything went according to plan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The employment content was envisaged to extend gradually, with less than 80 jobs in the first two years and it was <Col N="2434" /> not until the tenth year of the project that the planned maximum number would be attained.  For instance, after three years only 140 jobs were planned and only 287 jobs after six years.  Accordingly, the &ldquo;800 jobs approximately&rdquo; figure which has been repeatedly mentioned was dependent on the project being an outright success and completely meeting its job targets which were projected ten years into the future.  Whether or not this would have happened is debatable given the high financial and commercial risk involved.  I already made reference to these job fall-out figures in my RTE television interview on 17 May 1985.  The Government have to be very conscious of the value for money involved in all proposals put before them and there is no doubt that with less than 80 jobs envisaged by the end of year two of the project, the grant cost per job from this project was running high.</P>
    <P>Apart from these considerations, a number of other areas have been touched on in the media by Deputies and by political commentators over the past few days which need some clarification.  There have been comments by some commentators on the relations between the Government and the IDA in this matter.  The IDA statement clearly indicated that they fully recognised the Government's right not to accept IDA recommendations on major projects.  Above a certain figure, IDA grants require Government approval.  The present Government, since they came into office, have examined a number of this type of cases very carefully, often involving considerable exchanges with the IDA.  Let me make this clear for Deputy Reynolds.  The Government are not involved in the negotiations of the IDA.  It is only, when they have completed their negotiations and when a project is presented to the Government that there is a dialogue about the project to establish if it is good value for money.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Not in my time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In my view, for the <Col N="2435" /> Government to be involved on a day-to-day basis with the negotiation of individual projects would be to dilute the independence of the IDA.  They are there to negotiate and to come up with a package and it is the job of the Government to say yes or no.  It is not the job of the Government to arrogate to themselves the functions of the IDA, as Deputy Reynolds appears to want, and to sit in on negotiations regarding particular projects.  If that were to be the case, where would it end?  We would have no IDA but we would have the Government doing all the negotiations.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the Hyster project the Government exercised their judgment and came to the conclusion that the contribution from the company was so light as to be considerably disproportionate to the risk involved for the State. It must be clearly understood that in such, cases it is the Government who make decisions.  The IDA negotiate with the industrialist but the Government ultimately decide.  The Dáil gave the Government the power and the responsibility to approve grants over a certain figure, because beyond that figure the Dáil considered that it should be a matter for the Government to assess.  Everybody who negotiates with the IDA knows that if the grant involved is beyond a certain figure, then the Government's agreement must be sought.  The Government have a right to suggest changing the terms proposed if they think it desirable.  Everybody negotiates on that basis and the IDA statement confirms their clear understanding and acceptance of that situation. In effect, what all this entails is a clear scenario whereby the Government make policy and the IDA execute that policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another area which has elicited mistaken comment is the suggestion that <Col N="2436" /> the project involved the making of spare parts of their own forklift trucks which are on sale all over the world and that a captive market, therefore, existed for Hyster to service.  In fact, the project was mainly concerned with the making of spare parts for other people's machines, as well as Hyster's own machines, and this is clearly a very difficult market in which to win sales.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Read Mr. Kilhenry's statement.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>People who have machines tend to buy spare parts from those from whom they bought these machines and the original seller will want to pick up any spare parts business going for his own machines.  What Hyster proposed to do, therefore, was to try and break in and take this business away from the original equipment suppliers and existing suppliers of replacement parts.  Now, no matter how good your product and your marketing, that is a very difficult thing to achieve and a considerable element of commercial risk was, therefore, attaching to the project.  Given this risk and the recognition of the fact that the company would be trying to break into a new market taking business of existing suppliers, the Government felt justified in seeking an additional £1 million.</P>
      <P>At the end of the day, it has to be remembered that while the Government have a responsibility to try to attract new projects to create new jobs for this country, we also have a wider responsibility to the taxpayer.  At the time the Government took the Hyster decision, it was preparing the national plan.  The national plan subsequently clearly indicated what money was going to be available to the IDA over the next three years for industrial promotion.</P>

      <P>At the time this project was being considered, the IDA did not have these figures and while supplementary budgets may have provided additional funds for the IDA in past years, there was not to be a prospect of this during period when the Hyster project would have been unfolding, although again the IDA would not and could not have known this.  For the first time, the Government set out in the national plan clear cash limits for all organisations, including the IDA.  The IDA were not aware of these cash limits when they made their assessment whereas the Government were aware when they made their decision.  That is the difference between a Government and a subsidiary agency.  The Government have to look at the bigger picture of overall resources and cash limits, whereas the subsidiary agency merely has to act as best it can within its more limited mission.  The Government had to judge the project, which contained liabilities for the taxpayer down the line over a number of years, in the light of what they knew, but what the IDA did not know, was going to be available in money terms under the national plan.</P>

      <P>The Government are very much convinced of the continuing importance of foreign investment in this country.  I am glad to say that since we have come into office we have been successful, in conjunction with the IDA, in negotiating a large number of new projects in this country, providing substantial numbers of jobs, based on the concept of value for money.  We now have over 80,000 people employed, representing 36 per cent of our manufacturing employment, in foreign industry, producing £5 billion worth of goods a year.  We have launched a programme in the form of a linkage programme to get more of those foreign companies to buy more of their goods here so that foreign companies will not be an isolated entity within our economy but rather an integrated part of the total economy, contributing to its general health, rather than simply repatriating profits to their principals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The national plan and the Government White Paper clearly underline that message.  But where the White Paper marks a departure from previous policy is that we see that perhaps in the past incentives had been unduly tailored to the needs of foreign investment and mobile international investment, that we had been neglecting the potential of the small business here, that the incentives which were suitable to somebody from Oregon or Japan coming in here were not necessarily suited to an Irish person wanting to expand his business or to a person wanting to set up business who was a native of this country, that Irish business very often needed not big capital grants &mdash; because they already had premises &mdash; but assistance with marketing their product or with buying in new technology.  That is why the Government White Paper containes a shift in the emphasis of policy, <Col N="2442" /> not to the detriment of foreign investment, but moving to have a more integrated package which contained an adequate provision for marketing and technology acquisition grants which are not exclusively available to home industry but more suited to home industries needs rather than the capital grant type of project which tended to be largely, though not exclusively, of interest to foreign investors.  That is a valuable shift in our investment policy which puts more faith in what our people can do without at the same time expressing any lack of faith in the importance of the contribution of foreign investment to this country.</P>
    <P>I would like to say to the House that there has been a considerable improvement in the investment climate as far as this country is concerned in recent times. I have just returned from an IDA promotion in Germany and in Britain.  I was in both countries about a year ago meeting industrialists there.</P>

      <P>I will tell the House that I have noticed a very considerable difference in the attitude of investors in Ireland, where two years ago, or a year ago one was meeting people who were already in this country, trying to massage them, encourage them to remain here and not complain too much about the problems in the telephone service, of inflation and so on, when one was essentially engaged in a holding operation, on this most recent occasion all of the people whom the IDA arranged for me to meet, with very few exceptions, were new projects on the brink of coming in here, thinking about whether or not they would do so, hoping that they would be able to do so, a much more expansive atmosphere.  Whereas two years ago one was engaged in a holding operation, an operation of limitation, so to speak, at present, thanks to the professionalism of the IDA &mdash; and I have no hesitation in commending the professionalism of the staff of that organisation in their work in bringing <Col N="2443" /> investment to this country; they are a very good organisation and do a very good job &mdash; and thanks also to the successful policies of this Government, which have brought down inflation to 6 per cent, there are much more positive attractions for foreign and domestic investment here.  I know that in the years ahead we will reap the benefits of this.</P>

      <P>As a Member representing the constituency where the project was to be located I was shocked and appalled at the tone of the Minister's reply.  In the last 30 minutes I listened to a speech of more than 5,000 words from him explaining why the Government overruled the IDA in regard to this project.  The reality is that for a sum of £1 million the Government would have accepted the project. For a paltry £1 million, less than the cost of the Kerry baby tribunal, that project would have been based in Limerick and, ultimately, 800 jobs created.  Since I was elected to this House I have contributed to many debates and to most of them I was able to bring objectivity and a certain detachment but I cannot do that in this debate because it is my people, my neighbours and friends whose morale has been crushed by the facts that led to this debate.  This debacle must not be seen in isolation but in the general context of the Government's policy towards the Limerick and the mid-west region in the last three years.  In that time there has been a considerable economic and industrial decline in that region.  I could refer to industries like Mattersons and Ranks which were the mainstay of generations of Limerick people or about more modern industries such as Burlington which is being moved lock, stock and barrel to Tralee.  Even the more modern technological industries set up in the area in recent times have not been immune, as the example of Atari shows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2444" /> We had many closures of small concerns, industries that did not hit the headline but they affected us much more than some of the industries that hit the headlines.  The facts of the case are not that the Government were supposed to put up £14 million to Hyster's £1 million. The facts presented by the Minister are distorted and deliberately designed to confuse and mislead.  The Hyster Corporation had to put up £1 million up front immediately while the Government were to phase in their investment of £14 million over the eight to ten years it would have taken the project to realise its full job potential of 800 jobs.  The £1 million was not the only direct investment the Hyster Corporation had to make.  There was a clear agreement that Hyster would invest a substantial portion of its retained profits back into the Irish economy. Listening to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, one would get the impression that it was his belief that retained profits do not constitute money.  I cannot see the logic of that argument and I am sure that in the local elections the people of Limerick will demonstrate that they cannot see it.</P>
    <P>The return to the Exchequer was mentioned in passing by Deputy Reynolds.  It would be impossible for us to calculate how long it would take the total capital outlay by the Government to have been returned to the Exchequer by way of PAYE and PRSI.  It would depend on how quickly the jobs were created which, in turn, would depend on how well the business progressed.  I should like to point out to Deputy Carey who has been interrupting in this debate that his experience in relation to the chipboard factory in Scarriff, and other factories in his constituency, has not been too successful.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>From what I have heard from Clare the Deputy will have cause to know about them.  Economists I have consulted have told me that at the very best.  Government expenditure could <Col N="2445" /> have been recouped through PRSI and PAYE within two years, and, at the very worst, within three years.  That does not take account of the returns to the Exchequer that would come through an increase in VAT and excise duty arising from an increase in demand the newly employed people would create in the economy.  It is not possible to count the returns to the Exchequer from the increase in business and personal income as a result of the spin off effects of Hyster.</P>
      <P>The Government's initial explanation did not take account of the fact that their investment would be phased in over a number of years.  That means &mdash; the Minister did not seem to understand the implications of this &mdash; that the biggest proportion of the money which had to be put up by the State, directly and indirectly, would be invested at a time when it was substantially less valuable than it is now because of inflation.  The Government's statement did not take any account of the commitment by Hyster to reinvest a substantial portion of the retained profits into the Irish economy. The Government's statement, or their figures, did not take account of the fact that some of the £14 million, £11 million or whatever the sum is &mdash; Government spokesmen quoted different figures &mdash; would not constitute any net cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>Part of the £14 million was to come by way of the factory being let rent free to the Hyster Corporation.  I am familiar with that area and a lot of my relatives live there and I am aware that the factory is empty now and has been idle for several years.  I do not know what extra cost to the Exchequer could be incurred by letting rent free a factory that has been empty for several years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the shoddiest aspects of all this is the cover up and the conspiracy of silence that has surrounded this matter since the deal with Hyster broke down.  I am sure that all Members are fully aware that if the negotiations had been successful, if Hyster had gone along with the Government's amendment to the original deal with the IDA, the Minister for Justice, Deputy Noonan, would have <Col N="2446" /> been the first person to make the announcement.  He would not be talking about 80 or 100 jobs but about 800 jobs in accordance with his usual practice.  He would be on the front page of the <i>Limerick Leader</i> and on television and would insist on opening the project but, apparently, that Minister can only be found when credit is to be taken.  Where questions need to be answered or explanations given Deputy Noonan is nowhere to be found.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>From my feedback I am aware that the people of Limerick are copping on to Deputy Noonan.  I am not in the slightest worried about the Minister but he is worried about me.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who was forced to carry the can for the Government for the decisions of others was quick to step into the breach. It is possible that he was ordered to do so but he did so with such indecent haste that his statement had the effect of undermining, insulting and slandering a respected agency, the Industrial Development Authority, which has promoted and created so much here in the last 20 years.  If the Minister's statement did not insult or offend that agency will the Minister explain why, for the first time in our history, the IDA found it necessary to directly contradict a statement by their own Minister?  The Minister's attempt at explaining the differences between his statement and that of the IDA is a load of nonsense.  Even a cursory reading of his statement tonight shows that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main plank of the Government argument is the risk factor, the risk the project would be to the Exchequer, despite the fact, even on the Government's admission, that it would have cost approximately £1 million extra. Deputy Reynolds quoted from an interview given by the President of the Hyster Corporation, Mr. Kilkenny, to the financial correspondent of the <i>Sunday Independent</i> in the course of which he said that <Col N="2447" /> the risk factor involved was not nearly as great as the Government were trying to portray.  It must be remembered that Mr. Kilkenny has to deal with the Government in regard to the Blanchardstown project.  He has nothing to lose in making such a statement because the project has been committed to Holland.  That statement was made in forthright terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>This relates to Question No. 329 on the Order Paper which was:</P>
      <P>To ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware of the grave miscarriage of justice in the case of Regina Vs. Maguire and others, as screened and debated on a recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on RTE and on the Frost programme on Independent British TV&mdash;AM; and if he will make representations to the British Home Office and elsewhere with a view to reopening the case so as to establish the innocence of the Maguire family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot be privy to what the Minister for Foreign Affairs may or may not have done in relation to the Maguire case but witnessing the huge barrage of public concern on behalf of the Maguire family by British parliamentarians of both a Conservative and Labour hue, and a number of members of the British House of Lords in addition to a number of well known people in the area of jurisprudence in Britain, one can only be concerned that there has been a grave miscarriage of justice in this instance. The 20 minutes allotted to me will be less than adequate to complete the picture of what may have been a serious miscarriage of justice.  Basically, I am asking the Minister for Foreign Affairs to lend his political clout to convincing the British, <Col N="2448" /> authorities that there is a case to be made for the reopening of the Annie Maguire case.  For the benefit of those who might not be familiar with the full facts of the Maguire case, it involved more than Annie Maguire, it involved a substantial part of her family.</P>
    <P>Just under three months ago a prison gate opened and Annie Maguire came to freedom for the first time in ten years. Eight of these ten years were spend in a maximum security A status prison.  This meant that she had few privileges and few visits and had the constant vigilance of two prison officers every time she strayed outside her prison cell.  The ordeal was compounded by the fact that she was aware that members of her family were dispersed in other prisons throughout Britain.  She was committed to a prison cell for an offence for which she considered herself to be not guilty.  The evidence will show clearly that she could not have been guilty of the offence on the evidence that was produced to convict her at her trial.  This term of imprisonment would have been realistic if the evidence produced had been satisfactory. In the circumstances evidence which was less than satisfactory and which was subsequently proved to be less than satisfactory by persons far more prominent than myself in matters of this nature was used to convict her.</P>
    <P>Anyone who heard Annie Maguire on the first class &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme will have been impressed by her dignified uncomplaining demeanour. All she seeks is to establish her innocence.  Well before these programmes were produced I took an interest in this case and the concern expressed in these programmes precipitated me into taking genuine action on behalf of this family.  I also felt that if the British politicians and lawyers in their wisdom were so concerned about what they considered to be a miscarriage of justice why should not we on this side of the Channel activate ourselves on behalf of this Belfast woman and her family.  I took the liberty of addressing the following letter to the British Home Secretary:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2449" /> 16th May, 1985</P>
    <P>Mr. Leon Brittan M.P.</P>
    <P>British Home Secretary.</P>
    <P>House of Commons,</P>
    <P>London.</P>
    <P>Dear Home Secretary,</P>
    <P>I am writing to you in my capacity as a member of Dáil Éireann in connection with what has become known as the Annie Maguire Case.</P>
    <P>You will have the facts of the case at your disposal and I am now formally requesting you to re-open the case on a number of grounds including the following:</P>
    <P>(a)  That the presiding Judge misdirected the Jury.</P>
    <P>(b)  That the chemical test to detect the presence of explosives, as used in the Maguire case, is now in disrepute and has been proved to be scientifically unreliable.</P>
    <P>(c)  That the new evidence you suggest you require to re-open the case is surely the fact that the scientific test used in the case is now known to be flawed and descredited and no longer used by the British authorities in prosecutions of a similar nature.</P>
    <P>I would be glad to meet with you to discuss the matter in more detail and look forward to a response to my representations as soon as is convenient.</P>
    <P>The Private Secretary to the Minister acknowledged receipt of my letter dated 16/5/1985 about Annie Maguire's conviction and stated that it was receiving attention.  I am looking forward to the ultimate response to my representations to the British Home Secretary on behalf of the Maguire family.</P>
    <P>A sub leader in <i>The Irish Press</i> dated 15 May 1985 headed &ldquo;The Maguire case&rdquo; goes into this case well.  Unfortunately <i>The Irish Press</i> are not now functioning and I genuinely hope that the Press group generally will be back in circulation in the not too distant future because in addition to providing news it also provides jobs.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2450" /> However the sub leader in <i>The Irish Press</i> dated 15 May 1985 runs as follows:</P>
    <P>The announcement by the British Home Secretary, Leon Brittan that he will look very carefully at any new evidence about the conviction in 1976 of Annie Maguire and members of her family for possessing explosives only emphasises the unease which many people feel about the scientific evidence on which they were convicted.</P>
    <P>That is the burden of my case.  It is quite clear that the scientific evidence produced in this case is bogus.  It is not bogus in the sincerity of its presentation but bogus in its reliability.  That is fundamental to the whole conviction of this family. The article runs on:</P>
    <P>The Maguires were arrested at a time when Britain was still suffering the hysterical aftermath of an IRA bombing.</P>
    <P>That refers to the Guildford bombings.  I can understand the British people being hysterical at the mindless campaign conducted by that organisation, on behalf of the Republic presumably, but not on my behalf or on behalf of my Party or on behalf of the majority of the people here. That is not central to my argument that these people quite clearly were not guilty of the offence for which they were convicted on unreliable evidence.  This type of evidence is no longer used in cases of this nature.  I responded to the Maguire case editorial.  Unfortunately the editor, Mr. Tim Pat Coogan, is out of business at present and my letter reached him when the newspaper was in suspension. I wrote to Mr. Coogan on 16 May 1985 as follows:</P>
    <P>I note that you have featured the Maguire case in one of your sub leaders of the 15th May, last.</P>
    <P>For the information of your readers I have placed a Parliamentary Question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the matter and have been in direct touch with the Maguire family who have given me permission to pursue the matter through Dáil Éireann.  In <Col N="2451" /> addition, I have commenced correspondence with the British Home Secretary, Mr. Leon Britan MP with a view to discussing with him what appears to be, on the facts, a very serious miscarriage of justice.</P>
    <P>I have spoken to Annie Maguire and she is a woman who has the demeanour not of a wronged woman but of a woman to whom an injustice has been done and she was uncomplaining.  For that reason alone &mdash; it is not a good enough reason &mdash; maybe the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have a look at the case with a view to making the necessary representations on behalf of an Irishwoman and her family.  I was in touch with the Maguire family, Annie in particular, and she was glad that I was raising it on this side of the Irish Sea in addition to the efforts being made on the other side.  The scenario was that Annie Maguire left prison three months ago.  She was sentenced to 14 years.  Her husband, Paddy Maguire, was sentenced to 14 years, their eldest son, Vincent got five years and their youngest son, Peter got four years.  Séan Smith, the brother who stayed with her at the time, got 12 years, Pat O'Neill, a visitor to the Maguire house, got 12 years and the saddest case of all, if one case can be sadder than another, is that of Guiseppe Conlon, Paddy Maguire's brother-in-law who got 12 years.</P>
    <P>The story began in north London where she and her family live and they were arrested under suspicion of bombmaking and were eventually charged with possession of an explosive substance called nitroglycerine.  They were tried over a year later at the Old Bailey. The trial lasted two months and all seven accused were convicted and sent to different jails throughout Britain.  The most extraordinary feature of the case is that none of them made incriminating statements.  No explosives were ever found. Today, ten years later, Annie Maguire continues to protest innocence on her own behalf and on behalf of those other accused.  One of those accused was convicted on what is now suspected to be <Col N="2452" /> unreliable and unconvincing evidence and he died in a British prison protesting his innocence.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned the Guildford bombing and I should place on the record of the House that the presiding judge in Great Britain was Sir John Donaldson and he tried Annie Maguire and her family.  Sir Michael Havers acted as chief prosecutor for the Crown in both the Guildford and Maguire cases.  One significant aspect of the case is that this was the first time in Britain where possession of explosives was to be proved on scientific evidence alone.  We know that Sir Michael Havers was a British conservative MP and he was then shadow Attorney General.  Today Sir Michael Havers is British Attorney General.  He opened the case to the jury and in cross-examination Sir Michael described Pat O'Neill as &ldquo;one of the homing pigeons going down to Paddy Maguire's&rdquo;.  The only evidence of bomb making produced by the prosecution counsel was the presence of nitro-glycerine indicated by forensic testing.  It is fair to say that no explosives were ever found despite the fact that sniffer dogs and sniffing devices were brought into the house at the time and there was no evidence of explosives good, bad or indifferent.  Sir Michael Havers contended that there were traces of nitro-glycerine on the hands of the accused.  The hands of each of the accused was swabbed with cotton wool and then the swabs were taken for testing.  The evidence was that the test was carried out under a technique known as Thin Layer Chromotography or TLC and by a 17 year old apprentice trainee technician who had just completed his O levels.  Again there were no complaints in relation to schooling qualifications but we must ask ourselves what his scientific qualifications and scientific reliability were.  The test itself and the apprentice who conducted it were to become key issues in the case.  TLC is a relatively unsophisticated technique which has been in common use for many years.  The application of the TLC test in explosives cases has brought about reasonable doubt and these tests are now no longer used in such cases.  The tests <Col N="2453" /> were not reliable or reliably guaranteed and these questions were central to the trial which lasted for seven weeks.  The defence attacked and discredited this TLC test and they had an extraordinary witness, Mr. John Yallop, who showed that what the accused had on their hands was not necessarily nitro-glycerine. Surely there we come to the test for all criminal trials that the individual accused must be proved guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, and surely here was doubt.</P>
    <P>Independent forensic experts in Britain familiar with the case have also questioned the validity of the TLC test.  Professor Brian Caddy of Strathclyde University who had studied all the forensic evidence in the Maguire case cast doubts on its veracity.</P>
    <P>These are some of the reasons why I ask the Minister with the greatest of respect to express from this side of the Irish Sea our concern.  He may have done it privately, although I am not aware of that because I am not privy to what goes on in the Department.  We would be doing a service to the cause of justice but more particularly to a family who, let me say without becoming emotional, have been humiliated by a judicial process at which the British consider themselves to be supreme.  In this non-political, non-partisan fashion, I ask the Minister to address himself to the case in the interest of justice for this Irish family.</P>

      <P>The Maguire case is one which has caught the attention of the media and many citizens in recent months, notably since the RTE &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme last April.  I welcome this opportunity to emphasise the Government's concern about the case which has been ongoing since the original conviction.  This is an opportunity for me also to emphasise the Government's concern to advance the welfare of all Irish people in Britain and to do all in our power to ensure that in the enjoyment of their civil rights the Irish in Britain suffer no abuse or discrimination under the British legal and penal system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2454" /> It is fair to say that this Government have been more active than any in the history of the State in pursuing these aims and are working more closely than ever with concerned Irish organisations in Britain on issues affecting the welfare of Irish prisoners with positive results. Today I had a further meeting with the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain&mdash; a meeting which was part of the regular and constant contact with Irish organisations in Britain which I initiated when I came to office.  The Maguire case, together with the problems of Irish prisoners and detainees in Britain, were among the issues we discussed, as was our concern about the operation of the British Prevention of Terrorism Act.</P>
    <P>I informed the Federation of Irish Societies in Britain that so long as the Prevention of Terrorism Act obtains my Department and the Embassy in London will be watching for abuses and will be concerned to help the Irish persons in need.  As a measure of our concern it should be noted that the Embassy in London and my Department maintain a 24-hour service for this purpose amongst others.  We had about 200 contacts from friends, relatives and representatives of Irish PTA detainees in the first quarter of this year.  I want to turn back to the case raised be Deputy Andrews relating to Mrs. Annie Maguire, members of her family and friends were convicted of explosive offences in 1976.</P>
    <P>I appreciate and share the Deputy's unease about this case which has been the subject of renewed attention since the release of Mrs. Maguire on 22 February last.  The two recent &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programmes on RTE, the edited version of the RTE documentary on Channel 4 and other programmes by Robert Kee and David Frost on Independent Television have generated considerable concern in Ireland and Britain and have prompted demands for a review of the court proceedings in Britain and for exoneration of those convicted, one of whom, Giuseppe Conlon died while in prison.</P>
    <P>The trial took place in February 1976. Both prosecution and defence accepted that the case rested on forensic tests <Col N="2455" /> which the prosecution alleged showed traces of nitro-glycerine on the hands of all the accused.  The tests were conducted on the basis of the so-called Thin Layer Chromatography &mdash; TLC &mdash; technique. Cotton wool swabs and ether were wiped over the hands of the seven accused and their nails picked with Cherry picks.  Laboratory tests proved positive in all cases save one, leading to the allegation that the hands of the defendants concerned had been in contact with explosives during the previous 48 hours.  One of the accused, Mrs. Maguire herself had clean hands.  However, kitchen gloves found in a drawer and alleged to be hers gave a positive reaction.</P>
    <P>During the subsequent trial the defence case was that the TLC tests were not conclusive proof of possession of nitro-glycerine and that testing was carried out by an 18 year old apprentice without acceptable experience who destroyed the evidence during forensic examination.  Forensic scientist John Yallop who had originally designed the tests, appeared for the defence but as the House is aware, all seven defendants were found guilty by a jury.  Mr. and Mrs. Maguire received a sentence of 14 years. Their sons, then aged 16 and 13, got five and four years respectively.  Pat O'Neill got 12 years, Guiseppe Conlon 12 years and Seán Smyth 12 years.</P>
    <P>All have now been released but Guiseppe Conlon who had been in bad health even at the time of his arrest died in custody in 1980.  All had applied for leave to appeal against their convictions and sentences.  The appeals were duly heard but the Court of Appeal upheld the verdicts of guilty.</P>
    <P>Several aspects of the case have given rise to recurring concern since the original trial.  The first is that the Maguires were convicted principally on forensic evidence without any corroborative circumstantial evidence.  Indeed, although the police made an intensive search of the Maguire house and the area in which they were living using both sniffer dogs and mechanical devices for detecting explosives nothing was found.  Even a <Col N="2456" /> nearby canal was dredged but to no effect.  So, as I have said, the conviction rested principally on minute traces of nitroglycerine allegedly found on the hands or gloves of the seven defendants.</P>
    <P>It is largely on the forensic evidence, that is, on the question of the reliability of the Thin Layer Chromatography tests that the subsequent public commentary has been based.  In particular the evidence that vital tests were carried out by an apprentice, that the results were destroyed during the tests, that the method of testing was inherently unreliable and capable of giving a false result and that the person who actually invented the testing technique, Mr. John Yallop, was called to the defence during the trial has been raised to strongly question the fairness of the conviction.  These are indeed aspects of the case which would worry any fair-minded person.</P>
    <P>Reference has also been made in public to the more recent findings of Dr. Brian Caddy of the University of Strathclyde who, on the basis of research carried out by him, concluded that there was no unequivocal identification of nitro-glycerine in the case and that, therefore, one could not say with any certainty that the accused actually were handling explosives.  In this respect the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme interviewed a scientist in Ireland, Professor Boyle of Trinity College, who had come to the same conclusion. Scientific doubts have been expressed by other qualified persons also.</P>
    <P>None of the members of the Maguire family or their co-accused has ever admitted to having been guilty of the offence for which they were accused, either singly or as a group.  They did not admit guilt either at the trial or subsequently and have continuously and vehemently protested their innocence.  It has been asserted in their favour that they were exemplary citizens and had no connection with any paramilitary groups.  Mr. Maguire was an ex-British soldier who had lived in England for 20 years and I understand that both he and his wife resisted all attempts to become associated with terrorist prisoners while in prison.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2457" /> Another factor which has surfaced again and again in the recent public discussion of the case is the question of the climate of opinion existing in Britain at the time of the trial.  It has been alleged that the decision of the court in this case was influenced by the rightful outrage of the people of Britain in the face of the Woolwich and Guildford bombings and other terrorist offences and that the Maguires were punished because the climate of public opinion demanded a conviction.  This argument is inherently difficult to assess, especially at a remove of so many years.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, I want to say here that one of the things which always impresses me on my regular visits to the Irish communities in Britain is their view of the tolerance of their neighbours, even in the wake of such outrages as the Brighton bombing.  Yet I feel that the degree of understanding and sophistication which the British people in general show in distinguishing between the evil of the IRA and their ordinary decent Irish neighbours is now at a much higher level than it was ten years ago.</P>
    <P>Indeed, one of the impressive things about recent television coverage of the Maguire case was the obvious strength of conviction of their English friends and neighbours that they were incapable of the actions with which they were charged, and still less of those &mdash; the Guildford bombings &mdash; of which they were suspected.</P>
    <P>I move now to the position of the British Government which is very clear for, as Deputies know, several Members of Parliament in Britain have raised the case in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords.  In debates on 4 August 1980 the then Minister of State in the Home Office, Mr. Leon Brittan, with whom Deputy Andrews has corresponded over the past few weeks, now the Home Secretary, informed the House of Commons that the Home Secretary could consider intervening in the Maguire case &ldquo;only if some significant new evidence or other material consideration of substance comes to light that has not already been before the Courts&rdquo;.  In <Col N="2458" /> saying this Mr. Brittan argued that the Home Secretary could not act as a Court of Appeal and noted in particular that the testimony of Mr. Yallop, the inventor of the forensic test involved, had been considered both at the trial and the appeal.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the British Home Office recently issued a statement which, though it acknowledged the concern expressed in many quarters, repeated the view that the scientific evidence in the case had been considered in great detail at the time and that no grounds had been found which would justify the Home Secretary in using his powers under section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act, 1968 to refer the case to the Court of Appeal. The matter was also debated on 17 May in the House of Lords at the request of Gerry Fitt, who has had a long-standing interest in this case.  In reply to that debate, the British Government again acknowledged the many representations of concern made by respected figures who considered that a miscarriage of justice had occurred, but their response remained the same so far as the scientific evidence and other matters were concerned.  I am aware that it has been alleged that the trial judge was biased in his conduct of the case.  In this respect the Government spokesman in the House of Lords said that the Court of Appeal &ldquo;at the end of a most detailed judgement... concluded that it saw no reason for disturbing any of the convictions either on the basis that one of them was unsafe or unsatisfactory or that the learned judge was guilty of any misdirection or that his summing-up was in any way unbalanced&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I can assure the House that the Government continue to take a close interest in this case and will monitor any developments with a view to taking the matter further with the British authorities.  If Deputy Andrews or other Deputies consider that they have important new evidence in the case I will be glad to receive it.  I know Deputies will share my wish that the British authorities should not take an over-rigid view of their <Col N="2459" /> requirements in the light of the long-standing and widespread concern in this case which they themselves have frankly acknowledged.</P>
    <P>The British authorities are aware of my concern about the case.  They are aware of the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme, as well as the Channel 4, Robert Kee and David Frost programmes.  They have considered all representations but do not find that any new, important issue has been presented which was not dealt with in the courts.  Deputies will appreciate that the Government must be reserved <Col N="2460" /> in their public comments on the court decisions of another jurisdiction.  I repeat, however, that if important new evidence becomes available in this case, I will consider it with a view to taking up the matter further with the British authorities, and I will certainly continue to take a close personal interest in all developments which may offer such an opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 29 May 1985.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 575 and 576 together.  A special age-by-duration analysis of the live register is carried out in April and October of each year.  This analysis was initiated in 1980 as a result of recommendations contained in the Report of the Interdepartmental Study on Unemployment Statistics (Prl. 7925) published in April 1979.  No such cross-classification was compiled for earlier years.</P>
      <P>Results of the age-by-duration analysis for the State as a whole, for October of each year from 1980 onwards, are shown in the following table.  Equivalent results relating to persons on the live register at local employment offices in the east planning region (Counties Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow) on the same dates are also provided.  Information for areas smaller than planning regions is not readily available.</P>

Contract documents are with my Department at present but before their examination can be completed a further report on the quality of the receiving water must be submitted by Kildare County Council as requested by my Department.  This report is awaited in my Department.  As the estimated cost of this scheme is far in excess of the £50,000 maximum limit that applies to schemes in the small schemes programme it is outside the scope of that programme.</P>

      <P>Because of the various stages <Col N="2262" /> involved in road construction (land acquisition, earthworks, foundations, surfacing etc.) and because cost per mile varies by reference to factors such as the standard of road to be provided, land acquisition costs, the amount of earthworks involved, the soil conditions, the provision of bridges, the replacement of services and so on, the length of road commenced or completed in a particular year is not regarded as a particularly useful measure of performance.  The new road plan (PI. 2948, pages 23 to 28) does, however, provide information on the expected commencement and/or completion dates for major improvement projects on the national and major urban routes during the period 1985 to 1987 and on the length of road to be constructed in each case.  While the plan also lists projects to be undertaken after 1987, the commencement and completion dates have not been provided pending the determination of priorities using cost benefit and other studies.</P>
      <P>As announced in the new road plan, the Government will provide the following funds for road improvements in the period 1985 to 1987:</P>

    <P>The level of funding for 1988 has not yet been decided.</P>
    <P>It is estimated that £35 million or 28 per cent of the State provision for improvement works this year will relate to contract schemes at various stages of development.  While I am not in a position at this stage to indicate what the percentage will be in the coming years, I expect that it will increase due to the number of major projects (especially bridges) which will be financed under the accelerated road improvement programme set out in the new road plan.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, on the basis of the information available to the inspector, the husband's total assessable income for the current year, 1985-86, is not likely to exceed the appropriate age exemption threshold of £7,000.  Accordingly, he is not liable to income tax for 1985-86.  An exemption certificate was issued to him on 4 March 1985.  The inspector will now communicate directly with the taxpayer with a view to ascertaining whether or not his wife is in receipt of income.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer ceased employment on 31 December 1984 and subsequently submitted three claims to the inspector of taxes for repayment of tax on the grounds of unemployment. The claims were dealt with in February, March and April 1985 respectively and cheques in settlement of the refunds due were subsequently issued to him.  The final claim was dealt with by way of a review of his liability for the year 1984-85.  In the review he was granted all the allowances and reliefs to which he had proved title for that year and therefore, there is no further refund due to him.</P>

      <P>The Office of Public Works' original proposals for the extension to Killeenan national school, County Galway were prepared on the basis of the acquisition by the manager of the school of a site extension.  It transpired that the manager was unable to get a site extension and it was necessary to consider the scheme afresh.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 619 and 620 together.</P>
      <P>No specific circulars or instructions have been issued by my Department in relation to this scheme.  The regulations in force from time to time determine the period and amount in respect of which refunds are calculated.  These are at present one calendar month and £28 respectively.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Accordingly health boards will refund the cost in excess of £28 of drugs or medicines prescribed for use during a calendar month.  Recoupment is made on the basis of drugs used during a calendar month, rather than on purchases made within a calendar month.  For example, if a month's supply of a particular medicine is purchased at the beginning of a month, <Col N="2273" /> and again at the end of that month, the latter is regarded as being in respect of the following month.  Accordingly recoupment is calculated on the basis of two separate calendar months.</P>

      <P>Domiciliary care allowance is payable in respect of children who due to a physical or mental disability require a level of care and attention which is substantially greater than that normally required by a child of the same age.</P>
      <P>Eligibility for domiciliary care allowance is determined by reference to the degree of care and attention required by the child rather than to the type of disability or illness involved.  There are no specified illnesses or other disabilities which automatically qualify for the allowance; consequently the question of extending the scheme to a particular category such as children suffering from cystic fibrosis does not arise.  Domiciliary care allowance is not intended as an income maintenance scheme and the means of parents are not taken into account when assessing eligibility.  Parents who are experiencing the financial burdens reffered to by the Deputy could apply for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.</P>

According to the Department's records the person concerned did not satisfy the contribution condition during the contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governed entitlement to unemployment benefit on her claim of 13 February 1985.  Her claim was accordingly disallowed.</P>
      <P>She appealed against the disallowance on 26 March 1985, but an appeals officer also disallowed her unemployment benefit claim on the grounds that she did not satisfy the contribution condition. She was notified accordingly.  She continues to sign for credits.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a person to have contributions paid in respect of at least 156 weeks of insurable employment.  The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 890 reckonable contributions of which only 143 were paid contributions. He does not, therefore, qualify for the pension under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
      <P>He was also insurably employed in Great Britain for a period of 38 weeks. Under EC regulations the insurance records of a person who was employed in another EC member state may be combined to enable him to qualify for a pro-rata rate pension calculated on the basis of the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total.  In this case the combined total amounted to 928 of which 890 were Irish contributions. His pro-rata rate pension was calculated accordingly giving him entitlement to the pension at a current rate of £45.60 per week.</P>

      <P>The administration of the Department's services on a regional basis would require resources of staff and equipment that are not available to it at present.  The Department is conscious of the need for providing as much information as possible in relation to its services on a localised basis.  With this in mind, a computerised inquiry service has been provided in local offices throughout the country and this is gradually being extended as circumstances permit. Improvements in the telephone system including the installation of a modern PABX in Aras Mhic Dhiarmada, work on which is now in progress, will significantly reduce delays for people contacting headquarter sections.</P>
      <P>The question of deciding and paying benefits such as disability benefit, which are at present administered centrally, on a local or regional basis is something which the Department keeps under review.  Because however of the current pressures on the Department's local offices and also because of the additional resources which would be required, it can only be viewed as a somewhat long term possibility.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is currently entitled to an old age pension at the maximum weekly rate of £47.50 which includes a living alone allowance of £3 and an over 80 allowance of £3.20.  To effect recovery of an overpayment of pension, deductions of £2 per week were being made until early this month.  This overpayment has now been recovered and the pensioner has been requested to return his books for the appropriate <Col N="2299" /> adjustment.  When these are received the pensioner will be issued with the appropriate pension books which will restore his full pension entitlements.  These will include the living alone allowance book which did not issue to the pensioner due to an administrative error.  Any inconvenience caused to the pensioner is regretted.</P>

      <P>109 full time and 16 part time wardens are at present employed in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>The expenditure in 1984 on pay, allowances, and equipment of traffic wardens in Dublin was approximately £993,000.  The corresponding expenditure for the period 1 January 1985-30 April 1985 was approximately £311,000. These figures do not, however, include any sum in respect of pension liability or overhead costs.</P>
      <P>The total amount of fines-on-the-spot paid in Dublin in 1984 and in the first four months of 1985 was £1,486,000 and £450,000, respectively.  The total amount of fines imposed by the court throughout the country under the Road Traffic Acts which was lodged in 1984 to the Motor Taxation Account of the Department of the Environment was £3,154,000.  The corresponding figure for the first four months of 1985 is not readily available.  Records are not kept in such a way as to isolate the amount included in the figure of £3,154,000 which relate to court fines for parking offences in Dublin.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="2332" /> propose to take Questions Nos. 743 to 751, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I am informed that redundancy lump sums have recently been paid to the employees concerned.  However, my Department have not yet received claims for payment of relevant rebates.  Consequently, particulars of the entitlements in individual cases are not available to the Department.</P>
      <P>I should explain that the calculation of the amounts of lump sums payable is a matter for An Bord Telecom as the employer.  I understand that there have been some disagreements between certain employees and An Bord Telecom concerning the amounts of lump sums due.  If any of the employees concerned is still dissatisfied with the amount of lump sum as calculated by An Bord Telecom, she is entitled to submit an appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal.</P>
