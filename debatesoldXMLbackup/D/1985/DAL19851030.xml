    <Title>National Development Corporation Bill, 1985: Second Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill is not needed because the IDA, SFADCo, AnCO and the National Enterprise Agency are looking after employment.  This is just another layer of bureaucracy and it will be interesting to see who will be appointed to the corporation and if they will come in conflict with the IDA.  This will cost taxpayers' money for a long time, if set up.  According to the terms of the Bill, the NDC will look for good projects.  The IDA and SFADCo are in that business and are finding it extremely difficult now to find good projects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also talks about disposing of assets and about equity capital and so on but, if one looks into the Bill, there is no financial commitment.  Together with taking up good projects will the NDC be put under pressure to take on lame ducks?  God knows, we have enough lame <Col N="604" /> ducks at the moment.  Because of wrangling between the Labour Party and the Fine Gael Party it took nearly three years to introduce this Bill and the Labour Party maintain that they got what they wanted.  That is open to question and it is obvious that many Fine Gael members are not happy with it.</P>
    <P>Taking everything into consideration the IDA have operated very well, although I have some reservations in regard to the type of grant-aid being approved by the IDA.  It seems to many people that in relation to grant-aid the IDA are now export orientated.  Some good projects which would provide local employment for the home market have met with reluctance on the part of the IDA in terms of grant-aid.  This should be looked into.</P>
    <P>When the NDC come into operation it will be interesting to see what projects they will encourage.  I cannot see the public investing money in this company and I cannot see the Department of Finance putting money into a high risk project.  Most of the procedures in the Bill can be dealt with by the agencies I have already mentioned.  This is just another layer of bureaucracy which will not create the number of jobs suggested in the Bill.  Many civil servants and board members will be appointed to this new company and there will be political patronage.  The Taoiseach said that he would appoint people to State boards on the basis of their ability.  I am not criticising any of the appointees, but if one looks at the list of recent appointments to State boards, they all leaned very much to the right side.</P>
    <P>

    </P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Enright is well aware of that.  I should like to see SFADCo becoming involved throughout County Offaly.  They have been doing a very good job in west Offaly and I hope the Minister will facilitate the extension of their activities to the entire county. Throughout Laois-Offaly we have very high unemployment, depending to a large extent on Bord na Móna and the ESB.  I <Col N="605" /> am afraid there will be no improvement in that position.</P>
      <P>I should like to know what risks will be involved for this corporation?  How will they become involved in companies?  Up to now the IDA, AnCO and the other agencies associated with industry have been well able to look after companies which come in here.  They are well able to continue such activities without the NDC.  Will the new corporation be asked to intervene in failing industries?  These are questions that must be asked and are being asked by professional commentators. I do not think it would be for the good of the country if the new corporation were asked to prop up ailing companies.</P>
      <P>All in all, because of high taxes particularly, industry lacks incentive.  Both workers and management are crippled by our high tax rates, and substantial relief will have to be given if we are to have a proper industrial promotion climate. From now on we will depend more and more on small industries, factories employing between ten and 20 workers. We have seen the emergence of this in the US and Canada where small industries are thriving.  The same is occurring here and we must get out of our heads the idea that in future big industries employing between 400 and 1,000 people will be prevalent.</P>
      <P>I hope that I will not be out of order when I speak of delays in the payments of grants by existing agencies.  Apparently they are caught up in red tape in regard to title and other legal procedures and business people suffer as a result.  This will have to be looked at with a view to speeding things up, and the employers would be grateful if the Minister looked into it.</P>

      <P>The Deputy put me on notice that he would introduce a matter whose relevance would be doubtful. I let him make a passing reference to it but if he attempts to go into it in depth he will be out of order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>Our main aim must be to get the industrial climate right through <Col N="606" /> reforming our tax structure so that things will be made more attractive for investors in industry.  Our existing agencies are well able to look after these things and I therefore cannot see the need for a new one. I should like to see all agencies playing a more active role in horticulture, particularly the marketing of horticultural produce, because our present arrangements leave a lot to be desired.</P>
      <P>The Bill provides that the Government may provide finance if the corporation decides that a project would be viable. Already the agencies we have are in a position to do this.  I agree that the agencies we have require some streamlining because I do not think they have been as successful as they might be.  I am open to correction on what was grant-aided by our agencies but the failure rate would be approximately 10 per cent only.  If 90 per cent of what we grant aid is successful that is very good.</P>
      <P>The agencies in operation are capable of undertaking all that is required here and of supplying jobs.  At this time I cannot see the desirability of bringing this new company into being.  The question that must be posed is: what would it do that the other agencies are not doing already?  What would it do that our other agencies are not capable of doing already?</P>

Last week there was an announcement in relation to private sector aid &mdash; relief from employers' PRSI, constituting a boost to the construction industry and an employment incentive scheme.  This Bill provides a vehicle not already existent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is estimated that annually £1,000 million of investment is required in terms of replacement of fixed assets and working capital in order to sustain industrial output at its current level.  I am not talking about an increase in industrial output or in industrial employment but rather a sustainment at its present level.  All the indicators, whether through the stock exchange, the venture capital market or loan finance available through the banks, <Col N="607" /> show that the present investment level is approximately two-thirds of that, somewhere between £600 and £700 million per annum which is leading to a shortfall. Some of this can be explained by the current recession in certain blue chip industries.  But there is no doubt that there is a need for this country to develop a proper investment policy.  We have seen notable progress and shall see more. First, in terms of the investment market, there has been the operation of section 84 loans.  There has been also the introduction of the business expansion scheme, allowing the taxpayer to underwrite investment in manufacturing industry over a three to five year period.  We are also seeing the development of a third tier of small business stocks to be quoted on the stock exchange, a very welcome development.</P>
    <P>By far the biggest problem of investment in manufacturing industry is that there exist other lucrative opportunities in the form of gilts that the Government are selling through the stock exchange, whether in the form of investment bonds, such as the Housing Finance Agency, the Trustee Savings Bank or others of a whole variety of different equity markets. The rate of return and the tax rate on those investments are much more generous than those pertaining to investment in industry.  We must ask ourselves: what can be done to reverse this trend?  How can we get the billion pounds per annum into industry and more to create employment and jobs?</P>
    <P>The first problem that must be confronted is the present profitability of manufacturing industry.  It is important to realise that the profit from indigenous manufacturing industry dropped from 5.5 per cent in 1978 to 1.5 per cent in 1982 and to 1 per cent in 1983.  Therefore, when one invests in manufacturing industry not only does the tax treatment of the profits not favour that type of investment &mdash; it favours gilts and so on &mdash; but the rate of return on that investment is not good.  Our industries today are under-capitalised. The resources, whether by <Col N="608" /> way of pension funds, private investment, banks, are not being invested in manufacturing industry.  We must ask: how do we solve that problem?  But there have been welcome improvements.</P>
    <P>I view this National Development Corporation as a vehicle to get investment into manufacturing industry that does not exist at present, to sustain industrial growth and job creation in that sector. Having said that, it must be earmarked specifically for a certain subsector of industrial activity.  For instance, in the Joint Committee on Small Business we find the most common problem confronting small businesses in the manufacturing sector is that they can have a full order book, be trading profitably and still go out of business because of starvation of equity finance.  Many companies, whether exporting, producing for the domestic market, whether in the natural resource area, in the food processing area or in secondary production, find their biggest problem is that their ratio of loan capital to equity capital is all wrong.  The most desirable ratio is 1:1.  But we see that the debt equity ratio of many companies is up to 14:1, in other words, they are totally over-dependent on loan capital, the interest charges on such loans forming an albatross around their necks. Therefore, we must find a means of injecting equity into these companies. That must constitute the starting point of the need for this National Development Corporation.  The IDA can put in money only in the form of a gift of grant aid.  It does not constitute share or equity capital; it constitutes an injection of a gift of capital at the start up or expansion stage and bears no relationship to the cash flow problems of that company.  Bearing in mind the need for this Bill, the need to fill the void in the Irish investment market I should like to see a certain tightening up of certain loose ends of the Bill that I fear exist on Committee and Subsequent Stages.  In welcoming the Bill my only reservation is that we may be embarking on a policy that will establish a whole new generation of semi-State bodies which would be undesirable.</P>
    <P>In the course of the summer I spent a <Col N="609" /> lot of time studying the current state of our semi-State bodies or, as they are officially known, Irish commercial semi-State sponsored bodies.  If one analyses the situation carefully one will see that there are problems obtaining here.  The December 1984 figures show that the Irish public sector debt, which is the Exchequer and semi-State debt, amounted to £22½ billion.  Semi-State bodies, or State industry, accounted for 18 per cent of this public sector borrowing figure of £22½ billion.  In other words, Irish State owned industry, as it stands at present, accounted for £4 billion of borrowings at December 1984.  What is even more disturbing &mdash; if one looks at the six worst semi-State bodies &mdash; is that they managed to lose in the years 1979 to 1983, a total of £1,000,000,036.  This would include subventions in the instance of CIE for losses.  If tax levels at present are 36½ per cent of GNP, basically the taxpayer cannot afford to underwrite that level of loss again.  Through the policies of the Government there has been a rapid improvement in the balance sheet performance of many State bodies but the figures, nevertheless, are quite startling. It is incredible to think that CIE were allowed to lose £776 million between 1979 and 1983.  It is a national scandal and should not have been allowed to happen. It will not recur because the Government are insisting that it does not happen again.</P>
    <P>The idea of the National Development Corporation is a good one because it fills a void in the investment market.  It allows equity injections into companies which need it.  However, if the Bill is taken literally, particularly in its open ended emphasis in section 10, my fear is that we could be setting up another generation of semi-State bodies.  Therefore, we must look at the options which arise through setting up the NDC.  If we look at European experience, leaving out the UK, the whole policy relating to State industry is changing.  For example, this year West Germany propose to raise $700 million through the sale or part sale of State industries to finance a tax cut of 16 per cent.  In Holland two major proposed <Col N="610" /> sales of part shares were in relation to Hoogovens and VSM and there was also a part sale in Sweden.  A number of Deputies mentioned that Sweden is a success story in relation to State industry and this year they are in the process of selling part of Luxor, P K Banicon and a number of others which vary from holding companies, all in the trading sector, as well as banking companies.</P>
    <P>In Italy the parent State company of ENI sold 20 per cent of a subsidiary so there seems to be a European shift towards denationalising and part selling of certain companies.  In Britain there has been a crusade of privatisation which I do not support, but there have also been successful part sales of Britoil, Sealink, Amersham, British Sugar, National Freight, British Telecom, British Rail Hotels and British Aerospace.  There is a shift in all these countries of different political hues.  There are socialist Governments in Sweden and in France. Perhaps the State's level of activity, its absorption of GNP in taxes, expenditure and debt as a proportion of GNP and the servicing of that debt needs to be rolled back.  We may be going in the other direction and setting up a whole new generation of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>Many of our semi-State companies were set up 30 or 40 years ago.  The life cycle of their business has changed and it is time for them to finance new, partial State enterprise.  Aer Lingus are a statutory corporation set up in 1937; the ACC were also set up in 1937; Bord na Móna were set up in 1946; B &amp; I were set up in 1965; Ceimicí Teoranta were set up in 1938; the Irish Sugar Company were set up in 1933; CIE were set up in 1945, the ESB were set up in 1927; and Irish Life in 1939.  Times have now changed and we need a new impetus towards industrial development.  We need a National Development Corporation, but surely it is better to finance them from companies who are 40 and 50 years old, who have been given a fair crack of the whip and who are now looking to the Exchequer for more injections of equity.  They should be told to go to the private sector for equity, that the Government are not <Col N="611" /> going to flog them off as Margaret Thatcher did, but that the cash will be raised for the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>If we look at the alternative sources of finance for the National Development Corporation, it is clear that we could get a flotation on the Stock Exchange for the corporation, but I suspect there would be no takers unless it was State guaranteed. The next option is to raise an Exchequer loan to pay for it through the public capital programme.  Our national debt stands at £22.5 billion and has breatly increased since December 1984.  There are limitations in regard to that course and the means of equity investment are such that we should pursue this corporation thoroughly and positively but we should look at ways of raising the money other than from the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I wish to seek clarification with regard to section 3(1) of the Bill which provides that every body specified in the First Schedule shall be a State-sponsored body for the purposes of this Act.  Subsection (2)  provides that every body specified in the Second Schedule to this Act shall be a State-sponsored commercial enterprise for the purposes of this Act.  Does this mean that every company aided by the National Development Corporation will be an Irish commercial State-sponsored body?  If so, will we set up another generation of semi-State bodies?  Are we perhaps embarking on a repeat performance of what has proved very costly to the taxpayers so far?</P>
    <P>Section 10 outlines the principal objects of the corporation and the paragraphs run from (a) to (k).  They are very open ended although that is not necessarily bad in terms of the sector the corporation can support.  All the up to date reports recognise that we cannot rely exclusively on the manufacturing industry and that there is a huge area in tourism which needs to be looked at.  Would it not be better &mdash; and this is my personal preference &mdash; to specify in the Act what we want the National Development Corporation to do?  No investment in any company should be greater than the sum <Col N="612" /> of £150,000.  It should also be specifically earmarked for companies with less than 100 employees and of course I include in that any company just starting up.  There should be an insistence on management expertise in these companies and we should invite and actively headhunt people who are employed by multinationals or large companies who wish to set up in business on their own.  Thus, we would have a programme for small business development through the National Development Corporation.  My fear is that if the NDC take on a very large enterprise &mdash; for instance, an electronics or pharmaceutical company &mdash; a sum of £100 million could be a drop in the ocean. As the NDC are a private limited company there is the danger that if one very large project ran into difficulties the whole NDC would have to be liquidated because they would be the parent company of this new semi-State large venture. The potential of the NDC is enormous and I should hate to see it jeopardised by one failure.  There will be failures and that is right because we are entering a high risk area.  If we had a success ratio anywhere between four and six per ten enterprises it would be very good.  In America two successes out of ten is considered very acceptable.</P>
    <P>A small business development programme dealing with firms employing up to 100 persons would earmark £150,000 on a minority equity injection basis.  That would be restricted to companies where the management satisfied certain criteria and, secondly, where the banks were exposed without any State guarantee on a borrowing ratio of one-to-one equity capital to loan capital.  In addition, the entrepreneur would have to put in a substantial amount of equity, say, a minimum of 20 per cent.  In that event the NDC would put in 40 per cent equity, the banks would put up 40 per cent loan capital with the entrepreneur putting in 20 per cent himself.  There is little scope for abuse, there is involved the greatest and most dynamic potential of our economy, namely, the small business sector and we avoid having a new generation of semi-State industries.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="613" /> A recent survey conducted by the CII indicated that one-quarter of Irish manufacturing firms were constrained from developing because of the shortage of finance.  On the other hand, more than half of these firms perceived that they had little difficulty in identifying projects that were profitable.  There is no State monopoly on good projects.  The people in the areas concerned have the projects and the necessary expertise but they need to be helped in a certain way that will give them the right kind of finance that is available in terms of expanding and developing their ideas and bringing them to fruition.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that there is a problem in the venture capital market.  If a person has a brilliant idea and takes out a patent there is no way he will want to sell 51 per cent of his idea.  On the other hand, if the idea is not so good the banks or the venture capital agencies are not interested in acquiring 51 per cent.  There is this divergence between the requirements of the financier and the entrepreneur. If there was an accepted norm, where 40 per cent equity capital could be available for companies employing between one and 100 employees provided the project satisfied the criteria, it would be much more successful than having the NDC scratch around for projects themselves. I do not believe there is this multitude of projects that the private sector has failed to exploit into which the State can move and make a success.  My fear is that all that will be left will be the sour cream.  Many good ideas are not getting off the ground because of shortage of finance.  The IDA or the banks cannot fill this role at the moment but the NDC could fill it.</P>
    <P>I should like clarification on one issue. In his speech the Minister said he would draw up operational guidelines to avoid an overlap between the NDC and the IDA.  If a small firm propose to set up an enterprise making go-cars for children, if they purchase premises and machinery and if the NDC are involved, surely it is quite wrong that they do not qualify for IDA aid because they will have satisfied the criteria laid down by the IDA.  If they <Col N="614" /> went to a private venture capital agency for money they would get IDA support. It is quite anomalous that companies that are equity injected by the NDC will not be in a position to get IDA grant aid. Perhaps that matter could be clarified in the guidelines referred to by the Minister. If the project in question meets all the criteria of the IDA, the latter should be in a position to aid the company.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the NDC setting up large industries, of the demand for this and of the failure of the private sector, we must ask the question how it is that the NDC are expected to succeed.  I am saying the existing package available of IDA aid is so generous that what the NDC have to offer in respect of joint ventures probably will render it uncompetitive with the level of aid offered by the IDA.</P>
    <P>If a person wishes to set up a large pharmaceutical company that proposes to market a drug for asthma and if all the necessary feasibility and viability studies have been done, he would be much more attracted towards the IDA for 45 per cent grant aid than to relinquishing any percentage of potential profits in the company by giving a stake in it to the NDC.  There is what I would describe as blurred vision regarding what the NDC can do.  I do not wish to throw cold water on the NDC.  There is a void in the Irish investment market which needs £1 billion just to keep going at its present level and that void needs to be filled.</P>
    <P>I see a role for the NDC but they should have much clearer terms of reference. To get the best response, aid should be restricted to companies of a certain size and there should be restrictions on the amount that can be written off.  For instance, if 500 people came forward with projects and if each of them employed ten people on the basis of 40 per cent equity injection, there would be a dent of 5,000 in the unemployment rate of 230,000.  This would be worthwhile.  The IDA and the various Ministers are encouraging entrepreneurs to move into the area of the national linkages programme. There is tremendous potential in the area of State purchasing which will <Col N="615" /> be best fulfilled by helping small companies which are filling a particular need on the home market to develop an export base.</P>
    <P>I was particularly pleased to see clarification in the Minister's speech of the National Enterprise Agency.  It must be recorded that Mr. Healy and his colleagues have served this country well and deserve our support.  They did not see their job as setting up a quango which would involve huge tape cutting performances at the opening of big factories. They knew from experience that the biggest job creator is innovation.  When the wheel was invented a whole new industry was created and when the micro-chip was invented a whole new industry was created. Large scale job creation is dependent on innovation.  In my view, the fact that the NEA laid particular emphasis on high technology research and development projects was correct and I believe projects they helped will reap rich dividends for the small sum invested.  The NDC absorbing the NEA can only strengthen that corporation but I hope the NDC will have the same <i>modus operandi</i> as the NEA.  I would hate to see political pressure being brought to bear on the NDC to get big projects off the ground without having the most strict form of selectivity possible in terms of project evaluation.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that NDC aided projects will be able to compete with other businesses, but I see a problem here.  If it is decided by the NDC that the most profitable sector is the retail area, it would be totally improper for the State to get involved in that business principally because of its effect on its competitors. For example, if a price war can be underwritten by taxpayers' money, that will not make good sense because their competitors will also be paying taxes.  In other words, they will be helping to undercut their own businesses.  That makes no sense.  There will have to be greater clarification of the sectors of business in which the NDC can operate.</P>
    <P>If the NDC are to pursue a small business development programme, it will be <Col N="616" /> far easier to operate the suggested time limits.  I understand that before any project is aided, the Minister and the board will decide that in two, five or ten years they will be trying to sell their equity investment.  As we already have a business expansion scheme which sets down a five year period, there is a precedent for stating that equity is only injected on a given basis under certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>I hope private sector representation will be predominant on the board, somewhat akin to the membership of the board of Fóir Teoranta, and that there will be one or two representatives with considerable experience in the area of small businesses. We want this board to be seen as a friend of small businessmen, helping them to promote and develop their businesses.</P>
    <P>There is much misinformation about our natural resources.  Many people say they are totally neglected, that we have failed to develop them and that the NDC should specifically zone in on this area.  I believe many of these people are unaware of the current level of activity.  I have experience in the farm milling industry which is in the throes of competitive depression.  The meat industry, which is based on our livestock, is extremely competitive and it is dependent on the slightest change in intervention and on the Common Agricultural Policy and there is surplus capacity in both industries.</P>
    <P>As regards oil exploration, there is already a licensing procedure, a facility for the State to take a stake in companies which are involved in our oil exploration and a number of Irish companies are quoted on the Stock Exchange.  There have been developments in the fishing industry with the setting up of co-operatives and a number of fish processing plants along the west coast in particular. Taking all these matters into consideration, it would be wrong to assume that the private sector have failed to exploit our natural resources.  Admittedly, there have been some failures, not because of lack of exploitation but because of competitive pressures.  To say that the NDC should focus on that area and that they will solve all the problems which people <Col N="617" /> like Clover Meats or Ranks Flour could not do, would be very wrong.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, it is better for the NDC to be in a responsive position rather than to initiate projects.  The Revolving Investment Fund for Employment is good, but I think the emphasis on maximum employment is wrong.  Everybody would like to employ the maximum number but that is no basis on which to base equity injection.  The principle must be the rate of return.</P>
    <P>That brings me to another point on which I should like clarification from the Minister.  What will be the requested rate of return on equity injection by the NDC. I presume it will be preferential equity shareholding, that there will be an option to sell their stake after a given period. What is the rate of return being requested?  Is it 2 per cent per annum and 10 per cent after a five year period, or is there any insistence on a rate of return? If the Minister's emphasis on profitability is to be adhered to there must be some guidelines in terms of the requested rate of return for any equity investment.</P>
    <P>I should like clarification on a few matters. In the event of the equity shareholding being sold by the NDC will it be liable to capital gains tax?  That may seem an unusual question, it is the same as asking if Bord Gáis profits are liable to corporation profits tax, on the basis that it is all State money and it is all going to the Exchequer.  However, if, as the Minister outlined, the intention is that there will be a number of instances where the NDC will inject equity alongside private sector venture capital agencies that tax question might become very relevant.  One cannot treat shareholders differently.  If other companies are to be liable to capital gains tax there may be a problem in terms of capital appreciation of that shareholding or dividend.</P>
    <P>If it is the intention &mdash; I hope it is not &mdash; that the role of the NDC is to acquire the likes of Bula, as was suggested in a press report, I fear that the opportunity for it will be lost.  That would tarnish the reputation of State industry.  State industry is not bad <i>per se</i>.  It has its problems, such as the fact that there is a <Col N="618" /> tendency by management to feel that there is a bottomless pit of money to underwrite any problem via letters of comfort, or whatever, and there is also the problem in relation to employees. Their demands on a State owned company in the event of rationalisation will be far more excessive than on a private company simply on the grounds of a disbelief of any argument of inability to pay. While State enterprise has its problems it must be the aspiration of all those who support it that the NDC is successful and seen to be so.  Therefore, it must have clearer terms of reference than those outlined in sections 3, 10 and 15.</P>
    <P>I hope that as a result of the debate we will have a strengthened National Development Corporation, one that is earmarked to do a particular job, to inject equity on a minority basis as part of a programme of small business development for firms of between one and 100 employees.  The equity should be injected for a five year period along the lines of the business expansion scheme that raised £4.5 million in the 1984-85 tax year.  I suggest that the NDC could easily inject £20 million to £30 million per annum along those lines and do a very good job at creating the order of 5,000 jobs per annum.  If that is the goal and we move away from any fears of setting up a new generation of semi-State industries the NDC will be successful.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to congratulate Deputy Yates on his contribution. Since he was elected a Member he has added a new dimension to economic comment.  He has put forward very fair minded and balanced views on economic matters that come before the House.  I wish him well and a long tenure in the House because we need Deputies of his quality.  I agree with what he sees <Col N="619" /> as the main philosophical thrust of the Bill, the whole concept of small being beautiful, his proposition being that small industries are a good thing and that the employment of between one to 100 people is good.  That is fundamental to the Bill.  However, I do not go any further with him.  The Bill is conceptually wrong. It appears to be proposing another piece of bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>We have a number of State agencies which can cater for the very things the Bill is seeking to achieve.  The IDA have given good service to the State.  We also have Córas Tráchtála, AnCO and the National Enterprise Agency and I should like to know why, in the name of heaven, we need a National Development Corporation. Is it not a piece of bureaucracy upon a series of existing bureaucratic organisations?  I am 100 per cent anti-bureaucracy but I am not anti-bureaucrat. Our civil servants have never been found wanting in the service of the nation.  They are above corruption and have done their jobs well.  If there are any complaints about the way the Civil Service operates we must blame the politicians who down the years have done damn all about it.  I am not criticising the Civil Service but the bureaucracy, the operation of the day to day work that creates so much bureaucracy and hardship.</P>
      <P>My main complaint against the NDC is that it is an additional piece of unnecessary bureaucracy.  We have a number of very good agencies that seek to achieve the objectives of the Bill.  The Title of the Bill reads:</P>
      <P>An Act to provide for the promotion by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism of a limited company to invest in and to secure the establishment and development of industrial and commercial enterprises and to provide for other connected matters.</P>
      <P>As I understand it, our existing agencies seek to achieve what is set out in the Bill. Section 2 states:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="620" /> (1)  In this Act, except where the context otherwise requires&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;the Agency&rdquo; means the National Enterprise Agency Limited,</P>
    <P>&ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; means an industrial undertaking including an undertaking ancillary to industry or a commercial undertaking (other than an undertaking whose functions relate wholly or mainly to the provision of banking, insurance, legal, management consultancy, advertising, public relations or financial services);</P>
    <P>&ldquo;functions&rdquo; includes powers and duties;</P>
    <P>So be it.  We now know what an &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; is.  Deputy Yates properly asked what the terms of reference of the Bill are.  As I understand it, the broad terms of reference are set out in section 10 and there can be no difficulty about them, but section 13 reveals something that is already in existence.  That section states:</P>
    <P>It shall be the general duty of the Corporation&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)to assist in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State, and</P>
    <P>Surely that type of agency exists.  Why is it necessary to have this additional piece of bureaucracy?  The section goes on to state:</P>
    <P>(b)to carry out its objects, which shall include the realisation of investments made by it as soon as is financially and commercially prudent, in such a manner as to enable the Corporation to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by it and ensure that funds are available to the Revolving Investment Fund for Employment.</P>
    <P>If the Minister when replying can convince me that the Bill is necessary I will seriously consider voting with him.  I do not say that lightly.  However, nobody, not even one of the most competent Members on economic affairs, Deputy Yates, has convinced me that the Bill is worth supporting.  I suspect that Deputy <Col N="621" /> Yates did not have very much enthusiasm for the Bill.  He put forward very cogent and articulate propositions which cannot be challenged but I suspect that he and I are of the same mind in relation to this Bill and that he may be supporting it because he is a member of the party proposing it.  That might be an unfair charge and if he considers it so I will withdraw.</P>
    <P>There are many spectres raised by this Bill.  Are we not putting the commercial cart before the horse?  There is talk about setting up industries outside the city and county of Dublin.  Does the Bill envisage the quick passage of transport between Dublin and places beyond Navan, well known to the Chair?  Does the Bill envisage the passage of goods transported by huge oil-belching juggernauts which poison the city and county of Dublin on a day-to-day basis?  We simply do not have the road infrastructure to accommodate much of what the Bill envisages.  We have the most disgraceful road structure from any capital city in the world.  The less than healthy would be given heart attacks by the experience of travelling between Lucan and Kilcock behind a huge mass of traffic between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m.  I am sure there are people who have suffered as a direct result of being held up in that traffic snake.  It is a disgrace. Now we are being asked to pass this Bill in the light of a road transport infrastucture which is shameful in many areas.  Many good things have been done in relation to road building, such as the Naas dual carriageway and bypass which are magnificent examples of the workmanship of ordinary Irishmen.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about industry which relates to the infrastructure of the whole nation.  I have made my point.  The Minister should convince the industrialists whom we are attempting to attract that we have a tremendously well educated electorate and workforce, probably one of the best and most literate <Col N="622" /> workforces in the world.  It is also a young workforce but the problem is that a large majority of them are out of work.  Does this Bill envisage taking many people off the list of the unemployed?  Does it give any hope to the unemployed who have recently left school and see no future in this country?  I do not think it does.  It is just another piece of nonsense being proposed by Fine Gael to encourage the Labour Party to hang in there for the next couple of years.  This legislative nonsense is the product of the Labour Party and it appears grossly unfair that in a democratic system a minority party like the Labour Party should be inflicting this piece of bureaucracy on the totality of the Irish people.  It is wrong in principle, if not in practice.  It is unfair that the Labour Party should be let get away with it.  What is wrong with the IDA, CTT, the National Enterprise Agency and all those semi-State organisations who are already doing what this Bill intends to do in addition?  The Bill is a piece of socialist nonsense, given as a sop to the Labour Party and we should be very wary of it. I have no doubt that the Bill will pass through the Dáil since Labour and Fine Gael have a majority.  We must accept that the Bill will come into existence.</P>
      <P>I would return to the Yates principle that small is beautiful.  If this agency is to be set up it should concentrate on small industries.  Chairman Mao up to the time he went mad and went on a bout of cultural revolution had some very good ideas in relation to community-based industries. His successor, a man whom I study very closely, is also a man of great vision. Mao went a little bit bent or off side in the latter years of his life probably through, God help him &mdash; or whoever helps people like Mao &mdash; old age.</P>

      <P>I am relating the Chinese experience to the Yates principle that small is beautiful and that the fewer large conglomerates we have the better. We need more community-based enterprises in the Chinese sense.  The Bill if it is to do anything must enable this philosophy to be applied in the small industry context.  The future of this country is not in the hands of the conglomerates, some of whom treat their employees extremely well while others look on their employees as mere digits who can be easily disposed of.  When some of those multinational companies bit the dust during the summer and went into liquidation, the attitude to their employees was nothing short of criminal.  A report in one of the newspapers indicated to me that it would be much better if we were to concentrate on home-grown industry rather than international industry.  At least people who set up a home-grown industry would have to account to their neighbours for putting them out of work.  These other people come from the top of a skyscraper in New York and set up large enterprises but by the lifting of a telephone they can wipe out that large industry.  They have no obligation to the country or the people. That is why I am urging that this Bill should enshrine the philosophy that small is beautiful.</P>
      <P>I would also hope that the board of directors will not be political hacks but people appointed on sheer merit.  Our children have to do horrible examinations based on the points system because they have to operate in a meritocracy.  Why should we in this Dáil not give a better lead in that regard?  Do not look over your shoulder to see it it is a member of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Labour or The Workers' Party in the unlikely event of this or that.  People appointed to State or semi-State boards should have proven themselves in their own field.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="624" /> Let us bring an end to political &ldquo;hackery&rdquo; which will do the Dáil little good.  It does not rate highly in human values or in the eyes of the people, but I blame us and certain sections of the media for that. However, if we are to have a philosophy that small is beautiful enshrined in the philosophy of the people who will be running the corporation, let us buy guaranteed Irish products for whatever we are doing.  One great problem is that we do not concentrate sufficiently on the buy Irish programme.  By buying Irish we are keeping Irish men and women at work.  Buy Irish manufactured.  If the product is manufactured in Ireland, let us buy it.  If it is a good product, there is no reason why we should not buy it.  I hope the people who are to operate this ball of smoke, this additional piece of bureaucracy, will keep this in mind.  The quality Irish guaranteed programme has not been very successful and the fault lies with the nation itself.  So many times we go into supermarkets and see, for example, Jacob's biscuits and come out with some English or foreign made biscuits. That is a shame when a first class product made in Ireland by Irish people in an Irish company is available.</P>
    <P>These are some of my thoughts on this Bill which I condemn: (1) for another layer of bureaucracy added to organisations who can do the job more than adequately as set out in that Bill; (2) because I suspect that it was not brought in in any altruistic or pure fashion.  It was introduced in a political manner to keep the Labour Party quiet for the next two years to bring them through their term of office.</P>

      <P>I welcome the legislation to set up the National Development Corporation, even though the experience in other European countries and in the US of State investment companies has been, to say the least, bad.  I think it was Deputy Keating who in a previous contribution in this House stated in regard to State investment companies in countries such as Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and right across Europe, with the exception of Sweden, that the experience has been <Col N="625" /> that they were a drain on national resources ultimately and were wound down.  Sweden was an exception and the record of State investment company there is quite good.  The US set up the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932 and that company was wound up in the early fifties after a Senate investigation into anomolies in its operation both political and financial.</P>
      <P>Therefore, in most European countries and the US the experience of the setting up of State investment companies has been bad.  The companies were set up with the best of intentions.  Highly motivated staff were appointed but, due to a combination of political pressures bringing about unsound judgments, bad investments because of political pressures and the backing of hopeless cases and lame ducks, disillusionment set in amongst the staff of these companies, the rot commenced and they became a burden on the State.  Therefore, the lessons that were not learned in Europe and in the US must be borne in mind when this company are set up finally.  If the NDC are to be successful they must be free of political pressures.  The best people available must be encouraged to become members of this corporation.  We must have people with imagination who will seek out the good projects which have lacked financial resources, and we should encourage those projects to become even more viable.  We must forget about our lost causes and lame ducks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What are the problems that have given rise to high unemployment and a lack of job opportunities and what can we do about these problems?  I will not be too parochial, but I come from a constituency where we have experienced more than our share of closures in recent times. Many of these problems which arose not only in Cork but througout the country arose because of the removal of protective barriers under free trade agreements with Britian initially and then with the EC.  These closures of industries with a high employment content of manual workers had a further disastrous knock on effect in the ensuing closures of service <Col N="626" /> industries and retail outlets in the centres where these companies ceased to exist. We in Cork have suffered more than our share of these types of closures in recent times.  A fault with all Governments is that areas like Cork seem to be sucked into the idea that everything good and positive must be located in the Pale, in the Dublin region.  We must recognise, of course, the setting up of An Bord Gáis in the Cork region and that has gone against the tide, but there were pressures also to suck that venture into the Pale. Such action would be to the detriment of the outer regions only 160 miles away, and of areas like Cork and the west coast. The growth of the Dublin region is unhealthy.  We have lopsided development and Dublin is growing out of scale with the size of the country.</P>
    <P>On the national level we have two major problems: A negative attitude towards the value of wealth creation and an air of begrudging towards any person who tries to make a few £s in <i>bona fide</i> business.  We have a crucifying level of taxation which creates disincentive when we need incentive.  A recent survey by the CII indicated that a quarter of Ireland's manufacturing firms were constrained from developing because of shortage of finance and, on the other hand, more than half of those firms who were interviewed felt that they had little difficulty in identifying projects which were profitable but they had not the finance to develop these projects.  A number of developments have occurred in recent years which have reduced the attractiveness for the private investor of investing in industry.  Profitability in manufacturing industry in Ireland dropped from 5.5 per cent on sales in 1978 down to 1 per cent in 1983.  Such factors as the abolition of the export profits tax relief which provided tax relief dividends to shareholders and its replacement by a system whereby dividends are taxed at rates of up to 60 per cent militated against private investment. The same can be said regarding the abolition of the 20 per cent rebate on dividends and of the introduction of an advance corporation tax on Irish publicly quoted manufacturing companies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="627" /> The high cost of borrowing &mdash; 729 per cent more than the inflation rate &mdash; also operates against private investment though there have been positive moves in that area in recent times.  Small and medium sized companies are paying 729 per cent more than the inflation rate for moneys borrowed.  Capital taxation at 60 per cent on sales of shares makes stock exchange investment highly unattractive. Consequently, there are a number of steps we must take in order to make the environment more attractive for the private investor.  There is an annual investment yield of £1,000 million but we are only attracting little more than half of that.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers have asked what we intend doing about the high taxation rates but these speakers failed to put forward any solution to the problem.  I note that there are differing views as to how we should proceed in this area.  The problem has been made even worse as a result of the recession and the drop in yields from taxation and because of the high levels of public expenditure.  My colleague opposite, Deputy O'Kennedy, and I are members of the Committee on Public Expenditure and we in the committee have been examining the ways in which public moneys are being spent.  It is an understatement to say that the standards in relation to the spending of public moneys and those in respect of expenditure in private enterprise are poles apart. Until such time as we bring about an air of accountability in our public expenditure programmes we will continue to have to fund unreasonably high levels of expenditure in that area, expenditure which too often is expended inefficiently and unwisely.  Therefore, we must take a critical look at our public spending programme with a view to introducing more efficiency in the area of public projects. I apologise if I seem to be labouring this point but unless we create a proper environment for the setting up of the NDC, our moneys could be swallowed up in that area also.</P>
    <P>In the area of current supply services, health, education and social welfare are <Col N="628" /> responsible for 60 per cent of total expenditure. There cannot be a drop in taxation levels nor any real reform until such time as our expenditure in these areas is brought under control and made more efficient.  Unfortunately, real control in this area will only be possible when governments have the backbone to take on so many of the powerful vested interests that oppose any cut in these areas. These groups have grown in strength and have had their way for too long because of the failure of previous Governments to deal with them when the occasion arose. They now have a stranglehold on any government who attempt real cuts on public expenditure.</P>
    <P>Governments must come to grips with these groups if we are to have efficiency and control in the area of public expenditure. Until such time as this happens there will be little real reduction in taxation levels and we will not be able to provide a proper environment for economic growth.</P>
    <P>However, if we attempt cutbacks in public expenditure we must encourage the private investor in a positive way because the State has not the ability to finance the major programmes required to bring our economy to the standard of our European competitors.  We do not have the ability to finance major infrastructural works because of our already high borrowing levels.  That is why there is a responsibility on any government to encourage the private sector to invest in this area.  Because of our high levels of borrowing, one-third of all our revenue is diverted towards interest payments to service these loans.</P>
    <P>Our house construction programme is another area that represents a major draw on our resources.  In this sphere the State and the private sector should be able to come together on the matter of arrangements for a public housing programme. Local authorities have at their disposal the land that is necessary for a house construction programme.  A number of major bodies such as building societies have the resources to fund a national construction programme so there should not be too much difficulty <Col N="629" /> in the State, the building societies and the banks co-operating in a programme that would reduce to a large extent the waiting list for housing.  Such a programme would effect a major inprovement in our house construction programme with little or no cost to the State.</P>
    <P>That type of imagination, too, is required in respect of the road development programme and I am glad that a start has been made in that regard.  Co-operation with the private sector in these types of programmes is essential at all times.</P>
    <P>The private sector are labouring under a major handicap to the extent that interest rates are at between 7 and 9 per cent higher than the inflation rate of 5 per cent.  The Government have succeeded in narrowing this gap and we are now fully in line with the Community average of recent times.</P>
    <P>The inflationary spiral in which the economy was trapped for so long has been broken and the gains we will reap from this new found stability should be noticed soon in terms of increasing economic recovery.  This can be noticed already to some extent.  The reduction on VAT this year has been a factor in this development.</P>

      <P>We must strive for lower interest and inflation rates and a strengthening of our exchange rates.  This would bring about a healthy investment climate for industry.  We must not throw away the golden opportunity to become competitive with our trading partners.  The achievements of the last 12 months have not received the recognition which they deserve, being overshadowed by the controversy over public sector pay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> In setting up the National Development Corporation the Government have accepted that we will not see an influx of foreign investment, such as the country experienced in the sixties and seventies. We now realise that we are on our own and that it is important that we use the potential of our natural resources efficiently for the creation of several thousand jobs.  Deputy Yates dealt with this potential, saying that claims have been overstated in recent times.  I believe that there is massive potential for the development, for example, of our food industry.  To be parochial again, in the Cork region we have a university which has carried out extensive research in biotechnology.  The co-operation of the academic institutions, industry and Government could result in a major impact on the European market.  This is a role which the National Development Corporation could adopt, encouraging a new approach to the development of the food processing industry and the placing of investment in areas with major emphasis on product development.  There is a huge market, especially in the richer EC countries, for our products.  There would also have to be an emphasis on the proper marketing of these products, something on which we have fallen down during the years, as Deputy Andrews has said.</P>
    <P>There must be greater co-operation between the academic research institutions and industry.  The National Development Corporation could be a catalyst, bringing about the implementation of the new technologies in the production and processing of our agricultural products.  The research has been done and all we need now is confidence and the money needed to develop this research. The Government should appoint a Minister to liaise between the agricultural sector, research institutions and the industrial sector.  There is room for improvement with regard to proper liaison between those different sectors.</P>
    <P>We must remain competitive if we are to make an impact on the European market.  This we must bear in mind at all times.  The corporation must take into consideration the potential of the land <Col N="631" /> and the expertise and experience of our educational and research institutions. There is urgent need to switch resources towards the production of processed foods.  A recent magazine showed the gross value added in the food industry as follows: in Germany 64 per cent; Belgium, 62 per cent; the UK, 65 per cent and Ireland away down the list as 25 per cent.  This is an area which we should exploit, as there is great room for improvement.</P>
    <P>I mentioned the developments in the biotechnology area.  These have been particularly successful in the manufacture of certain natural products.  They have been applied quite successfully already to one industry in the Cork region.  The potential is massive, but the manufacturing industries must use the new technologies and expertise and be given adequate finance for success.  There is potential there for tens of thousands of jobs and I am not exaggerating.  We have the image of having a clean environment and have a top class reputation as an agricultural country.  All we need to do is bring forward the products which will sell on the sophisticated European markets.  If we set about this task in a proper manner, Ireland &mdash; and I hope my own area &mdash; will become a food production centre of Europe.</P>
    <P>The banking institutions which have vast capital at their disposal, the educational institutions having vast potential in skills and the Government must come together to exploit the potential, with consequent creation of thousands of jobs. The Government should set up a special ministry to promote liaison between the different Departments dealing with this area.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation must not become an avaricious devourer of public moneys, a prop for lame ducks or a vehicle for political &ldquo;band-wagoning&rdquo;.  The people appointed must have proven track records in business and must be seen to be independent of party political pressures.  I am sure they will be.  The principle of accountability must remain.  Too often in the past <Col N="632" /> empires have been built on public money and there was an impossible situation when the time came to dismantle them. The decrease in inflation rates and interest rates and the stability of our currency have brought about a resurgence of confidence among the business community. The measures announced in the House last Wednesday were generally welcomed by the construction industry and business.  I hope these will be only a first step in the creation of many more jobs.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>We have to tackle the area of insurance, make our courts more efficient and tackle the high level of claims being made against insurance companies.</P>
      <P>I also wish to deal with the question of bank charges.  The introduction of these charges by the banks in a time of recession when so many companies were in difficulty was inexcusable and scandalous and there should be an investigation as to why these charges were allowed when banks were making fairly good profits.  This is an area we should tackle at the same time as setting up the National Development Corporation.  I believe many of the comments made last week in relation to the banks were quite true. The Minister should talk hard to the banks about the way they introduced charges and increased a man's liability in running a small business from £20 per year up to £2,500 without warning.  Surely that is relevant while people are being killed off in business and at the same time the State is investing taxpayers' money to promote business and act as a catalyst.</P>
      <P>All ours efforts in relation to job creation will be fruitless if we do not take on the people who are taking money out of the job market, the vested interests who are killing off a lot of industry.  The reality is that an atmosphere has been created that we can get something for nothing, a free ride.</P>

Since I am not allowed to develop these points I will conclude.  I sincerely welcome the Bill and hope that the problems which beset State investment companies in other areas of Europe and the USA <Col N="634" /> will not be allowed to develop here.  I hope that the people appointed will have expert knowledge in the commercial field and that they will be allowed to work independently.</P>
      <P>I would like to hear the Minister's reply to some of the points raised by Deputy Yates regarding overlapping of the role of the NDC and the IDA, specifically in relation to small industries.  There is some confusion about their respective roles. Small industries need to be developed and it has happened in the USA that many small industries have mushroomed into larger ones.  We also need to encourage service industry which is getting no encouragement under existing schemes. I await with interest the Minister's comments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If ever this nation needed a programme for national development the time is now, but the instrument proposed for achieving that programme is the most ineffective and least in line with the priorities required. We have heard for some time about the gestation pains of the NDC and we should acknowledge that, for any instrument of policy to become effective, the first thing is that the Government themselves should not only seem convinced but determined in their collective role that the instrument will not just be introduced but implemented effectively.  Even before its birth &mdash; it was more an abortion than a birth &mdash; it was very clear that this corporation would serve only one purpose, the constant purpose of this Government, namely, their own survival.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is a purpose that can somehow portray to the public that in this instance the Labour Party are still alive and still in Government and a decision which they demanded as of right three years ago is about to be implemented.  That is the only purpose of this legislation and it is quite clear that those who would achieve a new development and sense of renewal in every sector of our economy do not have any sense of confidence in this development and less confidence in the capacity of a Government on their last legs, searching in every direction for <Col N="635" /> every hope of survival, to implement even the aims of this Corporation.</P>
    <P>Let us look at the extent of the problem which this corporation will have to tackle in terms of employment in manufacturing and related industries.  Then we must look at the extent of the potential because at this point of national depression, if not despair, that is at least as important as looking at the problem.</P>
    <P>This Government came into office with four main economic priorities.  The first was to reduce unemployment; the second was to reduce the level of taxation; the third was to reduce the level of borrowing; and the fourth was to bring order into our public finances and reduce the level of current budget deficit.  Where do we stand on each of these commitments which are printed in gold type on the statements by the Taoiseach on the first day of this Dáil and subsequently by many of his colleagues in Government?</P>
    <P>Unemployment has risen to the totally unacceptable level of well over 17 per cent of the labour force, an increase of about 55,000 since this Government came into office.  I want to make some corrections to that figure so that we will know exactly what this new State agency are setting about.  We are told that 17 per cent of the labour force are unemployed. From that calculation we have to exclude at least 70,000 young people and others who are on the plethora of schemes which this Government have introduced since they came into office.  These are short-term schemes and part-time training programmes which offer a bit here and a bit there.  The people on these schemes are not included in the figure of 230,000 unemployed, the highest percentage in Europe or any other democratic country of which I am aware.  If we were to add that 70,000 to the 230,000 we would have a figure of at least 300,000 of our total available work force who are not in employment and who at this point have very little hope of securing permanent employment.</P>
    <P>Most of those among the 300,000 are, understandably but unfortunately, in the private sector.  I will not repeat our earlier <Col N="636" /> debate in regard to the public sector, which I will not denigrate, but there is one great difference between the two sectors. That difference is that a huge proportion of the present unemployment figure has occurred in the private sector, about 95 per cent of it.  In the public sector vacancies have not been filled but at least 90 per cent of those who have become unemployed have been in the private sector.  Therefore, we can say that at least 40 per cent of the work force in the private sector will not be able to get employment.</P>
    <P>That is a reality and it has to be inserted into our social picture.  We cannot put the boot down on those who are breaking the law without realising that it is an inevitable consequence of the horrific failure of this Government since taking office to do anything about unemployment. We are talking about tackling the problem through this corporation.  The level of unemployment is unprecedented in our history and in the experience of any other democratic country in the world.</P>
    <P>Another cause is taxation and the impact it has had on employment.  It has been acknowledged by the Government freely and publicly, asserted here by the Taoiseach and the Ministers for the Public Service and Finance, that our tax levels have reached unacceptable proportions. Such tax levels are unacceptable here as they would be in any country. The reality at last has been accepted but that reality is totally at odds with statements made by members of the Government in the last six months.  They have undertaken to reduce taxation levels particularly in regard to income tax.  They said they would contain the growth of taxation but we find from figures given by them that we have the highest levels of taxation in the 27 member nations of the OECD &mdash; we are top of the league; we are in the hyper league, and if there could be promotion to a hyper hyper league we would gain admission.</P>
    <P>As a result of Government policies, taxation here now takes £6,000 million of our national income, an extraordinary figure considering that we need to encourage incentive, enterprise and <Col N="637" /> effort.  Since 1979, when taxation accounted for 26 per cent of GNP, under this Government it has grown steadily; although the GNP itself has been diminishing because of lack of investment and consumer capacity.  However, the tax take has increased by 10 per cent to almost 36.5 per cent of GNP.'</P>
    <P>That is our problem.  We have the Government deliberately setting about fiscal aggregates in order, they say, to bring about fiscal rectitude, bridging budget deficits by increasing taxation levels.  They are not being Thatcherite in that because no Thatcher Government would talk about reducing deficits by increasing taxation.</P>

Until the Government are prepared to look carefully at the imposition of these taxes and the manner in which they have been imposed, the NDC, to be administered by three Ministers but the responsiblity of 15, with all the hopes in the world will not achieve anything because the reward for investment is not there and the penalties for investment are all too obvious.</P>
      <P>Unemployment has been our greatest problem and employment our greatest priority, but the tax structures and levels under this Government are geared against the maintenance and the creation of employment.  They discriminate in favour of capital equipment but they discriminate against the creation of employment. This has been shouted by us in the House so often that I wonder how long the Government will ignore it.  On every £100 spent on employment costs the return to the investor is as little as £55, taking into account taxation.  PRSI and other costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="638" /> Is unemployment our major problem and the creation of employment our major priority?  If that is so, as the Commission on Taxation have said, our tax system should be neutral as between employment costs and equipment costs. I would suggest some discrimination against equipment costs in favour of employment.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not purport to deal in any way with that fundamental problem. It is not surprising that the consequence of this short-sighted policy has been that the deficit we were going to reduce has expanded.  I want to record that within one week of the last budget, publicly inside and outside this House, I gave the reasons that deficit could not be contained within the figures given by this Government, that the basis of the document entitled <i>Building On Reality 1985-87</i> was illusory.  I might refer the Government to that illusory document to demonstrate my point.  Their projections were based on an average of 210,000 unemployed throughout the course of this year. Within two weeks that figure had risen to 225,000 and was clearly rising.  It was evident from that fact that the social welfare costs required to meet the increased number over those projected would set the whole budget target out of line.  Equally it can be contended that the numbers employed to sustain the revenue to pay for the growing expenditure would be diminishing, leading to the present impossible burden of taxation on an ever-diminishing pool of labour to feed a growing number of unemployed.  That fact was evident to all but those who did not wish to see it and those who promoted that great document within two weeks of its publication.</P>

      <P>To present another illusion on top of all of these &mdash; as if this will solve all of our problems &mdash; amounts to nothing less than an insult to our people in the current state of depression.  I do not have recourse to the information over in Merrion Square at this time but the deficit for this year will amount not just to £1,234 million &mdash; a figure the Government may regret they ever introduced because it is too easily remembered &mdash; but at least £1,334 million, at least £100 million more and that allowing for some little tinkering going on at present in terms of what is euphemistically called savings and about which we hear an awful lot these days.</P>
      <P>Where can this Bill fit into a pattern of priorities that are not alone illusory but have been abandoned by the Government?

      <P>There are two ways of approaching a programme for national renewal.  One is to look at resources, personnel, natural, physical resources, personnel in terms of our people, natural resources in terms of our land, fisheries, forestry, minerals and tourism, creating a climate in which people will invest in these and in which the nation economically will play its appropriate part, thereby bringing about a sense of renewal, realising the great potential I contend exists despite the current problem. The other way is to say: &ldquo;No, we shall not look to the nation, the doers, the goers, the achievers, the workers, the patriotic people who are concerned at present.&rdquo;  When analysing the problem I did not even mention emigration and many people have left already.  &ldquo;No, we will do something consistent with what we have been doing in Government.  We will have another agency, another scheme, another layer of State involvement.&rdquo; The State will work it all out through the Departments that will be consulted by the three Ministers who are charged with responsibility here thus constituting the answer to our problem. There will be another huge growth in the bureaucratic structure of this nation if this is allowed to develop into anything other than a notion which is all it is. Already this year this Government have invested more in agencies and schemes than any other Government of which I can think&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If there are priorities in terms of our limited resources, if we are to provide something as large as £300 million by way of equity or promotional capital under the terms of this Bill, then let us examine how the Government see those priorities being established and implemented.  The largest single increase in public expenditure this year by a Government committed to controlling and reducing public expenditure has been in the administrative agencies under the aegis of the Department of Labour.  They have received a 48 per cent increase over last year.  This year they received £174 million of the hard-pressed taxpayers' money. Let the Deputy opposite not accuse me of knocking AnCO, Manpower, the Youth Employment Agency and all of those'&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>If, in addition to all of these administrative agencies that have enjoyed that huge increase we starve our native resources such as agriculture, the <Col N="642" /> food industry, education, and we add this one, is it not very obvious that the path this Government have been following will lead us into a deeper <i>cul-de-sac</i> than the one into which they have led us already? Have we not seen sufficient bureaucracy, agencies and roles defined for semi-State bodies?</P>
      <P>Recently I heard a committed semi-State servant say, &ldquo;All we require are people with some capital who are prepared to take a risk, who have the skills, and we will support them.&rdquo;  I know that he was genuine in what he said, but if we had people with capital who were prepared to take a risk and had the skills to implement their programmes I do not think they would be looking for too much support.  There are more agencies ready to give support and fewer people to avail of it and the same nonsense will apply in this case.  I am not speaking personally but I do not have confidence &mdash; neither do my party &mdash; in the capacity of the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism or the other Ministers who will be associated with this to make judgments as to what is viable.  While the Ministers have the benefit of great public servants who will always respond to a challenge and a purpose we must remember that if they are wrongly led they too will be caught up in the maze and mire.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to this the IDA could deal with these matters quickly but now there will be papers, documents and proposals passing from one Department to another seeking approval for appointments.  We will spend time, energy and money in passing this kind of proposal to and fro until the Minister is satisfied that a particular venture is worthy of support.  We need quick, effective decisions and sometimes risks must be taken.  I do not think that public servants believe that this is the role that they should play because everything will have to be prepared and presented so that Ministers can argue about appointments.  Each of the 15 Ministers involved will have memos when they attend Government meetings and the dossiers which are taking up so much <Col N="643" /> of their time at present will take up even more under these proposals.  Are we seriously suggesting that that is the way to tackle our problems?</P>
    <P>We all know that something is needed for national development.  We need a programme, a commitment and a direction but we do not need another agency. We are told that the National Enterprise Agency will be subsumed in the National Development Corporation who, according to the Government, have a much broader role to play, a broader remit and a much more ambitious programme than the National Enterprise Agency. Because they are wider, broader and more ambitious and part of the confused theology of the Government, the corporation are presented as a major commitment. Because of the ill-directed purpose, the corporation do not point in any direction.  The National Enterprise Agency have a very tight, definable remit but they will now be done away with. They were never allowed to flourish; the Government merely kept them going while they engaged in this futile argument over the last two years.  Their role was and should still be &mdash; and will be when Fianna Fáil come back to Government &mdash; to promote a pool of venture capital to create incentives for the private sector to participate in equity investment here, to get a return for investment for risk taking which would in some way be commensurate with the return from investment for safe haven deposits which has become a factor in recent times.  Above all else, it should ensure that the money which is flooding out of the country at present would stay where it belongs and that people who would in a normal climate invest in their own enterprises would not be hiding their money to avoid the constant hammer of the tax man.</P>
    <P>Allowing for every barrier in the way of the National Enterprise Agency, the finger on their throat all the time, they have been successful, in so far as they have been allowed to be.  Much of the programme of the enterprise agency would be on knowledge-based industries where further participation would be <Col N="644" /> implemented only after a five-year cycle and sometimes after a ten-year cycle as has been demonstrated in many states in America, in Japan and elsewhere.  We should also have promoted such a climate but instead we choked it and introduced this further nonsense of a State octopus which will get its tentacles on everything that moves and will tell the people in the private sector how to achieve success.  I put my money on the people out there to determine what is success.  Inevitably there must be failures in achieving the success which will bring about a new climate. Of course the Minister said that there will be no failures but that even if there are, the Government will not be involved.  To achieve success at the required rate, inevitably there will be failures but when the successful ventures far outweigh the failures the real achievements will be noted.  If we intend to watch every penny invested on behalf of the State to see if there are risks involved and that we might be criticised for supporting a dicey venture, how can we possibly expect to see real achievement?  I am all for prudence and control, the kind of control which we have not seen under this Government, but not a kind of control which would determine a timid approach which would not be related to the reality of the market place.</P>
    <P>I noted with a great degree of satisfaction &mdash; and I should give credit to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism in this regard &mdash; the setting up of the various committees of the House.  I have served for a considerable time on the Committee on Public Expenditure where we are concerned with how our money is spent.  I found the experience very satisfying.  The Members on the opposite side of the House who attended those meetings &mdash; and I express my appreciation for their courage and forthrightness &mdash; have all expressed the same deep reservations about this nonsense. When you listen to people of the status of Deputy Michael Keating, Deputy Allen and Deputy Yates who have been very much involved in this work expressing particular views, it is very clear that the experience they have gained on those <Col N="645" /> committees made them realise that we do not need another monster.  We should be doing quite the opposite.  Our capacity to control the growth of a monster like that will be diminished.  As Deputy Allen said, the test may be with regard to public service expenditure which we have not seen.  I have given many examples to show that such growth has occurred in the time of a Government who said they would reduce it.  The same criteria as apply in the private sector will apply. What the Government are proposing will not do the job.</P>
    <P>I am not taking issued with the question of the availability of £300 million by way of share capital and I do not want to be misunderstood on that point.  Rather I am saying that the structures through which that kind of share capital will be channelled will ensure that it will never flow to the intended targets but will be blocked before it gets from the source.  I am concerned about that matter.</P>
    <P>Where will we see growth?  The Bill states the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; means an industrial undertaking including an undertaking ancillary to industry or a commercial undertaking (other than an undertaking whose functions relate wholly or mainly to the provision of banking, insurance, legal, management consultancy, advertising, public relations or financial services);</P>
    <P>What the Government are proposing will be confined to industry.  They want to generate employment through industry. The reality of each successful economy in the past two decades is that growth in employment has not been in the industrial sector, although that is not to denigrate that sector.  It is simply to acknowledge that the advance in technology is such as to limit the potential for employment growth and generation in the manufacturing sector in particular.  I will give the experience of the United States.  In that country in the past two decades the number employed has increased on average by about 2 per cent each year but that growth has not been in the manufacturing sector.  It has been <Col N="646" /> in the services sector, whether it be tourism, construction or financial services. Yet, these areas are being crucified by this Government every day.</P>
    <P>The Government are confining the programme proposed in this Bill to the manufacturing industry sector.  They are not looking to the potential in the other services sector.  For instance, they exclude deliberately management consultancy. If there is one area that needs a great boost and a major commitment it is the area of management.  Any consultancy that can help us to improve our management, our research and development, marketing, work practices, equipment and so on, would make a great contribution to development but it is excluded under the terms of this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a better way to deal with the problem and that is through the development of our resource potential and the fundamental resource we possess is that of personnel.  This is especially important in this era of knowledge based industries, of the era of techniculture. The time is past for us to react <Col N="649" /> to and to complain about what is happening elsewhere and the effects on us.  Now we must invest in knowledge, in research and development, in marketing and in technological skills of all kinds.  We must put our confidence in our young people who are the entrepreneurs of the future.</P>
      <P>In that context I will make one significant comparison.  I mentioned that we are investing £174 million in the agencies under the aegis of the Department of Labour.  Who would suggest they are worth almost twice as much as our third level colleges?  Does Deputy Prendergast know how much we are investing, in this era of advanced technology, in knowledge based industries?  How much are the Government investing this year in third level education?  If we look at the Book of Estimates we find that the figure is £74 million less than we are putting into the Department of Labour.  That tells why we are failing.  In countries where they do not have a national development corporation, for instance in Japan, over half their first time employees have third level qualifications or their equivalent.  Yet we watch our resource dissipating by emigration and we invest in training programmes and short term schemes.  Is it any wonder that we have not got it right?</P>
      <P>That is the first difference between this Coalition Government and Fianna Fáil. Since the late fifties we invested in education and in Limerick in particular, and the institutes of education are testimony to that fact.  I am not claiming credit for this, although I was Minister for Education, and we saw in the late sixties the need for such a move.  Our education policies have proved themselves.  That is a first priority, but it is not mentioned in this document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are looking for national development the second priority relates to resource development.  Deputy Allen, Deputy Andrews, Deputy Keating and almost every other Deputy who has spoken referred to the agri-food industry and its potential.  The farmer is not to be blamed if the market is not created.  He is the primary producer.  The reality is that the added value through processing <Col N="650" /> is abysmally low and our marketing strategy is deplorably weak.  This has been demonstrated in many ways.  Unless we invest in marketing skills and research and development programmes to supply what the consumer wants in this sophisticated consumer society, be it in Europe, America, Japan or anywhere else, we will be ignoring this great potential, and this Government have totally and utterly ignored it.  Let me remind the House that out of a total of £900 million in public expenditure, this Government have provided less than £250,000 this year for marketing in the food industry.  That is how big a priority the food and marketing industry is for this Government.  That is the second major difference between us.</P>
    <P>Anybody with sense could see the potential in this area.  None of our foodstuffs is displayed on the shelves of the supermarkets of Europe, although we are primarily agricultural producers.  This is sad.  It is unbelievable that we have not tackled this problem.  All Governments appear to have overlooked this.  We probably enjoyed too much the bonanza under the FEOGA scheme and we did not look at the food processing industry as closely as we should.  This problem has been staring us in the face for the past three to five years but this Government have not begun to tackle it.  I pleaded with the Minister for Finance but he would not even spend a miserable £500,000 out of a total expenditure of £900 million public expenditure to give tax incentives to encourage marketing personnel to become more aware of the marketing requirements abroad.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously it is this Government's policy not to do anything about processing in this area.</P>
      <P>The tourist industry has great growth potential.  I ask this Minister not to say that the Government are giving a 14 per cent increase over last year's depressed figures.  If we look at Europe we will see how little we are achieving.  Could this Government make up their minds on what they are going to do about promoting employment in the minerals industry? What are their priorities for off-shore development?  When will they be implemented?  As this subject will be debated here tonight, I will not go into it in greater detail now.  The response to the latest licensing round has told the story of failure.  Surely we would have a greater response if there was a clearer direction.  Can anyone say that this problem is not the result of the Government's shortsighted approach, particularly in relation to their policy of fiscal rectitude? Has this Government's tax system solved even one such problem?  The opposite is true as we saw from recent Exchequer returns.  The presumption that increased taxation is the way to fiscal rectitude has been totally and utterly discredited and will ensure that this programme will not be successful.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have given the outline of what I think should be the priorities, but another priority which must be emphasised is that <Col N="652" /> profit and reward must be seen as desirable targets.  Profit should be seen as a measure of success by the promoter, his family, his employees and associates. Everybody should be better off.  This is the attitude we should be promoting.  The term &ldquo;profit&rdquo; should not be knocked by begrudgers; it should be considered as something which will be beneficial to every sector of the community&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>That is where it is going now.  This profit and reward should encourage our top personnel to remain in Ireland instead of what is happening at present when they have to emigrate because of our high tax levels.  One of our major native operations has a programme for development in investment but their only problem is that they cannot get their top personnel to stay here because of our high tax levels, and they cannot attract others to come from abroad.  When we make those corrections, as we will sooner rather than later, we will have real national development as distinct from this illusion.</P>

      <P>I am aware that our present controls on the export of works of art from Ireland are quite inadequate and because of my concern about this, earlier this year I appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Liam Hamilton to consider this whole area and to make recommendations to me.  I expect to have the committee's report before the end of the current Dáil session.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there has been an increase in regard to the depletion of heritage objects we are <Col N="655" /> losing in this way but because of the inadequacies of the existing legislation this is ever difficult to quantify.  There appears to have been an increase, perhaps a substantial increase in some areas.  This is of great concern and that is why, when the Hamilton Committee were initially set up, I asked that they report as soon as possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to anticipate the findings of the Hamilton Committee it is obvious that some type of legislation will be necessary and I anticipate that some of the findings of the Hamilton Committee will suggest legislation. There is a body of opinion that one cannot be too restrictive in this area in legislation and there are also constitutional difficulties.  All of these are being considered by the Hamilton Committee and I hope to have their findings shortly.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that within the next three months some very valuable paintings are likely to be exported?  Are there any steps the Minister can practically take at the moment to ensure that these valuable works of art are retained here?  They are a part of our heritage and should not be exported under any circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am unaware of the paintings or works of art to which the Deputy has referred and I would be pleased to get information on them.  Existing legislation is totally inadequate in relation to restraining the export of works of art.  As far as compulsion is concerned, nothing adequate can be done.  The legislation really deals with rights to take copies of documents leaving the country.  Our legislation is totally inadequate and that is why we are looking at this area.  It is a difficult and complex one.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that this is not a very simple, straightforward matter and that in fact it is quite complex?  It is important that we be aware of every aspect of the matter.  Very often when a Legislature interfere in situations of this kind they do more harm than good.  I sound that note of warning.  I suggest that when the time comes we might have a total, objective, impartial, non-partisan discussion here on the report, tease it out and satisfy ourselves that we are proceeding in the right direction.</P>
      <P>The Minister is aware that in this regard everybody is inclined to think of works of art going out of the country. There is also the very important question of works of art coming into the country. On that note let me ask the Minister two things.  First, is he aware of the very considerable difficulties being experienced by artists bringing works of art into this country temporarily for purposes of exhibition?  Will he look into that matter and see if anything can be done to facilitate the movement of works of art for the purpose of display or exhibition?  Secondly, will he advert also to that other very important part of our national heritage, namely the archaeological side?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TedNealon" hpid="Mr. Nealon Mr. Nealon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nealon</NameTxt>
      <P>As I have said, this is a very complex matter.  I am aware of the contrasting opinions about this.  Indeed, there are great dangers in becoming too restrictive because in some countries where this has happened a black market has been operated and the issue gone underground, rather than the situation improving.  Then there is the question of free movement which we would welcome <Col N="657" /> into this country.  There is the point of view that offering incentives as well as restrictions might be a consideration.  As far as temporary importation for exhibitions and other purposes as mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition is concerned, it is possible that that also will be referred to in the Hamilton Committee's report.  I have it under consideration.  As far as the archaeological area is concerned I might be encroaching to some extent on the area of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, at the OPW.  However, that is a matter of concern to the Government and we mean to take all possible steps in that direction and something is being done in that area too.</P>

      <P>A special occupational analysis of the live register is carried out quarterly in respect of the last Friday of March, June, September and December.

The 1983 figures are not comparable with those for the two subsequent years due to extensive recoding of registrants by occupation which was carried out in March 1984.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that the Deputy's question refers <Col N="662" /> only to statutes passed by the Oireachtas. During the period mentioned, the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, was passed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister accept that that kind of programme of legislation for three years is abysmal to say the very least?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would he accept that for a Department who have a Minister and a Minister of State to succeed in having only one Bill passed in three years hardly justifies their existence in any form?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be a mistake &mdash; some Deputies from the other side have expressed this view &mdash; to pass laws simply for the sake of passing them without giving due regard to the impact they may have particularly in the complex area of industrial relations and the labour market generally where the operation of those laws requires the consent of the social partners.  This House would need to take some time on that and, if the Deputy is anxious about the legislative record of this Administration in this area, I assure him that he will have ample time to debate at length and to enact legislation in this area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not to say that the Minister is going to give me the job. Regarding item No. 33 on today's Order Paper and the hours of work level, would the Minister confirm that the Government's intention is not to proceed with that Bill in the life of the present Dáil? If not, is the decision being made just to leave it there?  I just want to know the position; I am not particularly anxious to have the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the total grant to the various youth clubs; and if he is satisfied that adequate resources are available for the youth services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham) George Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Labour (Mr. G. Birmingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>The total <Col N="664" /> grant-in-aid fund for youth organisations and other services related to youth in 1985 is £2,950,000.  These funds are, in the main, allocated to voluntary youth organisations and groups.  No youth clubs are funded directly from this provision.</P>
      <P>The Department of Education, through vocational education committees, provide support for youth and sports activities at local level.  I understand that in 1985 total support through the VECs amounted to £1,581,000.</P>
      <P>In addition, youth groups are being assisted by my Department in the construction or renovation of indoor facilities such as youth centres and scout or guide dens.  Already this year a total of £210,000 has been allocated for this purpose.</P>
      <P>Finally, youth groups benefit from my Department's Teamwork youth employment scheme.  In 1985 some £2,150,000 has been allocated under this scheme to youth organisations and groups.  The total of the funds involved, approximately £6.9 million, represents a significant investment by the Government in the youth service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister of State give the percentage increase in overall youth grants in 1985 over 1984?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The increase from 1982 to date is some 97 per cent, an increase from £1.497 million to £2.95 million.  It does not lend itself readily to comparison between 1984 and 1985 because a number of new areas of support have been introduced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State deny the argument made by a number of youth organisations that the grant in 1985 is little more than in line with inflation and in many cases less than what is required to enable them to continue the services they have been giving now for a number of years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>No, that argument has not been advanced nor could it be advanced because it would be wholly <Col N="665" /> without foundation.  The subhead that I have referred to supports activity under a number of different headings.  The major one is the area of direct support to individual youth organisations channelled through their headquarters.  No youth organisation received an amount that was less than the inflation rate and each one received an amount that was something more than the inflation rate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State outline the procedure followed when a grant or allocation to an organisation is decided on?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>In the case of the headquarters youth organisation what has happened in recent years is that all the allocations have been announced at the same time.  A press release is issued detailing those allocations and an opportunity is given to the press to probe the matter further.  The organisations then, during the course of the year, draw down their funds as against expenditure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that it would be a very undesirable departure from well established practice if politicians, whether they be Deputies or even Ministers of State, were to <Col N="666" /> engage in a practice of bringing the cheques around to these organisations and handing them out as if they were a personal gift from the politician?  Would that not be a very serious piece of parliamentary malpractice?  Secondly, can the Minister confirm that this does not happen and that if it happens he will take steps to ensure, including himself if necessary, that it will not continue?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition and myself have been talking at cross purposes for some moments in that my replies have been addressed to the question of headquarters organisations drawing down their annual support under the youth service grant-in-aid scheme.  The supplementary tabled now by the Deputy is more likely to relate to organisations seeking capital grants or something of that nature.  In that situation the most usual procedure is that architects' certificates are submitted and a percentage of the total grant is paid against the certificate. In the normal course the cheque would be sent by post but it might happen occasionally that the organisation involved would be attending a meeting in the Department in which case they would collect the cheque themselves.  On occasion the cheque might be handed over by people associated with the Department, including myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not most desirable that in all these cases strict departmental procedures are adhered to, that the organisations concerned be notified by the Department of the allocation and that payment be made to them directly through official channels?  Can the Minister state whether he has or persons authorised to deputies for him have brought cheques personally and handed them to organisations as if they were donating the money personally when all that is involved is the dispensing of public funds?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that in this area of support for community activity it is important that proper procedures are <Col N="667" /> followed.  That would be the attitude of the entire Government and that was why on one occasion we found it necessary to review the allocation of grants when it appeared that some organisations who had not submitted applications were about to become beneficiaries.  Because of that it was necessary for us to review very carefully the whole question of the making of applications and the consideration of them on their merits.  I have indicated what the normal procedure is. I have indicated also that on occasions when meeting with a group I have dealt personally with them to expedite matters.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The most usual procedure is for the cheque to be sent by post.  The next most usual procedure is for an organisation to be in the Department on other business and while there to collect the funds.  They are always anxious to have the money in their bank accounts as soon as possible.  I have indicated also that there have been occasions when someone associated with the Department, and particularly myself, has been dealing with such an organisation and handed over the money to them.</P>

      <P>The Minister has indicated that about £2.1 million has been spent under the Teamwork schemes but is he aware that a number of applications, in my area particularly, have not been successful on the basis that funds have run out?  If this is the case, is it the intention to provide additional funds for the remainder of this year?  Also, would the Minister consider it right that organisations who have applied must reapply next year simply because the Minister says there are no further funds available?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>Regarding Teamwork, a sum of £6 million was allocated in the original Estimate but the response exceeded expectations by far.  Consequently, in the summer months organisations were applying but funds were not available to meet those applications.  In those circumstances I sought the agreement of the Government to have extra funds made available and I was successful in that regard.  At a time when funds were short it appeared to be appropriate to <Col N="669" /> examine each of the organisations' applications for the purpose of ascertaining whether they would readily qualify under any of the other schemes and in particular to ascertain whether some of them should more properly have made application under the social employment scheme. The point is that funds in addition to the £6 million have been made available, but if the Deputy has any case in mind in particular I should be happy to talk with him about it.</P>

    <P>Statistics of the number of individual claimants are not readily available.  In order to establish the precise number of beneficiaries, a detailed analysis of all claims would be necessary because individual employees can submit claims in respect of different entitlements; the average number of claims is about two per person.

      <P>Is the Minister satisfied that the legislation is operating speedily on behalf of those people who have claims to make and could the legislation proposed take in some of the hardship cases lying around at the time of the enactment of the Bill?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am happy that the legislation is operating as satisfactorily as we had anticipated.  As the Deputy will recall, part of the delay in the introduction of this legislation related to considerable worries expressed by many about the difficulties involved in its administration in cases where there were inadequate records and where employees had been at the receiving end of improper management.  The establishment of documentary proof is a necessary requirement for the distribution of taxpayers' money. These cases posed difficulties which we had anticipated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government decided in 1982 to phase out the scheme for the <Col N="671" /> employment of clerk-typists in primary and secondary schools.  This policy is being implemented through the non-replacement of clerk-typists who resign or retire and by no new posts being created by the Department of Education. Apart from 31 posts which were reinstated in conjunction with the launch of the social employment scheme, no exceptions to the phasing out policy have been allowed and appointments to school secretary posts are now being made solely under the Department of Labour's social employment scheme.</P>
      <P>The social employment scheme was developed for the express purpose of enabling the large numbers of productive and energetic persons over 25 years who have been unemployed for more than 12 months to play an active role in social and community development at a reasonable cost to the Exchequer.</P>
      <P>At present, my Department, through the National Manpower Service, AnCO, the Youth Employment Agency and CERT, operate a wide variety of training/employment programmes, many of which cater specifically for persons under 25 years.  If there is any change in the eligibility criteria under the social employment scheme for school secretaries I shall get in touch with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister consider that there is an abundance of common sense in having 25 years as the regulation age in view of the fact that a very responsible applicant for such post as school manager secretary can be unemployed for five years and still not qualify simply because of the age limitation? Even a 24-year old suitable applicant is not eligible.  Further, in view of the fact that so many responsible school leavers who are, in the opinion of school committees and management, suitable for such posts are not eligible, being debarred because of these regulations, can the Minister see any way in which he could amend these regulations so that <Col N="672" /> such suitable applicants could be considered for appointment as secretaries to school management boards?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I was asked by the Labour Court to initiate discussions with the supermarkets on a voluntary code of practice, the object of which would be to minimise the sale of South African goods.  This request was made by the court in the context of a report on the dispute at Dunnes Stores, Henry Street, which I requested last April.  The outcome of the discussions which I initiated with the major supermarkets amounted to a positive declaration of their individual intent to minimise the sale of South African produce. The agreed statement recognised that the search for alternative supplies to replace South African produce means that there will be a period when produce from South Africa will feature on display. This arrangement would continue until such time as the supermarkets acquire constant and consistent alternative sources of supply.  I am sending the Deputy a copy of the agreed statement for his information.</P>
      <P>The court has also recommended that, in the context of arrangements to facilitate a return to work by the workers in dispute, with management assurances of no victimisation or recrimination, I should invite both sides of industry to make submissions on the question of the rights of conscientious objectors in employment.  I approached the FUE and the ICTU and both have replied in fairly negative terms so that further action on this will prove difficult.</P>

      <P>The youth levy was originally intended for the creation of new schemes to give employment to young people.  How can the Minister justify the hijacking of part of these funds to the Department of Education and other Departments and their use for schemes which were in existence long before the youth levy was introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>All the available research done by the Youth Employment Agency, independent researchers and in other independent member states of the Community indicates that the level of education which a person has on leaving the school system is a key determinant in their job prospects.  The Youth Employment Agency in consultation with the Department of Labour feel that the Department of Education have a substantial role to play in preparing people for work and ensuring that they have the skills necessary to maximise their chances of getting work.  In that context a certain amount of funds from the youth employment levy has been allocated to the Department of Education.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a substantially different question, but I can give an initial reply by way of assistance to the Deputy. Our concern and that of the Department of Education and the Youth Employment Agency has been for those people who drop out of school exactly at the minimum legal age or very soon afterwards and whose employment opportunities are considerably reduced as a consequence. Our concern would be to ensure that people stay in the educational system for the maximum time in order to improve their employment chances.</P>

      <P>I assigned the Youth Employment Agency responsibility for implementating the &ldquo;Social Guarantee&rdquo; for young people.  The guarantee is being directed initially at early school leavers and these will be identified to the National Manpower Service by the school authorities.</P>
      <P>The guarantee was introduced on a pilot basis in Dún Laoghaire, Coolock, Cavan and Waterford early this year.

Amounts outstanding include a portion that will not be payable because of the reduction in the relevant income tax provision.  The collection is a matter for the Collector General and the health boards, and it is being pursued in various ways.

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, I referred the dispute to the Labour Court under section 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, and I appealed to the parties to the dispute to co-operate with the court in their inquiry in the interest of securing an early resolution of the issue.</P>
      <P>The court in their report to me recommended that, subject to a resumption of work, I should initiate discussions with the major supermarkets with a view to minimising the importation of South African produce and that I should consider the question of conscientious objectors in employment.</P>
      <P>Notwithstanding the failure to achieve a resumption of work consequent on the court's recommendation, I entered into discussions with the major supermarkets. The result of these discussions is that the supermarkets have given a positive declaration of their individual intent to minimise the sale of South African produce. As regards the court's recommendation to me on the question of conscientious objectors in employment, I invited the Federated Union of Employers and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to let me have their views. Both sides replied in fairly negative terms so that further action on this aspect will prove difficult.  The strike still persists. Discussions were initiated by the Labour Court with the parties earlier this month. I have contacted the Labour Court about the progress of these discussions and I understand that the court will be letting me have a report on the position later this week.</P>

      <P>I was wondering what was the position <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Labour Court, whether they had reported back. I suppose the Minister is not prepared to say who has delayed or where he thinks this dispute has been prolonged.  For example, have they been in direct contact with the Labour Court?  The dispute has been sufficiently protracted and, at this stage, a resolution is either possible or <Col N="686" /> impossible through the Labour Court.  It is time that where the blame lies was clarified, if &ldquo;blame&rdquo; is the correct word to use.  Does the Minister wish to say anything?</P>

      <P>Outline proposals for the reform of industrial relations were published by my Department in March of this year.  The proposals centred on two main areas: (1) the placing of trade dispute law on a new and more forward-looking basis by moving from a system of immunities to a system of positive rights; and (2) the reform of our industrial relations institutions notably through the establishment of a new Labour Relations Commission.  Since March there has been a series of meetings with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers at which these proposals were amplified and discussed in detail.  This process is not yet complete. I am sure Deputies will appreciate how important it is to have the fullest possible consultation and consensus on the complex and wide-ranging issues involved.  I would hope to be in a position to put a reform package before the Government before the end of this year.</P>

I am proceeding with consultations with both sides in industry in a manner of which the Deputy is already aware and which I have already indicated to the House.  I hope that the reform package which I shall bring to Government by the end of this year will result in legislation being introduced as soon as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he now accepts that the social employment scheme has been a major failure and that the widespread marketing of the scheme was almost totally inadequate; and the amendments he proposes to make to the scheme to make it workable, acceptable and of benefit to the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The social employment scheme represents a positive Government response to the plight of the long term unemployed, particularly those over 25 years of age.</P>
      <P>The scheme provides an opportunity for the large number of energetic and productive persons who fall into this category to play an active role in the social development of the community.</P>
      <P>I am very satisfied with the progress of the scheme to date.  At present there are almost 3,500 people employed on over 800 projects under the scheme.  A further 1,400 projects with a potential for 5,300 jobs have been approved and the National Manpower Service are currently recruiting persons to fill these vacancies.</P>
      <P>There is now a comprehensive programme of schemes designed to meet the needs of the unemployed.  Experience has, however, shown that the general public is often unaware of the opportunities provided for the unemployed or, if aware, are unable to differentiate between the different programmes.  I have, therefore, decided to launch a comprehensive publicity campaign in the case of all the employment schemes.</P>
      <P>As in the case of other manpower programmes, I am keeping the operation of the social employment scheme under continuous review.</P>

      <P>I thank the Minister for clarifying the position because last <Col N="691" /> week the Taoiseach said in the House that over 9,000 people had taken up employment under this scheme.

      <P>The matter is now with those bodies who applied for and got sanction to take on people.  Sadly, in regard to Dublin city, the take up has been zero as far as the local authority are concerned.  Dublin Corporation are the only local authority who have not yet availed of the schemes.  The data I have are divided on a regional basis related to the operational areas of the National Manpower Service.  The Dublin area, which includes Dún Laoghaire and Dublin County Council, has 196 projects which employed 682 people as of 25 October.  On balance, two-thirds of the projects are local authority or public sector employers and one-third are private employers.</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time&rdquo;.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I was here for the end of Question Time which stimulated further thoughts appropriate to the Bill. The Minister now leaving the House indicated that he feels he has a comprehensive programme of schemes designed to meet the needs of the unemployed.  He certainly has.  If ever there was a programme of schemes for the unemployed to stay unemployed this Government are certainly pursuing it.  For that reason, I referred to them on previous occasions as a scheming Government.  I do not believe that there has ever been a precedent for such a variety of schemes for the unemployed and such little hope for permanent employment.  We do not need more schemes, agencies or administrative bureaucracy interfering with the major task of encouraging the private sector to get up off its knees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was recently told in blunt terms by a very successful industralist in my area who started as a blacksmith and who now employs 80 people in Nenagh that he does not have time for these schemes.  He put it very well to me when he said, &ldquo;I do not have time for these schemes.  I do not have as much time to be helped as they have to help.  I have no time for the book- work&rdquo;.  It is not surprising to hear from the Minister for Labour who <Col N="764" /> announced a new initiative today that he is going to advertise widely the range of schemes available.  The officials in the Department of Labour may be the only people aware of the plethora of schemes available, all leading to <i>cul-de-sacs</i> but now the public will be made aware of what is available with the intention of trying to convey the impression that people are gainfully occupied, although certainly not gainfully employed. Recently there has been a spate of very expensive advertising on radio and television by the only people who can afford such advertising, namely, the State agencies under the aegis of the Minister for Labour who has just left the House.  At great expense which must be met by the taxpayers they told us of the range of services provided.  I challenge anyone to say who in the private sector could afford such advertising even though such people are the real key to development.</P>
    <P>Recently there has been a new development in the co-ordination of industrial policy and support schemes.  Because of the plethora of schemes available and because people are confused about where to go and whom they should consult, the Government introduced something new. Now they have what they call the &ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo;.  A person can go to such a place to find out about all the aids available. We are developing a major industry in one-stop shops to explain how a person can get through the maze of the other support services that are bedevilling the country by imposing such a high burden of taxation on the workers and the entrepreneurs.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Labour has promised us that we will have an even more comprehensive programme of schemes designed to meet the needs of the unemployed. In his words, the social insurance scheme &ldquo;is now enabling the unemployed to play an active role in the social development of their community&rdquo;.  Thus, these people can live with the illusion that they are playing this role.  I agree it may be that they are carrying out useful works, whether it be on the roads or in community development programmes, but what they really require is the dignity <Col N="765" /> of knowing that they are providing for themselves and their families and that they have a place of dignity in their community that is not dependent on schemes or community development programmes. The Government are content to maintain a level of schemes and programmes of community involvement when what is required are viable jobs. The reality is that we are further away than ever from providing those jobs.  I had hoped that at this stage we would have seen evidence of some sign of awareness by the Government that the road they have been travelling is the wrong one &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>What the Government are proposing in this case deliberatly excludes financial services.  It extends to industrial enterprises other than those whose functions relate wholly or mainly to the provision of banking, insurance, legal, management consultancy, advertising, public relations or financial services.  No other Government have ever lavished as much on public relations in their own interests as have this Government and if that is good for the Government in their own right why do they exclude public relations in this instance?  The Government know that everything else is running away from them, the deficit, employment, taxation, investment and incentive.  They are doing nothing about these matters but the one area on which they focus now is that which they can control to a greater or lesser extent, namely, public relations. We have certainly got a surplus of public relations from them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will.  The Government have excluded public relations in this instance.  At least they should be consistent.  If they take this view about public relations in the private sector, at least they should start to reduce, adjust or roll back &mdash; to use some of the jargon &mdash; the public relations exercise in regard to their own role.</P>
      <P>Financial services should be included in the provisions of this Bill.  Despite our arguments on Finance Bills during the years we failed to persuade the Minister to include the services sector generally in the equity participation scheme.  This is something we regretted because, as I mentioned this morning, it is in that area that there is the greatest growth potential for employment.  In saying this I am not denigrating the role of manufacturing industry.  Because of technological development the scope for increased employment, even in a healthy manufacturing sector which we do not have, is limited. On the other hand, the scope for increased employment in the services sector &mdash; in this instance I refer to financial services &mdash; is very considerable but it is excluded in this case.  Does the Minister not realise that given the right climate for investment here there could be an active interest in investment participation on the part of banking interests?  However, there is no such interest now.  I have spoken to people who have indicated that, given the right climate, they would like to invest and participate in banking, insurance, building societies and in other areas.  However, they will not do that now, first, because of the tax regime and, secondly, because they do not know what this Government may do or say in terms of national programmes, particularly in such a sensitive area as banking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If someone introduces what he regards as ideological restrictions for the sake of proving to all and sundry that he still has a voice in Government, then the people who are interested in investing here will not run the risk of having their well researched programmes put at naught and, for as long as this Government last, that will be the case.  There <Col N="767" /> will be a different approach to investment at every level in the service sector when Fianna Fáil are in Government because there is great potential in this area to generate employment and to attract investment.</P>
    <P>Are we prepared to acknowledge that in the last five years in particular the downturn on investment here has been so dramatic as to have had a debilitating effect in terms of the economy?  The level of investment in the private sector is falling at an alarming rate both in absolute terms and as a proportion of GNP.  The Minister has acknowledged this and thrown up his hands and said we must correct this but the truth is that investment level is the key to success or failure, and no development corporation will change that pattern.  We must give clear signals that investment is welcome.  I am not talking solely of investment from abroad; I am also talking about investment by Irish people who are at present investing elsewhere &mdash; for instance in the Isle of Man and anywhere else they can find a safe haven for their funds.</P>
    <P>This whole area needs to be tackled because we want to encourage investment by our own people particularly in indigenous industry but we are doing the opposite.  The black hole is getting blacker, bigger and deeper and now we are bringing in an illusion like this saying this is the answer &mdash; £300 million equity investment by the Government.  That is but a fraction of what we have lost in the last three or four years and that money must be recovered.</P>
    <P>There was a time when Ireland prided herself on attracting investment, skills and personnel.  There was a time when Ireland was considered as the place to go, because of the exciting prospects there and people were encouraged to get involved, but that time has long since gone.  Anyone who looks at the prospects held out in the Bill will see that, first, we are not interested in financial services and, second, those who wish to invest here and get involved with the NDC will find that two or three Ministers will decide how much we are prepared to risk. <Col N="768" /> I am not saying we should not be prudent or that existing agencies, such as the IDA, should not apply very strict norms but this way is probably the most efficient.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what happened recently where taxpayers' money was invested particularly in attracting foreign investment &mdash; I am talking particularly of some major multinationals involved in the high technology areas.  It is clear that major corporations, particularly in the software area, are involved in a range of investment activities around the world.  They are notoriously mobile in their activities. When international trends are not very favourable one of the first enterprises to go is that located here.  Why?  Because we are engaged in assembly line production for the commodity market and this production line could be shifted tomorrow to Puerto Rico, Spain, Portugal, Zambia, or Nigeria.</P>
    <P>These enterprises are located here because of our proximity to the European market, but is not Belgium as close to the EC as we are, and cheaper?  Spain and Portugal are coming into the Community and other countries have preferential trade agreements with the Community established through Lomé, Maghreb and so on.  These countries have guaranteed access for their industrial products, their labour costs are lower and they can guarantee the multinationals that there will not be changes of policy of the kind we have seen here.  What have we witnessed? Many major corporations introduced here at great expense to the taxpayer have left our shores.  Our industrial development programme must ensure that the nature of the enterprise being launched here is of such significance that its survival is essential to the international enterprise.  To achieve that we have to ensure that our tax levels cannot be seen as a barrier.</P>
    <P>Let us look at an executive from Massachusetts, Bonn, Cologne or Frankfurt based in Ireland and paying Irish tax rates at 60 per cent as well as the levies.  At a certain stage he will realise that if he were living in Belgium he would be paying tax at 40 per cent, and in some other country <Col N="769" /> it might even be as low as 30 per cent. Then he asks himself what plus is there in it for him and his team to remain here. What are we doing to encourage our people to leave Saudi Arabia, America or Canada, and work at home.</P>
    <P>Recently a great deal of Irish money has gone abroad.  Our major building corporations in the ratio of eight to one, are engaged in programmes outside Ireland. How long will this go on before we finally ask ourselves why this is happening?  The reason is that the people who decide these affairs have said it is not worth a candle to invest in Ireland.  The Minister for Tourism has left the House, but recent indications have shown, that some Bord Fáilte personnel are not too enthusiastic about working abroad, being paid Irish salaries and being charged Irish tax rates.</P>

      <P>Our inflation rates are coming down in line with the inflation rates of other countries and that is to be welcomed, but is the Minister aware that one sure way to guarantee zero inflation is to depress the economy and consumer demand, and we are now at that point when we will be able to boast that there is no inflation.  Expectations have gone so low that people will give anything for a job.  That is one of the most basic laws of economics.  We should not boast about our inflation rate coming down when the international trend is favourable anyway, and when it is as a consequence of the most depressed economic condition we have ever witnessed.  If the inflation rate next year is down a further 1 or 2 per cent, I hope it will not be at the expense of another 20,000 unemployed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>To create employment we must create an industrial development climate and concentrate on knowledge based industries.  We should not react to what is done elsewhere.  We should take our courage in our hands and invest in knowledge.  We should award excellence and attract the top people and give them an opportunity and a challenge. We are doing the opposite at the moment.  I will give the Minister the names of miniature Irish corporations which I do not wish to name in the House who cannot get their own personnel to stay here, much less attract others to come back.  Will the NDC tackle that? They will not.  I do not know if these corporations ever get a chance to talk to the Government but if they are so frustrated as to continue to make the Opposition spokesman aware of their plight, I presume the Government know of it.  However, I do not see the Government responding to them.</P>
      <P>In dealing with this Bill I pointed out the problems and the reasons for failure. However, I remain more than a convinced optimist.  The climate for developing the potential of this nation has never been so ripe.  We could develop tourism, the food industry and business with Arab States, Hong Kong and throughout the world if we had the courage to go after it instead of engaging in arid ideological debates here and coming up with a nonsense like this.  Someone said that we have a Government of lame ducks but they are worse than that because they do not even have a drake to lead the way. Until we see guts, direction and leadership from the drake we will get nowhere. I do not want to damn this company before it starts but it does not offer any hope to those awaiting a sign from this House or this Government.  The sooner we get an opportunity to introduce that hope and the enterprise programmes that we have planned the better, not only for us but for this country to bring about a spirit of renewal and incentive.</P>

      <P>As Chairman of the <Col N="771" /> Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies I welcome this Bill.  I do so because this Bill is the brainchild of the labour movement. It is the expression of the ideas of the Labour Party based on discussions with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions who are the elected parliament of the workforce north and south, representing over 600,000 members.  It must be remembered that the Labour Party were founded by the trade union movement to give political expression to their industrial policies.  In introducing this Bill the Government are reflecting the policy of the Labour Party and reflecting at a deeper level the policy of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  While many people would question the tenuous reasons for the Labour Party's participation in Government &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I will deal with the Deputy in a minute if I have time.  This is a major factor in justifying our participation in Government.  In every Coalition Government here the Labour Party left a significant hallmark on the doings of that Government.  I need not go into them unless someone wants me to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>The first Coalition Government introduced pension schemes for what were deemed pejoratively as the servants in the local government and public services scheme.  In every successive Coalition Government we improved the lot of those workers, some of whom had to stand under hedges to get out of the rain, or go into cottages to get some one to boil water for them.  In spite of the long term of office of Fianna Fáil from 1932, they made no improvement in the pension entitlements of those workers.  Under the Coalition Government in 1973 to 1977 we built more houses then were ever built in the State.  I am replying to a question.  I am not straying <Col N="772" /> from the Bill.  When Fianna Fáil denied that, Deputy Jim Tully was able to say: &ldquo;check with the ESB.  They made the connections&rdquo;.  At that time we introduced more legislation in favour of the workers than had been introduced since the foundation of the State in spite of the fact that Fianna Fáil were in power for 46 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>Both Fianna Fáil and the workforce can bear in mind that the National Development Corporation is the child of the labour movement.  I will quote from the ICTU document of autumn 1984 confronting the jobs crisis:</P>
      <P>Both the Telesis and the NESC reports recognised that a necessary condition which must be met by Irish companies breaking into export markets is the achievement of a minimum scale of operation.  We should therefore concentrate greater efforts on developing a number of large Irish firms with the scale, technological and marketing capabilities necessary to compete internationally in high-productivity industries.  This can be done by the State through the National Development Corporation.  While the Programme for Government (December, 1982) envisaged such an innovative development role for a National Development Corporation in the development of the indigenous resource sector of the economy and advanced technology projects, the White Paper on Industrial Policy effectively nullified this proposal.</P>
      <P>There are certain important differences between the White Paper and the Bill but the Bill envisages a strong innovative development role for the NDC.</P>

      <P>The ICTU document also says:</P>
      <P>Public enterprises should be used to secure the co-ordinated development of resource-based industries.  The National Development Corporation should be given the role of established new public undertakings where suitable projects are identified in this area and of working with existing enterprises to expand and diversify their operations.  The National Development Corporation must be adequately funded from the outset if it is to perform this developmental function effectively.</P>
      <P>The NDC will have the role of establishing new public undertakings as indicated in section 10 (1) (c) of the Bill.  The funding, up to £300 million as projects are developed, will be adequate to meet the objectives of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The ICTU document also says:</P>
      <P>The National Development Corporation should be empowered to undertake appropriate investments, in association with BIM, for the co-ordinated development of marine resources, including mariculture and associated land-based industries.</P>
      <P>That is exactly what we are doing in section 10(1)<i>(f)</i> of that Bill.</P>
      <P>Again I quote from the document:</P>
      <P>The potential for growth in traded services, including education and training and health care services where Ireland has both expertise and a reputation, should be systematically examined. The National Development Corporation could, in conjunction with the relevant State agencies, play a major role in developing this area of activity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is generally covered by the objectives in section 10.  Therefore, it is all the more sad that when we have a project put before this House by the Government at the instigation of the Labour Party in <Col N="774" /> response to the policy of the ICTU this is totally opposed by Fianna Fáil.  The Leader of that party has been condemned by the president of my union for his categorical dismissal of the Bill before it was even published as a concept.  This is the man who gave assurances both to the national executive council of my union and the ICTU that in anything they wanted when Fianna Fáil came back into power they would be met by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>I am not sure whether Deputy O'Kennedy was for or against the Bill because he is a lawyer trained in the art of presentation of public argument.  He devoted 60 per cent of a very long speech to knocking the Bill and then gratuituously telling us how we might improve on what we had already suggested.  I make full allowance for the obligation of any parliamentary Opposition to oppose, but it is very sad to hear the meretricious guff and cant coming from the opposite side of this House and to remember what he said about his colleague, the blacksmith of Nenagh who, I am sure, is well known to you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and a very worthy individual.  Deputy O'Kennedy said, quoting presumably a higher authority than himself, the blacksmith of Nenagh, that we do not need more schemes.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House let me quote from the magazine <i>Success</i> of 5 August 1985, four months ago.  The chief executive of the senior job promotion agency in the country, the IDA, Mr. Padraic White, said:</P>
    <P>Well, at the present time, the private sector equity funding is only going into about 25-30 projects a year and you can take it that these will be the cream of the crop.  These 30 projects with equity funding against the needs of this country is really only a drop in the ocean.  I would love to see us getting from 30 equity investments a year up to 200.  They do not always have to be £½ million apiece but they could range from £10,000 &mdash; £20,000 which would be critical to the start up money instead of the executive or professional person having to mortgage their home and <Col N="775" /> everything belonging to them and their wives.</P>
    <P>That is a direct refutation by the senior job promotion executive in the country of what the Fianna Fáil spokesman has mentioned.</P>
    <P>I do not want to be gratuitously offensive to anybody or to be sarcastic, but I would like to know whether Deputy O'Kennedy or Deputy Haughey really reflect the policy of Fianna Fáil.  Recently the Leader of the Opposition had to reprimand publicly his two Front-Bench spokesmen, namely Deputy Noonan of Limerick speaking on agriculture and the land tax and Deputy O'Kennedy speaking on the whole question of taxation. Therefore, it is difficult for us at this side to establish what exactly is their coherent policy.  It is particularly upsetting for those of us whose whole lives have been devoted to job creation.  I have a distinct recollection after the completion of the negotiations for the appropriate wage round in January 1981 that Deputy Haughey said that it was now his hope that the FUE would come out with the agreement in their tow and create the necessary jobs.  The following morning the spokesman for the FUE gave a political Harvey Smith to Deputy Haughey and said that it was not the function of the FUE to create jobs.  There is nothing wrong with that because they are being honest and consistent.  The FUE have not and never had any policy for the creation of jobs except as a means to generating more profit.  That is what they are about, and is it not sad that Deputy Haughey, the leader of the party which produced Deputy Seán Lemass and Tod Andrews, two of the greatest practical socialists this country has ever produced&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankPrendergast" hpid="Mr. Prendergast Mr. Prendergast">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;said that they were not in favour of this development where Irish enterprise, skill, money and workers' tax are going into formation of a concept which, it is hoped, will thrive and succeed to create more employment <Col N="776" /> for Irish workers?  This is the hope we are offering to the unemployed.</P>
      <P>This concept is a major cornerstone in Irish industrial history.  It is hoped that this positive initiative will incorporate positive proposals to expand the State equity investment in new or existing ventures and that new employment opportunities will be created not only for the many unemployed young people but also for what could be regarded as the forgotten people.  I refer to those managers and supervisors who are 40 years of age or older trying to raise families and finding themselves unemployed because of redundancy or company closures.  We tend at times to forget that this is a labour pool with experience and a talent which in many ways is more valuable than money because it has an immediate start up capacity to be productive.  Anyone familiar with the Telesis report and the White Paper on Industrial Policy will recall that they highlighted the need to give new impetus to industrial development.  It is recognised that the policies which clearly served us well in the sixties and seventies are now outdated and have less success than they had.  This is reflected in the last three years in that in that time the number of jobs lost in manufacturing industry has exceeded the number of new jobs created.  It is, therefore, commonsense to realise that new initiatives are required.  Old solutions do not necessarily solve new problems and the state of Government finances does not allow for any real expansion of expenditure on job creation.  Let me quote from paragraph 1.3, page 4 of the White Paper on Industrial Policy dated 12 July, 1984:</P>
      <P>The concept of value for money for the State resources devoted on industrial support measures is of critical importance.  As indicated in chapter 13.2 £430 million was spent by the Department or agencies directly or indirectly concerned with industrial development in 1983.  In the same year a further £315 million in tax revenue was foregone to various tax reliefs designed to foster industrial development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="777" /> If we the people, as Ireland incorporated, decide to do something for ourselves in sharp contradistinction to what Deputy O'Kennedy said has been the situation &mdash; where the volatile hi-tech companies can come and go as they please &mdash; what is wrong if we spill some of that money accidentally in this country?  What is wrong if, by way of honest attempts to create something, the money does not become as productive as we might wish? It would be far better for the economy and for the people if that the money were spilled somewhere here in a way that would have some spin-off benefit rather than for it to be lost in a black hole by way of going to American multi-national corporations.</P>
    <P>I do not understand the Opposition continually adopting a negative attitude to the establishment of the NDC.  Allowing that the Opposition must oppose, can they not accept the challenge of change? For the many unemployed this development may present the opportunity of a lifetime but that opportunity must be taken now.  The opportunity is expressed in clear terms in the Bill, that is, to push ahead with industrial development. There are listed in the Bill 15 State-sponsored bodies and 24 State-sponsored commercial enterprises.  In my role as chairman of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies, I am aware of the importance of these commercial enterprises.  The present committee and their predecessors were critical of some of the operational aspects of these bodies.  Regrettably, although the committee and their predecessors made a total of 20 reports to the Houses, not one of them has been debated in this House.</P>
    <P>While I have admired the initiatives taken by many of the commercial State-sponsored bodies in expanding their activities, I must admit that there has been a lack of a co-ordinated approach. For example, the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies in their report on OIE referred to the fact that four commercial State-sponsored bodies have an equity investment in hotels in the State.  They are Aer Lingus, <Col N="778" /> Údarás na Gaeltachta, Aer Rianta and OIE.  I trust that the NDC will provide a more co-ordinated approach to such developments.  It may very well be that some commercial State-sponsored bodies have not developed projects because of the lack of funds or of technical knowhow.  For example, arising from their research and development work in salmon farming, Údarás na Gaeltachta were interested in establishing a salmon marketing company but, as they did not have sufficient resources of their own, the project was developed subsequently by the NEA.</P>
    <P>The committee of which I am chairman visited Údarás na Gaeltachta two or three weeks ago and I am glad to be able to record publicly that I found that visit a revelation.  Despite the much maligned activities of the Údarás in other directions, there is no doubt that the work they are engaged in is first class and, in my considered and objective view, is the ideal prototype for what the NDC should do.  Údarás differ from the IDA and SFADCo to the extent that, while the latter two bodies provide funds for investment and grant-aiding for people coming into the country and setting up their businesses, Údarás go a step further.  It may be argued that this is necessary from the point of view of managerial expertise in the more remote parts of the country, but they take equity shareholdings in these companies.  They move in and gather supremely valuable and important &ldquo;coal-face&rdquo; experience.  Their people are working in the businesses.  This is the type of enterprise that I would foresee as the prototype for the NDC.  It is the prototype that warrants serious study by those people who will be responsible for the successful development of the corporation.</P>
    <P>The NDC should not be perceived as a threat to State-sponsored bodies and particularly to some of their ancillary activities.  On the other hand, such activities should not be guarded jealously as a birthright by these commercial State-sponsored bodies because that would prohibit the NDC's involvement in the provision of funding or personnel to <Col N="779" /> expand their growth to the maximum commercial potential.</P>
    <P>I welcome the proposals contained in section 30 of the Bill for the NDC to submit, not later than six months after the end of their financial year, a report to the Minister of their proceedings and for the Minister to cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. I have complained already to the Taoiseach in this House about the situation whereby, although there has been an improvement in the furnishing of annual reports and so on, by and large when we receive these documents they represent historical data because they are so far out of date as to be of no help in a current evaluation of the companies concerned.  No annual report should be more than six months old by the time it is before this House.  In that way we can have up-to-date information in relation to any decision we might reach.</P>
    <P>In our report on Irish Shipping Ltd. we recommended that every commercial State-sponsored body should be obliged to carry out a review of their objectives every three years and that a statement of these objectives should be incorporated in their annual report and accounts.  We regard that as being supremely important if we are to have effective public sector bodies which are funded by taxpayers' money and answerable to the taxpayer through this House.</P>
    <P>I hope the NDC will adopt this recommendation and also that a similar approach will be adopted by their subsidiary companies while having due regard to their commercial sensitivities.  We made the following recommendation also:</P>
    <P>In analysing group financial accounts it is difficult to ascertain the strengths and weaknesses within the company and subsequently it becomes difficult to evaluate the result of such ancillary activities against their objectives and also the degree of cost subsidisation of a loss making activity by a profit of operation which may not be readily apparent from the consolidation of the accounts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="780" /> It has been our painful experience that when faced with the activities of a number of consolidated companies by way of a rolled up annual report, it is difficult to ascertain the quality of the individual performances.  I trust that this aspect will be considered closely by the NDC.</P>
    <P>While acknowledging that there will always be a degree of commercial confidentiality associated with subsidiary or ancillary activities, when the results of these subsidiary companies are consolidated for accounting purposes, it becomes extremely difficult to evaluate their effectiveness.</P>
    <P>I trust that the corporation will provide for a greater disclosure of information.  It is explained in the Explanatory Memorandum that in all of their investments the corporation will be required to act in a commercial manner and that investments may be made only in enterprises which are profitable and efficient or which are capable of becoming profitable and efficient and which have reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment.</P>
    <P>I endorse these as the primary objectives of the corporation and I am convinced that sustainable employment can be achieved only through sustainable commercial enterprises.  The basic thrust of the NDC is to promote State equity investment in new or existing ventures. The reason the State should do so is highlighted by the fact that the private sector is only equity funded up to 30 enterprises.</P>
    <P>The principal objectives of the Bill are outlined in section 10 which provides for the development of a strategy as to how these objectives are likely to be achieved. Obviously, this is of the utmost importance. We must decide first what we want to do and then decide on how we do it. It is only when such a strategy has been outlined that a meaningful structure can be developed.</P>
    <P>This process is time consuming and in the initial period should demand of the board, the managing director and the key staff a number of think-tank sessions from which policy issues will emerge.  The <Col N="781" /> appointment of the chief executive and the board should be based on proven records of competence in the commercial area with a philosophical commitment to public enterprise.</P>
    <P>To come back to the planning period, we must be conscious of what is referred to in Peters and Waterman's book <i>In Search of Excellence</i>.  I quote: &ldquo;We don't constrain with plans at the beginning when ignorance is the highest&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Of course, we will make mistakes but let us learn and some of these mistakes can be very productive if they teach us what not to do in the future.  In other words, the board members and a limited number of staff members must initially inform themselves of the opportunities prevailing and subsequently through the evaluation of alternatives, preferably on a sectoral basis, determine a work programme. Undoubtedly, there will be tension and jealousy between the corporation and other State agencies and they could very well be perceived as a threat to the narrow-minded.  In overcoming such problems it will be critical that the corporation effectively communicate what they expect to achieve.</P>
    <P>Many Irish businessmen admit that there is almost a spirit of continuous hostility between them in their fight for domestic market share but such an attitude invokes co-operation when export marketing is undertaken.  Therefore the growing pains of the NDC will not be cured in one another's backyards but overcome in the heat of the marketplaces of the world.  There is a very wise seanfhocal as Gaeilge which goes: Muna mbíonn ach gabhar agat, bí i lár an aonaigh leis. That is, even if you only have a goat, be in the middle of the marketplace.</P>
    <P>Contrary to the untrue, denigratory comments of Deputy O'Kennedy, this Government place a very strong emphasis on the whole need for marketing.  In that context they have refurbished the old Franciscan monastery in Louvain in Belgium which I visited myself.  The whole purpose will be for it to be used as a base for training Irish graduates and others who are learning to compete in the business world of Europe.  These people <Col N="782" /> will be trained in all the necessary aspects of marketing.  In relation to Deputy O'Kennedy's comment about the food sector, it should be pointed out also that this Government have set up an excellent centre in the Raheen Industrial Estate in Limerick which is involved in the promotion of strategies for the development of greater jobs and job creation in the food processing sector.  It must be remembered that this is supremely important because the food processing sector, after the petrochemical industry, is the highest in Europe in terms of job creation.</P>
    <P>To come back to the NDC, I would stress that the fundamental characteristic of the proposed corporation, despite the knockers &mdash; and we will have plenty of them &mdash; must be the commitment of the board and staff not only to believe in success but also to achieve it.  However, instant success which may grab media headlines may also fuel suspicion.  In the first year's track record this is important and subsequent risk ventures must be undertaken which can then be funded with a greater degree of confidence.  The <i>modus operandi</i> of the corporation must strongly reflect the development role and therefore bureauracy must be kept to a minimum.  We would stress this.  Practical processes are normally associated with those who have had commercial coal-face experience.  The priority consideration in the appointment of board members and their staff should relate to their commercial experience.  Initially, understandably, it will be difficult for the corporation to achieve role clarity.  While accepting that high fences make good neighbours, nevertheless the corporation should ensure that their initial policy guidelines should not be too restricted, which could be detrimental to their own future activities.</P>
    <P>The significant difference between the NDC and the vast majority of other State funded agencies is that the corporation are primarily an investment agency as distinct from a grant administration or advisory agency.  They will therefore <Col N="783" /> have to live with their successes and failures. Section 10 of the explanatory memorandum of the Bill states:</P>
    <P>In all of its investments, the Corporation will be required to act in a commercial manner and investments may be made only in enterprises which are profitable and efficient or are capable of becoming profitable and efficient and which have reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment.</P>
    <P>That is important.  People often foster sedulously the idea that because a concept is a socialist one it is automatically cognate with failure.  That is a very carefully fostered idea.  I was amazed at some of the erroneous and misleading statements which came from the other side this morning in this debate.  It should be pointed out &mdash; and not many people realise this &mdash; that this country has more semi-State bodies than any other country in Europe outside the eastern bloc, according to my information.  The vast majority of them are doing well.  There are some contentious ones which have been traditionally failures and they are highlighted, but nothing is said about the successes.  I should like to refer here, a Cheann Comhairle, to the models which exist in other countries which I believe this country should be following more properly as models for our own development. Deputy O'Kennedy and others have referred to the &ldquo;fly-by-night&rdquo; nature of some of the companies which come in here to invest.  They are purely profit orientated.  To be fair to them, they have never hidden that motive.  They tell us that.  I have spoken with people involved in other countries in Europe which are much more in tune mentally and culturally with our philosophy as an island nation.  I am speaking about countries like Austria, Denmark, Finland and Norway which have tremendous records in the development of their own resources and countries which we should be following.</P>
    <P>Údarás na Gaeltachta recently had here people from Finland and returned <Col N="784" /> their visit.  Let us remember that Finland, like us, lives in the shadow of a much greater and more aggressive political power.  The Finns have had to live under that shadow and develop their own resources.  Let us look at where Finland was at the beginning of this century and is now, with foreign companies restricted to investing something like 28 per cent in Finnish enterprises.  They have come to this country and are prepared to put up with what would be deemed to be inadequacies of infrastructure and other matters in the west of Ireland, given importance by people from more advanced countries like the United States and Germany.  There is in Finland a company called KERA.  That is the regional development fund of Finland which finances enterprises, industrial estate companies and municipally constructed industrial premises in the development region.  The financing is granted in the form of loans, cash grants, share capital investments and is guaranteed.  In addition to investments the fund finances research and development of enterprises, product and process development, marketing, training and consulting.  The sectors within which that fund operates are also defined in the legislation &mdash; industry, tourism, fur farming, fishing, fish breeding, commercial horticulture, plant nurseries, peat production, mining and quarrying and workshops.  In addition, for a few years the fund has been able to finance enterprises engaging in certain services such as product development enterprises, marketing companies and service enterprises in the fields of accounting and electronic data processing. Industrial premises constructed by municipalities and industrial estates constitute an important object of financing. The fund can also grant loans for investment in fixed assets and for operating capital and grant guarantees for loans taken in Finland by enterprises.  The same applies in Norway and Sweden, where these public State companies are responsible for the creation of the type of work that we envisage will be done here by the National Development Corporation.</P>
    <P>As a commercial organisation the <Col N="785" /> NDC must adhere to commercial criteria. We must remember that we are talking about taxpayers' money.  Deputy O'Kennedy made a facetious reference to running up a <i>cul-de-sac</i> but I would infinitely prefer to be found standing still at the end of a <i>cul-de-sac</i> than being smashed to pieces at the bottom of a cliff, which I suggest is where this country was being taken by the previous Fianna Fáil Government with their profligate policies and their visitation of huge repayment burdens on workers.  The workers have had to pay.  That statement will stand up to close scrutiny.</P>
    <P>Everything the Labour Party are saying in this Bill is aimed at providing work and relief for workers by way of jobs in the first instance and then by diminishing the pressure on taxpayers of borrowing repayments.  It will be a difficult task for the NDC but they must focus on opportunities rather than on petty problems.  We have plenty of wasps in jam jars.  The opportunity to invest in joint ventures and/or to take an equity stake in companies presents a very real challenge.  Such an investment portfolio should embrace projects that have an almost immediate potential return and others of a more long-term nature. Through such an investment programme the corporation can be cushioned against financial failure which will inevitably arise if the correct entrepreneurial decisions are not taken.  The NDC must be pro-active, generating and bringing to fruition on their own initiative, rather than being a reactive agency providing financial assistance to support the initiative of others.</P>
    <P>Somebody spoke scathingly this morning about investment in education.  The level of investment by this Government is higher than ever before in the history of the State and the number of third level graduates has trebled since about 1979.  I am open to correction on the exact figures.  In my city we have the National Institute for Higher Education and Members may have seen a programme last night where Professor Joseph Lee of University College, Cork, dealt with the role the NIHE is playing in training <Col N="786" /> people to get into the European situation. The Crescent Comprehensive College also figured prominently.</P>
    <P>We were always told that our best people emigrated to America and built up that country, as well as other countries. That may be true, but during the last century an Augustinian monk, Mendel, put forward the theory that like begets like.  We are now producing the best of our people from the same origins and the same sources.  Now that they have been given the best educational chances they will stand foursquare with Germans, Belgians, Frenchmen, Englishmen and anybody else.  It was always said by the British Government that their real anguish at the loss of Ireland was not because it was a geographical entity but because of our administrative capacity.  It used to be said quite rightly that the British Foreign Office was run from the Dingle Peninsula.  We can go back and look at the track record.  We have people as competent, as capable, as visionary and as imaginative as anybody in the world in what we are seeking to do.</P>
    <P>Private enterprise has manifestly failed to provide employment for our people and we must now look to ourselves to do it.  Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the new threat coming in at 60 miles an hour from Europe in the form of Portugal and Spain.  I told the workers in Shannon Airport ten years ago that this would be the situation.  A competent labour force on the European mainland a couple of hours journey from the golden triangle will represent effective competition to us. We cannot sit back and moan about the situation.  We must be up and doing.  I am not speaking in any pejorative sense when I say it is cold, objective historical fact that private enterprise has not risen to meet the employment needs.  We were advised by the NESC report and by Telesis that we must look to ourselves to do it.  There are very good examples in other places in Europe.</P>
    <P>I urge the support of the House for this Bill.  I sympathise with Fianna Fáil because they are expected to oppose and are very good at doing so.  It is one of the great contradictions of democracy in the <Col N="787" /> western world that if a Government on budget day offered bars of gold to the country by way of tax concessions they would still be opposed by the Opposition. I hope that the workers will evaluate the guff and cant, obviously insincere, artificial and spurious contributions by some spokesmen from the Opposition.  There is no coherent, logical approach from them on this issue.</P>

      <P>I am appalled by the lack of vision and courage coming from a party such as Fianna Fáil who made such a wonderful contribution in the past to the ordinary people.  Their disparaging sourness, their discouraging knocking, their &ldquo;wasp in the jam jar&rdquo; approach will, I hope, be seen by the workers for what it is.  Not once in the lifetime of this Dáil have Fianna Fáil put up even one policy document on anything.  That is their sad record.  They may well say that this is political strategy, but if we are to be knocked in the public opinion polls it is surely the ultimate irony that we are being knocked for what we are trying to do consciously, while the Opposition are coming up, having sat back and done nothing.  When I listen to the decibels of sourness coming from the Opposition and their begrudging tone I am reminded that Robert Browning said in one of his great couplets that a man's reach must always exceed his grasp, else what is a Heaven <Col N="788" /> for, and the vision must always be finer than the view.</P>
      <P>I ask the workers to recognise that it is Labour Party policy which is being implemented.  Fianna Fáil have at least identified the fact that it is Labour Party policy reflecting the attitudes of the workers, the ICTU which is the elected parliament of the workforce.  I support the Bill in full.</P>

      <P>I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill. Any proposals which could give hope and promise to the thousands of unemployed merit serious discussion and consideration, especially when the unemployment figure is escalating.  However, I believe the Bill as framed will not lead to job creation.</P>
      <P>Coming from a constituency in north Kerry which is plagued by unemployment &mdash; we are approximately 7 per cent above the national average &mdash; I do not see anything in the Bill to create worthwhile employment in the country.  The Bill will allow the Government to invest in certain industries.  Is this not in conflict with the present policy of the IDA?  As a result of the Bill what will happen to the NDA?  I believe this Bill is going to replace the NEA which proved itself to be very effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A recent study by the Trade Policy Research Centre examined the performance of public investment companies in Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the UK.  Only in Sweden did a state agency produce a portfolio whose return compared with that of the private market.  In Belgium, Holland, Italy and the UK the public agencies went through periods of very bad performances.  Experience in the US has been even more unsatisfactory.  The Reconstruction Finance Corporation was established in 1932 with the main aim of assisting industrial development during the depression.  The RFC came into its own in the booming forties and fifties. However, instead of industrial development it took to financing the construction of massive bars, drive-in cinemas and <Col N="789" /> motels.  Unfortunately those deals frequently involved political and financial favours and the RFC was wound up in 1953.</P>
    <P>The object of the NDC under section 13 is to realise its investments as soon as financially prudent.  Is it a fact that all viable investments will be disposed of? Why not dispose of them to the workers involved?  This would be an incentive to the workers in successful ventures.  The NDC must sell off investments as soon as they become a commercial proposition. What will happen to bad investments? Will they all come back to the taxpayer for propping up, as has been the case in the past in the ICI and the PMPA?</P>
    <P>The financing of the NDC will mean further taxation with no guarantee of worthwhile job creation.  Increased taxation now is not on.  I was hoping the Bill would give some gleam of hope to the various regional development organisations throughout the country for development on a regional basis which, I understand, will be policy at European level.  In north Kerry the IDA have about 1,000 acres between Tarbert and Ballylongford. The land was purchased over a number of years with the intention of developing it for industrial purposes. That will not happen until a single Shannon estuarial authority have been set up. Why is there not some provision in the Bill to assist areas like Kerry?  Is it because of political pressure and vested interests in the Limerick Harbour Board Authority?  They monopolise the Shannon at the expense of Kerry and Clare.</P>
    <P>Recently the Minister for Communications visited the region and gave an undertaking that if he could get agreement between the counties involved he would set up a single estuarial authority. In their submission to the Minister, representatives of Clare and Kerry wanted equal representation for all three bodies. Early last year the Minister promised a decision before the end of the year.  We still have not got a decision from him.  I have no hesitation in forecasting that if a single estuarial authority were set up in the Shannon region the counties bounding the Shannon estuary would prosper. <Col N="790" /> I speak in particular of Kerry where we have 7 per cent more unemployment than the national average.</P>
    <P>Tourism, which has the greatest growth potential, needs an injection of capital, which would pay off in employment as well as helping the economy. However, this does not come within the ambit of the NDC.  In statistics issued by Bord Fáilte we are told that approximately 20,000 jobs have been lost to tourism in the last five years.  Without fear of contradiction I can say that in Kerry alone we have lost 3,000 tourism jobs in that time.  Thousands of jobs would be created by an injection of capital into tourism because the spin off from tourism is tremendous.  I welcome the recent introduction of tourism grants but they are not enough.  I appeal to the Government to consider the matter seriously immediately. Refurbishing grants are needed.  It is a pity the Minister did not include tourism in this Bill because it has been proved that tourism had a magnificent role to play in job creation.  I had hoped to see provision made in the Bill for sound feasibility studies so that investment would be available to exploit the full potential of agriculture, tourism and fishing.  I had hoped the Government would have created an atmosphere to ensure that private enterprise would be encouraged to continue with job creation programmes.  This is not so.</P>
    <P>Section 8 of the Bill provides for the take-up of share capital by the Minister for Finance.  This can be financed only by more State borrowing.  To break even, not to speak of earning a profit, the average rate of return will have to be well in excess of the 13 per cent the Government have to pay on domestic borrowing.  How many Irish firms are generating a rate of return of anything like this?</P>
    <P>Section 11 gives the Minister a veto over the appointment of an auditor to the NDC.  That is not an unusual procedure. Section 14 requires the NDC to inform the Minister in writing of each and every investment.  The Minister's approval is needed for any office expenditure in excess of £250,000.  That would hardly buy a computer these days.  Section 15 <Col N="791" /> provides that any investment in excess of £1 million must be approved by the Minister and if it is in excess of £2.5 million it must have Government approval.  One can imagine the Cabinet being bogged down financing NDC loans. The scope for political interference is only too evident.  That is not my view alone: recently an expert stated that guarantees required in regard to day-to-day operations will mean little if the NDC have to approach the Government for expenditure approval.</P>
    <P>Section 10 allows the NDC to invest in management and assistance of any semi-State body.  It also allows the NDC to act as a holding company for any State-sponsored commercial enterprise.  Do we really need another State body to assist existing State bodies?  It is wholly inappropriate that the Government should even contemplate setting up a big brother to existing State companies.</P>
    <P>In the final analysis the National Development Corporation should be judged on whether, in the words contained in the <i>Programme for Government December, 1982</i>, it will prove to be a major vehicle for job creation.  I contend that the National Development Corporation will do nothing for the 65,000 who have since joined the dole queue and, for the remainder of the lifetime of this Government, that the only jobs created will be ones at headquarters.</P>
    <P>There are better ways of creating jobs than by setting up another white elephant. For example, the National Enterprise Agency should be given their head, enabled to build and tackle the defects in the domestic capital market which are impeding that agency in meeting with financial needs of our industry.  Also the venture capital market should be developed and those people involved should be listened to more carefully. There should be reward for the creation of wealth and a change in the present structure of incentives favouring the use of capital at the expense of employment. Indirect taxes on employment should also be reduced and, above all, the present tax code should be reformed.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="792" /> I contend that the Bill is too political, it is a bad decision to dispose of successful investments within the National Development Corporation.  Existing State agencies, such as the National Enterprise Agency and the IDA are doing good work.  They should be helped in its continuance by an expansion of their powers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamNaughten" hpid="Mr. Naughten Mr. Naughten">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to welcome this Bill which I consider to be a new exciting initiative on the job creation front, of vital importance to our future industrial development.  It has been contended that this is a political Bill, that it is a brainchild of the Labour Party.  I am not worried about whether it is political or was first thought up by the Labour Party.  Rather am I concerned that its provisions will provide major employment opportunities for many of our young unemployed, which I believe they will.</P>
      <P>In the past there have been industrialists with excellent projects they could not get off the ground.  They could not create the jobs that this new corporation could develop simply because they were unable to obtain the necessary financial capital. In that regard I believe the provisions of this Bill will play a major role with both private and semi-State involvement.  The House should recognise the advantages and opportunities presented under the provisions of this Bill.  Many industries at present importing commodities that could be produced on the domestic market will discover that such can be produced as a result of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Prior to its introduction this Bill attracted some unwarranted and singularly non-constructive criticism on the part of the Leader of Fianna Fáil.  It was evident that very little thought was given to those remarks.  I very much regret that he did not await its introduction.  Let us not forget that, when the Industrial Development Authority were being established by a former Coalition Government in 1949, Fianna Fáil had the same remarks to make about that Authority then as they have now about the National Development Corporation. <Col N="793" /> We are all aware what a tremendous success the IDA have proved to be.  I sincerely hope that, in time, the National Development Corporation will prove to be as satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Arising from those comments by the Leader of Fianna Fáil and other Fianna Fáil speakers there has been put out a false impression of the objectives of this Bill.  I might reiterate some points made by the Minister on its introduction.  First, the National Development Corporation will not be giving grants but engaging in equity investment on which they will be seeking to make a profit.  It is only proper that profits should be sought from such investment.  I might point out that they were not designed to undertake the functions of a rescue agency, again something which I believe to be right and proper. Neither do I believe there will be any conflict whatsoever between the National Development Corporation and the Industrial Development Authority.  I know the Minister will ensure that there will be an operating agreement drawn up between the two bodies, which will be subject to Ministerial approval.</P>
    <P>By operating on a commercial entity basis, the National Development Corporation will provide an opportunity for useful State investment, the establishment of new enterprises and, unlike the IDA, will be able to dispose of them in accordance with normal commercial criteria.  They can invest in a project which, if successful, can be disposed of in the normal commercial manner.  I believe that policy to be correct, that if a project is got off the ground, is self-financing, then the funds arising therefrom should be utilised for further financial investment. The National Development Corporation can be involved in the development of highly value-added investment to be used as a vital industrial base.  They can play a major role in the development of our natural resources, much of which did not receive the type of investment or high priority they should have received in the past.</P>
    <P>Employment objectives can be achieved only by way of selective investment. When it comes to valuable resources we <Col N="794" /> should be careful how we invest, for example, in what type of projects.  At a time of scarce national resources it is important that, in the long term, identifiable projects are viable ones.  It is not unreasonable to expect that the corporation will invest in projects which will take some time to mature.  It is right and proper that we should invest in them. Unlike private industry, it may not be practical for the corporation to get involved since they might have to wait a considerable time to get a return on their investment.  Resources should not be tied up indefinitely in technology of the mid-eighties and the National Development Corporation should, due to their revolving investment fund, be in a position to stay on the frontiers of technology and provide the jobs required for our young population.</P>
    <P>It is important that the corporation should be able to sell their assets and reinvest in new technology because we must keep abreast of new technology, new products and processes.  In the past, many firms ran into financial difficulties as a result of heavy borrowing.  In this connection the National Development Corporation can play a major role by becoming involved with private industry and providing the necessary financial capital and loans.</P>
    <P>The Government are committed, in conjunction with sectoral and agricultural interests, to a co-ordinated development programme for indigenous resources.  To expand on this point I wish to draw on one or two examples from my own area.  In County Roscommon indigenous industries of a servicing nature for farm products have proved commercially viable and lead one to suggest that the potential of indigenous industries in many rural areas, such as farm land, rivers and other natural resources, have remained largely untapped. The National Development Corporation can play a major role in the development of rural Ireland.  Industries in my area which are based on indigenous resources include Hanley's of Roosky, North Connacht Farmers, Connacht <Col N="795" /> Meats and the Shannonside Development in Ballaghaderreen.  These are all extremely successful industries but we still have not come to grips with getting the maximum value for our agricultural products.  Far too often in the past we were selling a commodity which did not give the best possible returns.</P>
    <P>I can think of many areas in agriculture where many jobs could be created but, unfortunately, these have not been fully tapped.  By comparison with indigenous industries based on agriculture, very often multinational companies employ fairly large numbers of people.  However, these companies have a tendency to take the easy option on occasions when faced with difficult trading circumstances. Examples of this can be found all over the west in urban areas such as Roscommon, Castlebar and Sligo which have all suffered over the last few years.</P>
    <P>One can also question the method of assessing job potential in the context of financial investment and huge moneys by the IDA.  The National Development Corporation have as their principal objective the creation of the maximum number of viable jobs as a result of their investment.  Under the legislation, the National Development Corporation are required to act commercially, which is welcome and I compliment the Minister and the Government for ensuring that this is part and parcel of the Bill.  We must also consider our fisheries and forest resources.  In recent weeks forestry was the subject of much comment and I am not unduly concerned whether our forestry development is carried out by the State or by private interests.  For far too long we have failed to recognise the tremendous potential and opportunities which lie in the forestry industry, such as job creation, developing the industry and preventing imports of timber.  In many cases we export timber which is wasteful and a misuse of a vital natural resource.</P>
    <P>I also believe that the National Development Corporation can play a major role in developing our fishing industry. In that context one cannot help but notice the lack of impact any such development <Col N="796" /> is making in the media at present compared to ten years ago when EC regulations were being discussed and we had very lengthy debates as to how this industry could best be utilised.  Much of the development has been piecemeal and I hope that the National Development Corporation will bring about a more uniform approach.  We are an island situated in the midst of some of the richest fishing grounds in the world and it will be our own fault if we continue to allow other nations to capitalise on what is effectively one of our greatest natural resources. Unfortunately we have not taken advantage of this natural resource.  We have not developed it or created the opportunities for jobs in the processing of fish.  This is an area in which the National Development Corporation can play a major role, together with private investment, in bringing in modern techniques to develop the fishing industry and creating the maximum number of jobs.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation can also play a major role in tourism as we have only touched the tip of the iceberg in this regard.  We have neglected this vital source of revenue and tourism received scant attention and small financial resources in the past.  I regret that many of our lakes and waterways are totally under developed.  Development associations and other bodies, such as county councils, have received small financial allocations to provide amenities and to carry out other improvements.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the National Development Corporation getting involved in the development and provision of much needed facilities in the tourist industry. In the midlands the MRDO, an organisation involving five adjoining counties, have set up a sub-committee to develop Lough Rea.  It is regrettable that such a major tourist asset has not been developed.  Whatever work that has been done has been carried out by one or two private companies.  Here the NDC can play a major role in the co-ordinated development of the entire Shannon to exploit the tremendous tourist potential of that region.  I should like to see the corporation invest in that area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="797" /> The accusation is often made that there are many bureaucrats running the country. Frequently we say that State companies are overloaded with civil servants. I hope that will not happen with the NDC.  I am glad to see that they will have a nine member board and I hope that those appointed to the board will have the ability to develop the NDC to the maximum so that the greatest number of jobs possible may be created for our young people.  The announcement by the Minister last Wednesday, together with the announcement by the Taoiseach of other employment incentives, will help to create many vital jobs.  Those measures together with the social employment scheme and other schemes of the Department of Labour in the next 12 months will play a major role in reducing the number of unemployed.</P>
    <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill and I compliment the Minister.  I am confident the NDC will be an important vehicle for employment in the years ahead.</P>

      <P>This latest example in the basket of Coalition announcements is no more or less than a measure to keep the Coalition together for a little longer.  It is well known to all commentators that the Government are disintegrating and are grasping at straws irrespective of the cost to the taxpayers.  This latest example of Coalition blundering and mismanagement can be seen for what it is, namely, an election strategy.  Every single attempt by the Government to address the unemployment problem, the basic fundamental problem affecting the people has failed.  This is because their basic economic philosophy is wrong and faulty. They have depressed the economy by squeezing the money market.  They have failed to tackle personal and corporate taxation levels.  They have not created the climate necessary to attract investment from the private sector and thus create job development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How else could it be when we had a reluctant sponsor in the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism introducing this measure?  We are all well <Col N="798" /> aware of the series of internal arguments, some of them carried on in public in the past six months, that heralded the introduction of the National Development Corporation.  We have seen the ideological split, with the Labour Party threatening to introduce this measure and the reluctant sponsoring Minister seeking by every means available to him to thwart the efforts of the Coalition partners.  We saw diametrically opposed ideologies flaunted before the public and finally we got the outturn which is before us today.</P>
    <P>The outturn is a document that is over-politicised. It is more responsive to political influence than to commercial viability.  There is ministerial over-involvement at every stage of the investments proposed in this measure.  It is impossible to isolate the proposal from the charge of power politics involvement by the Ministers concerned and by the Government parties.</P>
    <P>As this measure is framed it cannot be insulated from the political environment. It seems to me that it runs contrary to everything the Government have been preaching in the past three years.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, does not concede easily on any measure.  If his consent had to be dragged from him for this measure, we can be quite sure that inherent in this Bill is the means to prevent his deeply-held principles being entirely eroded.  Every section of the Bill shows the involvement of the Minister to guarantee that the philosophy which he failed to hold sway with at the Cabinet table will, in practice, be inherent in this measure.</P>
    <P>The public agency introduced here will be concerned with matters other than that of straight commercial viability.  The agency will have to take on board the social aspects and the sectional aggrandisement of some parts of the community. In addition, geographical considerations will have to be entertained. It is obvious from the wording of the document that there will be a trade-off between the social and economic benefits hoped for as a result of this measure.  We have seen in certain circumstances where it has not been prudent for banks and <Col N="799" /> private investors to get involved.  However, it will now be prudent for the Government to expend reasonably large sums of money on measures that will not be taken purely on grounds of commercial viability.  We hear people like Deputy Prendergast pontificating, as is his wont, telling us that this is a Labour Party Bill. It certainly is such.  He has identified what everybody outside this House knows to be true.  This is not a Coalition measure. It is not a measure of the Minister.  The Deputy has admitted that this is a Labour Party measure.  They are providing nothing in this Bill except the witness that Fine Gael in the interest of survival will concede anything to their reluctant partners in Government.</P>
    <P>How can any entrepreneur guarantee success in advance?  The banks themselves cannot do that.  We hear of bank losses every year in write-offs.  The multinationals have failed in several well-known instances in the past 12 months, not least the Travenol Laboratories in Castlebar and also Mostek.  We hear of factory closures, of banks, industrialists, financial institutions and major private investors failing and making bad decisions.  Now it is suggested that this new Bill will be the panacea to cure all the ills of the Irish economy, will only be involved in commercially sound and viable projects and that nothing but that will be entertained by the NDC.  That is the greatest joke of the lot because there is an element of risk even with enterpreneurs who are familiar with and expert in dealing with these matters.  The Government see this as a means of trying to get an election platform in place somehow to convince the unsuspecting public that hundreds of millions of pounds are being made available for job creation when anybody who reads the document closely will recognise fully that there is no money being made available.  There is the promise that if some investors offer themselves and they are found suitable at some future date they may get a reluctant go-ahead from a reluctant Minister and get a little investment by way of State support. But that is all that is promised, and I <Col N="800" /> guarantee that before this Coalition Government leave office not one single productive job will be in place because of this measure.</P>
    <P>The Fianna Fáil Party had an organisation in place called the National Enterprise Agency who were set up in 1984.  Is it not interesting that that agency had 444 applications to date and that they have made 16 worth while investments with a total investment of about £2 million?  The NEA were capable of doing that amount of work and it must be remembered that for the past six months they have been working with a temporary staff and in a political limbo because the Coalition had to arrange that they would not be overactive because that would have cut the floor from under the proposal to introduce the NDC.  If the NEA were doing the job to an efficient standard acceptable to all, people might ask what was the purpose of the new agency.  To justify the introduction of this measure, the NEA had to be sabotaged by the Coalition. Despite that, they made 16 worth while investments in the national resource development, the import substitution programmes and in commercialisation of research and development.  Those 16 ventures are working satisfactorily.  I am putting it to the Coalition that if they had shown the same enthusiasm for the NEA that some of the Labour members are showing for the NDC, there would be no need for this extra expense to be put on the taxpayers by introducing this new measure.</P>
    <P>We hear that innovation is to be the key role so far as venture capital expenditure is concerned and that it can play a major role in national development and employment.  There is not a single sentence in this document to suggest that innovation will be promoted by the NDC. But the National Enterprise Agency did promote innovation at company and sectoral level and the central theme for that agency was investment programmes in product and process innovation, in marketing structures and in new technology-based enterprises.  That is precisely what the new document before us professes to support.  I put it to the Government that <Col N="801" /> that document bears no relation to what is required as far as development is concerned, but the NEA had it set down clearly and specifically what they were about.  There was no ambiguity in the terminology.  Why did the Government take the opportunity to cast aside an agency who were working well and producing the goods?  The only answer is that it was necessary to satisfy the whims and desires of the minor party in Government and to provide them with some type of electoral platform for the forthcoming general election.</P>
    <P>The NEA were very involved in investing risk capital and they did so in the areas I have mentioned, such as natural resources.  That is specifically mentioned in this document as well.  They were also involved in importation substitution programmes, also mentioned in the NDC document.  They were involved in export opportunities development, research and development and providing capital at the very early high risk stage for these ventures. What more are the NDC going to do?  Nothing.  We are saying there is no need for this Government document because agencies already exist which are capable and could carry out these functions if they had been given the opportunity. But the NEA have been strangled over the past six months to accommodate the Coalition desire to give a political sop to the Labour Party at a time immediately prior to the next general election test.</P>
    <P>The question has to be asked: if the Minister, reluctant as he is with his over-politicised document, is going to press ahead, how much is it going to cost and who is going to pay for these investments if and when they come to pass?  We are told there may be £300 million authorised share capital made available.  Anybody who understands these matters will readily recognise that not a single shilling had to be put forward at this time.  It is not issued capital, it is authorised capital, and unless it is called upon at some future date then no money is available for the ventures being suggested in the document. We all know that eventually it is the taxpayers who must pay for any bills that accrue because of this document and <Col N="802" /> that borrowing for low return projects is a very dicey operation and will end up in an economic upset and higher unemployment levels.</P>
    <P>Who will be the directors of the board of the NDC?  From where will they be drawn?  There are only two places &mdash; the Civil Service or the private sector, and more than likely they will be drawn from well-known industrialists, some banking people or people from the financial institutions, but all will have Fine Gael tags attached to them or, perhaps because this is a Labour document, they will have the Labour tag on this occasion, but they will be members of the board before the next general election.  I would like to know where they will come from.  More than likely they will come from the private sector.  If the banks can lose money, if multinationals can close down, if financial institutions have to be taken over and administered by the Government, will these people be able to pick and choose only winners?  We must take it that there will be failures attached to this operation, that is in the order of things.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, admits that high risk ventures will be involved and this means there will be a reasonably high proportion of failures.  We are not talking about £5,000 projects.  Not on your life.  We have something much grander in store for the people.  We will be talking in tens of millions of pounds and, if experience is anything to go by, then with departmental involvement we are going to have a number of failures and over the years substantial losses will have to be entertained by one section of the community, namely, the taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The nine favoured sons or daughters of Ireland who will sit on this board will have an unenviable task and they will have a mandate from the Minister. &ldquo;Direction&rdquo; is the word used in the document which has connotations which will have to be looked at very closely.  They will be charged with the responsibility of picking the commercial successes.  That is outlined in section 10 of the Bill.  It is well worth taking a closer look at the terminology in section 10.  To protect his good monetaristic principles the Minister <Col N="803" /> has made sure that he has framed section 10 in such a way as to give him an escape if he requires it later on.  The NDC will get involved in enterprises that are capable of becoming profitable and that have reasonable prospects for profitability. The words &ldquo;capable of&rdquo; and &ldquo;reasonable prospects&rdquo; are the words of flexibility and compromise.  This is an escape from public accountability.  If they fund any project or investment they can always fall back on section 10 and say it had been capable of profitability.  There is no guarantee in that section that it will be profitable or that it will generate employment. Section 10 is a two-way release so far as the Government are concerned.</P>
    <P>Management will take policy directions from the Government through the Minister.  That is catered for in another section well distanced from section 10. The Government will evolve policy dictated by sectional and geographical interests. Therein lies the fundamental weakness in this document.  The Minister knows that there is no guarantee of success in any venture in this document and it will always be available to the board of directors to say that they were authorised under section 10 to take on high risk ventures.  When the Government take on a high risk and one adds in the social dimension as against the commercially viable dimension there is sure to be a plethora of disasters in the foreseeable future.  Those disasters will have to be paid for eventually by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the corporation will be entitled to depart from the conventional risk return consideration. They are being given flexibility to allow them to take on board elements that would not normally be a part of the criteria used by the private sector or highly commercial interests.  They are being given discretion outside the normal commercial yardstick.  That is an inherent weakness in this corporation.  It is the way out for the NDC in politically sensitive areas.  I refer the House to section 31 in support of my argument.  It says that the Minister will be empowered to issue policy directives to the corporation.  That <Col N="804" /> suggests that there is no cut off point in relation to anything the Minister might like to suggest by way of policy to the corporation.  The Minister could direct them to any location to take on any type of investment, viable or otherwise, as long as the social dimension is enough to warrant the investment.  The social dimension in Irish political life means the political dimension.  If it is politically advisable, the Minister has given himself the power under section 31 to enable him to direct the corporation to do anything that he desires on his behalf.  If that is not politicising the corporation I do not know what is.  It should be political anathema to the Minister who has been preaching the separation of the private sector and Government agencies.  The Government have been divesting themselves of some of their lame ducks, some of the corporations and institutions which were not paying their way, and here the Minister is getting back into the arena of creating further bodies so that eventually the same fate will befall them as has befallen so many in the past and the tab will have to be picked up by the taxpayer.</P>
    <P>This provision applied to all other State investment companies in other countries. The power to direct the corporation to do what the Minister or the Government of the day wanted existed in all other jurisdictions investigated and those State investment companies failed for that reason.  But as in the good Irish tradition we are taking on board again the weaknesses that should have been evident to us from a careful scrutiny of similar State investment bodies abroad.</P>
    <P>The Government may have good intentions in relation to creating the right climate for investment and in relation to providing venture capital to certain institutions but those good intentions will not prevent the Minister utilising his discretionary power to back non-commercial enterprises if political expediency is the order of the day for that project.  That is the basic weakness in this document. Section 10 has the ambiguity to allow the board to get involved in dubious ventures and section 31 gives power to enable the Minister to direct them to get involved <Col N="805" /> in non-commercial ventures and projects that will be undertaken for reasons other then commercial viability.  The looseness in the wording makes a nonsense of the stated aims of the NDC as outlined in section 10.</P>
    <P>The question of accountability is worth pursuing because we have heard quite a bit about public accountability for money spent on behalf of the taxpayer.  There is so much flexibility built into this corporation that everyone will find it easy to use the escape clause in section 10.  To justify the introduction of this Bill one would have thought the Minister would have been charged with the responsibility to show that there was a deficiency in the existing capital.  The Minister should also have been expected to show how this public agency could remedy that shortfall in capital supply.</P>
    <P>I put it to the Minister and to the Government that any weakness that exists in the Irish equity base is due to our tax regime.  That is why the private sector and the people who control the money market are encouraged to expend their finances into property and services rather than into the manufacturing sector.  This was recognised in the Government's White Paper.  Enormous amounts of money are available in the private sector for certain kinds of venture. We had a good example of that when it was suggested that the oil boom had reached the shores of Ireland.  Then £1,000 million was available from under the mattresses to invest in high risk ventures in oil exploration.  How come then, that this tremendous amount of risk capital available in the economy was not readily available for the manufacturing sector?  The equity base is weak because of the taxation regime we have, and nothing has been done by the Minister or the Government since coming into office to redress that.  It is a Government's job to create the conditions which will allow growth in the productive sector and to create a climate and environment which will give a decent return for risk taking and risk takers.  Is that not the inherent <Col N="806" /> weakness that we find in the whole question of venture capital usage that the burden of personal taxation is a major disincentive to risk taking?  The Minister, the national plan, <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>, last week's package and the NDC hold out no hope whatsoever for a change in the taxation regime in the foreseeable future.  That is the major reason why we have such an enormous black economy.</P>
    <P>It might come as a surprise to the Minister that people in industry, highly paid executives, are at this time unwilling to accept promotion in their place of work. People are unwilling to do overtime or give anything extra because of the level of personal taxation attached to their incomes.  It might come as a surprise to the Government and the Minister that it is becoming increasingly more difficult in the private sector to recruit suitably qualified executives to man our industrial sector.  However difficult it is to recruit them, we have been losing our best trained and most experienced executives to other jurisdications in the past six months, again because of the frustrations attached to the taxation regime.  That is the basic reason for the shortage of venture capital in this economy, but the NDC are not going to redress that, and no measure as yet outlined or suggested by the Government is going to redress the inherent weakness that presses the Minister to have to introduce this measure.</P>
    <P>The NEA were the venture capital risk taker and were expending the money. They were in place and were not overladen with enormous powers as outlined in sections 10, 14 and 31 of the Bill where we get a real insight into the Minister's demand for power control over this organisation.  He will have to be given the closest details in writing before the corporation can do anything.  We expect that at least they will be able to set up house before they have to give in detail what they propose to do, but the consent of the Minister will have to be sought and obtained at every stage along the way. Taking sections 14, 15 and 31 in tandem you see the everyday involvement of the <Col N="807" /> Minister in this proposed corporation. Why does he bother to encumber us with another layer of bureaucracy when he is to be involved in the day-to-day running of the thing anyway?  He could have set himself up in a nice new office in Kildare Street and done the job himself, but that is exactly what the Minister wanted to do and, if I might put it to the Labour Party Member present, that is where the Minister has codded the Labour Party in this. They wanted it to be somewhat different. They thought they were getting something grandiose, but in effect the Minister, Deputy Bruton, a leading member of the Fine Gael Party, is the controlling influence, the directing influence, and his consent must be had before any project, any investment, any venture or risk are undertaken by this corporation.  They have been sold a political pup and before too long they will recognise that.  We are expected here to sit idly and quietly by and give recognition to something that has no chance or hope because the Minister is determined that his basic fundamental philosophy, in so far as money control is concerned, is not to be taken away from him to satisfy the whims of the Labour Party.</P>
    <P>The Government had a glorious opportunity to do something about the Irish equity base, about generating the climate that would make it possible to attract in the risk capital.  They are not going to do it.  If they had shown a little imagination and perhaps a little courage in this area of personal and corporate taxation they would have released plenty of venture capital in the private sector.  There has always been an abundance of venture capital available from the private sector when the climate or investment environment was right, when the risk was worth taking and when the prospect of benefit was in proportion to the element of risk taken.  Now all the money is being put into services and into property because the risk takers see that while the return might be small on their investment at least it is secure.  If they undertake any <Col N="808" /> other type of investment they are penalised and crucified by the most penal taxation code in western Europe.  I suggest that the Labour Party would have done better to press the Minister for Finance to do something on that level than to press the Minister, Deputy Bruton, to introduce the NDC when in effect he has brought it in but has codded them up to the two eyes in the wording and the ambiguity he has written in for his own purposes.</P>
    <P>Apart from it being the Government's business to create the conditions necessary for the productive sector of the economy, they have a responsibility in regard to the national attitude to risk.  I have preached about this here before now and it is worth reiterating.  Those who take the risk must be rewarded.  We must have the proper attitude from the general public that it is not a mortal sin in Ireland in 1985 to make money, and the only way to get job creation and create new avenues for the generating of new employment is by allowing business to make money.  That is a good, capitalist idea.  I am sure it pains the heart of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and his friends in the Labour benches but be that as it may, it is still a capitalist idea and, let me say without using a pun, it is a capital idea also to allow businessmen to make money.  One reason that the people in the private sector with capital are not willing to invest is that they are not satisfied that the socialist wing of the Government are not engineering ways of taking it from them.</P>
    <P>The Government are putting in place something that will not and cannot work. The corporation will be only a duplication of other agencies who are doing the job quite well and who would do it much better if given a little Government support. The Government should have undertaken to do something about the competitiveness of our manufacturing productive sector.  Such a step might have enticed a little extra venture capital into the arena.  It is worth noting that since 1978 unit costs of production here have increased by about 15 per cent more than was the case of our competitors in <Col N="809" /> Europe.  Ours are the highest essential service costs in Europe, whether in the areas of telecommunications, internal postal charges, electricity supply or the tax inclusive price of petroleum products used in industry.  We are out of line in all those areas.  If the Government had applied themselves to bringing our essential costs into line with the European average, we would not have experienced such an enormous number of factory closures and the putting out of work of tens of thousands of our people.  Would that not have been a much better response than what the Government are doing now?  Would it not have been much better to protect our indigenous industries that were already in place and to which the capital allocations had been made?  Instead, those industries were allowed die because of the Government's lack of interest in protecting our competitive base.  What we have got is a silly, over-politicised document which is no more than an effort at salvaging the Coalition for another quarter at most.</P>
    <P>One would have thought that the NDC would have been opposed totally to stated Government pseudo policies to the extent that for sometime the Government have been talking about reducing bureaucracy.  In this context I must take Deputy Prendergast to task.  He has told us that bureaucracy must be kept to a minimum.  At least the Deputy is sensible enough to admit that we are creating another layer of bureaucracy but he is begging us to keep that to a minimum. Has it not been the tradition to keep bureaucracy to a minimun?  One would not think so in the light of the path indicated in this Bill.</P>
    <P>Has not Parkinson's law run riot for half a centruy with organisations feeding on themselves, generating the need for extra staff, the need to protect themselves and to expand?  Is the new corporation not a formula for the creation, not only of another layer of bureaucracy, but of a conglomeration of a whole range of subsidiaries and bureaucracies?</P>
    <P>Deputy Naughten seems to accept that some nine people will be responsible for the operations of the NDC.  He seems to <Col N="810" /> think that the nine political hacks who will be appointed by the Coalition before they leave office will be responsible for the work of the corporation.  That is nonsense. They are the people who will be appointed for the purpose of ensuring that the ministerial directions are complied with as set out in section 31 but what about the hundreds of people who will be put into good, permanent and pensionable employment for the purpose of carrying out those ministerial directions? That is the layer of bureaucracy I am talking about.  There is no need for it.  The Minister, who is a very capable man, has conned Labour in the way he has framed the ambiguity in sections 10, 14, 15 and 31 but he would have been better advised to have used his considerable talents to co-ordinate the existing agencies.  There are a number of substantial, well-established and effective agencies among which are the IDA and Fóir Teoranta, a company I am deliberately putting second because they will have to be expanded and given much more resources if and when the NDC get off the ground.  I say this because of the rescue operations they will have to engage in and which will have to be paid for by the taxpayer.  Then there are the other agencies such as CTT, the National Enterprise Agency, the IIRS and the NBSC as well as Bord na Móna and so on.  These are all referred to in one way or another in this document to the extent that the NDC will become involved in areas of activity that were formerly the responsibility of these agencies.</P>
    <P>It is not merely a dislocation or a dissolving of the NEA that is involved.  All the other areas are mentioned specifically in the document as being suitable avenues for investment by way of venture capital through the NDC.  I am satisfied that this is a vote of no confidence in all these other agencies but I doubt if such a vote would stand up to scrutiny.  These agencies may have had their weaknesses; they may have made bad decisions or may have involved the country in the expenditure of large sums of money by way of rescue packages, but at least they have reasonably good track records.  Now we <Col N="811" /> are to add another layer that will be expected in some way to superimpose itself, be gifted enough to make the right decisions and not to be involved in failures. It is the lie in that document that somehow new expertise or experience will flow from the private and public sectors and be co-ordinated in a way that will allow only the right choices to be made.  There will be an element of failure and that factor must be faced here.</P>
    <P>It is suggested in the document that at some time the good projects will be sold off.  The Minister did not get his own way there but in the later part of section 10 he got his way to the extent that he will be entitled under section 31 to sell off any project by way of ministerial direction. There is no provision for any such sale to be at the discretion of the board of the NDC.  They will not be in a position to say no to the Minister.  He will direct them and his political appointees will put that direction into effect.  The Minister will sell off the good projects, as he indicated publicly six months ago.  It will be necessary to sell off these projects in order to accommodate the roll over funding because there will be no other money available for that purpose.  In other words, that fund will be accommodated by the sale of the successful projects, if there are any, while we will keep on board the herd of white elephants because of political pressure to back uncommercial ventures and hopeless cases.  It has never been the tradition to make an immediate decision to sell off a white elephant.  Such decisions became a protracted business but the reason for that was that initially the venture was established to accommodate sectional interests or a geographical or political interest.</P>
    <P>How will it be possible for the Minister of the day to divest himself of the nonviable project when the political toing and froing will provide the pressure to hold on a little longer in the hope of the venture becoming profitable, as is provided for in section 10?  These are words of flexibility and compromise, words inserted deliberately to avoid <Col N="812" /> having to pull out of the weak project, to avoid closing down, selling off or liquidating. Liquidation to a Minister or any other politician is the last straw.  There is always the prospect that things will change, that the exchange rate might improve.  Maybe fishes might fly.  That will be the attitude of the Minister when the time comes to divest himself of the uncommercial projects.  It is a pity, when so much work has been put into this document for the purpose of creating that type of scenario to accommodate the political outturn of a number of years hence.</P>
    <P>I confidentally predict that before this unfortunate Government go to the next electoral test not a single productive job will have been created in the life of the Dáil that brings about this National Development Corporation.  How could it be?  All the corporation are going to get involved in over the next 12 months &mdash; if the Government are there that long, which they will not be &mdash; is outlined in section 21 where the administrative expenses are forecast as £2 million a year. It is a pity that Deputy Prendergast is not present to hear that.  It was obvious that he did not read the document.  He would have had his answer as far as bureaucracy is concerned.  Therein lies the first step in the bureaucratic layer.  They will get £2 million a year for as long as they like and after that with the Minister's consent as much as they like.  Then you come to section 33 where the corporation will be allowed to lease or purchase premises They will have to get the Minister's consent for sums over £250,000.  That is not to suggest that the amount will not be another couple of million pounds.  For the first 12 months there will be a search around town for suitably spacious and luxurious office accommodation which will, no doubt, be given the Minister's sanction and consent.  He will have to consent, to keep the Labour Party in office with them.</P>
    <P>Surely this must be regarded as the greatest waste of public money in the last 12 months.  They are putting in place a tier of bureaucracy at considerable expense, despite the fact that there is already a plethora of investment, grant-aiding <Col N="813" /> and capital agencies in existence here.  To make it worse, it was responsibly suggested recently by a Government spokesman that perhaps Bula might be a suitable natural resource for National Development Corporation involvement. Are we creating this corporation to take over existing lame ducks, not to mention creating new white elephants when we have already expended £9 million of the taxpayers' money and put it into the pockets of certain capitalists and we have not even got a hole in the ground?  It is now suggested that we provide authorised share capital, if and when called upon, up to £300 million to support projects as ill-fated as that.</P>
    <P>Take a look at the inconsistency in the Minister's thinking in this matter.  I am delighted that Deputy Skelly is in the House.  If he follows through on some of his comments in this House for the past 12 months he will give an awful scorching to this Bill.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Communications. Deputy Mitchell, in the recent past stated that Westat, comprised of RTE and Bord Telecom could not become involved in such things as satellites because that was a high risk involvement. What are we being told here?  The State are not to get involved in high risk capital involvement and venture capital expenditure so far as that Minister is concerned, but his running mate is now telling us that we must become involved in high risk ventures and create a climate in which high risk ventures will seek our support.  Why did the Minister not take on board some of the 440 projects put up to the NEA?  They were involved in natural resources, in marketing strategies, in R &amp; D, in all the things being suggested and touted here as suitable for venture capital investment.  The NEA did remarkably well with temporary staff and a Government choking them every day so that they would be seen to be a failure, otherwise the Government would not have had the courage to introduce this Bill.</P>
      <P>The institutional experience elsewhere throughout the world would advise against proceeding with this type of corporation. Surely if the experts in the field of venture capital investment and companies of a State investment nature advise against it and if the experience has been a failure in all the developed countries, that would have cautioned the Minister to think twice about it.  But, of course, he had no choice in the matter. He was carrying out the direction of the Taoiseach to satisfy and placate the Labour Party in the short term: &ldquo;But make sure, Minister Bruton, that you frame the terminology in such a way that we can scuttle it later on&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not a single Minister or Government spokesman has made a clear, unambiguous, economic argument to justify this new creation.  They have talked loftily about profligacy in other administrations, about the need for job creation, the need to pour State funds into a whole range of areas such as natural resources, about the need to do down the National Enterprise Agency.  They have talked about the need <Col N="815" /> to supplement all the other agencies which I mentioned some time ago but not a single word to justify economically the need for this.  There was no word on why institutions in other jurisdictions had failed so miserably, not just in western Europe but also in North America.  The legislation is full of ambiguity.  That is enough, as far as I am concerned, to guarantee that it has been introduced for political reasons.  And this from the Minister for Reform, the man who was going to divest the Government of all the white elephants, put them out to pasture or liquidate them.  Here he is taking on a guaranteed organisation that will have a failure rate and must inevitably involve the expenditure of taxpayers' money through Fóir Teoranta to bring about a rescue later on.</P>
    <P>Never was there less enthusiastic selling of a Government measure by Government Ministers.  Not a single one of them has come from the Fine Gael side to justify the reason for this corportion. There has been plenty of Dáil talk, well recognised by the public servants in the House and by the correspondents.  We have heard a fair amount of Dáil talk in relation to this Bill.  Words have been floating in the air across the Chamber such as &ldquo;indigenous&rdquo;, &ldquo;viability projects&rdquo;, &ldquo;macro-economics&rdquo;, &ldquo;value-added&rdquo; and &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;.  All this mumbo-jumbo is known affectionately as Dáil talk and we have had a surfeit of it.  This Bill is the last kick of the dying Coalition and it will not provide a lifejacket for either of the Coalition Parties.  It is a nonsense because it is surplus to our requirements.  It is so geared and so phrased that it has no chance of success and does not deserve the support of Dáil Éireann.</P>

      <P>It is not surprising that Fianna Fáil are reacting in this manner. It is not without precedent.  On 9 March 1950 the Bill to set up the IDA was placed before the House.  The late Mr. Seán Lemass said:</P>
      <P>I am not opposed to the Bill merely because these individuals constitute the authority.  I am opposed to the Bill in principle and, whatever views I may have about the individuals, I do not propose to express them.  But, in fairness to them and to anyone else who may be now or who may in the future become associated with this Industrial Development Authority, I want them to understand that my oppostion and the opposition of the Deputies on this side of the House to the whole idea of the Bill is fundamental and that at the earliest possible occasion we will terminate it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That bring us back to 1950.  Had not the Government of that period taken the initiative what would have been the <Col N="817" /> consequences for this country?  We are seeing history repeating itself in this House.</P>
    <P>There is the same negative approach from Deputy Flynn and his party.  He says that no economic reason has been given to justify the setting up of the National Development Corporation.  Are 230,000 unemployed people not a sufficient economic reason, or do they matter in the least?  There is an element of risk involved and it is only fair to say that some of these companies may fail.  If we are to be timid in our approach to solving the problems of the nation we might as well stay at home.</P>
    <P>There has been much talk about Labour Party ideology.  Has it now become undignified to hold an ideal?  This State was founded on an ideal but nowadays it is seen as wrong to be idealistic. If I may offer any criticism of the Bill, it is that it has taken three years to come before the House.  It would be wrong to suggest that there were not differences and some measure of conflict between the parties in Government.  That is quite legitimate and understandable in a democracy where every person has a right to express his or her views on any issue within the law.  That is the normal process of government and to me it is quite acceptable.  It recognises the depth of the unemployment crisis in our community and we are going forth in a fearless way in an attempt to resolve these problems.  Deputy Flynn said that risk taking is not getting enough incentive.  I dare say the Fianna Fáil Government of 1977 did provide incentive for the private sector and they failed dismally in this regard.</P>
    <P>There are 12 million people unemployed in the EC.  Is anybody suggesting that the capitalist system has succeeded? There is a socialist content in this Bill and rightly so because the old ways have not succeeded.  It is time to come forth with new ideas and to tackle courageously the problems which confront us.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party have never opposed the coming of multinationals to this country if it meant the creation of jobs, but we have reservations and there is a need <Col N="818" /> for us to consider how we can help ourselves without being totally dependent on the multinationals.  I am a little concerned that Deputy Flynn should refer to section 31 as being of a dubious nature, indicating that he feels there is something underhand or sinister about it.  The use of this type of language in no way compliments the Opposition.  Regarding State enterprise and the setting up of bureaucracies, Deputy Flynn dwelt at length on his criticism of the State sector but he, like myself, is an employee of the State sector in his non-political life.  Is he suggesting that to work for the State is less than honourable and that the only activity indulged in by public employees is ripping off the State?  It is sad that an elected Member of this House should refer to the people who will head the corporation without giving the facts.  It is deplorable that highly qualified people should be abused in this way by Deputies.</P>
    <P>No Government so far have taken a decision solely on ideological grounds. We have had much talk about Irish entrepreneurs. We have a State sector because the private sector did not, and were not prepared to, invest.  We have the ESB, a transport company and we had a shipping company simply because the private sector was not able to undertake their provision.  Governments in Britain set up State enterprises on ideological grounds but here it was done because the private sector were not prepared to take the risk. It is important that that should be pointed out.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn said that we can get people today to invest in service industries only.  Have we been lacking in courage? Deputy Flynn criticised the Government for making available £300 million to the NDC.  This Government have shown courage in the face of our problems.  Deputy Flynn said the private sector was being penalised and victimised by taxation and he said that was not a just reward for investment.  What did the Government of which Deputy Flynn was a member do in 1977?  They announced commitments but they failed to deliver, they failed to respond to the needs of the private sector.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="819" /> As a Labour Deputy I am happy that at last we have a Government with the courage to produce this Bill.  My hope now is that it will provide the jobs we so badly need.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to make a brief contribution on this Bill.  Like Deputy O'Sullivan, I was amazed at some of the things Deputy Flynn said on behalf of Fianna Fáil.  He took strong objection to the prospect of the investment of up to £300 million in the NDC and the country.  It is an investment in job creation.  I cannot imagine why Fianna Fáil are opposed to this investment.  Perhaps Deputy Flynn is worried that some of the money might be wasted, might not be used properly, that some of it might go on administrative and bureaucratic expenses.  The job of looking after the people's money has been better served by people on this side than those on the far side.  Squandering is unlikely to take place while this Government are in power.</P>
      <P>I was amused by some of Deputy Flynn's references, particularly towards the end when he spoke about the Bula-Tara situation.  He and Fianna Fáil have been pushing to give this ore body over to Tara, lock, stock and barrel.  He seems to be very upset because Irish investors and Irish incentives have been involved in this.  He spoke about £9.5 million being put into back pockets but he did not refer to what the State got in return.  He conveniently omitted many of the details in that connection.  It is only right, therefore, that the record should be put right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think anybody on this side will be fooled by either Tara or Bula, but Deputy Flynn seems to have fallen for the idea that Bula should be made bankrupt and the mine handed over to Tara. The Bula ore body is the richest in Europe.  There is enough in the ground to be mined over a 20-year period.  Tara have 20 years reserves left in their mine but there is no prospect of any jobs coming out of the ground if the Bula mine is handed over to Tara: Tara would bank it for the next 20 years, leave it there, <Col N="820" /> and when they are good and ready, mining being a long term investment, they might go back to do something with it.  One thing is sure: the Government or the taxpayers will not get a single penny from that mine, in the same way as they have not received a penny revenue from Tara to date.  Indeed, the Tara people are on record as having bragged that they never will contribute a penny to the Irish revenue.</P>
    <P>Does Deputy Flynn not remember that many years ago Tara offered the meagre sum of £80,000 for a 20 acre farm, which included the mineral rights, to Mr. Wright, the farmer?  It was only when Tara categorically refused Mr. Wright any equity or royalty participation, even 1 per cent, in the development of his mine that Mr. Wright approached the Bula people, Mr. Tom Roche and Mr. Wymes, to get him out of his dilemma.  When Bula was formed Mr. Wright received £500,000 and 20 per cent in the company. Does Deputy Flynn not remember that the State now owns 49 per cent of Bula Ltd., having paid £8.9 million for 24 per cent, receiving 25 per cent free in 1977?</P>

      <P>We are discussing the NDC and investment in Irish jobs.  We are talking about a sum of up to £300 million to be used for that development.  One of the suggestions made by Deputy Flynn was that some of that money be used in this project.  All I am doing is clarifying that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I have to discuss it because it was used as the main part of Deputy Flynn's plank.  I was talking about a national resource, a national project which can create jobs.  The private shareholders in that company lent £13 million to the company and guaranteed a further £11 million of a bank debt.  That was a real commitment on behalf of the Irish investors in this project and it is too glib to <Col N="821" /> talk about somebody putting £9.5 million into their pockets.  That is not true.</P>
      <P>If Tara get their hands on this ore body we will not see it developed in the next 20 years and neither workers nor taxpayers will benefit from it in any way.  Tara, a multinational company, have succeeded in conning, or trying to con, the Department of Energy and the Government into scuttling Bula.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is talking about.  I will tell him this much that you are talking about joint venture, private investment and, because the socialist element of this Government has been recognised to the extent that it wishes to invest in the public sector in job creation is it wrong?  Whereas this Bill talks about different kinds of investment and ventures.  It talks about private sector investment, about investment directly by the corporation, in joint ventures with the private sector or in co-operation with a State-sponsored commercial enterprise. That covers the whole gamut.</P>
      <P>Deputies opposite should welcome this opportunity.  As many people in this House in recent decades have pointed out &mdash; and as Deputy O'Sullivan and others of his party before have said &mdash; the private sector have not been an unmitigated success and have not always succeeded in investing in certain areas. That is true.  They do not always invest for prudent reasons when it is not opportune to do so.  That strengthens the case for the State helping in investment areas. In the preparatory documents for the national plan it was estimated that it cost £6,125 to create a job, of which the State received back £3,000 in revenue.  Therefore it cost £3,125 to create a job.  If the private sector invest in job creation there is a negative cost to the State, the State receiving £6,125 back in revenue for every job created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This National Development Corporation, together with the recent move by the Government to open up investment in certain parts of the city, constitute prudent steps in the right direction.  The <Col N="823" /> record of the performances of different semi-State corporations, where public money is involved, in recent years has improved to the extent that it is carefully and strictly monitored, not least by way of establishment of committees of this House so that we can confidently monitor their performance.</P>
    <P>Anybody in this House who has any feeling at all for the population at large, who wants to keep our total population including youth, together &mdash; and it should be noted that for the first time in 100 years we have our total population together&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason they are all together is that emigration ceased in the seventies.  In the great Famine of 100 years ago a large part of the population emigrated when we lost the cream of our people.  As Deputy M. Ahern has mentioned it, I should say that emigration is beginning again.  The objective is to stop it.  This kind of investment will help in that respect.  It should be remembered also that in the fifties and sixties there were 20,000 per annum leaving the country which amounted to approximately 400,000 people over 20 years.  They were all the disadvantaged and less-well-off workers who left.  That is not now happening. They remain, now and many of the professional and educated classes emigrate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If Deputies opposite think that tens of thousands of such people will sit around, allowing us in here to twiddle our thumbs, without engaging in enlightened investment like this, they are making a very big mistake because this time the people will be here to march and vote with their feet. Therefore, I do not see what Deputies opposite are complaining about when the Government decide to invest in a project such as this providing money for the creation of jobs.  Jobs must be created on a massive scale.  It is sums like these only that will create the numbers of jobs required to put people back to work. <Col N="824" /> Remember one is talking of perhaps 10,000, 20,000 or 30,000 jobs.  People who welcome this Bill are enthusiastic about the prospect of what can be done with this money&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The people from the Labour Party will be watching every pound, if not every penny, of it as it is invested over the next couple of years.  If the private sector wish to become involved there is room for them also.  I have great confidence that projects such as these will put the country back on its feet, providing the kind of employment that is needed.</P>
      <P>I do not share the pessimism of Deputy Flynn as demonstrated in the course of his remarks.  It does not demonstrate constructive opposition, when some proposal is put forward when constructively one could come along and say: &ldquo;That is good, at least you are doing something positive, something which will assist the state of the nation by way of investment in jobs, in infrastructure.&rdquo;  This is by way of getting our young people back to work and allowing them to remain at home with a future.  Yet all the Opposition can say is that this constitutes another white elephant, that the money invested will be to no avail with no prospect of solving our problems.  What do the Opposition want or expect us to do, sit back, do nothing, wait for another five to eight years until everything has returned to normal by which time we may have lost 500,000 of our population, many of them young? This is a vote of confidence in our young people, in their future, that you have been saying for years have constituted the State's greatest asset&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>That Dáil Éireann condemns the Government for its failure to <Col N="826" /> implement comprehensive policies for the development of the country's natural resources.</P>
    <P>A nation is its people and its natural resources and it is the signal failure of the Government to implement or even attempt a comprehensive policy, not alone in the area of manpower which has been the subject of many constructive debates by speakers on this side of the House, but also in the area of natural resources.  Deputy Daly will be speaking later about forestry and Deputy Kitt will speak about the neglect of turf development.</P>
    <P>I will concentrate on a few specific areas such as mining, oil exploration and natural gas.  I heard Deputy Skelly refer to mining but I heard only a few sentences so I hope I will not take his remarks out of context.  However, I should like to make the point that to my knowledge the Wright family do not have 20 per cent of Tara Mines, they have only ten per cent. The amount of loans in relation to one company to another have not been clearly defined or established.  Those points should be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>With regard to the national crisis, we should be looking to ourselves to see what we can do with our natural resources. How can we develop them to the maximum benefit of the people?  I will have to draw arrows across the bows of various Ministers in an effort to get logical explanations for some of the policies they are pursuing which are very difficult to understand.</P>
    <P>In regard to the most recent debacle in relation to the long drawn out saga of ten years, the position of Fianna Fáil in relation to Bula is to have it brought into production at the earliest possible opportunity in order to provide the jobs that are so badly needed and to reap the maximum national benefit which can be derived from it in the interests of our hard pressed taxpayers.</P>

      <P>The people have received no return from this natural resource or from the disastrous decision <Col N="827" /> to invest almost £10 million on behalf of the taxpayers over eight years ago. People are entitled to ask questions.  Will they get a return?  When will they get a return?  What will be done in the wake of this debacle?  I hope the Minister for Energy will speak in this debate and I call on him to state clearly and specifically what additional funds have been paid by the Government during the years from 1983 to date to the bankers of Bula Mines?  For what purpose was the money paid and what were the results?  I am not so naive as to believe that the bankers did not receive any comfort somewhere along the line, especially when they did not know where their money was going and were reluctant to go after the personal guarantors of the shareholders. Was there authority from this House to pay any money?</P>
      <P>I recall the Coalition budget of 1982 where there was a specific amount of £1.7 million provided in the Estimates for arranging a deal between Bula and Tara. The Government then fell and when I was Minister for the rest of 1982 I used approximately £140,000 of the amount provided to buy approximately three weeks to try to finalise a deal.  That is all I paid out; the taxpayer was saved the balance and it went back to the Exchequer at the end of the year unless between 14 and 31 December the Coalition handed over more money.  I want the Minister to be very specific in relation to moneys paid from 1983 to date so that I can evaluate what is going on behind closed doors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now turn to the Government's handling of the take-over negotiations which were announced in this House in December 1984 and which were the subject of many questions.  The Minister of State said then that he had a deal and time and time again I asked questions regarding the finalising of such a deal.  I was told there were no problems, just a few small matters to be ironed out.  I was told negotiations were confidential and I respected that.  What happened?  Apparently there was a deal worked out in August, if I am to believe everything I <Col N="828" /> was told.  I admit that the two parties concerned in the deal were difficult to deal with either separately or together but I was told that there was a deal.  I do not know what happened then but I can speculate based on the information I received and on statements made.  It appears that the Government, the Minister and the Minister of State believed that they had a deal because, if not, they would not have held a champagne party in the Department of Energy to celebrate. However, Bula then decided that they were not going to accept that deal and they put in additional demands totalling about £10 million.  The handling, strategy and the non-recognition of the realities of economic life in relation to the metal industry at the time were obviously ignored by the Department.  If they had not ignored these realities they would have put that demand into the dustbin recognising that they had a good deal in December 1983.  Deputy Skelly need not be shaking his head because these are the facts.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hang-ups about either company, I look on it purely as a business decision.  I have been involved in these negotiations and I know how difficult it is to deal with the two parties concerned.  The Government stand condemned for their ineptitude and bad judgment in these take-over negotiations. They stand condemned for ignoring the drastic changes in the market <Col N="829" /> place and, above all, they stand condemned for their despicable and injudicious use of threats and &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; tactics.  The whole thing backfired on them.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that Tara were prepared to sign in August.  Despite the fact that the deal had been improved four times during the year they were still prepared to sign until the demand was made for an extra £10 million.  If I were in their chair I would do the same thing.  They did not know what would be the end of the matter.  The Government told them that the deal could be signed and then the other party came along with a demand for another £10 million.  What way is that to carry on business negotiations?  They showed a total disregard for the realities of the situation.  A few days later metal prices came down and they have not stopped falling.  Yet, the Government say that Tara should have taken on a deal that not alone would have bankrupted their operations but would have put strains on their entire enterprise.  It was obvious from reading the <i>Financial Times</i> and other papers that the company had taken a corporate decision to reduce their borrowings.</P>
      <P>Against that background a deal was on the table.  It was celebrated by a champagne party in the Department of Energy but it finally collapsed in the face of the Government.  We heard about the appointment of a receiver.  He must be a mystery man because we have not seen him yet.  On behalf of the shareholder holding a stake of 49 per cent, I want the Minister to clarify where is the receiver and what is his position.  Apart from the bankers there are many other creditors who want to know where they stand. Above all, the workers in Bula want to know where they stand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is not good enough to hide behind a smoke-screen.  From reading the newspapers today it is obvious that the Government are creating another smoke-screen when another mystery tour takes off to Europe to talk to the Finnish company, Autokompu, and also an Austrian company.  I listened to that fairy tale in 1982 for a while.  I took the plane to <Col N="830" /> Helsinki and I confronted Autokompu to find out their views on Bula Mines.  Today in a worsening market situation I have little doubt about their views and I have little doubt either about the view of the other European company.  Stop this smoke-screen tactic to try to cover up your failed negotiations that fell back into your lap.  Give us a clear statement tonight with regard to the situation and where you intend to go from here.  I cannot understand why you have messed it up so badly.  There is the experience of ten years behind all of you &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Col N="831" />
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Should that prove true in the long term it will be a reflection on the bad deal that was done in the beginning.  It is the first admission from any member of the Government parties that a bad deal was one in 1975.  When the negotiations were proceeding I gave some gentle advice to the Minister for Energy and the Minister of State to stop the &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; tactics and the threats because that would only tend to undermine international investment.  I am asking the Minister to explain to the people why the company got special treatment in the past ten years.</P>
      <P>In addition, a sister company, Bula Resources, in the recent third licensing round got four blocks.  Not alone are they minority stake holders but they are a majority stake holder in one case.  They are handling a 60 per cent majority interest in one case, 40 per cent in another, 22½ per cent and 13.88 per cent.  I want the Minister to explain why this happened. When he announced the third round he went overboard in stressing the financial criteria he was laying down for companies that hoped to be awarded blocks.  He said:</P>
      <P>It is the weakest link in a chain which breaks first.  The progress of any group can be seriously hampered if the weakest member ... has to be picked up and carried when the going gets tough.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He said he would be very wary of companies that seemed to have ambitions to become operators which it was beyond their capacity to achieve.  The company, Bula Resources, failed to honour their obligations in other good blocks they got in previous rounds.  Will the Minister please tell the House how he thinks they will be in a position to proceed with the four blocks they have got?  How could the Minister give four blocks to a company that would be ruled out on the basis of his own criteria?  What is the explantion? Is it political, is it due to an ideological hang-up, or is it a combination of both?  Not alone do the people here want to know but also the people on the international scene wish to know why this <Col N="832" /> happened.  We are talking about a company that failed to honour its financial obligations one day but that was given four blocks very soon afterwards.</P>
    <P>On the Stock Exchange the shares of the company concerned are running at approximately 5p while the par value of the shares is 25p.  Does the Minister realise that company cannot get in money without going to the High Court with a request to reduce the par value of the shares?  If the company could not get money on good blocks in the past month, how does the Minister expect it will get it now?  Does he expect the people and the Opposition in this House to believe that there was no interference either for political or ideological reasons?  It defies common sense and logic why he should put at risk natural resources that can and should be developed by giving four blocks to this company.</P>
    <P>What is the present position of the receiver in Tara Mines?  If a receiver was appointed to any small business in the country he would have taken up office within five minutes, but in this case are the Government preventing their receiver from doing his duty?  Are they giving comfort to the banks to keep him out?  Is it true, as I heard today, that a timescale has been set by the receiver telling the Government to make up their minds or he will go in and do his job? What kind of an example is that to give small companies who are struggling to stay in business?  They realise that if you are big enough and have the right friends in the right places a receiver will not be brought in, but if you are struggling and a receiver is appointed, he will be in within five minutes.  That is the reality of economic life in Ireland today.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope he will.  That is the purpose of this exercise.  The third licensing round has been a total disaster, as I predicted when the Government brought out the revised terms.  I said they were not geared to the reality of getting scarce international investment because of the state of the oil industry.  The price of oil has dropped, but if we are serious about this we should tailor our terms and create a climate where investors can operate.  We should not carry on like cowboys using &ldquo;big brother&rdquo; tactics with people who have come here to try to resolve problems which were of the Government's own making.  That is not the way to encourage international investment.  When we look at the way we are managing our affairs I am not surprised that the third round was a flop. It is cheaper today to buy oil on the world stock exchanges than it is to risk money in Ireland because there is not a clear recognition by the Government that risks must be rewarded and enterprise encouraged. This Government have gone consistently in the wrong direction over the past three years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="834" /> Let us now look at natural gas and look at the Government's programme of inaction.  In October 1982 I decided in principle, and announced it at the time, that Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford were to get natural gas.  It is a sad reflection on this House and the way we manage our affairs that three years later we have gone very little further down that road.  We must ask ourselves why. In October 1982 Limerick Corporation decided to accept a minority stake in a company which would provide natural gas into Limerick city and private enterprise were to get 60 per cent.  The corporation accepted that, sent it to the Department and we accepted it and decided, in principle, that they would get gas.  What happened?  Since this Coalition came into office private enterprise were thwarted in every way possible with the result that they were forced to pull out.</P>
    <P>The Cork Gas Company subsequently got into financial difficulties.  The same consortium were interested in bailing them out and taking 70 per cent of the shares of that company but that was not approved by the present Tánaiste.  At the end of the day they were forced to withdraw and once again it was decided that the ideal solution would be to have a nationalised gas industry in Cork.  Now we have one in Limerick &mdash; whenever the gas gets there; and why it is taking so long I will never know &mdash; and we have one in Cork.  What happened in Clonmel? There must have been five deputations to the Tánaiste about this so far, but there is no movement there.  Is there no way in which these ideological hangups can be disposed of so that we can use the one natural resource that is available to us, which will bring economic activity back into the economy and provide the jobs which are so badly needed?  Do not talk about where we will get the money because An Bord Gáis who are making £68 million a year are ready, willing and able to finance it.  Everything is in place: there is the natural resource, jobs are needed, but there is no movement.  Why? Is it political?  Is it ideological?  What is it?  That is what we want to know tonight.</P>
    <P>There is another crisis developing in <Col N="835" /> Dublin Gas.  The price of oil has dropped but will An Bord Gáis respond by reducing their prices?  No; they are talking about increasing them.  Anybody who looks at that financial setup will realise that that must inevitably bring about a crisis.  Are we heading for the total nationalisation of Dublin Gas?  Are the Fine Gael Party sitting beside men in a Government who are allowing this situation to develop?  The new policy seems to have nothing to do with private enterprise or private investment, but letting the State control everything so that we can move towards the last stage of a socialist State.  The Government already distribute 66p in every £1&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not believe this Government will be in power for very much longer.  There is private money available for investment in joint ventures with the Government, but daily we hear this Government say they do not have the money to do this or that.  Why not let private investment in?  Because of an ideological hangup; Fine Gael are prepared to sit back and let the economy sink deeper and deeper into the rut.  Let us know if those who are deciding our energy policies accept that there is place for private investment here.  If we will continue to be subjected to this display of arrogance by this Government who say they know the best way to do everything. If they do, they have not done anything in the last three years, and they are unlikely to make any changes in that direction in the few months left to them. This is a terrible indictment of this Government.</P>
      <P>The national grid was built before this Government took office and not even a spur has been put on since.  The Coalition let an agreement between the British and Irish Governments slip away.  This would have benefited the economy and the hard pressed taxpayers to the tune of £500 million to £600 million over 20 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the truth hurts, but I am speaking from experience.  Can the Minister with responsibility in this area to contradict anything I have said here this evening?  We are still waiting for a gas extension from the outer ring of Dublin to Dundalk and Drogheda.  There is a deposit of £5 million sterling in the kitty which the British Government lost on the deal which this Government let slip from their grasp.  The cost of that pipeline in 1982 was between £13 million and £14 million and there are 23 million ECUs in Brussels for gas development, but for three years this Government have done nothing about it.  If it lies there much longer I would not blame the people in Brussels if they redirected it elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the record of inactivity and inaction of this Government.  There is no logical explanation for any of the things I mentioned here tonight, and I look forward to the Minister for Energy telling me how much additional taxpayers' money he paid to the banks on behalf of Bula Mines, where he got it, and why we were not told about it in this House when the Estimates were going through, where we stand in relation to the receiver, representing 49 per cent of the shareholding, where he sees Bula getting all this financial help and backing that they could not get only two months ago to take on their obligations in relation to the three blocks they had and why a block of the four they got was one of the most sought after blocks which the Minister gave to a company who were not in a position to meet their financial commitments.  That <Col N="837" /> demands more than a glib explanation. It demands a logical explanation on behalf of the people and on behalf of the good name of Ireland at home and abroad.</P>

      <P>My colleague, the Minister for Energy, will deal in detail with Deputy Reynolds charges in relation to oil and gas and in relation to the Tara &mdash; Bula question.</P>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>

      <P>&ldquo;endorses the actions of the Government in the implementation of its policies for the development and exploitation of the country's natural resources.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>In relation to fisheries, since assuming office we have succeeded in finalising the common fisheries policy and we dealt with the expansion of the EC, specifically the addition of Spain and Portugal.  We succeeded in retaining for ten years the Irish box and up to the year 2001 certain restrictions and limitations will apply on the Spanish and Portuguese fishing efforts.  In relation to the fishing industry, we provided for them an aid package which has been very successful despite the prophets of doom who decried what it contained at the time.  About 200 skippers have availed of this package.  The result is that a vast amount of arrears have been reduced.</P>
      <P>In relation to marketing, we have substantially increased financial resources to BIM for the current year and the results are showing.  We have in place export credit facilities for the export of fish and the White Paper on the fishing industry is now being completed and hopefully will be published before the end of the year.  That is a pen picture of the major steps forward in relation to the fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="838" /> In the strict sense, forestry would not be regarded as a natural resource because our forests have been planted but in the broad sense it can be accepted as a natural resource.  The objective in this area is the exploitation of the resources and the maximisation of the benefits to this State on behalf of the people who have invested in that resource, namely, the taxpayers. I initiated a study into forestry.  Last November I set up a review group to look into the area of administering this asset to see what changes might be recommended. That review group are about to report.  Government support for the forestry programme goes on apace.  In 1984 we planted 7,400 hectares.  Together with that, roughly 450 hectares were planted in the private sector.  There is every indication that the take-off of large investment in the private sector is now imminent.  In 1985 we will be extracting roughly 600,000 cubic metres of saw log together with roughly 250,000 metres of pulp wood.  The saw milling industry which was set up with the assistance of taxpayers' money through IDA grants now produces 35 per cent of domestic sawn white wood.  To put this in context, only five years ago only 15 per cent of the domestic sawn white wood market was being satisfied by home grown timber.</P>
    <P>In relation to private forestry the Department are open to suggestions.  A while ago Deputy Reynolds made the point that we were not asking the private sector to provide money for investment in all sorts of ventures.  Both the Department and the Government are prepared to look at investment by the private sector in forestry.  I do not wish that to be interpreted that I am proposing to sell off every State forest as I was accused of doing when an official of a certain bank mentioned that he had at his disposal funds which could be used to purchase part of the forest asset.  My response to that proposal was that it was worth examining and that if certain conditions were met I would give it serious consideration. The obvious condition is that the taxpayers' return would be adequate and that the product would be used ultimately for the benefit of the taxpayer.  There are <Col N="839" /> other conditions but those are the major ones.</P>
    <P>In relation to agriculture we have made enormous strides in recent times.  The amount of revenue accruing to the State from that industry is enormous due to the advances made by many farmers, the vast bulk of whom have been able to avail of new technology.  There are some who have not been in a position or who have been unwilling to avail of advances made and they are falling behind.  We are in a very competitive area and we must consider the most efficient farmers.  There is no room for inefficiency.  We must choose the most efficient farmers and concentrate on their efforts to produce a product for which there is a market.  We have 6.9 million hectares, nearly three million hectares of which are devoted to pasture and 1.2 million to hay and silage.  Because of our climate and because of this fact two of our major industries are the cattle and dairying industries.  They account for £2,855 million worth of exports.  That is 66 per cent of our total intake from agriculture.  We have made enormous strides.  Despite the allegations that this Government have no interest in and no feeling for the individual who is prepared to invest in any industry, all these facts go to show that the country is vibrant and industries are prepared to seek markets and look forward to expansion.  Despite what has been said, I feel that Deputy Reynolds' speech is totally political.</P>

      <P>In the brief time allocated to me I make a special plea to the Minister for Energy concerning the private bog development scheme which is about the only scheme for developing private bogs as the local authorities cannot apply their local improvements funds to bog development. I ask the Minister to consider the submission that is with him for guaranteed loans or an interest subsidy to farmers who have incurred great debts because of the atrocious weather conditions we have had this year.  Normally at this time of year I would ask the Minister to consider including more money in the Estimates for the private bog development schemes.  This year after the bad weather the farmers have lost a great deal <Col N="841" /> of money because they could not carry out the schemes approved by Bord na Móna.  I ask the Minister to respond positively to the submission made to him that these subsidies or interest free loans be made available to people who find themselves in difficulty.</P>
      <P>Regarding bog development, I would like to inquire, as I do usually on energy debates, concerning the ongoing review, as it is described by Bord na Móna, on the Derryfadda bogs.  I cannot understand how a Government, who say that they have a comprehensive energy policy and are exploiting our natural resources look at hundreds of thousands of acres of bog developed in the Galway-Roscommon area and have not as yet given approval to continue with the building of the briquette factory.  In 1976 we in that area hoped that the milled peat would be used in the power station and a great fear when the power station was rejected was that all of this milled peat would be shipped to Shannonbridge or one of the other ESB stations.  It is ironic that this year, 1985, what we feared then is now taking place but for a different reason.  Because of the shortage of milled peat the proposal now is to transfer and transport this milled peat to the ESB stations in the midlands.  In 1977, after a deputation to the incoming Fianna Fáil Government, approval was given for a briquette factory in this area.  Unfortunately it has not been built.</P>
      <P>On 13 December last year Deputy Reynolds and I had a question down to the Minister for Energy concerning the review that was going on at the time.  We were told that it was to be reconsidered in May 1985.  In the light of the market situation at the time I would like to quote from the reply we received.  The Minister said and I quote from the Official Report, column 2826, volume 354:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have asked the board to keep me informed of the state of the peat market in the intervening heating season.  The deferral of the project had inevitably affected employment levels in Derryfadda and there have been redundancies.  Bord na Móna have <Col N="842" /> made every effort to minimise the job losses and wherever possible have relocated workers at their other works in the area.</P>
    <P>The job losses referred to the laying off of 100 people, an unfair way to deal with a review as carried out by Bord na Móna. We would like to know now when this review will be completed.  It has been going on since May 1985, and since the project was sanctioned in 1979 it is time a decision was made.</P>
    <P>On the question of layoffs let me welcome the fact that Bord na Móna decided not to lay off workers.  That was a major concern of all Deputies and I hope the decision will carry through into 1986.  In the Galway-Roscommon area £20 million is committed to the project.  The local authorities in Galway and Roscommon have carried out water schemes and provided roads and other services, and now continuing delays are adding to the cost of this project.  I would like to impress upon the Minister &mdash; though I am sure I do not have to do so &mdash; that a briquette factory is the most suitable means of utilising the production of the boglands in these areas.  Now that the bogs are almost fully developed and the factory programme has reached the stage where tenders have been sought for the civil works, I ask the Minister to continue with the approval for the building of this factory. I ask him to inquire again concerning the possibility of EC funds for it.  We understand that EC regulations provide for help towards the exploitation of peat resources and the processing of peat for briquettes.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few words on what I see as the complacency &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash; of this Government as regards energy supplies.  When Deputies on this side put down questions about alternative energy options we are told for instance, that short rotation forestry is not successful.  I see no commitment to that project or to other alternative energy <Col N="843" /> areas.  I impress upon the Government the necessity for planning, research and development in these areas, particularly with the timber industry.  We heard the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry dealing with some of those matters in the House but the papers that have been produced by people in the Agricultural Institute have shown very clearly that in small industry particularly timber could be used as a fuel which would help that industry if they had the technology to use it.  It is a renewable source of energy and is also a non-polluting source of energy.  I am very pleased that a Galway company, Tuam Engineering, provided the generator for the windpowered turbine at Kinsealy. This has great potential for the horticulture industry as was the case also in Corca Dhuibhne where the Tánaiste performed the opening ceremony.</P>

      <P>That type of project, especially the one at Kinsealy, has great potential in terms of the export market. I understand that in 1984 Denmark exported wind turbines to the US to the value of about 90 million US dollars. There is Danish technology at Kinsealy and I should like to see the Department becoming more involved in that area. They are a little complacent about alternative energy.  Perhaps they are lulling us into a sense of false security.  More money should be spent on research and development in this area.</P>

      <P>I am delighted that this debate is taking place because industrialisation on the basis of our natural resources is the cornerstone of the economic policy that The Workers' Party have been promoting for more than a decade. I am very pleased that recently the IDA understood the importance of this development and now have a special section dealing with the matter of natural resources and with the development of industries based on natural resources. <Col N="844" /> The investment in such industries is very welcome.</P>
      <P>I do not know whether the Government have yet realised the importance of the wealth creating potential of this type of development.  By all means we should encourage foreign industrialists to set up here and in that way to provide extra jobs, but these industries are not as wealth creating for the economy as are industries based on our natural resources.</P>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry does not regard forestry as a natural resource.  What else is it?  The Minister seems to have the impression that our natural resources are represented merely by our mineral wealth and probably by oil.  Forestry is a natural resource that is renewable.  The State is renewing our forestry resources but private individuals and companies should be encouraged also to become involved in this area.  Forestry could also be a source of great industrial development but our forestry, as in the case of so many other areas, has not been the source of job creation and wealth that it might have been.  It must be taken out of the hands of civil servants and there must be no holding back in terms of its development.</P>
      <P>Bord na Móna who did such a tremendous job in developing one natural resource should be given responsibility for marketing and developing our forestry especially since peat resources are being depleted and may not last for more than another 20 years.  The Sugar Company and the ESB are also examples of how natural resources can be harnessed and developed into major industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to 30 years ago we were taught that we had no mineral resources but then minerals were discovered.  Attempts had been made during the past couple of hundred years to find minerals but it was always thought to be the case that they did not exist.  Now we find that they are in great abundance in the Meath area but we are not using them to the extent that we should be exploiting them in terms of industrial development and job creation. Between 300,000 and 350,000 tons of ore are being taken from the country each year from the Tara mine alone and now <Col N="845" /> we are telling Tara to take over Bula and to adopt the same procedure there.  This will result in nothing being left behind as was the case at Tynagh.</P>
    <P>A number of years have passed since the carrying out of a feasibility study into the provision of a smelter in the Ballylongford area.  That survey was conducted by a multinational company but the Government should now carry out their own feasibility study with a view to providing a smelter for the minerals taken from Tara and Bula.  Immediately, the Government should review the lease on Tara in order to ensure that the royalties are paid on the tonnage extracted rather than by way of the present system whereby royalties are paid only on profits which are proved by way of corporation tax.</P>
    <P>Clever accounting can avoid that. Therefore, in the context of the Bula deal the Government should force Tara to accept a renegotiation of the lease and to pay royalties on extraction.</P>

      <P>If I had more than five minutes I would share my time with Deputy O'Malley but that is not the case. I asked for the opportunity to speak briefly under a couple of main headings in this debate.</P>
      <P>The main question for us in the constituency of Louth is the natural gas pipeline. It appears that there is a certain amount of confusion in this respect so perhaps when replying the Minister will clarify the matter.  In the course of visits to the constituency, one or two Ministers indicated that the gas pipeline would go ahead.  Unless the gas pipeline is extended from Dublin to the Border, Louth and the Border area generally will suffer greatly.</P>
      <P>I think it would be accepted by the House that Louth is probably the most industrialised county in the Border region but it suffers severely from adverse Border trade and the exchange rate.  If we are to compete and to secure replacement industries for those which we have lost it is absolutely essential that this decision be taken.  As a member of the Labour Party and speaking as a Labour Deputy in the constituency, I ask the Minister, as a colleague and as the Minister responsible, to use his good offices to have this decision taken speedily so that we can make up for the time we have lost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I am making a special appeal to the Minister.  There is one company in the town of Drogheda that would use more natural gas than the whole of Dublin city.  It does not make sense to have a gas pipeline within 26 miles of that town, with a further 20 miles to Dundalk, without these towns being included.  One must take into account that the Morecambe Bay field on the British coast is about 60 miles from Dundalk as the crow flies.  In the event of no further gas being discovered on our west or east coasts, it would make sense simply to extend the <Col N="848" /> gas pipeline from Britain to Dundalk and reverse the procedure so as to ensure the extension of the supply of gas to industry in the Border area.</P>
      <P>I also remind the Minister that we have a very large fishing fleet in the constituency of Louth and that this is an area that has been badly neglected.  The pier is virtually falling into Clogherhead harbour and the 35 boats from there have to dock in Drogheda, Mornington, Skerries and Howth because of the condition of the harbour.  I ask the Minister to take note of those two main issues affecting the constituency of Louth.  I hope in the next debate to get more than five minutes to contribute.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>In my opening remarks I would like to reply to the Opposition speakers and first to make a few general points.  I hope to deal with the points raised by my erstwhile adversary across the floor, Deputy Reynolds.</P>
      <P>First, I should like to state that this Government are fully committed to the comprehensive and orderly development of our natural resources both on land and sea.  If you look at the area of energy policy, the fundamentals of that policy are that the Irish people are the owners of whatever oil or gas exist off our shores and of most of the land-based minerals. Any natural resources policy must recognise that fact and the objective must be to facilitate the exploration and search for these natural resources while, at the same time, ensuring a fair return for the people as the owners and also a reasonable award to the lessees who are entrusted with the development of the resources.  I do not believe, however, that this has been particularly a philosophy of Fianna Fáil over the years.  They appear to favour the easy option, to belong to the &ldquo;Let us give away our resources&rdquo; school of thought.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I can accept that &mdash; and for Deputy Reynolds in particular &mdash; in <Col N="849" /> that it can be popular in certain business circles.  It may be in the shorter term, but I suggest that in the long term and over the long haul it is disastrous both for companies and for the Irish people who are the owners of the resources.</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly not one in the area of resources policy.  Changes made by the previous Coalition in the mid-seventies, both in relation to mining and petroleum offshore, have provided a stable framework for development and exploration.  The Fianna Fáil attitude always has been &mdash; and we have seen more of it here tonight &mdash; to bend and wilt to the passing pressures of the day. What the Government are providing and what is in the long term intersts of companies engaging in exploration is a fair regime governing tax, royalties and safe participation.  Terms that are over-generous to the companies cannot last &mdash; public opinion rightly would not allow that &mdash; while a framework that is over-harsh will not ensure adequate exploration or development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should also pay careful attention to the idea of using our natural resources for development, that is, of selling them cheaply to aid industry and so on.  This should not be the norm of policy.  For example, in the case of natural gas it would mean that the Exchequer obtains less revenue and the Irish people therefore a lower reward than if the full market price were charged.  It may be desirable in certain circumstances to forego revenue for a wide policy aim or where premium markets for natural gas are being built <Col N="850" /> up, but we must remember that often demands for cheap gas are, in fact, demands for more subsidies of one sort or another and we should evaluate them on that basis.</P>
    <P>In relation to oil exploration generally, Government policy was spelt out clearly in April 1975, with the publication of the terms to be applied to exploration licences to be issued under Ireland's first and subsequent licensing rounds.  These terms took full account of the need to achieve a broad national interest objective. They also recognised the potential of our offshore areas as a source of energy resource which could, if properly exploited, make a very valuable contribution towards meeting the energy needs of the economy which even now is overdependent on imported oil.</P>
    <P>They also took into account the distinctive characteristics of the oil exploration industry.  These were a vastness of scale of operations involving initial large scale expenditure on exploration with a corresponding expectation of <i>pro rata</i> large scale returns from development; the costly and specialised technology constantly being adapted to the changing needs of new operational areas; also, the volatility of the industry to the exploration and exploitation stages; also, the fast pace of development necessitating some measures of flexibility on the part of the State to take account of short term considerations while ensuring that the policy reflected long term national needs and avoided any element of indiscriminate exploitation; also, the fact that any hydrocarbons discovered were essentially a finite resource.</P>
    <P>Finally, it was recognised even then, despite the general air of optimism which prevailed, that there could be no certainty that significant commercial deposits of petroleum would be discovered and, even if these were found, that they could either be quite limited deposits or prove to be such as to represent a considerable surplus over and above conceivable national usage.  The terms provided for a fair return on effort and investment on the part of licencees <Col N="851" /> and set maximum limits for State royalties and State participation, with provision for reductions in these areas when this was necessary to ensure a fair return for investors.</P>
    <P>Ministers have repeatedly stressed that the flexibility provided for in the terms would undoubtedly be exercised where necessary in the case of marginal fields. Where the oil industry sought more specific assurances earlier this year we responded by producing a formula for reliefs in the case of marginal fields which in general was well received by the industry.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Since 1975, licensing terms have stood the test of time and have been used by successive Governments as the basis for offshore exploration.  That our licensing terms are not as unattractive to the oil exploration companies as some would have us believe is borne out by the fact that since licences were first issued subject to those terms almost £400 million has been spent by those companies on drilling activities.  The vast amount of knowledge and data relative to our offshore has been provided to my Department at no cost to the State as a result of the companies' exploration efforts.  Including the well currently being drilled, a total of 89 wells have been drilled offshore to date, apart from onshore wells.  Next year at least ten wells will be drilled, which is the highest number since 1978.  The data relating to those wells and all the related seismic data supplied to my Department free of cost are the basic elements in the large data bank to which I have already referred.  While individual companies hold particular sets of data, the Department of Energy are the only organisation in possession of all the data, seismic, geological and geophysical, which have so far emerged from the exploration of offshore Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In many instances this gives us considerable strength in our negotiations with the oil companies and enables us <Col N="852" /> from time to time, technically and within the limits of commercial confidentiality &mdash; which is a matter of paramount importance to the industry &mdash; to be of great assistance to them in their assessment of acreage.  These are all parts of the national interest objective which I and the Government continue successfully to pursue.</P>
    <P>In relation to the third licensing round, the suggestion has been put forward by Deputy Reynolds that because only 15 out of 77 blocks have been allocated the third round has not been a success.  Of course Deputy Reynolds seems to have forgotten the history of past licensing rounds and the success or otherwise of the third round or any round should not be measured by the proportion of blocks on offer that were licensed.  This falls into the error of assuming that every square on the map has the same potential.  This is not so and it was recognised when the 77 blocks were offered that many were likely to be of little or no interest.  The success of a round depends only on whether it leads to a continuing satisfactory level and quality of exploration over the blocks on offer, satisfaction being measured in terms of what is considered to be appropriate and necessary to see the area fully explored.  The facts will substantiate that the third round was a success.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Nobody but the Minister believes that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>This might hurt the Deputy but he will have to listen to it. First it resulted in about 6,500 kilometres of seismic data being made available to the Department and to the industry. Prior to the round there was only a superficial knowledge of many of the blocks on offer in the round.  Secondly, of the blocks considered by my Department to be of significant prospectivity and therefore worthy of licensing with drilling commitments, well over half have been licensed.  Once the seismic referred to above had been acquired it was possible to determine which blocks were significantly prospective and there were 29 <Col N="853" /> in that category.  Of these there are six blocks which for good technical reasons were not attractive to exploration companies at that time.  There are three which could be licensed but for the delimitation dispute with Britain.  Of the remaining 20 blocks, 15 are licensed.  My Department are at present making preparations to promote the remaining blocks.  Thirdly, the level of work commitments for the 15 blocks is the maximum that could be achieved at this time and a large amount of seismic is committed.  The fact that ten wells will be explored next year is very satisfactory.</P>
      <P>In relation to the question of mining, which seems to be of interest to Deputy Reynolds&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister give four to Bula?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I will tell the Deputy if he will wait a minute.  I should like to talk about the question of mining because time seems to be of the essence here. Government policy is to secure continued investigation of the country's mineral potential, the development of identified economic ore bodies and their exploitation on terms that provide a fair return to the State.  Steps were taken in the early seventies to ensure an equitable return to the State from the exploitation of mineral resources.  In 1974 the 20-year tax holiday introduced by Fianna Fáil was ended. About the same time the State established for the first time its right where it was deemed appropriate to take a participating interest in mine development through the securing of a State shareholding in the Navan ore body.  This right was firmly enshrined in the Minerals (Development) Act, 1979.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been a fall off in investment in recent years which is reflected in the minerals industry worldwide.  However, against the background of the current worldwide economic situation mineral exploration here is still being maintained at a reasonably satisfactory level.  New sources of investment continue to be attracted.  This arises because companies realise that in Ireland they have a well <Col N="854" /> developed physical infrastructure and a network of services and can explore for and develop minerals within a relatively simple but effective legal and administrative framework.  There is a stable political climate and the assurance that, in the event of a discovery, they will receive a fair and reasonable return on their investment.</P>
    <P>I should reply to Deputy Reynolds who in the course of his contribution made allegations both in relation to the third licensing round and in relation to negotiations which have been conducted in my Department.  He implied that the negotiations were on the basis of either political or ideological favouring.  This was an interesting remark from Deputy Reynolds but one which I will certainly refute either inside this House or outside. If the Deputy wished to make the remark outside he would find himself in a hell of a lot of trouble.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">

      <P>I approached the question of the difficulties in the Navan orebody as somebody with no preconvictions and a totally open mind in my efforts to bring about a solution which would be best for the development of minerals here.  I have approached the mining problem in a totally honourable manner and I totally refute the allegation by Deputy Reynolds that a comfort was given to either party.  I challenge him to say it outside the House.</P>

      <P>No comfort has been given and there was no holding of the receiver. Anything that was done was in an effort to bring a conclusion to a sad saga in the development of minerals in this country. Deputy Reynolds is as aware of that as anybody in this House.  Anything that has been done has been with a view to bringing about the development of all the ore body in the Navan area.  I would ask <Col N="855" /> Deputy Reynolds to withdraw his remark in this House that there have been either political or ideological considerations in my handling or my Department's handling of the mining situation during the past 12 months.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset of the Minister's contribution he claimed to be committed to the development of our natural resources.  The difficulty with this Government is that they claim to be committed to everything but are achieving very little, if anything.  That was clearly demonstrated by the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry in his contribution which was a lamentable performance, a hopeless response to the critical situation which faces him in relation to the development of two major national resources, forestry and fisheries.</P>
      <P>I support the motion fully condemning the Government for their failure to implement comprehensive policies for the development of our natural resources.  Many of the problems currently affecting the development of marine resources and marine-related industries can be attributed to an absence of policy, fragmented administrative structures and the overlapping of financial and human resources.  At the same time we have a lack of investment of research and development in the marine sector.</P>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil have recognised for some time that the sea represents a national resource with a huge developmental potential which as yet has only been partially released.  Last March our leader, Deputy Haughey, announced that the next Fianna Fáil Government will establish a marine Department to exploit fully the potential of our marine resources.  We have spelled that out very clearly in a documented policy outlining the position the next Fianna Fáil Government will adopt in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="857" /> This contrasts starkely with the performance we have seen, particularly in relation to the development of our fishing industry.  There is a totally depressing atmosphere in that industry.  Fishermen are in severe financial difficulties with arrears mounting daily.  Boats are being repossessed weekly.  Our infrastructure is completely undeveloped and many of our harbours and landing places throughout the country are in a state of dereliction. Some of them are even dangerous.  One collapsed in my constituency last year.</P>
    <P>The entire fisheries policy being pursued by the Minister is inadequate for needed development.  Fish quotas are inadequate to meet the needs of fishermen. With the accession of Spain to the EC, fishermen's livelihoods are in jeopardy and many jobs in the industry have been put at risk because of the failure of the Government successfully to negotiate higher quotas, particularly for herring and mackerel.  Thousands of jobs are at risk in the fish processing industry.  I suggest that the Minister has abdicated his responsibility totally in regard to fish quotas.  We have a lack of research and development throughout the entire field of fisheries and the aqua-marine sectors of our economy.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been proclaiming for some time that the sea as a national resource has a huge potential.  Last March Deputy Haughey announced that the next Fianna Fáil Government will establish a marine Department to be known as Roinn na Mara to exploit the potential of our marine resources.  We have set out in great detail the policy Fianna Fáil will adopt in this respect.  It contrasts very sharply with the policy we have seen in this area.</P>
    <P>Policies set down by successive Governments for fishery development have not been implemented.  The forest planning programme is in decline.  Targets have not been reached and, as the Minister said tonight, we planted only 7,000 hectares last year though the target was 10,000 hectares.  Our land reserves for forestry have been depleted by the Government.  We have had the Minister here and outside speaking about the need <Col N="858" /> for development of our forests, but the review body which he set up and which were due to report last June still have not issued a report.  The Government do not appear to be able to make decisions about what the mechanism will be for future development of this resource.</P>
    <P>We are importing timber annually to the value of between £5 billion and £6 billion, 90 per cent of which could be grown successfully at home.  Small sawmills throughout the country are working at half their capacity and jobs have been lost in old established mills like Kilrush and Mountrath.  This has happened because the Government will not provide timber.  Worse still, we had the Minister's proposal to sell off State forests to private financial and banking institutions.  He is not sufficiently interested to keep up timber supplies that would maintain employment in this sector.</P>
    <P>We on this side are deeply committed to the development of these resources.  It has become necessary to establish a State body, similar to Bord na Móna, to exploit the potential of our forests to ensure that we will at least be in a position to meet our own needs in regard to timber.  We have spoken of the job potential in timber.  We are sick and tired of Minister after Minister telling us that they are committed to this, that and the other but we never see action from them.  The time for commitment is over.  The time for action is now.</P>
    <P>In regard to fisheries again, we saw massive dumping of lead on the oyster beds in Galway under Government licence, and similar damage being done to the Cork oyster beds by the pumping into them of raw sewage.  These two enterprises were earning more than £5 million annually.</P>
    <P>Deputy Faulkner spoke of the need to supply Drogheda with natural gas.  We support that call fully and we have spoken of it on numerous occasions.  Earlier in the month, Deputy Faulkner tabled a question on this subject.  It is not good enough to say that feasibility studies will be carried out.  I urge the Tánaiste to go ahead with this gas extension to Drogheda and to other urban areas <Col N="859" /> throughout the country.  The Shannon Industrial Estate are crying out for a supply of natural gas.</P>
    <P>It is time for the Government to come out of the dark in this respect.  Infrastructures should be created whereby jobs will be provided.  We have seen only failure from the Government in all areas of national endeavour.  They have failed to exploit our natural resources.  They have <Col N="860" /> failed to manage the country's finances. They have failed to deal with even the most pressing of our economic problems. It is no wonder Fine Gael are in total disarray.  There is only one honourable course for this Government and that is to call a general election and let the people decide their future.  I have no doubt about the answer they will get.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Birmingham Bombings.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="DavidAndrews" hpid="Mr. D. Andrews Mr. D. Andrews">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>In the time available to me I hope I will not diminish my case. I should like once more to condemn the atrocities which were committed in the name of some strange philosophy in Birmingham in 1974 in which 21 people died and over 160 were injured.  However, I should like to raise three issues in the short time available.  First, the Birmingham bombings in 1974.  The second is a matter which I have already raised in this forum, the Annie Maguire case.  I am glad to say that she will be visiting the Dáil around 18 November and I know that an all party committee will be there to greet her and to listen to her.  The third point I wish to make deals with the allegations made by Father Denis Faul, that courageous priest from Dungannon, about the treatment he and a number of fellow clerics received from an Irish official in Washington in late 1974.</P>
      <P>When I raised the case of Annie Maguire previously, the Minister gave a rather soothing undertaking that he would do something about it <i>vis-à-vis</i> the embassy in London or by whichever route he intended taking.  Unfortunately, the Annie Maguire case is further than ever down the road.  In relation to the Birmingham Six, the Minister has already said that he contacted the British Government, and I quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of today.</P>
      <P>A Foreign Affairs spokesman confirmed last night that on Mr. Barry's instructions the Irish embassy in London had contacted the British authorities &ldquo;regarding the position&rdquo; of the convicted men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that is not good enough.  I think that this and the Annie Maguire case deserve to be dealt with at a higher level. <Col N="863" /> I say this with no disrespect to those whom the Minister instructed to trot along to the British Home Office to raise the issue there.  The British will only listen when the people concerned are at ministerial level or at the level of Prime Minister or Taoiseach in this case.  Instead of having one of his officials call to the British Home Office the Minister should ask the Irish Ambassador in London to invite the British Home Secretary to meet with the Minister to discuss the matter.  It is as important as that.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme was recorded some evenings ago on British television.  Fair play to the British: they are not afraid of self-exposure in that regard.  There is no doubt that the six individuals received beatings from the police and confessions were forced out of them.  As in the Annie Maguire case, the forensic evidence was flawed.  The IRA, for what that is worth, suggested they were not members of their organisation and the people concerned have protested that they are not members of the IRA. As was revealed in that programme, they have consistently pleaded their innocence. I ask the Minister to take up this case and the Annie Maguire case with the Home Secretary, Mr. Douglas Hurd. That is needed.</P>
    <P>In addition to the television programme one of the leading articles in <i>The Guardian</i> of today's date has the following heading, &ldquo;Six beaten Irishmen&rdquo;. This leading article is most fair-minded. It condemns, as I have done, the atrocity in 1974 of two bombings in Birmingham that were committed in the name of some perverted philosophy.  The article makes the following comment:</P>
    <P>Though it is undisputed that the men were beaten up, nobody has ever been convicted of the crime.  And when the six tried to sue the police for assault, Lord Denning &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash;&mdash; that legal luminary &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>&mdash; dismissed the move on the basis that their success would open up an <Col N="864" />&ldquo;appalling vista&rdquo; of wrongful conviction.</P>
    <P>The article suggests they were beaten up but the second and most damning point in the leading article is with regard to the forensic test and how flawed it was in this instance.</P>
    <P>In the light of these revelations the Minister should act himself in the matter. It is not good enough in this or the Annie Maguire case to leave it at diplomatic or official Civil Service level.  This is not a matter for the bureaucrats: it is a matter for this House.  For the time being the Minister represents us and he has an obligation to represent the country.  I have been in the Department of Foreign Affairs and I have never found them wanting in the service of the State.  This is no criticism of the officials, but I am saying that the Minister has an obligation to represent us himself in direct discussions with the British Home Secretary, Mr. Hurd.</P>
    <P>A former British Home Secretary has indicated his disquiet and concern at what has happened.  It is suggested that Mr. Jenkins, a former British Home Secretary, backs a new lobby on the bombing verdict.  Another friend of Ireland, a British Conservative MP and a man whom I know relatively well, has also indicated his concern about what has happened which was brought to attention in the television programme.  Formerly John Farr, he is now Sir John Farr.</P>
    <P>Before I conclude I should like to refer to Father Faul.  I ask the Minister to deal with the Birmingham bombings case and also the Annie Maguire case.  In addition, will he explain why an Irish official hampered the campaign for the Birmingham Six when Father Faul visited Washington in late 1979.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not diminished my case by the rather rushed fashion in which I had to present it.  This was due to the short time available to me.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Deputy is referring to when he said that Father Faul was hampered in 1979 by, I <Col N="865" /> presume, an official of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  I was not Minister then.  If he had asked to raise that matter on the Adjournment I would have had some information on it but I am afraid that I have no such information.</P>
      <P>With regard to the Annie Maguire case, I share the concern of the Deputy in this matter.  I told the House on a previous occasion what I have done about it.  I intend to continue on that road.</P>
      <P>Tonight I shall talk about the Birmingham Six, as they are known.  The Deputy should not be under any misapprehension. The Department of Foreign Affairs do not have a separate existence from that of the Minister.  When an official makes a case he does not do so in his own right but on behalf of the Minister, the Government and this House and it is treated as seriously as that.  If an official of the British Embassy here makes a case on behalf of his Government he is taken seriously.  There is no question of our saying to him that he is unworthy to make representations on behalf of his Government.  We would not say that we wanted Mr. Hurd or somebody else to come over and make the case personally.  It is a nonsensical suggestion by Deputy Andrews and I am surprised he made it.</P>
      <P>I am glad to have this opportunity on the Adjournment to reply to the Deputy's statement on the case of the Birmingham bombings.  I appreciate the Deputy's unease about this case which has been the subject of renewed attention both in Britain and Ireland since the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme shown on ITV television on Monday evening.  That programme has prompted demands for a referral of the case to the Appeal Court in Britain and for the exoneration of those convicted.  The case has been the subject of previous approaches by the Government to the British authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 6 June last, I informed the House that I fully appreciated the concern expressed about the convictions of the Birmingham Six.  I said then that the decision about whether there was a basis for a retrial was a matter for the British Home Secretary.  I said I was aware that <Col N="866" /> such decisions were taken by the British Home Secretary when significant new evidence became available.  I also said that, if such evidence became available, I would examine it closely with a view to making an appropriate approach to the British authorities.</P>
    <P>I want to repeat what Deputy Andrews said about last Monday's programme which, to my mind, contained new evidence. There were three main areas in which the programme made a significant contribution to our knowledge of this case.  The first is the question of the confessions made and retracted by the six accused; the second is the question of the forensic evidence; and the third is the circumstantial evidence.</P>
    <P>On the question of the confessions, there is evidence that the men were beaten up but it was unclear at the trial where they were beaten up.  The judge said they had been assaulted while in prison and he exonerated the police.  It was clear from the evidence presented last Monday evening that they had sustained these injuries before they went into prison and doubts were cast in the Annie Maguire case and this case about the forensic evidence.  This is another matter for concern which should be reexamined. The third question deals with the circumstantial evidence.  In her evidence in court a barmaid at the railway station said she had recognised two of the men, but in Monday night's programme she said that, because of the nature of the bar in which she was serving, with travellers passing through, it would not be possible for her to be sure she had seen the men in that bar.  The programme also pointed out that there was an element of guilt by association in the evidence presented at the trial and proceeded to challenge this association with subversive groups and other important matters.</P>
    <P>As I said, in my view the evidence presented by the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; programme warranted a new approach to the British authorities.  I instructed an officer of my Department at the embassy in London to make representations about <Col N="867" /> the case on the morning following the programme.  These representations have been made and I am awaiting a response from the British authorities.  I believe that was the correct course of action.</P>

      <P>The Government will honour their commitment in the national plan to publish a national youth policy in 1985.  Because of the wide range of issues covered and the <Col N="694" /> extensive consultations with all interested parties, the formulation of a comprehensive youth policy has taken some time to complete.  The exercise involved initially preparation and publication of a discussion document which was followed by the establishment of a national youth policy committee.</P>
      <P>The work of the committee extended over a period of a year and the publication of the committee's report was followed by the submission of views from all interested parties on the recommendations of the committee and debates in both Houses of the Oireachtas on the report.  The purpose of all these consultations has been to prepare a policy based on the findings of the report which would reflect the largest possible degree of consensus. Finally, of course, consideration of the draft policy by the Government is necessary and that consideration will be completed very shortly.</P>

      <P>It has been represented to me by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions that the practice referred to has been followed by certain employers.  It will be appreciated that I have no power to compel employers to employ persons for any particular minimum number of working hours.  The number of hours to be worked is a matter for negotiation between the employer and employee in each particular case.  I <Col N="695" /> can say though that I deprecate the actions of those employers, not only in the contract cleaning industry, but also in other industries and services, who reduce the working hours of their employees for the specific purpose of depriving the employees of the benefits of various workers protection Acts administered by my Department.</P>
      <P>I am very much aware of the problems of all part time workers.  The House will be aware that last year I introduced legislation which reduced to 18 hours a week the minimum number of hours which part time workers had to work to be eligible for protection under the Unfair Dismissals Act, the Redundancy Payments Acts and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act.</P>
      <P>In regard to contract cleaing employees in particular, the Deputy is, no doubt, aware that the Labour Court, in exercise of its powers under the Industrial Relations Acts, last year established a joint labour committee to deal with conditions of employment of workers engaged in contract cleaning work in Dublin city and county.  Earlier this year the Labour Court made an employment regulation order, on foot of proposals from the joint labour committee prescribing minimum wages and entitlements for such employees.  I should mention that such Labour Court orders are not restricted in their application to employees working 18 hours a week but can apply to those working 17 hours or less.  I understand that the present employment regulation order will be reviewed in due course.</P>
      <P>I have recently received a study sponsored by the Employment Equality Agency relating to the working conditions of part time cleaners, which is being considered at present in my Department.</P>

      <P>I am taking it that the Deputy's reference to the special employers' incentive scheme refers to the employment incentive scheme and the training grants scheme is taken to refer to the work experience programme.</P>
      <P>Information on these two schemes is as follows:</P>
      <P>Employment Incentive Scheme</P>
      <P>Annual recruitment under the employment incentive scheme is running at a rate of 7,500 with about 6,000 employers participating in the scheme per annum.</P>
      <P>Work Experience Programme</P>
      <P>Throughput on the work experience programme in 1985 will be about 8,800 young persons with approximately 4,700 employers participating.</P>
      <P>The Department are not aware of the turnover of employers within the various companies throughout the country.  A major research programme would be necessary to ascertain this figure.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that both schemes are fulfilling their objectives.  In fact, the annual limit of two recruitments per employer qualifying under the employment incentive scheme is being increased to four.</P>

      <P>In the training of staff in the National Manpower Service, special emphasis is given to the need for tact and sensitivity in dealing with members of the public. This is considered especially important as many users of the Manpower Service are suffering from the trauma of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I am at present taking steps for comprehensive advertising and publicity including the design of new brochures etc. which will give an overall picture of the options open to the unemployed with particular reference to the long term unemployed and first time job seekers.

I expect, however, that all these offices will be fully computerised by the end of this year and the system will be extended to the remaining offices in the east region during 1986.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>My Department is making every effort to determine the amount payable to the occupational pension scheme of Castle Brand Ltd. under the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984.  Unfortunately, a number of legal and other problems, some complex, have arisen and the position has been made more difficult because of basic deficiencies in the occupational pension scheme itself.</P>
      <P>The trustees of the occupational pension scheme in Castle Brand Ltd. submitted a claim through the liquidator of the company, for payment of outstanding pension contributions which remained unpaid when the company went into liquidation in August 1984.  Under the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, the amount payable from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund is:</P>
      <P>(a)  the total sum of employees' contributions which were deducted from the pay of the employees concerned in the year prior to the date of insolvency and which were not paid into the assets of the pension scheme, plus</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="699" /> (b)  the lesser of the following amounts: (i) the employer's element of the pension contributions in respect of the year prior to the date of insolvency which remains unpaid, and (ii) the amount certified by an actuary to be necessary to meet the liability of the pension scheme on dissolution.</P>
    <P>When my Department examined the claim, it was found that no final trust deed or rules constituting a definitive scheme which would have made provision for the contributions payable by the employer and employees was ever completed.  The major problem has been to determine for the purposes of the Act the actual rate of contributions falling to be paid into the pension scheme for the period of 12 months prior to the date of insolvency of the company in August 1984.</P>
    <P>In order to try to reach a solution of the whole matter, my Department has sought legal advice on the problems which have arisen in dealing with the application of the Act to the Castle Brand case.  I am hopeful that, in the light of legal advice, it will be possible to find a framework which will enable my Department to establish the factual information necessary in order to pay the trustees of the pension scheme the entitlements under the provisions of the Act.  At this stage, I am not in a position to indicate when the matter will be resolved but I hope that a solution will not be too long delayed.  I also understand that the High Court has listed for hearing on 4 November next a notice of motion by solicitors for the liquidator of the company, the outcome of which may affect a decision on the pension application being considered by my Department.</P>

The survey is carried out in May-June of each year and it examines the career paths of second level school leavers from the previous academic year.  The time lapse allows a more settled picture to emerge in relation to school leavers entering into the labour market or continuing in further education. Therefore, the information which the Deputy is seeking in relation to school leavers from the 1984-85 academic year will not be available until the findings of next year's survey are published, towards the end of 1986.  The findings of the 1985 survey covering school leavers from the 1983-84 academic year, will be published shortly.</P>

Support is provided from the Department of Labour Vote (Vote 39) subhead U2 &mdash; grant-in-aid fund for youth organisations and other expenditure relating to youth &mdash; for which a sum of £2,950,000 was provided in the 1985 Estimates.  I had previously adverted generally to this support as being available in my announcement of Government support for youth services on 16 May this year.  Support for projects has been allocated as follows:</P>
      <P>Dublin city £227,000, Dublin county £180,500, Dún Laoghaire-Bray £32,500 and other urban areas £160,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept the view expressed by the Deputy which is clearly based on a misapprehension of the Government's role in relation to International Youth Year. The position is that, in accordance with the guidelines of the United Nations which designated 1985 as International Youth Year, the Government established an independent national committee in January 1984 to plan, stimulate, co-ordinate and assist activities for the year.  The committee has, with the generous support and commitment of many voluntary and statutory bodies, facilitated a varied and intensive programme of activities, events and initiatives undertaken by and on behalf of young people for International Youth Year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have strongly supported the national committee for International Youth Year in developing a nationwide programme for the year through the provision of £240,000 in direct financial support and full secretarial and administrative staffing and back-up services.  Furthermore, local <Col N="704" /> groups undertaking projects and initiatives for International Youth Year have received grants exceeding £450,000 in total through the Teamwork youth employment scheme operated by my Department.</P>
    <P>International Youth Year ultimately depends on the support of the community for its success.  It is not sufficient to ask what is being done for International Youth Year.  All who are concerned about the situation of young people should ask what they themselves have done or are doing.  I would urge them to make a special effort in these the closing months of International Youth Year to support all positive activities undertaken for and on behalf of young people.</P>

      <P>The draft Bill to extend the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, and to introduce enabling provisions for the introduction of sub-board structures in State enterprises is being finalised.  My intention is to be in a position to introduce the Bill this session or at least during the Christmas recess.</P>
      <P>I hope to be in a position to introduce a Safety, Health and Welfare (Offshore Installations) Bill during the current session. This Bill will provide measures for the safety, health and welfare of persons on installations concerned with the exploration for minerals in the waters in or surrounding the State and generally for the safety of such installations and the prevention of accidents on or near them.</P>

      <P>There were 73,156 persons under 25 on the live register at the end of September 1985.  The measures to be taken in the next three years to assist employment are as set out in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> and by the Taoiseach in the Dáil last week.  Their implementation falls to a number of Ministers.  Youth will of course benefit from these measures.</P>
      <P>My area of concern is the provision through my Department and its agencies, of employment, training and work experience opportunities.  In all, some 57,000 young persons will benefit from these programmes during 1985.</P>

Payments up to and including 1982 were provided under the town gas subsidy schemes (1975 and 1977).</P>
      <P>This scheme came into effect on 1 July 1975 and took the form of a subsidy which was paid to producers of town gas to enable them to reduce the price of town gas sold to consumers.  The subsidy was no longer payable to the Dublin Gas Company on its receipt of natural gas in 1982 although an amount of £0.46 million has been included in the 1983 figure in respect of payments outstanding.</P>
      <P>Contributions in 1983 and 1984 were mainly by way of rebates off the buy-in price of natural gas to Dublin Gas Company and loans by BGE to the company pursuant to the agreement between the parties in respect of conversion of the distribution system and further development of the gas network in Dublin.</P>

    <P>Note:</P>
    <P>The drop in the average penalty imposed in 1981 arose from a change in the method of calculation of some fines from a system of £20 a day for returns outstanding to a maximum fine of £500 (since increased to £800).  This change was necessary as district justices were then adopting the view that their jurisdiction did not permit them to impose fines at a level consistent with the previous system of calculation.  Instead the justices tended to impose much lower fines, thereby reducing the average penalty as compared with previous years.  The increased penalty of £800 was introduced in the Finance Act, 1982 and is reflected in the averages for 1983 and 1984.</P>

    <P>PAYE was introduced with effect from October 1960.  It applied at that time to all employees except those for whom a statutory tax deduction scheme was already in operation (public servants, officials of Bank of Ireland, etc.).  PAYE was extended to all employees as from the income tax year 1976-77.  For prior years, tax payments in respect of all persons (including public servants) taxed under schedule E have been taken into account.  The average tax payment for each year is obtained by dividing the net receipt of schedule E or PAYE tax, as the case may be, in each calendar year by the number of persons effectively liable to tax in the income tax year in which the calendar year ends, e.g. the 1975 net receipts is divided by the number liable to tax in 1975-76.</P>

    <P>Notes:</P>
    <P>1.  In calculating the figures in column (a) the estimated net receipt from farm taxation in each calendar year has been divided by the number of farmers assessed to tax on their farming profits in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends e.g. the 1979 receipt is divided by the number assessed for the year 1979-80.  This is because revenue receipts are, in general, prepared on a calendar (financial) year basis.</P>
    <P>2.  Full time farmers and farmers who, or whose spouses, carry on another trade or profession have been included in the calculations.</P>
    <P>3.  Income tax on farming profits is collected with schedule D tax generally and because of this it cannot be separately distinguished.  Accordingly the figures shown for tax payments by farmers are estimated.</P>
    <P>4.  The figures contained in column (b) are obtained by dividing the net receipt of income tax from other self-employed persons in each calendar year by the estimated number of those persons assessed to tax in the year of assessment in which the calendar year ends as explained in note 1 above.</P>
    <P>5.  Cases involving income assessable to tax under schedule D which are not strictly self-employed have been identified and excluded as far as possible.  The figures are, therefore, not strictly comparable with the figures for averages given previously in relation to this category.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>The recommendations in the report have been considered.  The Commissioner of Valuations advised that the amendment proposed would be contrary to the fundamental principle underlying the valuation code which is that rateable valuation depends on the letting value of a property and that amendment of the Valuation Acts to render derelict and <Col N="721" /> vacant properties, which have no letting value, liable to rates would not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>The principal public authority agents of urban renewal are the local authorities. The Minister for the Environment has had consideration given to the problem of dereliction and urban decay with a view to reducing the amount of derelict property, particularly in inner urban areas and to improve the appearance of those areas.  Possible solutions to the problem by way of penal rating of property or taxation of derelict sites involve complex issues which still need to be resolved.  The report of the Joint Committee on Building Land also has touched on the question of dereliction and urban decay from the point of view of the supply of land for development and, having regard to the extent of derelict sites in the hands of public authorities, has recommended measures which would have an effect on the market for urban land generally and assist in bringing derelict sites into development.  The recommendations of the committee are being considered. In addition the preparation by the Minister for the Environment of the general scheme of a Bill to consolidate and modernise the powers of local authorities in relation to the acquisition and disposal of land is well advanced; this should considerably improve the capacity of local authorities to deal with derelict sites.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Special arrangements are already in operation to assist the economic development of south-west Kerry.  In addition to the wide range of aids generally available to the designated areas, the special project officer referred to in the question was appointed in October 1981, as an additional assistant county development officer to the Kerry County Development Team and given special responsibility for the south-west of the county.  The county development team have a very broadly defined role in the economic development of their area and, in pursuit of that role, the services of this additional officer are freely available to individuals and organisations in south-west Kerry.  He can assist any of them in seeking support from the appropriate public agencies for worthwhile projects, including projects in tourism, forestry, fishing and agriculture. Moreover, in suitable cases, grants would be available from the western development fund.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am convinced that these arrangements are such that no worthwhile project will fail for lack of resources.  Bodies such as the South-West Kerry Development Organisation have a valued contribution to make to the development of their areas.  They can best make this contribution by collaborating with the promotional and other activities undertaken by the public agencies concerned with development and by availing to the full of <Col N="723" /> the wide range of incentives and services which these agencies administer.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a person must have at least 26 contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.  According to the Department's records there are no contributions paid or credited for the person <Col N="726" /> concerned during the period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governs entitlement to unemployment benefit on her claim of 22 July 1985.  She informed her local office that she was employed for the full year in question and inquiries are being made to establish her contribution record for that year.  When these inquiries have been completed her claim for unemployment benefit will be determined.</P>
      <P>She was advised to apply for unemployment assistance in July 1985 but she declined to do so until recently and her case was then referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of her means. Those inquiries are now complete and arrangements are being made to submit her case to a deciding officer for assessment of her means.  Her entitlement to unemployment assistance will be determined in the light of the amount of means assessed against her.</P>

      <P>The entitlement to unemployment benefit of the person concerned could not be determined until protracted inquiries had been made to establish his contribution record in the period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984, which governed his claim of 2 May 1985.  These inquiries were recently completed and his claim was allowed at the maximum weekly rates appropriate in his case of £37.25 from 2 May 1985 increased to £39.50 from 4 July 1985.  All arrears due less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance advanced to him pending the outcome of his claim will be paid this week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>He will exhaust 156 days unemployment benefit on 2 November 1985 and as he does not fulfil the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in the seven year period prior to the date of his claim to enable him to receive maximum rate of unemployment benefit for the full period of 390 days, his weekly rate of unemployment benefit will be <Col N="727" /> reduced to £32.75 from 4 November 1985.  According to the records of this Department he had only 264 paid contributions in the seven year period.  However, inquiries are being made to establish his contribution record during the period 6 April 1984 to 5 April 1985 and when these inquiries are completed his entitlement to unemployment benefit at the higher rate will be reviewed.</P>

      <P>The allowances referred to are intended essentially for persons in receipt of old age and invalidity type pensions who are living alone and who have special needs by reason of that fact.</P>
      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme is intended to facilitate these pensioners in getting help in the event of an emergency and this scheme is confined to qualifying pensioners living alone or only with persons who would be regarded as unable to summon aid in such a situation.</P>
      <P>The free electricity and free television licence schemes are intended to assist pensioners in meeting the cost of these facilities and the schemes are confined to qualifying pensioners who are living alone or with specified dependants or who are incapacitated and have living with them a person who provides them with constant care and attention.  Where, as in the case referred to, the person who lives with the pensioner is in receipt of unemployment benefit and therefore seeking employment they would not be regarded as living with the pensioner for the purpose of providing fulltime care and attention.</P>
      <P>To extend the coverage of these schemes to all cases where pensioners are looked after by relatives at home would change the nature of the schemes and would be extremely costly.  There are no plans for such an extension in present circumstances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a free electricity allowance is that an eligible person must be living alone or with certain excepted persons. In cases where a pensioner occupies a portion of a house, the position, generally speaking, is that he-she is required to have separate cooking facilities as well as a separate ESB meter before he-she can be regarded as living alone for the purpose of the scheme.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was approved for a free electricity allowance in November 1983.  However, in May 1985 during a review of her entitlement it was ascertained that she occupied a portion of the house and that the remainder was occupied by her son, his wife and their family.  There is only one ESB meter for the entire house and, as her son and his wife do not come within the excepted categories, she could not be regarded as living alone for the purpose of the scheme.  Her allowance was therefore terminated in June 1985.</P>

      <P>I have already introduced a range of measures to assist farmers who were faced with the problem of providing sufficient winter fodder for their livestock.</P>
      <P>In August I launched the nitrogen subsidy scheme, which was designed to encourage farmers to spread nitrogen at that time so as to induce a late growth of grass, and the first time silage-making subsidy scheme, which is aimed at encouraging the production of silage on farms where it had not been made previously. The estimated cost of these schemes was £2.5 million.  The response under both schemes has been most encouraging and I have no doubt but that they have made a considerable contribution to easing the fodder position for many farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="753" /> In September I introduced the Shannon Valley flood scheme the object of which is to help farmers who, as a result of the flooding, were faced with serious winter fodder problems.  This scheme is estimated to cost £1 million.</P>
    <P>I have also secured the agreement of the EC Commission to provide 125,000 tonnes of intervention grain at a specially reduced price to help towards meeting the fodder needs.  In addition, the Government have agreed to provide £14 million to assist farmers with serious fodder problems.  Plans for utilising this sum in the best interests of the farmers who were hard hit are at present being worked out and I hope to be in a position shortly to announce details of the arrangements to be implemented in this regard and in regard to the EC grain.</P>

      <P>For purposes of the middle level technician programme operated by my Department with aid from the European Social Fund certain one and two year courses in regional technical colleges and colleges of technology are recognised.  As the courses referred to by the Deputy are structured as <i>ab initio</i> three year diploma courses it is not possible to have these included in the programme in 1985-86.</P>

      <P>The student in question, as a holder of a national diploma, must, under the provisions of the VEC scholarships scheme, obtain exemption from the first two years of his proposed degree course in order to be eligible for renewal of scholarship. As he has attained one year's exemption only, he must be deemed ineligible for assistance at this stage but could be considered for assistance when he has been admitted to the fourth and final year of the course.</P>
      <P>In the case of a four year degree course, a student obtaining the required two years' exemption will obtain assistance for a further two years whereas a student obtaining only one year's exemption will obtain only one year's further assistance.  This provision in the scholarships scheme obtains irrespective of where the college of attendance is located.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she will approve the payment of a higher education grant or a VEC grant for the 1985-86 school year to a person (details supplied) in County Kerry to enable her to pursue her studies in level 2, ACCA accountancy in the Cork Regional Technical College; and if she will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GemmaHussey" hpid="Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey) Gemma Hussey">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>The higher education grants scheme provides that the holder of a grant under the scheme who completes a course at national diploma level may, subject to prescribed conditions, have his/her grant extended in respect of subsequent attendance at a degree course.  The student referred to in the Deputy's question was paid higher education grant for the three years, 1982 to 1985, in respect of attendance at a national diploma course in business studies in the Regional Technical College, Cork.  The provisions of the grants scheme stipulate that a grant may be renewed, under certain conditions, for progression to a degree course.  However, the student in question is not pursuing a degree course in the academic year 1985-86 and she is not therefore eligible, under the terms of the scheme, to have a higher education grant available to her in that academic year.</P>
      <P>The student placed herself outside the scheme of scholarships to regional technical colleges and colleges of technology, operated by the vocational education committees, when she accepted a grant under the higher education grants scheme in 1982.  She cannot, therefore, be awarded a VEC scholarship in the academic year 1985-86.</P>
