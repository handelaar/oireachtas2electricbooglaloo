      <P>In reporting to this House on 24 April last on the meeting of the European Council held in Brussels on 29-30 March 1985, I said that the Government proposed to arrange for a discussion in the House, before the Milan meeting of the European Council, on the report of the Dooge Committee, on European Union, and on European developments generally.  The discussion today which will also refer to the Spinelli draft treaty and Report No. 14 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee is on foot of that commitment and in response to requests from Deputies.  Deputies will be aware that the meeting in Milan is to take place on Friday and Saturday next.</P>
      <P>I originally envisaged that this discussion might have taken place at an earlier date but developments over the past two months did not, however, lead to the emergence of any clear scenario as to likely or desired follow-up by the Community on the report submitted by the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs chaired by Senator Dooge.  Indeed, on the eve of the Milan meeting, the position is still not as clear as one would wish although after discussions with a number of Heads of Government within the past week I am now in a better position to direct the attention of the House to the issues that are most likely to arise for possible decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think, however, that I should first recall briefly some of the historical background. The primary Community to which Ireland acceded on 1 January 1973, following an 83 per cent &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; vote in a referendum in which voter turnout was 70 per cent, is entitled the European <Col N="1939" /> Economic Community.  The Treaty of Rome on which this Community is based is largely concerned with economic, commercial and related social matters.  Much of the impulse for the establishment of the Community was economic in nature: this is true today in regard to the motivation for new steps towards European Union.  And yet, from the outset, the founding fathers of the Communities were motivated by aspirations that went beyond purely economic, trade or social matters.  This commitment is seen in the Preamble to the Treaty of Paris, establishing the Coal and Steel Community, which provided for the safeguarding of peace by creative efforts and laying the foundations of a broader and deeper community among peoples long divided by bloody conflicts.  Similarly, the Preamble to the Treaty of Rome sets down the commitment to an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe and their resolve to strengthen the safeguards of peace and liberty.</P>
    <P>From the outset, also, these political aspirations were well understood in Ireland. What I have just said about the treaties is closely based on paragraph 6.1 of the White Paper, &ldquo;The Accession of Ireland to the European Communities&rdquo;, published by the then Government in January 1972 before our people voted in the referendum on accession.  Earlier references could also be quoted.  Not only was there understanding of the Community's ultimate political goal: from as far back as 1962, each successive Government declared their commitment to the achievement of European Union.  On 18 January 1962 the then Taoiseach, Mr. Sean Lemass, addressing the Ministers of the member states, said:</P>
    <P>It is natural that we in Ireland should regard with keen and sympathetic interest every genuine attempt to bring the peoples of Europe closer together ...We were happy at the development of a strong movement towards closer European Union .... In the Bonn Declaration the Member States reaffirmed their resolve to develop <Col N="1940" /> their political co-operation with a view to the union of their peoples and set in motion procedures designed to give statutory form to this union.  I desire to emphasise that the political aims of the Community are aims to which the Irish Government and people are ready to subscribe and in the realisation of which they wish to take an active part.</P>
    <P>In applying for membership of the Communities, the then Irish Government declared their acceptance of the treaties, of the decisions taken in their implementation and of their political objectives and indicated their readiness to join in working towards the goal of political unification in Europe.  These commitments were reaffirmed when negotiations opened in 1970 on Ireland's reactivated application.</P>
    <P>Similar sentiments have been expressed by successive Taoisigh &mdash; Deputy Lynch, Deputy Cosgrave, and the Leader of the Opposition who, when he held office as Taoiseach, said in Dáil Éireann on 11 March, 1981 at column 1396, Volume 327 of the Official Report.</P>
    <P>We could not, and would not wish to opt out of the obligations and aims inherent in the achievement of the ideal of European unity.</P>
    <P>European Union, however, is not a precise concept.  Over the years, many different views have been advanced as to what the content of such a union should be and on forms which the political unification to be eventually achieved in Europe should take, having regard, in particular, to the much greater diversity of Europe, as compared, say with the United States. Various attempts had been made up to 1983, either to map out a blueprint for progress towards European Union or to recommend particular substantive or procedural steps to expedite progress along the road.  All failed to lead to a decisive step or breakthrough.  Time does not permit for any extensive analysis of the reasons for this failure but one important cause was the faulty working <Col N="1941" /> of the Community's institutional system. I shall touch on this later in my remarks.</P>
    <P>In all European circles, a realisation had been growing over the past two or three years that there was an urgent need to address the state of crisis in the Community, exemplified, on the one hand, by the delay in decision-making and paralysis of the institutional system and, on the other, by Europe's economic decline relative to the United States and Japan, seen in terms of wide gaps in performance on economic growth, job creation and tackling unemployment and in the fields of entrepreneurship, innovation and technology.  With the settlement, at least for a time, of the budgetary and other problems which had deeply divided the Community, the European Council, at Fontainbleau, turned its attention back towards restoring momentum to the Community and relaunching it along the path of European integration envisaged by its founders.  It was decided to establish a high-level committee of personal representatives of Heads of State or Government ot report on the steps to be taken to that end.</P>
    <P>The Government fully supported this decision and were glad to assume the responsibility during the Irish Presidency of establishing this committee under a distinguished Irish chairman.  Within a very brief period, the Dooge Committee produced a substantive interim report in time for the European Council meeting in Dublin last December.  The European Council decided that the final report of the committee would be the main subject for discussion at the meeting in Milan this month.</P>
    <P>Before referring to the report of the Dooge Committee, let me take some time to refer to the parallel initiative of the European Parliament which led to its adoption of the Draft Treaty on European Union in February 1984, a document which is the subject of Report No. 14 of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities.  The adoption of the Draft Treaty by the European Parliament represented the culmination of a process initiated back in 1980 by the indomitable <Col N="1942" /> Italian MEP, Altiero Spinelli, whose European commitment dates back to the Italian Resistance and to a conviction formed and expressed before the guns of World War II had ceased to sound in Europe.  It is very largely due to the lead given by him and his co-workers and to the sustained follow through by the European Parliament that we owe the revitalisation of the debate on the future of the Community.  In taking this major initiative, the intent and inspiration of which the Government can broadly support, the Parliament placed the onus on the Governments of the member states to advance the integration process envisaged by the Draft Treaty.</P>
    <P>The latter is unlikely to be fully acceptable, in its present form, to all member states, but its broad thrust is probably shared by most, if not all the Governments of the Twelve.  However, the main focus of current activity is centred more on the report of the Dooge Committee.  This has been laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and, I believe, circulated to all Deputies.  I shall not therefore attempt to summarise it.  It does not take the form of a new draft treaty in legal form.  Rather, it sets out the objectives, policies and institutional reforms which it believes are neccessary and for these purposes contains recommendations in the following areas: creation of a genuine political entity, creation of a homogeneous internal economic area, the promotion of the common values of civilisation, the expression of an external identity and the operation of efficient and democratic institutions. Deputies will have had an opportunity by now to review the specific recommendations. Later in my statement, I will be setting out views on some of the major issues raised by the report.</P>
    <P>For the present, I simply note that Senator Dooge was able to agree with the majority consensus on all issues, except two.  He did not agree to the inclusion of the section on security and defence and, though in agreement with the principle underlying the text favoured by the majority of the committee in regard to principles of voting in the Council, he <Col N="1943" /> was unable to support the actual text because, although not excluding the pleading exceptional circumstances of a vital interest, it did not include any explicit reference to the protection of vital national interests in exceptional circumstances. I should also say that despite Senator Dooge's efforts the section on the promotion of economic convergence is very weak and is far from providing a satisfactory basis for progress towards European Union.</P>
    <P>The meeting of the European Council in Brussels last March decided that detailed examination of the proposals would continue over the following months by means of bilateral contacts, in order to enable the European Council to arrive at final conclusions at its June meeting.  Widespread bilateral contacts have been taking place and, as I undertook last March, I have ensured full Irish participation in this process.  Mr. Ferri, personal representative of Prime Minister Craxi, came to Dublin for discussions with senior Irish officials.  I discussed the matter in Lisbon with Commission President Delors, the British Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister of Portugal, and, briefly and informally in Madrid with Prime Minister Gonzalez.  Last week in Rome, I met Prime Minister Craxi and, separately, Christian Democrat members of the Governments of five member states, including the Federal German Chancellor and the Luxembourg Prime Minister, and Ministers from Italy, The Netherlands and Belgium, as well as Commissioner Andriessen.  Subsequently, I had discussions with President Mitterand in Paris and Vice-President Narjes of the European Commission in Dublin.  There have also been preparatory discussions at formal and informal meetings of the General Affairs Council while the Italian Presidency circulated some time ago a draft mandate for an Intergovernmental Conference, as proposed in the Dooge Report which has prompted reactions and proposals from other member states.  Nevertheless, despite all this activity the situation is <Col N="1944" /> rather fluid and the likely course of events is not easy to predict.</P>
    <P>Before going in more detail into the actual issues that may arise in Milan, and the Government's approach to these issues, I want to review the impact of Community membership on this country, so that the significance to us of our participation in the Community, and of its successful future development may be apparent.</P>
    <P>We are substantial net beneficiaries in a number of different ways.  In purely financial terms our gross contributions of £208 million in 1984 were exceeded four times over by payments from the Community of £851 million, plus loans of £126 million on advantageous terms from the European Investment Bank.  The net transfers of grants represented last year 10.8 per cent of our current budget receipts, and reduced by that amount the level of taxation required to provide current services and support farm incomes. In the absence of this net payment we should either have had to increase the present VAT rates of 0, 10, and 23 per cent to rates which, for example, could be of the order of 8.5, 18 and 27 per cent respectively, or else have had to increase by 30 per cent the average tax bill of the average income taxpayer &mdash; or have affected some combination of such tax increases.</P>
    <P>Over the period since we joined, the accumulated net inflow of non-repayable moneys has added up to £3.8 billion, which expressed in 1985 money terms amounts to no less than £6.8 billion.</P>
    <P>Access for our farm sector to EC markets has meant that the price levels obtainable have been far higher than they would have been had we remained outside the Community.  If in 1984 we had been obliged to market all our agricultural exports at world prices the returns from those exports would have been some £700 million, or around 45 per cent, below what they actually were.  This would obviously have had an absolutely disastrous effect on farm incomes. Indeed, given the over-supplied state of world markets for many products, it is quite possible that we could not have sold <Col N="1945" /> some of the production at all.  In such a situation, it would have been totally uneconomic for our farmers to produce anything near their present output levels and agricultural production would have effectively collapsed.  Given that the dependence of our economy on agriculture is still relatively heavy, our GNP would have been a great deal lower farm we not within the EC.  The impact would not, of course, have been confined to agriculture as the effects of lower farm incomes, and consequently reduced purchasing power, would have been felt throughout the entire economy.</P>
    <P>On the industrial side, as over two thirds of the sales of the new industries here are directed towards EC countries and as location within the EC was the prime motivation of the vast majority who came here after 1972 and of some who came immediately before that in anticipation of our entry, it is clear that a majority of the 70,000 relatively highly paid jobs in these industries would not have come into existence but for EC membership.  Together with the loss of jobs in services dependent upon direct purchasing from these industries, or upon the spending of the purchasing power generated here by the industries that would have been lost and by agriculture operating at a much lower level of activity than in the Community, the total loss of employment would have been enormous. And this sharply reduced and poorer labour force would have had to find the massive sums now made available to us through net payments from the EC out of higher taxation.</P>
    <P>That simply could not have been borne.  The level of public and social services would, therefore, by now have been at a level that would have been totally unacceptable to our people&mdash;or, indeed, to any other northern European people. The compensating gains by staying out and producing a certain range of high cost goods in small and inefficient industries for the home market behind high protective barriers &mdash; if that were the preferred alternative &mdash; would have been absolutely minimal by comparison.</P>
    <P>It is as well that these facts, which <Col N="1946" /> are rarely stated clearly, should be put forward at the outset of this debate, so that the debate may take place in an atmosphere of reality.</P>
    <P>Those who urge that we would be better to be outside the Community, alleging a threat to our neutrality &mdash; which I shall later demonstrate is not put in jeopardy by membership &mdash; ought to reflect upon these facts.</P>
    <P>The Community could, however, benefit us and other member states much more than it does at present.  For example, if the barriers to technological industry that now exist within the Community were removed, we should have more industries and more jobs here. Because at present some major countries continue to try, contrary to the Community competition rules, to seal off some of their markets in favour of firms locating within their borders, we have lost a number of high-tech firms that would have come here.</P>
    <P>Again, if the Community's total resources were not limited by the application of the unanimity rule to the raising of the limits on the share of VAT to be levied by the Community as own resources, a better financed Community would extend its activities in ways from which, as at present, we should benefit significantly.  These resources are, in any event, far below the minimum levels necessary to create a Community with a power to pursue policies capable of influencing significantly its own future evolution.  I shall return to this point later in the context of the proposals for European Union.</P>
    <P>In many other ways, too, the present faulty operation of the decision making system is damaging the interests of Ireland, as of other member states and the Community generally.  This is because in cases where the Treaty provides for decision making by qualified majority, even where countries do not invoke the veto aspect of the Luxembourg compromise, or even overtly hint that they may do so, a vote is not called because of the realisation that if it were to be called, the veto would be invoked.  Thus a decision <Col N="1947" /> is postponed again and again, often on relatively minor issues.</P>
    <P>Similar delays and blockages occur in the quite separate cases where the Treaty itself requires unanimity.  For example, proposals to harmonise national safety requirements or standards in the interests of free movement of goods, are made under Article 100 of the Rome Treaty which requires unanimity for a Council decision.  The result has been that action on many such proposals has been blocked in some cases for up to 20 years.  This has perpetuated fragmentation of European markets and prevented the exploitation of economies of scale, thus allowing non-European firms to gain an unnecessary marked, in some cases overwhelming, advantage.  All of us in the Community are the losers.</P>
    <P>Ireland is the most significant beneficiary of EC membership in terms of net measurable transfers.  Other member states also gain substantial advantages, not so easily measured, but in some cases very large indeed, for example, from the Customs Union, but if we limit ourselves &mdash; because we have to &mdash; to net measurable transfers, those to Ireland are in most cases ten to 20 times greater than to &mdash; or from &mdash; most other member states, amounting to 3.9 per cent of our GDP in 1983, compared with 0.19 per cent to Italy, 0.2 per cent to the Netherlands, 0.4 per cent to Denmark and net transfers the other way from Germany, France and the UK amounting to 0.4 per cent, 0.4 per cent and 0.19 per cent respectively, of GDP.</P>
    <P>It is therefore vital for us that obstacles to the taking of decisions in the Community be eliminated.  Of course, there will be some cases where we would be the losers rather than the gainers, and we shall have to be prepared to take a little of the rough with a lot of the smooth. Thus if more rapid movement towards a genuine single internal market, which would be of immense benefit to sectors here which at present lose out because of continuing barriers to trade, were to be made possible by applying majority voting in respect of such matters, now <Col N="1948" /> determined by unanimity, we could be adversely as well as favourably affected in areas like transport, and would face problems in the insurance area, for which we might need and have to seek some temporary provision.  But overall we should be the net gainers if in respect of the internal market decisions could be blocked only by a country which does, in fact, have an objectively verifiable vital national interest &mdash; a situation which it is now generally recognised will have to be provided for by some solemn procedure of invocation that will discourage its use except in cases where there really is a vital national interest.</P>
    <P>I would venture to comment that in the past 12 years we have had to defend very few vital national interests &mdash; our milk production and our fish resources being two.  Both were recognised by our partners as being vital national interests and were treated accordingly, giving us in each case the exceptional right in each case to go on increasing output when all other member states had to cut back.  In the event, we did not need to invoke the Luxembourg compromise in these two cases and have, in fact, not sought to do so in other cases, although, like everyone else, we have to admit that we have at times dragged our feet about matters that would be inconvenient, or would have involved using some of the substantial net financial benefits of membership to finance adjustments to Community standards.</P>
    <P>Thus our position on decision making is clear &mdash; we want to free up the present system, removing the abuses while retaining a provision to deal with genuine issues of vital national interest, to be advanced and proved objectively by formal procedure that no country would embark upon unless the issue were a really grave one.</P>
    <P>Within this general area of decision making one must distinguish between two aspects &mdash; first, the need to restrain the abuse of the Luxembourg compromise in cases where the existing Treaties provide for qualified majority voting, while retaining procedures to deal with genuine cases of vital national interest and, <Col N="1949" /> secondly, the quite different question as to whether the existing provisions in respect of unanimity voting cover the correct range of cases, namely, those in which there is a genuine need for unanimity.</P>
    <P>There may be cases where a move from unanimity to qualified majority voting might be desirable, as I have said in relation to decisions concerning movement towards a genuine single market, which is particularly important to us as a small country which so often finds itself frustrated by non-tariff trade barriers placed in its way particularly by larger and more powerful countries.  But because of the wide differences between overall expenditure and tax levels in member states, and especially the very big differences between internal taxes on such articles as spirits and tobacco, which reflect differences in national attitudes towards the consumption of these goods that have serious potential health implications, there would have to be provisions to accommodate our particular circumstances. The economic, social and health consequences of the drastic changes in tax levels that would be necessitated by harmonisation of taxation, because of the enormous differences between internal taxes on some of these items at present, are such that they would be clearly unacceptable.</P>
    <P>There are also institutional reforms which, as a country with a powerful interest in the success of the Community we favour, as do most other member states.</P>
    <P>Thus the erosion of the power of the Commission, and in particular of its exclusive right of initiative in respect of new proposals, has been damaging to the Community and to our interests as a small country.  Increasingly as the years have passed, successive Commissions have been less inclined to play the kind of political role as prime movers of new policies which the Treaty requires them to do.  Their proposals have tended to become more and more timid, as they have sought to anticipate and take account of the likely objections of member states before formulating their proposals lest they find them blocked by the use of the Luxembourg compromise.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1950" /> This has been because bitter experience has taught them that if they do not, in effect, accommodate in their proposals objections, especially of the larger countries, one or other of these will object and the proposal will get nowhere.  In my personal view, this trend has become even more marked since the establishment of thrice yearly European Councils of Heads of State and Government at the Paris Summit at the end of 1974, for at European Council meetings the Commission appears especially tentative about putting forward proposals, and as a result the initiative has, I feel, tended to pass back from the commission to the major member states, quite contrary to the provisions of the Treaty.</P>
    <P>We favour the full restoration of the Commission's Treaty powers as the best way of protecting the interests of small countries.  We also as a Government favour &mdash; and have done so since we put forward the proposal at the Rome European Council in December 1975 &mdash; the investiture of the President of the Commission by heads of government and by the European Parliament.  We also believe that he should himself play an important role in the choice of the national commissioners, so that he may get together around him a coherent team of high-calibre people.</P>
    <P>It has also been suggested that the Commission's management powers in respect of the implementation of Council decisions should be extended.  Worthwhile steps in this direction also appear necessary to avoid overload on the Council structures in a Community of Twelve but in some instances this might, of course, require a fairly precise initial mandate from the Council indicating in a fair amount of detail how the Council wishes the policy to be implemented and what interests would need to be safeguarded in this process.</P>
    <P>The strengthening of the powers of the European Parliament is also essential. Although it seems that in the neighbouring island, and perhaps in Denmark, there is resistance to this because of an illusion that what is at stake would be a <Col N="1951" /> transfer of power from national parliaments to the European Parliament, this is not in fact the case.  There is no such proposal.  The problem is to secure some kind of democratic control over the decision making powers of the Council of Ministers, which at present in effect rules by decree.  The absence of an adequate role for the European Parliament outside the budgetary area, for example, in relation to the ratification of Community treaties and the enactment of Community legislation, is a grave defect in the democratic structures of the existing Community.</P>
    <P>It also encourages the Parliament to act with less responsibility than might otherwise be the case in the only area where it has effective power, namely the budget.  It would be helpful in this connection if it also had some function in relation to the raising of some part of Community revenue.</P>
    <P>It has to be recognised, of course, that any movement towards co-decision between Council and Parliament must be so structured as not to introduce significant delay into the decision-making process and that there must be a system of mediation through which a decision can be reached reasonably rapidly where there is disagreement.  Solutions that have been suggested to this problem include the transmission of Commission proposals to the Council through the Parliament, which, within a specified period, could append its comments on a proposal, or a meeting between representatives of Council and Parliament at which an effort would be made to reconcile differences, with the last word left to the Council.  The views of Deputies on how this process might best be undertaken would be welcome.</P>
    <P>Other issues that could arise in relation to the movement towards a European Union include the development of the European Monetary System; the closely associated issues of economic convergence of member states which at present have widely different levels of <i>per capita</i><Col N="1952" /> income and living standards and the concentration of short term economic policies, technically known as conjunctural policies; the extension of the Community's competences to new areas; and the expansion of own resources, as well, of course, as developments in relation to political co-operation.</P>
    <P>We favour the development of the European Monetary System.  We should like to see our neighbour Britain become a full member of the system.  This would reduce to a very narrow range fluctuations between the Irish pound and sterling, which have created many problems for us since 1979.  Moreover, the inclusion of sterling would strengthen the system itself.  We should like to see a greater movement towards use of the ECU both for public and private purposes.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that progress towards the economic and, therefore, the social goals of the Community, and in particular towards the reduction of unemployment, will be slow and uncertain until the economic space of the Community is treated as a unit for short term economic policy purposes.  The policies of individual member countries should be co-ordinated through the Commission so as to achieve the kind of coherent result that emerges from central policy making in countries like the United States or Japan. So long as some larger countries in the Community retain the illusion that they can successfully operate autonomous short term economic policies and so long as they fail to grasp that their power to do so under modern conditions is very restricted, just so long will the Community remain a sleeping economic giant, unable to pursue its own economic interests coherently in relation to the rest of the world.</P>
    <P>Another economic issue that for us &mdash; and I believe also for Italy and Greece, as well as the new members, Spain and Portugal &mdash; is vital in the pursuit of the objective set out in the Preamble to the Rome Treaty which recites that its signatories were &ldquo;anxious to strengthen the unity of their economies and to ensure their harmonious development by reducing the differences existing between the <Col N="1953" /> various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions&rdquo;.  This fundamental principle of the treaty has not hitherto been given the importance that is its due.  Countries like Italy, and later Ireland and Greece, and most recently Spain and Portugal, have been significantly influenced in joining the Community by the presence of this commitment in the Treaty, and it has at times been disturbing to remark a tendency to downplay or ignore this principle.</P>
    <P>The achievement of the objective that the Community is now setting itself, namely, a genuine European Union &mdash; implies clearly a scale of funding far beyond anything currently available.</P>
    <P>It has long been argued by Irish Governments, and has also been widely accepted within the Community, that closer economic and monetary integration involving the transfer to Community level of the control over the major instruments of economic policy, would need to be paralleled by substantial reinforcement of Community action in favour of the less prosperous regions of the Community, including arrangements for transfers of resources on a significant scale.  These would be required in order to offset the potential centripetal efforts of integration on less-developed areas or to help these areas adjust to any external shocks affecting their economies.  While there are undoubted gains from economic integration in the absence of adequate convergence or safeguard mechanisms, there may also be risks of an uneven distribution of these gains, even to the point of some areas being net losers.</P>
    <P>Inter-regional mechanisms and transfers, both over and hidden, operate in national states and enable them to maintain a single currency and an integrated economy.  Similar mechanisms are required at Community level &mdash;they exist, for example, in the Regional Development Fund, but as yet in a very undeveloped and inadaquate form.</P>
    <P>This whole area was studied by the MacDougall Group, the Study Group on the Role of Public Finance in European Integration, and it was dealt with along the lines I have just sketched in their 1977 <Col N="1954" /> report.  They concluded that substantial increases in spending that would help to reduce inequalities in living standards would be necessary even in a period of pre-federal integration and that measures that would bring the Community budget up to 2 to 2.5 per cent of Community GNP would only begin to be economically significant in reducing inequalities and facilitating integration.  Even this, they decided, would be of extremely limited significance in regard to the possible use of the Community budget for the purpose of stabilising the economy of the Community and of its component parts in the face of cyclical fluctuation in economic activity.  A previous study in 1975 by the Study Group, Economic and Monetary Union, 1980, the Marjolin Group, had concluded that the minimum quantitative basis for European public finance would be 5 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>By comparision with these assessments of what as a minimum would be needed by way of Community resources in order to give real effect to the commitments and objectives of the Rome Treaty, the actual resources available to the Community are very restricted indeed.  The recent increase in own resources enables it to supplement the proceeds of Community import duties and levies by 1.4 per cent of the Community's VAT base, instead of 1 per cent as hitherto.  But next year, the very first year in which this extension of powers comes into effect, the needs of the Community are now estimated by the Commission to require own resources amounting to 1.35 per cent of GNP in addition to the import duties and levies.  In other words, the new margin to be introduced at last after such long and bitter arguments is likely to be used up almost completely at the very outset, thus starting once again, perhaps next years, the wrangle about raising the level from 1.4 per cent to 1.6 per cent by the action of national parliaments.  The figure of 1.6 per cent is itself only a fraction of that needed to make a European Union a reality.  Here the gap between the willing of the end and the willing of the means remains wide.</P>
    <P>Another major issue for discussion at <Col N="1955" /> Milan is the French proposal for European co-operation in advanced technological research for civilian purposes. This has great merit, coming as it does at a time when the American SDI initiative &mdash; leaving aside for the moment its military implications &mdash; threatens to dominate and absorb European research capacities unless a countervailing initiative of a civilian character is launched in Europe.  At this moment there are many distinguished scientists in many European countries who are awaiting the outcome of Milan before deciding whether to sign on to participate in SDI, which could thus involve a massive, and in terms of future technological progress, possibly fatal, brain drain for our Continent.  It is of vital importance to all of us in Europe, therefore, that Milan succeeds in taking a clear decision on Eureka, involving a firm commitment to go ahead at once with research in a number of key fields, supplementing private resources where necessary with Community funds.</P>
    <P>This project has aroused intense interest throughout western Europe, not alone in Community countries but in Norway and in the three neutral countries of Switzerland, Austria and Sweden.  The structures of Eureka should be such as to ensure that while centered on the Community, these other non-EC countries will also be given a full opportunity to take part, so that their important scientific resources may be available to this European project, rather than be drawn away into the American orbit.</P>
    <P>We are willing and anxious to play our part in this project.  Our resources in this area are limited, but not negligible, and in a couple of sectors we have significant scientific skills to offer.  What is less clear is whether we have Irish firms capable of participating in the development stage of this research.  If these do not exist, then we shall have to bring them into being &mdash; a process in which it might be necessary for the National Development Corporation to play a role.</P>
    <P>We would be anxious that this project should develop along lines similar to <Col N="1956" /> ESPRIT, the Community-based European Strategic Programme for Research in Information Technology, within which provision is made that 10 per cent of the specific projects will be small projects for which small firms and consortia could hope to tender successfully.  The importance of this from our point of view is clear.  In the absence of major Irish technological enterprises, our ability to benefit from development spending and from the industrial application of this research is likely to depend upon firms in Ireland, most of them small by international standards, securing a share of the funding, to which we as a member country will be subscribing.</P>
    <P>We would also be interested in discussing with our partners whether there could be any application of the principle of a Community intellectual property in the results of this research &mdash; admittedly a novel concept and one which could be difficult to apply in practice.</P>
    <P>The other matter that will arise at Milan is that of developing further the process of political co-operation, that is, the attempted co-ordination of the foreign policies of member states of the Community.  Great practical progress has been made in this area since 1973 when we joined the Community.  Policies which we have traditionally espoused, for example, recognition of the rights of Palestinians to self-determination in parallel with the right of Israel and other States in the area to having secure and guaranteed borders; support for human rights in Latin America <i>vis-à-vis</i> authoritarian regimes which have generally &mdash; although not invariably &mdash; been rightwing dictatorships; support in the late seventies for a solution to the problem of Rhodesia, based not on the so-called &ldquo;internal settlement&rdquo; but on the involvement in negotiations of the Patriotic Front; support for genuine independence for Namibia; opposition to apartheid in South Africa.  All these and other policies to which Irish people have been attached have at various times since 1973 gained increasing support from other members of the Community through the process of political co-operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1957" /> Moreover, Ireland has played a constructive role in this area, for example, through my own visit to Portugal in June 1975 as President of the Council of Ministers, which opened the way towards Community co-operation with the process of development of Portugal into a pluralist democracy and away from becoming a near-Communist State; as was threatened at that time and more recently, in our 1984 Presidency, by organising and presiding over the San José meeting of the Ten, as well as Spain and Portugal, with the five Central American countries and the four Contadora countries which are seeking to establish peace in the region.</P>
    <P>Political co-operation has from the outset been concentrated on seeking and often finding, by consensus, common positions on matters of foreign policy, and on discussing the interests we have in common with our partners in the political and economic aspects of security, excluding military or defence questions with which, as a non-member of any military alliance, we are not involved.</P>
    <P>As such, political co-operation has worked well, and we would be happy to see it evolve constructively.  There now is a widespread view that the effectiveness of the work of European political co-operation could be enhanced if it possessed a secretariat&mdash; many countries would say &ldquo;a light secretariat&rdquo;&mdash;with administrative functions and the task of preparing papers for Ministers in conjunction with national officials.  For my own part I find that the present system, with the secretariat effectively provided by the country holding the Presidency, sometimes aided on what is called a &ldquo;troika&rdquo; basis by the preceding and following Presidencies has worked quite well.</P>
    <P>However, with the additional administrative burdens that enlargement will bring in its train, a small secretariat providing administrative assistance to the Presidency might well be warranted. Some countries propose that the <i>ad hoc</i> structures of European political co-operation should be given formal recognition by putting them on a treaty basis, although it is not entirely clear what the <Col N="1958" /> benefit of this would be, given that the system must in our view continue to operate by consensus &mdash; viz. no common action to be taken against the wishes of an individual member state.  This matter may come for discussion at Milan.</P>
    <P>The UK Government have in fact proposed a draft treaty, parts of which, however, we would not be prepared to accept: in particular a provision that would require that no member country could co-sponsor a resolution at the UN if any member state opposed it.  This seems neither desirable nor practicable.</P>
    <P>In the discussion of these matters Ireland finds itself in a different position from its partners, all of whom are members of the North Atlantic Alliance, while Ireland is neutral.  It should be made clear that no other Government have put any pressure at any time on us on this issues of neutrality.  Presistent reports to the contrary are quite simply inventions.  No one should allow themselves to be fooled by this propaganda.</P>
    <P>As I pointed out earlier, Senator Dooge disagreed with the section on security and defence in the report because it contains proposals that seek to go beyond the existing guidelines on political co-operation.  These provide only for co-ordination in the area of foreign policy on the political and economic aspects of security.  The section contains suggestions that, in the view of the Government, are more appropriate to military alliance frameworks.  On this issue, Senator Dooge was reflecting the position of the Government.  Irish policy in this regard is both understood and accepted by our partners.  In discussion of the report's proposals, we will continue to take the line that there are subsisting and valid distinctions between these aspects of security that are appropriate to political co-operation and those, such as operation defence questions, that are appropriate to alliance frameworks.</P>
    <P>The fact is that our country's position in this matter is known to and understood by our partners and no question arises in this context of any change in the Government's commitment to maintain <Col N="1959" /> Ireland's neutral position of non-membership of military alliances.</P>
    <P>It is clearly in our interest to distinguish most clearly between our insistence on our neutral position on the one hand, even if this be seen by some as making tidy arrangements between different institutions more difficult to arrange and, on the other hand, our positive stance on the further development of the Community. It would be very damaging, indeed, to our interests if we were to add to any problems that our position on neutrality might be felt by some of our partners to pose for them, but which they are willing to accommodate, an intransigent position on other aspects of the process of European union.</P>
    <P>Fortunately we have no interest in creating other problems and every interest in solving them.  As a result both in the preparation of the Dooge report &mdash; and this House will, I am sure wish to pay a warm tribute to the Leader of the other House for his skill and patience in securing agreement of the representatives of Heads of Government of nine other member states to so much of its contents &mdash; and in seeking with our partners to put into effect its proposals, we are glad to be able to be positive, and to be joined with the original six Community members in seeking to move ahead together in as many ways as possible.  The goodwill which we have always enjoyed in the Community &mdash; and which I should say has brought us many tangible benefits &mdash; has been enhanced by our positive stance on so many of these issues.</P>
    <P>It is in this positive spirit that we view the proposal, first put forward in the Dooge report that an Intergovernmental Conference be convened to negotiate a draft European union treaty.  It is difficult to gauge the degree of support that now exists for this approach or even for holding a conference designed to agree on further steps in the integration process, not necessarily enshrined in a new treaty. Some member states are opposed to the proposal and there have been signs that others are now less confident of the merits of this approach.  On the other hand, the <Col N="1960" /> Declaration on European Union adopted at the meeting of European Christian Democrats in Rome last week, at which the Governments of six member states were represented by Heads of Government or Cabinet Ministers, came out in favour of a conference with a precise mandate to achieve the objectives set out in that declaration which raise no problems for Ireland and whose achievement would bring significant benefits to us.</P>
    <P>Against this background the Government will support calling a conference, if it enjoys a reasonable prospect of success, and we have conveyed this attitude to the Italian Presidency.  To have such a prospect it would be necessary to have a clear mandate enjoying a broad measure of support, and an appropriate timetable, so that the conference would not drag on until momentum was lost and the political climate altered for the worse.  No service would be rendered to the cause of European Union of such a conference were a failure.  Thus prudence is required.  But I do not wish to convey a hesitant attitude. We would encourage the Presidency in trying to ensure a basis for convening a conference that could lead to a new leap forward in European integration.  Equally, we will support whatever procedure is best calculated to secure meaningful progress, on a balanced basis, towards an entity that would be worthy of the title &ldquo;European Union&rdquo;, with economic and political integration proceeding broadly in parallel.</P>
    <P>I look forward to the comments of other speakers on the matters I have mentioned during the course of this speech and on any other aspects of the Dooge report or the Spinelli report that they may wish to advert to.  I am sure the debate will be a constructive one, and that it will help myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to play a constructive and positive role at Milan.</P>
    <P>Before concluding may I add a few words by way of general comment.  Both at the time when we debated joining the Community and since we have been a member of it, there has been a tendency in this country to look at our membership <Col N="1961" /> almost exclusively in terms of the material benefits we have secured from membership &mdash; and to look no further. In part this reflects the fact that these benefits have, as I said at the outset, been immense and, in so far as they can be readily identified and measured, far greater in relation to our economy than in relation to any other.</P>
    <P>But the construction of Europe is much more than a matter of pounds and pence received.  The Community is the guarantee for us and for our descendants that this western part of the European Continent will never again be the site of conflicts between its peoples.  The era of war within Western Europe is dead and, apart from occasional acts of terrorism, many of them emanating from outside Western Europe, one of the only two remaining sources of significant violence within this area of 320 million people is, tragically, to be found in our own country, in Northern Ireland.  I hope and believe that the conflict in Northern Ireland can also be brought to an end and I know that our European partners, conscious that this alone remains as an area of significant violence in Western European apart from the Basque Government in Spain, would wish to help us along this road if the opportunity arose for them to do so.</P>
    <P>I would add one further consideration. Western Europe is today in a new and very difficult phase of its history.  Technologically it is being outpaced by the United States and Japan.  Its economy is sluggish.  Its arteries of economic activity have become blocked by a kind of sclerosis, which if it is not cured, will lead to a decline that would effect all of us&mdash; is already affecting us to some degree&mdash; in our daily lives.  We find ourselves part of a Continent which, having for centuries led in innovation, is now lagging behind, one in which, while unemployment falls in America and Japan, the numbers out of work continue to rise.</P>
    <P>We in Ireland are suffering from this more than most.  With such a young population and a birth rate that was rising steadily till the beginning of this decade, we more than any other European country, need &mdash; and will, until the end of <Col N="1962" /> the century, continue to need &mdash; rapid economic growth in the countries around us, to which our economy is tied by geographical reality.</P>
    <P>It is therefore in our interest more than in that of any other country that Europe, through a mingling of its cultures and a sharing of its scientific and entrepreneurial resources, and through concerted sharing of its scientific and entrepreneurial resources, and through concerted changes in institutions, laws and practices that inhibit growth and the expansion of employment, break out of its long period of torpor and resume its earlier world leadership in innovation and enterprise. That can happen only through the invigorating effects of the removal of the barriers that, despite all the best efforts to date of those who founded the Community, continue to prevent it from functioning effectively as a single economic unit and a single market.  Europe for us is not merely a matter of national interest; it is also an ideal, and an imperative.</P>

      <P>In discussing the future direction of the European Community today we are also discussing the future of the Irish nation.  Ireland's place is in Europe.  But history has taught us that we must never rely on others to ensure our intrests and our welfare.  We cannot afford to assume that there is a benevolent presence somewhere out there in Europe which will take care of all our problems and which will release us from our responsibilities.  The reality of the situation in which we find ourselves 12 years after becoming members of the EC should remove from us any temptation to indulge in such illusions.  There is no case to be made for sacrificing our vital interests solely for the sake of being regarded as &ldquo;good Europeans&rdquo;.  We must rid our minds of illusions of that kind and concentrate on an analytical assessment of where we stand today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Milan Summit, once billed as a major meeting, no longer looks likely to reach major decisions.  But nonetheless we must maintain our vigilance.  We all recall the Stuttgart European Council two years ago when the Taoiseach came home and claimed he had saved the Common Agricultural Policy.  We know <Col N="1963" /> to our cost what has happened since. Decisions could be taken at Milan which would have serious and far-reaching implications for us, even if they no longer involve the idea of convening a grandiose intergovernmental conference.</P>
    <P>In discussing the Dooge report today we are not just discussing an important EC document that will be on the table of European leaders at the Milan Summit. We are discussing a report drawn up under the chairmanship of the Taoiseach's personal representative.  We are entitled to assume that, except where reservations are specifically indicated, the report reflects the views of the taoiseach.</P>
    <P>In my opinion the Dooge report is a very inadequate document both from a European and from an Irish point of view.  In so far as specifically Irish interests are concerned, Senator Dooge has taken up a minimalist position.  At a European level the major issues are sidestepped.</P>
    <P>The economic development of the European Community in over the past 12 years has been extremely disappointing. My main criticism of the Dooge and Spinelli reports is that they contain no convincing remedies for the unemployment crisis in the Community.  In being unwilling to tackle this problem directly the leaders of Europe have virtually abdicated their responsibilities.  It is no accident that most of them now find themselves in serious political difficulty at home.  The Taoiseach will not be the only Head of Government in Milan to have suffered a disastrous political reverse in the last few months.  Compared with mass unemployment, European Union is quite frankly irrelevant, and none of the projects for European Union have demonstrated in a convincing manner that they can deal with that situation.</P>
    <P>European Union, the Dooge Committee and the Spinelli report are in part at least exercises in political escapism.  In setting up the Dooge Committee and thus giving priority to political and institutional questions over economic ones, <Col N="1964" /> European leaders have been behaving as if they believed that the economic problems were secondary and that the political will needed to tackle them was missing.  They then decided to pass on to the next item on the agenda, political union, only to discover that there are no quick solutions there either.  An Italian journalist, Luigi Barzini, in his book <i>The Europeans,</i> recalls that as far back as 1929, Briand, the French Foreign Minister, solemnly proposed the creation of a United States of Europe to the League of Nations but, and I quote, &ldquo;The project was duly entrusted to a committee and was heard of no more&rdquo;.  I wonder if we shall hear a great deal more about the Dooge report after this week's European Council.</P>
    <P>In 1973, when we joined the Community, there were 2,500,000 people unemployed in the nine member states of the EC.  Today there are 14 million.  When we joined the Community 12 years ago our unemployment rate was 65,000. Today it is around 225,000.</P>
    <P>So far as our own situation is concerned, we have to go back to the fifties to find any parallel to the high unemployment and high emigration we are now experiencing.  It is not a position we expected to be in when we joined the EC.  In the last two years unemployment in Ireland has risen faster than in any other EC country and at twice the EC average.  Industrial investment in manufacturing industry fell by a catastrophic 39 per cent in volume terms in Ireland in 1984, while rising by 7 per cent on average in the EC as a whole.  Employment in indigenous industry has been devastated in the last few years, while productivity growth in multinational firms has not been translated into economic growth or increased employment for the country at large.</P>
    <P>A NESC study published in 1981 showed that the gap in living standards between member states has widened, not narrowed since we joined the EC.  The gap must be even wider today.  When we joined the EC we could look forward to significant money transfers and consequent Exchequer savings.  In 1972 we had <Col N="1965" /> no budget deficit and a minuscule foreign debt by today's standards.  Yet today this country has major financial problems which, despite all the propaganda engaged in by this Government, have grown since they came into office.</P>
    <P>It is not my intention to paint a picture of unmitigated gloom.  There have been significant improvements in living standards and in social conditions since 1973. We have captured a significant share of high technology industry.  Farmers, while not as well off as in the late seventies, were given a window of opportunity from which many have drawn lasting benefit. Some of the increase in employment in the the late seventies, some 60,000 jobs, chiefly in the services sector, have been retained.</P>
    <P>It is a commonplace that not merely the United States and Japan but also the other smaller developed countries of the OECD have all fared considerably better than the EC.  Norway has prospered outside the EC.  Austria and Switzerland still have very low rates of unemployment. Our geographical situation, our level of development is not the same as theirs. They have options that we do not have. Our position outside the Community would be immensely difficult.  But we must analyse what has gone wrong, and indeed whether the remedies proposed in the Dooge report offer any hope of real improvement in the situation.</P>
    <P>The two international oil crises of the seventies are undoubtedly the factors initially responsible for the severe recession, the effects of which are still with us.  It is a fact of history now that the Community, faced with its first serious challenge, did not prove an effective instrument to respond to the crisis.  The issues were, of course, ones that affected the whole western world.  To the extent that there were any attempts at a co-ordinated response they took place within the OECD, and under the auspices of the Economic Summits of the Seven, which have produced no real results.  As a market and as a trading bloc the European Community serves some function.  As far as wider policy issues are concerned, whether they be political or <Col N="1966" /> economic, the EC has often turned out to be little more than a forum to coordinate our community attitude before one of these Seven Summits.  The United States and Japan deal individually with the larger member states, while treating the EC itself as a body of secondary importance.  The larger member states have allowed and, indeed, encouraged this to happen.  There is no suggestion in the Dooge report of the EC dealing with the United States on all aspects of economic policy on a bloc to bloc basis.  It is surprising that the Taoiseach, who has made much of this issue in the past, could not persuade Senator Dooge to raise the point.  Talk of a single foreign policy by the larger member states, when they have every intention of continuing to operate independently themselves, is, as this example shows, a hypocritical means of depriving smaller countries of their independence and freedom of action.</P>
    <P>The EC could use its considerable strength as a bloc to bring about a co-ordinated economic recovery.  There are a number of policy options that have been or could be considered.</P>
    <P>The first option, much favoured by some of our partners, goes under the name &ldquo;completion of the internal market&rdquo;, the dismantling of frontiers, non-tariff barriers and State subsidies, the harmonisation of tax rates and so on. The argument for this option is roughly that the United States and Japan are markets without internal barriers, while there are all sorts of real and hidden barriers in the EC.  It has to be said that our interests in regard to such a programme work in both directions.  It is said, for example, that foreign investment which might have come to Ireland, is being diverted to the larger continental countries, who practise a State purchasing policy that favours factories situated in their territory.  On the other hand much of our industry is handicapped not so much by invisible trade barriers, as by poor marketing.</P>
    <P>The Oireachtas Joint Committee have pointed out, &ldquo;Lowering our tariff barriers has decimated our traditional industries, with consequent unemployment&rdquo;.  A <Col N="1967" /> Completely integrated internal market, based on a <i>laissez-faire</i> survival of the fittest philosophy, is unlikely to favour Ireland, if only because of our natural geographical disadvantages on the edge of Europe.  It is a policy likely to favour the heartland of the Community, south-east England, northern France, Benelux, Germany and northern Italy.</P>
    <P>An economy like ours, which has become to a great extent dependent on multinational firms &mdash;if it is to be allowed to become a dumping ground for cheap goods from inside and outside the EC&mdash; is not likely to provide its people with anything approaching full employment.</P>
    <P>It has been recognised far too little in the past that economic integration imposes considerable costs on weaker and more peripheral economies, with activity naturally gravitating towards the centre and to the most densely populated regions.  Ten years ago, when the Taoiseach, then Minister for Foreign Affairs, came home from the 1974 Paris Summit with a fairly miserable regional fund, I stated in the Dáil on 13 December, 1974, Vol. 276, column 1908 of the Official Report that unless there were a comprehensive regional policy.</P>
    <P>...it is quite meaningless to expect some of the member countries to participate in monetary union, or economic integration in their present state of development relative to other members.  Unless there is an operation of a meaningful regional policy, unless the different areas of the Community are brought up to somewhat the same level, then one can forget about economic integration in the full sense of the word and monetary union.</P>
    <P>I believe that what I said then remains entirely valid today.  Economic integration, without a proper redistributive mechanism, is 19th century economics. It is as if we tried to run this country on free market principles with virtually no social or regional policies.</P>
    <P>The Dooge report opts heavily for the approach of completing the internal <Col N="1968" /> market, the mutual recognition of European standards, the elimination of tax differences, the free movement of capital, the opening up of access to public contracts, the removal of all measures distorting competition.  It states that European economic life must be made fully competitive through a return to the fundamental principle embodied in the Treaties of promoting efficient producers.</P>
    <P>I want to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Taoiseach's personal representative, has underwritten policies that are entirely insensitive to our special economic position.</P>
    <P>The uncritical endorsement of a policy of ruthless market forces dominating a large market by the Taoiseach's personal representative demonstrates the shallowness of much official and political thinking to which the Taoiseach uncritically subscribes.  Whatever about the validity of such principles for the south-east of England and the Federal Republic of Germany, what safeguards are there for less developed regions such as Ireland? The Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs must get away from this notion that we are uncritically in favour of more economic integration without any compensating transfers, benefits or protection.  Once again it was left to the Greek representative on the Dooge Committee to point out that:</P>
    <P>The overall gains from economic integration are not only unevently distributed, but may also disguise losses for the less prosperous regions.  The creation, therefore, of an integrated market and a technological community needs to be supplemented by a very substantial effort to strengthen the Community's cohesion by promoting regional development and the convergence of living standards.</P>
    <P>I do not accept the criticism which we here around today which speaks of &ldquo;the begging bowl&rdquo;.  It suits our partners to paint Ireland as a large beneficiary of Community membership, merely from the fact that we have received several <Col N="1969" /> hundred million in benefit from the Community across the counter.  It is ignored, of course, that Denmark, which has the highest <i>per capita</i> income in the Community, also receives the highest EC transfers, so that most of what we obtain from the Community is not specifically related to our stage of development.</P>
    <P>No Irish Minister or official should be diffident about our alleged windfalls from Europe.  These are simply the logical, natural outcome of Community policy. Are we really so naive as to suppose that the biggest net contributor to the Community, the Federal Republic of Germany, benefits least from the EC?  I would argue, without fear of contradiction, that the Federal Republic of Germany benefits far more from the Community than we do.  Indeed, their trade surplus with the EC in most years is equivalent to or exceeds their payments to Brussels.  We need to think straight about these aspects.  We must get out of our head once and for all the idea that we are somehow specially favoured by the EC or by our partners.  The stark truth is that we are not.  We are and remain one of the less favoured regions of the EC and we should have no illusions about it.  It is long past time that we should be forming a practical working alliance with those countries that are in a similar situation so as to obtain effective redistributional Community policies.</P>
    <P>There is much talk from time to time about tendencies towards a two-tier community, and the fear is expressed that we might be relegated to the second tier.  But we have a two-tier community now, and we are deluding ourselves if we think otherwise.</P>
    <P>The Six, plus Britain and Denmark, have <i>per capita</i> incomes per year based on purchasing power parities of between 8,500 dollars and 11,000 dollars.  Ireland's <i>per capita</i> income is just over 6,000 dollars or 57 per cent of Germany's.  We are behind Spain with an income of 6,800 dollars, but ahead of Greece with 5,400 and Portugal with 4,500.  These figures are taken from the 1985 Administration Yearbook and Diary.  In terms of economic development we can be grouped <Col N="1970" /> with the new southern European members of the Community, Spain, Greece and Portugal.  Their experience of the impact of Community membership in relation to traditional industry is likely to be similar to ours.  There is no doubt that they will exercise considerable muscle within the Community.  We can choose to join them in seeking a fairer redistribution of the wealth of the Community, or we can choose to pretend that we belong to the top tier and, with some sort of false pride, continue to suffer in a dignified silence.  Of course in relation to agriculture and fisheries, our interests will differ from theirs but that can be accommodated also.</P>
    <P>Some economists and trade union voices here have argued at periodic intervals down the years that we should invoke the emergency provisions of the Treaty and impose temporary import tariffs or deposits.  Successive Governments have taken the view that, given our dependence on foreign investment that needs access to European markets, this could seriously damage our interests.  I share that view.</P>
    <P>However, we must demand safeguards and preserve the right balance in all future steps towards economic integration, given that such steps may have a greater relative net cost to us than a net benefit.  At the present stage it is not a question of trading off political advance against economic benefits to Ireland.  It is a question of ensuring that any further steps towards economic integration are adequately compensated.  We must get out of our heads the idea that further economic integration without compensatory safeguards is necessarily of any benefit to us at all.  Indeed the exact contrary is as likely to be the case.  Therefore it is totally absurd for us to even contemplate political concessions for the sake of more economic integration which may be of very dubious benefit to us.</P>
    <P>The reservation expressed by the Department of Finance in the Joint Oireachtas Committee Report on the Spinelli Draft Treaty are on the whole an injection of realism into the situation.  They are worth quoting in full:  <Col N="1971" /> The Department of Finance has stated that the provisions on economic policy would immediately and severely constrain national freedom of action in regard to economic policy thus effectively depriving the Government of the right to manage and develop our own economy.  These constraints would apply, for example, to actions relating to fiscal policy and to such matters as capital movements, monetary and credit policies and exchange rate policy.  The draft Treaty would itself impose, or create the potential for the institutions of the proposed Union to impose, much greater obligations than arise under the existing Treaties.</P>
    <P>The Dooge report has very largely adopted the sections on economic policy of the draft treaty so that the Department of Finance's comments apply equally to it.  The essential point being made by the Department of Finance is that in the absence of co-ordinated economic policy management at Community level to tackle unemployment and bring about recovery we cannot afford to be deprived of our own national economic policy instruments.</P>
    <P>It is not possible of course to have a complete internal market without some harmonisation of tax rates.  You cannot dismantle frontiers while you still have substantial divergences on tax rates.  You could argue that anything which might force the Government to lower the highest indirect taxes in Europe to more normal European levels ought to be welcomed. But it could also mean that you would have to impose VAT on food and children's footwear and clothing.  The Taoiseach has not spelt out the practical implications of his support for liberalisation of the internal market.  Would they include VAT on food? Would greater EC control of State purchasing mean that Government and Irish State bodies would be even less able to buy Irish than they are today?  Would the Commission find it easier to police the Irish situation, than say the situation in Britain, France or Germany, ensuring that common rules <Col N="1972" /> work to our disadvantage to a greater extent?</P>
    <P>There are two brief paragraphs in the Dooge report on economic convergence and Community solidarity.  It talks about the promotion of solidarity amongst the member states aimed at reducing structural imbalances and the strengthening of specific community instruments. Unfortunately this sort of statement has been fairly routine over the last ten years. It does not actually imply that any action will be taken, or more money allocated to the structural funds.</P>
    <P>The second paragraph at least contains an all too rare acknowledgment that economic integration can have negative effects, when it states that:</P>
    <P>the effective pursuit of integration and the strengthening of Community institutions that underlines it, require positive action to counter the tendencies to inequality and promote the convergence of living standards.</P>
    <P>However, the political realities emerge clearly in a footnote.</P>
    <P>Mr. Ruhfus (the German Chancellor's representative) entered a reserve arguing that economic convergence by its very nature is a convergence of economic policies ....  It will thus help to improve living conditions in the individual Member States.  <i>On this basis</i>, positive action is required to counter tendencies to inequality and to reduce structural imbalances in the Community.</P>
    <P>This makes it clear that the Federal Republic expects to get increased economic integration, in other words improved access for its industrial goods for free without accepting the need for compensating redistribution policies.</P>
    <P>The proposition that by following similar economic policies economic convergence will naturally occur is in any case demonstrably not true.  Nearly all European countries are following monetarist policies at the present time, none more harshly than our own.  Dr. Kieran Kennedy of the ESRI in a very interesting address a few weeks ago argued indeed <Col N="1973" /> that the common pursuit of monetarist policies was reinforcing depression in the Community, over and above the effects of such policies in each individual country. It is quite obvious that straightforward reflation in the traditional Keynesian mould is largely responsible for the sharp economic recovery in the United States.  But Europe's present leaders in economic matters are carefully ignoring this inconvenient happening. The possibility of co-ordinated reflaction is nowhere alluded to in the Dooge document. It is something that I continually pressed for at the European councils which I attended.  Neither a co-ordinated reflation nor a substantial increase in the structural funds is contemplated to make greater economic integration more workable and acceptable.</P>
    <P>I have said before, that any attempt to build a European Union or some kind of European super-state on the basis of revenues amounting to 1.4 or 1.6 per cent VAT is a self-evident absurdity.  Yet there is no proposal to be found in the Dooge report to increase the resources of the Community or to allow it to take over responsibilities, outside of agriculture and trade policy, presently exercised by the member states.  I acknowledge that the Taoiseach accepts that argument when he says that a genuine European Union emphasises clearly a scale of funding far beyond anything currently available.  I agree with the Taoiseach when he says that but there is nothing about it in the June report.  In such circumstances we must be extremely wary and sceptical of proposals which would drastically reduce our own freedom of action in the absence of any increased funding in Community reserves.</P>
    <P>That leads naturally on to the question of the national veto.  No one disputes that the veto, or the Luxembourg compromise as it is called, has been too widely abused in respect of matters that could not remotely be described as a vital national interest.  There is a broad measure of agreement that deployment of the veto should be restricted to genuine cases.  But as the use of the German veto in relation to cereal prices last week <Col N="1974" /> showed, vital interests from a political point of view are not immediately recognisable by others.  Ireland by its abstention in Council upheld, rightly in my view, the German right to exercise the veto.  But it has to be said that Ireland and other countries have been subjected by the German Government among others to a lot of unwarranted pressure to gives up the veto.</P>
    <P>According to the London <i>Times</i> of 15 May 1985 Chancellor Kohl in an angry message to the Commission President, stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;You have to learn it is not possible to put one of the most important member states under such pressure&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>That had an unfortunate <i>Animal Farm</i> ring to it:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;All members are equal but some are more equal than others&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The clear implication is that Germany does not feel they need the veto, because they are confident that their interests will always be respected.  Ireland without the veto would of course have no such assurance. This highlights the danger for Ireland of expousing too enthusiastically high-flown European rhetoric when it is no more than that.  Generally speaking, the larger countries have numerous methods both on stage and behind stage of protecting their interests even without recourse to the veto.  We have no such possibilities.</P>
    <P>The veto is of course the heart of the issue.  As things stand at present, our Government who are responsible to Dáil Éireann and the electorate are answerable for decisions taken at EC level.  If universal majority voting were introduced, or if the Parliament acquired significant legislative powers independently of the Council, then the EC would cease to be democratically accountable to us in Ireland.  That is the truth of the matter. Without a veto we stand to lose ultimate control of what is decided on our behalf in Europe.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge as the Taoiseach's representative has sat on the fence, identifying himself neither with the majority <Col N="1975" /> position of the original Six nor with the minority position of the British, the Danes and the Greeks.  However, Ireland's support for the German use of the veto indicated our real position.  It is reported in the <i>Sunday Tribune</i> on 23 June that the Taoiseach was prepared to go much further, and make the vital national interest on which the veto was based subject to verification by the EC Commission.  That would not have been in any way an adequate safeguard.  There is no substitute for each country being able to determine its own vital interests, though with a clear moral obligation to produce adequate justification.</P>
    <P>The British have recently proposed a new requirement that there should be majority voting in the implementation of policies agreed at EC Summits.  This would create grave problems for us, while we have a Taoiseach who does not always grasp the significant implications of what he has agreed to, as we recall from the debacle over the super-levy following the Stuttgart Summit.  Indeed it may have been just that case the British had in mind.  It would be a standing invitation to the more powerful members of the European Council to present us with <i>fait accomplis</i> which could not subsequently be reversed.  Heads of Government would then be extremely wary of agreeing to anything in such circumstances.</P>
    <P>Apart from the veto, the other major concern we have is the maintenance of Irish neutrality and of the Community as an entity that is politically distinct from NATO.  We must make it clear that it is not in the Community's interest simply to be regarded as the European pillar of NATO, and a part of a military bloc.</P>
    <P>The Dooge Report nowhere acknowledges the existence of Irish neutrality. The interim report states:</P>
    <P>Similarly in the case of defence, although the aim of the European Union is indeed the cohesiveness and solidarity of the countries of Europe within the large framework of the Atlantic Alliance, it will only be possible to achieve that aim in a series of <Col N="1976" /> steps and by paying special attention to the differing individual situations, including the situations of the two nuclear powers which are members and of certain member countries facing specific security problems.</P>
    <P>In the final version the wording was slightly altered with &ldquo;security&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;defence&rdquo; and &ldquo;the larger European and western framework&rdquo; substituted for &ldquo;NATO&rdquo;.  It is quite incomprehensible that in this context the particular situation of Britain and France as nuclear powers are mentioned while there was no reference to Irish neutrality. It is also clear that the substitution of &ldquo;security&rdquo; for &ldquo;defence&rdquo; in this context is a subterfuge, and that they are in fact interchangeable.</P>
    <P>The Dooge report proposes joint EC discussions on external threats and on the joint production of weapons systems. These are activities clearly appropriate to a military alliance rather than to a political or an economic Community.  Implementation of the proposals clearly represent a step towards the creation of a European defence community.  These particular proposals are being strongly promoted by the British Government in particular.</P>
    <P>Up until now the Government have adopted a low-key approach to the policy of neutrality, an approach that has been described as &ldquo;footnote neutrality&rdquo; by reference to Senator Dooge's footnote reservations.  The Government have not defended the policy of neutrality with any conviction, still less have they put forward a policy of positive neutrality. We have the dangerous situation of a Minister for Defence who is openly proNATO. We have a Taoiseach who clearly is not firmly committed to neutrality and whose commitment to it apparently does not stretch beyond 1987, as he made clear in a television interview on 15 May 1985, following his attendance at the Bilderberg Conference, at which of course NATO was fully on the agenda.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly there is an attempt being made to undermine our policy of neutrality through the European Community.  I <Col N="1977" /> say that seriously because all sorts of specious arguments are being put forward about our being hysterical about it or seeing bogeymen where they do not exist. The evidence is there.  There is no lack of European fora in which those who want to discuss defence matters can do so outside the Community.  The Western European Union, the Eurogroup of NATO, and the Independant European Procurement Group all exist for that purpose. Discussions on security and defence are therefore being pushed in the Community for reasons other than because it provides a ready forum.</P>
    <P>Extension of the competence of the Community to these subjects requires consensus and unanimity.  I understand that Greece and Denmark are for entirely different reasons also opposed to these proposals.  We too should show clearly that we are prepared to stand up for our position of neutrality.  Our neutrality will not be respected if we are embarrassed about standing up for it.  It is unacceptable to us to be part of a Community that is integrated into NATO.  We should not be forced to opt out of European political co-operation, through this proposed extension to defence.  The safest course of action is to take a firm position of principle that we are opposed to defence being discussed by the Community.</P>
    <P>It is not as if we were the principal obstacle to a common European defence policy.  Both Britain and France possess what are euphemistically called independant nuclear deterrents.  It is not proposed by either Government, British or France that these be placed at the disposal of the Community, but even if that were not the case, the Irish people have no desire to be incorporated into a super-state armed with nuclear weapons.</P>
    <P>Those who consciously or unconsciously are seeking to force us to abandon our neutrality are foolish in failing to appreciate the potential value of Irish neutrality to the Community in the international arena.  Our neutrality emphasises the peaceful nature of the Community, its openness to all democratic European countries, and it helps <Col N="1978" /> the Community to undertake international initiatives and to be represented in international peacekeeping forces without simply being regarded as a part of NATO.  The last thing the world needs today is a reinforcement of military blocs or the creation of new ones.</P>
    <P>There are also other proposals in regard to political co-operation.  The proposal to set up a permanent secretariat to assist the Presidency seems on the face of it to be a sensible one, which could ease the burden carried by the Presidency. However, it is essential that as a neutral country and as a non-member of NATO, we retain our right to conduct an independent foreign policy.  A common foreign policy is incompatable with our neutrality, and would prevent us from taking a distinctive line at the United Nations on disarmament and on issues arising from the colonial past.  Whenever possible we will seek a European consensus, but we should not as a small country allow ourselves to be bound down by rules that will not be observed by the larger member states in a crisis situation.  The Dooge Committee seek to formalise consultation procedures and have the same purpose as the proposal to phase out the veto, to constrain the freedom of action of the smaller member states.</P>
    <P>The report speaks of seeking a consensus in keeping with the majority opinion with a view to the prompt adoption of common positions and to facilitating joint measures.  Since the majority may well adopt positions which will derive from a different philosophy from ours we could not be bound by a majority consensus.  Both the Danish and the Greek representatives on the Dooge Committee appended comments to the Dooge report making it clear where they stood on this, in particular that common positions should be sought but that they must be based on complete consensus.</P>
    <P>Nearly all of us in this House are anxious to see the development of the European Community in a positive way. I regret that there are so few positive proposals for the further economic development of the Community.  The European proposals for a new technological. <Col N="1979" /> leap forward in the Community are to be welcomed, although they are not so far very well defined.  It remains to be seen whether the European Council is prepared to commit additional resources necessary to make this a success, where it has opposed the provision of funds for other common policies.  A diversion of existing Community resources, for instance from agriculture for instance or the regional and social funds, can only be deterimental to our interests.  It is not clear either how far Ireland will stand to benefit from such programmes, which will inevitably be principally tailored to the big research programmes undertaken in the larger member states.  As far as the Dooge report attempts to face up to this it is welcome, but certainly the Community should not allow itself to become simply a technological appendage to the United States.</P>
    <P>Nothing indicates that European Union is a realistic short-term objective at present.  It would be quite wrong for the Taoiseach to move from the solid basis of the Community to supporting such a union on a blank cheque basis without the necessary safeguards or preconditions. European Union should not be used as a cover for a further retreat from Community solidarity on the economic and social planes.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge and others have sought to persuade us that the original Six are determined to proceed with or without the rest of us, and that we must go along with them, or else we will be left behind. I see no evidence of this happening, especially as unfortunately recently the Franco-German accord, a great mainstay of the Community has encountered difficulties. Even without that it was not possible to take seriously the threat that the Community on the point of becoming Twelve after many years of painstaking negotiation is willing to engage on a potentially divisive enterprise which might break up the Community.</P>
    <P>At this stage European Union can only be based on the sovereign nation-states of Europe.  We must remain a full partner, retaining our right to say yes or no, and <Col N="1980" /> maintaining our independent voice in the world.  It is not the sovereignty or the prosperity of the larger or more central countries that will be taken away by the proposals in the Dooge report.  The smaller and less developed countries must be vigilant that what is proposed on the basis of high-minded principles does not degenerate into a system which simply enables the larger countries to carry out untroubled their strategic political and economic designs.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach must be careful that he is not carried away by his liking for membership of the private clubs of the rich and the powerful and look at the world from the perspective of their multinational interests rather than from an Irish viewpoint.  He must not let his patent desire to be well thought of in the right circles lead him into damaging our real national interests.  That is my advice to him as he goes to Milan.</P>
    <P>Let me conclude by saying that I do not think the Taoiseach has demonstrated in what he said to us today that European Union as conceived in the Dooge report will bring improved benefits to Ireland compared with the existing situation. There is a danger that some of the current proposals will disimprove our situation. It is time for very careful, prudent statesmanship. We are Europeans; our place is in Europe; our future is in Europe; but at the same time we must be very careful to protect our interests.  We want to see Europe progress and develop.  We want to see closer economic integration in Europe, but we want to see it done on the right basis and in the right way.  In our view the Community has failed, despite the sophisticated bureaucracy that it has at its disposal, to tackle its serious economic problems in the past four or five years.</P>
    <P>I believe the Dooge report falls down in that it does not recognise and confront the central failure of the economic management of the Community.  If the Community are prepared to proceed with economic integration on the right basis &mdash; namely, bringing all the areas of the Community as near to the same level as <Col N="1981" /> possible &mdash; then we can unhesitatingly support any proposal for economic integration, but if economic integration is to be such that it simply makes the rich richer centre richer and the poorer peripheral areas poorer, we cannot support that sort of economic integration. These are just a few words of advice which I give to the Taoiseach on his departure for Milan.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very useful that this debate takes place in this form where people can express statements of opinion on the situation in Europe without being tied to a particular motion or having to make decisions as to voting.  I hope it will open up a debate nationally on what is happening in Europe and the implications of the Dooge report.</P>
      <P>The recommendations of the Dooge report, or what should more accurately be described as the Report of the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee for Institutional Affairs, raise many very fundamental questions about the whole nature of the European Economic Community.  It poses serious questions which have generally been ignored since our accession to that institution in 1973, and again obliges us to consider carefully the many political, economic and social implications of membership, many of which were not debated in the lead up to the referendum in 1972.  Most importantly it enables us to attempt some sort of cost-benefit analysis of our membership and to consider in restrospect the impact the EEC has had on our society. It also provides us with a useful opportunity to evaluate what contribution we are making to the progressive development of modern Europe, if any, and what contribution we could be making in the future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It must be accepted that many Irish people still have serious apprehension about the whole EC experiment and are concerned about the obvious gaps which exist between the great hopes of our accession and the achievements of our membership.  They recognise the continued disparities between the regions, the growing level of unemployment, the disproportionate level of unemployment <Col N="1982" /> in Ireland, the questionable benefits of the Common Agricultural Policy, the lack of a common industrial policy, the underdevelopment of our own resources and the growing threat posed to our own fishing grounds.  They have also every right to examine critically the performance of all the EC institutions during the current economic crisis and to question the involvement of our Community partners in the destructive arms race at a time of such severe economic recession and growing international tensions.</P>
    <P>In 1973 it was said that the EC was a rich man's club and very little has hapened since then to change that perception. While progress has been made on the elimination of tariff barriers to facilitate the free movement of labour and capital, the great inequalities within the Community are still particularly persistent and appear to be given a very low priority in the centres of power.  While capital and labour had great expectations, only the interests of capital have been properly facilitated and the great aspirations of labour have been continuously frustrated.  Democracy has found little expression in the complex structures of Brussels and the benefits of membership have proven quite elusive for the great majority of ordinary people.</P>
    <P>It is understandable that there would be a movement for reform after 25 years of the Treaty of Rome, when the EC is apparently incapable of adopting a common approach to the many obvious areas of common concern in all member states.  But it must seriously be asked if the current proposals in the Dooge report are actually addressing these questions or are facing up to the real challenge posed by the current crisis.  Are the problems simply institutional and arising from the cumbersome decision-making process, or are they more fundamental than that? Surely it does not require a change in the Treaty of Rome to make unemployment the number one priority of the Community. Do we need a political union to extend technological co-operation, trade or commercial links?  Do we need to develop consultation on security problems or the rationalisation of military <Col N="1983" /> equipment to enable the Community to function more efficiently?  Do we need to lose our right of veto in order to speed up the decision-making process?</P>
    <P>Do we actually need a new treaty to begin the process of restoring economic growth, tackling unemployment, equalising living standards and extending the democratic rights of our citizens?  In my opinion the answer to all those questions is &ldquo;No&rdquo;, and it is for that reason I do not believe the Dooge report is actually addressing the central problems facing the EC.  These problems are not simply institutional or bureaucratic problems but arise mainly from the absolute and misguided total reliance of all EC Governments on the effectiveness of the free play of economic forces and competition in a community of 273 million people.</P>
    <P>It is a curious fact that such a free market approach has been severely restricted by the EC in the agricultural arena because the CAP sets the terms of reference for political and social policy reasons but sets no such restrictions in the industrial arena where free cut-throat competition still dominates.  As a consequence there are over 13 million of officially unemployed in the Community but there are many more millions of victims of economic deprivation.  How can we talk seriously about extending the frontiers of democracy on a transnational basis when the most democratic right to work is denied to so many of our fellow citizens? Surely that is where democracy must begin.</P>
    <P>As a socialist party committed to defending the interests of the working class, we maintain that this is an absolute, basic human right which is scandalously denied to the millions of unemployed citizens of the Community.  Without work people lack adequate income and the sense of dignity and purpose which can only be found in a productive relationship to society.  Nowhere is it more clear that the EC is dominated by the inhuman ideology of capitalism than in the fact that unemployment is treated as an inevitable by-product of economic crisis and not as <Col N="1984" /> a denial of fundamental human rights. Recognition and implementation of this right means fighting for a programme of full employment in the EC.</P>
    <P>I see considerable merit in the proposals for greater economic development by the creation of a technological community through improved industrial co-operation and see value also in the strengthening of the European Monetary System.  There are useful suggestions in the decision making processes and the respective roles of the EC Commission at the Parliament.  But unfortunately this report is effectively an extension of the political demand for a fully integrated free market which was contained in the European Parliament's Draft Treaty of last year.  It has as its objective the transformation of the EC into a fully fledged European Union, without the participation of many European countries in northern, middle and eastern Europe.</P>
    <P>It requires a development of decisions by majority voting, which must work to the detriment of small countries such as Ireland.  It envisages the implementation of a common external policy for the EC and growing military and security co-operation between the member states without challenging the link between the US military establishment and so many of our European partners.  It would also entail a transfer of even more power from the national parliaments to Brussels at a time when there is no evidence that a multi-national institution could respond any more effectively than national parliaments do at present.</P>
    <P>It should be remembered that the European Parliament has already shown its susceptibility to the power of the multi-nationals during the very recent debate on the Vredling proposals.  On that occasion the very modest proposals for a common standard of information disclosure and accountability by employers were effectively stillborn when the full weight of international capital under the direction of the US Chambers of Commerce, was brought to bear on that institution.  Our own Confederation of Irish Industries played their part in that <Col N="1985" /> drama as did the representatives of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael with the enthusiastic support of Mrs. Thatcher's representatives in Europe.  That episode provides a warning, if one was needed, that an extension of European democracy was not intended to extend to the boardrooms of Dublin, London, Paris, Bonn or New York.  It has become equally evident that equalisation of social policy will be a very slow process and will hardly keep pace with the policy of integration in the economic sphere.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly the area which gives cause for greatest concern are the proposals on security and defence.  These suggest as follows:</P>
    <P>(b) Security and defence</P>
    <P>The aim is to encourage greater awareness on the part of the Member States of the common interests of the future European Union in matters of security.  The relevant Member States will make the fullest contribution both to the maintenance of adequate defences and political solidarity, and to the pursuit of security at the lowest possible level of forces through the negotiation of balanced and verifiable measures of arms control and disarmament.</P>
    <P>In any event, this question will have to take account of;</P>
    <P> (1)  the frameworks which already exist (and of which not all partners in the European Community are members) such as the Atlantic Alliance (that really means NATO) the framework for and basis of our security, and the Western European Union, the strengthening of which, now under way, would enrich the Alliance with its own contribution;</P>
    <P>(2)  the differing capabilities and responsibilities and the distinctive situations of the Community Member States;</P>
    <P>(3)  the existence of interests and objectives which Member States, <Col N="1986" /> while respecting their individual situations as regards defence and security, recognize as common, in particular the need for the Atlantic Alliance to maintain adequate military strength in Europe for effective deterrence and defence, in order to preserve peace and protect democratic values. </P>
    <P>Accordingly, the following measures are proposed:</P>
    <P> (i)  Developing and strengthening consultation on security problems as part of political co-operation.  Such consultation could involve in particular:</P>
    <P> (a)  discussion of the nature of external threats to the security of the Union;</P>
    <P>(b)  discussion of the way in which Member States' security interests may be affected by the international context, in particular by developments in weapons technology and strategic doctrines, changes in relations between the great powers and the progress of negotiations on disarmament and arms control;</P>
    <P>(c)  an effort to harmonize, whenever possible, the stances to be taken by Member States on the major problems posed by the preservation of peace in Europe. </P>
    <P>(ii)  the stepping-up of efforts to draw up and adopt common standards for weapons systems and equipment, taking account of the work being done in the relevant bodies.  (Armies, I presume).</P>
    <P>Particular attention is to be paid by Member States to:</P>
    <P> (a)  rationalizing their military equipment research and development;</P>
    <P>(b)  support for production capacity for high-technology equipment which can strengthen Europe's defensive capabilities. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1987" /> (iii)  A commitment by Member States to design, develop and produce such systems and equipment jointly. (Arms and weapons of war).</P>
    <P>(iv)  The will on the part of the Member States to create the technological and industrial conditions necessary for their security. </P>
    <P>While Senator Dooge did not agree to the inclusion of the section on security and defence it still appears in the text and should alert us to the possible consequences of majority voting on such matters in the future.  Unfortunately, no thought was given to this more positive and, in my opinion, the more important security issue of achieving a nuclear free zone in Europe.  The development of a rational policy of non-alignment by all member states and the provision of a basis for non-aggression and mutual co-operation between East and West in Europe has never been on the agenda of the EC.</P>
    <P>The military alliances have already been formed under the unbrellas of NATO and the Western European Union, but our Government have never taken any initiative to develop an alliance of non-aligned or neutral countries.  We have taken no initiative to provide an alternative which would encourage the Danish, Greek or Irish Governments to co-operate in opposition to the military build up which is now such a feature of modern Europe.  Have we ever considered a proper dialogue with the Scan-danavian countries, Norway, Sweden or Finland, and with Austria and Switzerland or mutual co-operation for demilitarisation and world peace?  Why should we not be taking initiatives for peace while other countries are taking initiatives for war?  If we were really a neutral country, our purpose should be to take such initiatives with other countries in Europe for peace.</P>
    <P>When we are talking about European Union we are referring to all of Europe. Why is it that we have been so inactive in promoting <i>detente</i> in accordance with <Col N="1988" /> the 1975 Helsinki Agreement?  Surely it is part of our duty as a neutral country to work for and ensure that there will not be a war.  That agreement provided a framework based on respect for sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity and political independence.  It was based on ten principles which are in the UN Charter.  We support those principles and also supported the Helsinki Agreement. We should be using those as the basis of our policy in Europe and our policy for neutrality and peace.</P>
    <P>Why have the Government, the Taoiseach and our Senator Dooge not sought to place this approach on the European agenda rather than inserting a token footnote of dissent in a report which carries the name of Ireland's representative, Senator Dooge, and yet proposes measures for military co-operation?  Is it any wonder that people are asking what we mean by our national policy of neutrality or if we are serious in our national policy of neutrality?</P>
    <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach, and the House, to oppose our participation in any conference of EC Governments which uses the Dooge report as an agenda for discussion on a new draft European Union treaty.  The problems of the EC can be dealt with in the context of the Rome Treaty, the only proposal placed before the Irish electorate in the referendum in 1972.  That Treaty, which was accepted by the Irish people, should still be the basis for action in Europe.  It gives ample scope for that and for increased co-operation or convergence in economic and social affairs while preserving the right of individual member states to protect and defend their own vital national interest.  Any attempt to depart from that will meet with determined opposition from The Workers' Party, not only here but on the streets if necessary, because we view the implementation of the current proposals of the Dooge report as an attack on the hard won rights and independence of the Irish people and a retrograde step for the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>There should be no doubt in anybody's mind that Fianna Fáil <Col N="1989" /> are convinced that Ireland's place is in Europe.  We are also aware that in talking about Europe we are referring to Ireland. Our success depends on Europe succeeding. We are very happy to say that, and I make that statement deliberately having regard to the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on the last occasion we had a debate on Europe here, suggested the opposite.  I did not have an opportunity of replying to the Minister on that occasion.  We are convinced, as I have said on many occasions, that Europe does not owe us as a nation anything.  We cannot have the hand out expecting the begging bowl to be filled.  That is a wrong impression to create and something we should dispel at every opportunity.</P>
      <P>I am convinced that during our short period of membership of the European Community we have made a worthwhile contribution to Europe as a whole and I am satisfied that we can continue to make that contribution.  I am also satisfied that we have to fight hard for recognition, for acceptance and for benefits we feel are necessary for the country.  I am referring in particular to difficulties that arose in the past in regard to the agricultural policy.  We had to fight very hard to get what we genuinely believed we were entitled to.  We will have to continue to fight for what we believe we are entitled to.  We had a problem in regard to fisheries recently and we had to make a very strong stand on that issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I could, without any difficulty, launch into a strong attack on the Government for not fighting as strongly as they should have in certain areas, but that can be left for another day.  I understand from the Whips that we will be having a discussion on the Estimate for Foreign Affairs before the Summer Recess and that may be a more appropriate occasion for a general bash at the Government, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Agriculture for their failure to get more than we have got.  I am genuinely worried that the Government, in particular the Taoiseach, who is obsessed with the idea of being regarded as a good European by his European friends &mdash; he often goes to a lot of trouble to boast <Col N="1990" /> about that in the House &mdash; are more than prepared to go half way on almost all occasions.  That has not always been to our benefit.  I have listened to the Taoiseach tell the House about his good personal friends in Europe.  After the Stuttgart Conference the Taoiseach told the House vehemently that he had succeeded in preserving the Common Agricultural Policy; but, as we all know, following that conference we had the introduction of the milk super-levy which is causing exceptional problems for those involved in the dairy industry.  I make that statement with first hand knowledge of what is involved because I represent the biggest dairying constituency.  Thousands of farmers who are involved in that industry do not know where they are going, what will happen their investment, or the money they borrowed at high rates of interest to develop their enterprises. At times the Government appear to get carried away with this good European image.  We must get rid of this illusion and concentrate on the position as it is. We must coldly analyse our achievements to date.  Truthfully, I do not think we have achieved what we should have and I have cited one industry which is tottering, not knowing where it is going or if it will survive.</P>
    <P>With regard to the report before us, I should like to state that we are all anxious and concerned about the future of Europe.  We should be, because it is vital for our existence that we should have a strong and healthy European Community. We are all thankful that 30 years ago great people got together to get the Community underway.  We must remember that in the first half of this century Europe experienced two World Wars in which millions of people were killed.  It was because of those events that an effort was made to bring about an economic community.  If the EC has not achieved its aims on the economic front it certainly has achieved another aim in that it is 30 years since we have had a war in Europe. I am satisfied &mdash; I cannot see into the future any more than anybody else but I am probably more honest to admit it &mdash; that we are not going to have the great <Col N="1991" /> countries of Europe embroiled in another war for many years to come and, I hope, never.</P>
    <P>There are problems and challenges to be faced in Europe and we have to grapple with them fairly quickly.  Europe is not making the progress we want it to make.  Nobody would disagree with me on that.  Unfortunately Europe is stagnant. Europe will not disintegrate but it will not progress and there are serious problems which have to be overcome.  I have no doubt that Europe could stagger to the end of the decade going from one crisis to another, but who wants this continuous wrangling and bickering?  Who wants to witness Mrs. Thatcher or her successor coming to Dublin Castle and kicking the table, as Kruschev did at the United Nations, shouting in her squawky voice looking for her money back.  No government, no parliament or no member state wants anything like that. There are crises and problems but I believe they can be overcome.</P>
    <P>The first challenge to be faced is the enlargement of the Community.  In the first 15 years, the original Six member states achieved what was probably the biggest surge in prosperity ever recorded in the history of the world.  The only other source which could be compared with that was what happened in the United States after the Civil War.  Very shortly Spain and Portugal will become full members of the Community.  We are all convinced that on the basis of the limits of our resources and income, Europe cannot carry on as it is because the money is not there.  The member states are not providing money for the Commission to implement policies.  If there is nothing else to be said about Europe, it must be admitted that there are policies and plans for everything and anything but the money is not there to implement them.</P>
    <P>In the Dooge report there is, unfortunately, a backing away from the original aims and ideals of the Community.  We have grandiose regional and social plans but the funds are not there to implement them.  In 1973 when 83 per cent of the population voted for Ireland to be full <Col N="1992" /> members of the European Community, there was great talk about regional and western development.  Who at that time would have thought we would have potholes in the roads in which telegraph or ESB poles could be stood?  Who would have thought our road system would be falling asunder in 1985?  Who would have thought that, despite the high power PR work of An Bord Telecom we would have a telephone system which is disimproving as the days go on?  That is a fact.  I know the Minister, Deputy Quinn, does not agree with me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Who would have thought 12 or 15 years ago when we were talking about what Europe was going to do for us that we would still have a bad telephone system? We have not made any progress.  As the leader of our party said earlier, there were 65,000 people out of work in 1973. At that time members of the major party in Government were hopeful, indeed optimistic, that the unemployment level would be reduced but instead it has increased to 230,000 unemployed at <Col N="1993" /> present.  To us Europe is not, as the Taoiseach described it this morning, of tremendous value.  There are very serious problems to be tackled which should not be forgotten.  The unemployment problem has not been seriously tackled by Europe or by us.  I accept that 12 years ago there were 2.5 million people out of work in Europe but that figure has increased to 14 million.  That is unforgiveable.</P>
    <P>The Heads of Government, Foreign Ministers, Finance Ministers and so on are talking about European Union, sovereignty, neutrality, military alliances and so on, but they are not talking about things that matter to the people who make up the European Community.  The fact is that Europe has done nothing positive to provide employment opportunities for the many millions out of work.  I would like to see greater efforts being made to help tackle this serious problem.</P>
    <P>I welcome genuine and positive initiatives towards European Union.  I agree we must move forward and we have to improve the institutional balance in decision making in the Community.  I am very anxious that we fix our sights on European Union as the ultimate goal of all our efforts.  As far as we are concerned, there can be no real union until such time as there is total integration and harmonisation of the economic policies of the member states.  The paralysis from which the Community suffers at present stems from factors which cannot be resolved by window dressing initiatives or by tinkering with the existing institutional structures.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that further integration can only follow economic and social development and the primary motivation for integration is the further development of the Community through the treaty framework. This means that, first, the complex of international problems facing the Community must be resolved in the immediate future.  Secondly, it means the development of an even closer Community of interests through the adoption of concrete and visible measures designed to face up to the economic and social problems of the Community, principally <Col N="1994" /> unemployment, and to further the aim of the convergence of the economics of the member states.  This means the provision of the necessary financial resources for the Community to maintain existing policies and to develop new ones designed to achieve the aims already mentioned.</P>
    <P>European Union as it is being offered to us, based on a 1.4 per cent or 1.6 per cent VAT contribution, is not realistic.  I do not want to use the word &ldquo;nonsense&rdquo; but I am afraid I have to because this is very much out of touch with reality.</P>
    <P>I agree with Senator Dooge when he refused to subscribe to the inclusion in the text of the sections dealing with security and defence.  I would like to make it very clear that Ireland's neutrality is not negotiable and we will strongly reject any attempt to embroil this country in any military alliance.  Our positive neutrality is aimed at the promotion of peace as has been clearly established already by Ireland's traditional attitude to decolonisation, disarmament and peace-keeping issues in the United Nations.</P>
    <P>It is being suggested that European political co-operation should be extended to military affairs.  We are totally opposed to this idea.  While individual member states may discuss certain foreign policy questions touching on political aspects of security, we are opposed to any involvement in either military or defence matters by the Community institutions as such. This opposition is rooted in our status as a member state which does not belong to any military alliance.  Indeed, if Ireland were to adopt any other position, inevitably we would find ourselves subjected to pressures such as the promotion of nuclear facilities in our country.  I am satisfied that those pressures would be exerted on us.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil are resolved to preserve the whole of Ireland, North and South, as a nuclear-free zone.  We see clearly that this is possible only on the basis of maintaining our military neutrality and as far as we are concerned, as I said, Ireland's neutrality is not negotiable. When this country signed the Act of Accession to the EC there was no reference whatsoever to any military or <Col N="1995" /> defence obligations.  Protocol 30 which was annexed to that Act recommended that the Community institutions implement all the means and procedures laid down by the EC Treaty, particularly by making adequate use of the Community resources to reduce the economic differences between Ireland and the rest of the Community.  We are still a long way from honouring that commitment and today the Taoiseach in his lengthy speech, in a throw-away remark, said:</P>
    <P>I should also say that despite Senator Dooge's efforts the section on the promotion of economic convergence is very weak and is far from providing a satisfactory basis for progress towards European Union.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely crucial sentence.  I hope that somebody on the Government side, when replying to the debate &mdash; perhaps the Foreign Minister &mdash; would honestly tell us what our interests are, what interests we could have in European Union which have, in the words of the Taoiseach, no satisfactory economic base.  If there is not that satisfactory economic base, surely we are only shadow boxing, not doing anything about the real problem.  I believe that to be so.  I am not in any way going to decry the benefits that this country has received.  They were fairly well documented and have been repeated reasonably often.  If that has not been in this House, it is because we do not have the time for discussion of these matters.  If the Chair will be slightly tolerant of me, I will say here and now that I have failed, as chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on EC legislation, to get any time whatsoever in the last two and a half years to debate any EC issue in this House.  I have written to the Government Chief Whip on a number of occasions and to the Leader of the House, Deputy Bruton, and have spoken personally to the Taoiseach about the matter, but have failed.  I regret that.  I hope that the Minister will have time, in Government or wherever there is talk about these things, to mention that Members from all parties are becoming fed up with <Col N="1996" /> their efforts being totally ignored &mdash; and those frustrations could be avoided.  It is a pity, because that was a great committee. It is taking the best that Deputy Manning as vice chairman and I as chairman can do to keep it going.  I say that with sincere regret.</P>
    <P>We should have more time for discussion, not a full day's discussion but of one to three hours, to give people an opportunity to speak on the subject for ten to 15 minutes.  We would co-operate with any arrangements agreed between the Whips.  Perhaps then we would all be better informed on what is going on in Europe and would learn from each other.</P>
    <P>The benefits from Community membership are listed by the Taoiseach today. However, he gives a slightly unbalanced picture of the benefits.  There have been costs, too, and to talk about Ireland being the most significant beneficiary of EC membership in terms of net measurable transfers ignores the economic costs.  I am not trying to hold it in for the Minister, Deputy Quinn because he is a member of the Labour Party, but on a personal basis I am sure he would have to agree with me, being a representative of that party, that there have also been immense costs.  I am trying to be very open and fair about this matter.  We would not want to go overboard, but must be fairly cautious.  We must see exactly where we are going.</P>
    <P>We talk about the veto and that four letter word has been misused so often and is causing confusion.  I have listened to people discussing that matter outside the House and many are mistaken on its use: when it could be used; what the consequences are of using it.  Even at times the mere threat of using the veto can cause much harm.  I gather that the present Taoiseach, when Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1975 was involved in the movement suggesting that the vote should be got rid of.  I just wanted to put that on the record.  It came to light in an article that I read recently by John McGlue.  The Taoiseach suggested at that time that the veto would only stand if the country concerned alerted the Council of Ministers as to its intentions if certain <Col N="1997" /> measures were or were not to be decided upon.  I would say that that recommendation will haunt the Taoiseach, particularly in recent times, having regard to the importance of this veto as we see it.</P>
    <P>The phasing out of the veto could cause serious problems to this country.  Of course, there are issues which can and must be decided by a majority vote. Nevertheless, as long as excessive economic imbalances between the regions persist and until such time as they are eliminated, there must be provision to allow smaller and economically weaker countries like Ireland to invoke, when necessary and justified &mdash; and I underline that word &ldquo;justified&rdquo;&mdash; their vital national interests and exercise the right of veto.  I very much think that that is important.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach's statement is quite a document to get through.  It is one which appears to be vague in a number of areas. Nobody has made any attempt, to the best of my knowledge, to spell out the consequences for us of action that will be taken.  That is important.</P>
    <P>I have marked the Taoiseach's statement for study and for question at some stage in the immediate future.  He referred to the barriers to the free flow of technology in the Community and he stated:</P>
    <P>The Community could, however, benefit us and other member states much more than it does at present.  For example, if the barriers to technological industry that now exist within the Community were removed, we should have more industries and more jobs here.  Because at present some major countries continue to try, contrary to the Community competition rules, to seal off some of their markets in favour of firms locating within their borders, we have lost a number of high-tech firms that would have come here.</P>
    <P>Rather than complaining in a mild way about this, the Taoiseach should tell us what he has done about it in the past two and a half years.  If member states have been misbehaving, surely there must be a mechanism to deal with the problem?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1998" /> If young people can be helped the Taoiseach should do everything possible to help them and to act in a positive way. The question remains, what actions have been taken by the Government to ease the problems?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said &mdash; I am open to correction if I misquote him &mdash; that he is in favour of many of the recommendations of Spinelli.  I think that is a fair recollection of what he said.  He went through his speech very quickly: I do not know how he could get through up to 40 pages in 45 minutes when the average reading speed of any Member is about two minutes to two and a half minutes per page of script.  It is difficult to understand what the Taoiseach says.</P>
    <P>With regard to Spinelli, he should be more specific and tell us exactly where he agrees with Spinelli.  Does he agree with giving the Parliament more powers and, if so, in what way?  Will he spell out the implications of this so far as this Parliament, Governments and the Council of Foreign Ministers are concerned?  He did not go as far as President Mitterrand of France who said he agrees with everything in Spinelli.  I do not know: I can only ask the Taoiseach about the Spinelli report.</P>
    <P>Naturally all of us would like to see a stronger Parliament, one that would be listened to more carefully.  I have been to the European Parliament and I have had the privilege of being on the Council of Foreign Ministers.  I know the way they treat motions that come from the European Parliament.  In the European Parliament I watched how members of the Commission treated questions or submissions made by the Parliament.  There is room for tremendous improvement there.  As there is a strong link at present between Spinelli and Dooge, we want to know far more than what we have been told because the truth is we have not been told much.  Matters have been touched on but it has been all very vague.  I am not casting any reflection on the people who put this script together for the Taoiseach. One can only lead a horse to water; one cannot make him drink the water.  If we are to have any input in what <Col N="1999" /> is involved by way of decisions on the Spinelli and Dooge reports we have not been told.  We do not know the views of the Government on the matter.  It is the responsibility of the Government to put forward their proposals and to have them discussed.</P>
    <P>I am open to correction on the following for the reasons I have given previously, but I did not hear the Taoiseach spell out clearly what in his view has gone wrong.  He did not tell us why things have not come right for us in Europe.  We do not know if the remedies suggested by the Dooge Committee will deal with the situation.  I am not happy about that.  We would want to know more about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that, like Deputy Collins, I have 30 minutes to speak.  At the outset I wish to state that I am expressing a view on behalf of my party on this matter. This series of statements is of unique importance to this Parliament because of many of the issues raised.</P>
      <P>The Labour Party welcome this debate.  It is essential that there should be an informed and extensive debate on all aspects of the future development of the European Community.  Over the years we have as a nation failed to engage in serious analysis and discussion of the Community's purpose and policies, preferring to indulge in rhetoric, assertion and shortsighted pursuit of narrow sectional goals.</P>
      <P>Only the Labour Party have been prepared to publish their policies and analysis in details and to debate them openly and I say that more in sadness than with any sense of pride.  In 1971, in 1978, in 1984 and again this year the Labour Party have published comprehensive policy documents on Europe and in them have set out a clear, consistent and principled approach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2000" /> Most recently, the Leader of the Labour Party and the Tánaiste indicated our stance on the key issues now arising within the Community in his major address to the 14th Congress of the Confederation of Socialist Parties in the EC, which took place in Madrid.  That speech attracted much attention in Ireland for its references to neutrality but it ranged over many other crucial and topical issues, spelling out Labour's viewpoint very precisely.</P>
    <P>We see the report of the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee for Institutional Affairs, known as the Dooge Committee, as a document of the greatest political importance and we recognise the depth of thought that has gone into its preparation.  It is a report worthy of a serious response and it is not to be dismissed by recourse to slogans or to conspiracy theories, which characterised the statement of the Leader of The Workers' Party this morning.  It raises real political issues &mdash; indeed real political choices and challenges &mdash; and it must be faced up to carefully, critically and on the basis of some basic principles.  I want to state three basic points of principle from Labour's standpoint at the outset.</P>
    <P>First, Labour accept that the European Community as it is today must move on to a new phase of development. As the party's 1984 policy statement says: &ldquo;The Community desperately needs a new approach and a new impetus.  Ireland, within the Community, equally requires such a new beginning.  Labour is committed to the pursuit of the policies which can bring this about.&rdquo;  In his Madrid speech, the Leader of the party made the same point when referring to the need for positive initiatives within the Community. He stated that: &ldquo;Labour is committed to working for the changes needed to bring about these advances.&rdquo;  The Labour Party are not negative about the Community or about its development. We want a more dynamic and effective Community but we do not want it for its own sake.</P>
    <P>My second point of principle relates to the purpose of the Community itself.  I <Col N="2001" /> can quote from the party's 1984 policy statement in which it is stated that:</P>
    <P>Labour continues to hold fast to the conviction that only a European Community which can give reality to the aspirations of its people for jobs, for a secure future, for peace, for social justice and for an adequate response to the world's development problems can guarantee the future of democracy and unification within and among its member states.  It is only through policies built upon the principles of socialism and related directly to the aspirations outlined above that the Community can have a future of progress and development, and such a future is vitally necessary for the people of the Member states.</P>
    <P>That is a point of the most fundamental principle to which I shall return.</P>
    <P>Thirdly, we cannot separate our consideration of the Dooge report and of the evolving debate on European Union from the realities and demands of our policy of positive neutrality.  Labour's 1978 Policy Statement on Ireland and the European Community contained the following emphatic statement:</P>
    <P>It must be stressed that commitment to the entire complex process of creating a socialist basis for the future of the Community does not imply any diminution of Ireland's long-standing neutral position.  Indeed, it is the position of the Labour Party that the largely pragmatic basis of our neutrality should be strengthened by a firm acceptance of a non-aligned position in world politics and a refusal to contemplate involvement in any form of military alliance.  Above all there can be no question of Ireland becoming aligned to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation or any military organisation.</P>
    <P>Neutrality should imply a whole range of approaches to the main issues of international politics.  In particular, it means that there must be a total commitment to the pursuits of <i>detente</i> and world peace &mdash; a rejection of any <Col N="2002" /> form of involvement in the sordid armaments trade which has brought so much misery to the world for the sake of financial profit &mdash; and a positive contribution to the necessary process of world development.</P>
    <P>Only a country which is clearly seen to be independent of the entanglements of military alliances can play an acceptable role in the struggle for a new international economic order.</P>
    <P>That is Labour's continuing and unequivocal standpoint.</P>
    <P>Noting carefully these three points of principle as the starting place of Labour's approach, I wish to outline our approach and response to the Dooge report and to the total European debate by reference to a number of crucial matters of concern.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the present debate is tending to centre upon certain economic issues and upon related institutional matters. These require some comment.  I wish in this connection to quote directly from the recent Madrid speech of our party leader, the Tánaiste, who said:</P>
    <P>We see the new impetus towards European Union and the wide political debate which has come about as a result of the Spinelli initiative, the Draft Treaty on European Union and the Report of the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs as potentially positive developments in so far as they rest upon principles such as democracy, concern for jobs and social justice and genuine concern for peace.  But in considering these moves we must not lose sight of the disturbing fact that Europe today is characterised by the strength of rightwing ideologies and even by the re-emergence of undisguised fascism.  We must never allow ourselves to fall victim to the temptation that the creation of structures will achieve our ends.  The political forces which control these structures are of vital concern and we must not permit the future Europe to have within its structures the potential for rightwing domination.  Basic elements of balance and firm guarantees for certain rights <Col N="2003" /> must be locked into any new European structures.</P>
    <P>Specifically on the economic and social front I must emphasise that a Common Market founded on market forces alone is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable in principle and in practice since it works against the interests of regions which have suffered &mdash; and suffer now in this period of recession &mdash; from disadvantages of geography and infrastructure, from lack of resources and from past exploitation.  While the goal of realisation of the Community's internal market is understandable and logical it does contain the threat that unfettered market forces will exacerbate the already great &mdash; and still increasing &mdash; differences between the developed and less developed regions.  Our experience in the Community since 1973 makes this a matter of painful experience, not a theory.</P>
    <P>I must state at this Congress that the Labour Party deeply regrets the absence from the documents to which I have referred of an adequate response to this problem.  The Congress Resolution, on the other hand, does stress the need for adequate regional and social policies and I welcome this evidence of socialist realism. However, Labour cannot support the concept of European Union unless the economic and social policies of the Union &mdash; and the institutions and laws which will underpin them &mdash;are so designed as to present growing regional imbalances and to promote and achieve growing convergence in living standards and levels of employment.</P>
    <P>This is a very firm statement.  We mean it because it is a fact &mdash; and beyond question &mdash; that in the present Community regional policy and regional development can be seen as no more than a crude form of social welfare or dole.  We are insistent that this failed and discredited level of policy must be replaced by a totally new policy in which regional development and convergence will be an integral element of Community policy <Col N="2004" /> and, indeed, a political commitment.</P>
    <P>A common market based purely on market forces is not only unacceptable to socialists in principle but also unacceptable in fact as it works against the interests of those regions which suffer from disadvantages of distance, lack of resources, weak infrastructure, insufficiently developed markets or past exploitation. In these circumstances, unfettered market forces simply exacerbate the differences over time between the developed and underdeveloped regions, as has happened in the European Community since Irish entry.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party note that neither the report of the European Parliament nor that of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee address this problem at all and, accordingly, state that they cannot support the European Union unless its economic policies and the institutions which will implement them incorporate, are actively designed to prevent growing disparities between the regions and are positively intended to bring about growing convergence in living standards and levels of employment.  Such policies must be transferred from the arena of social compensation policies, which are in truth regarded by the richer and bigger economies as Euro-social welfare, into an integral part of the European Union's economic policies.  Labour regard these as an essential programme which stands to benefit substantially the underdeveloped regions of the Community's Mediterranean basin and congratulate in particular the Socialist Government of Greece for insisting on their adoption as a condition for further progress.  Based on precisely the same principle, the Labour Party state that their support for European Union is based on a demand for an equivalent Community instrument, to be known as the Integrated North Western Programmes, to cover the whole island of Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  This programme should have similar resources devoted to it as the Mediterranean Programmes but, in any case, shall not be less than a figure equal to half the Public Capital Programme on a year by year basis for a period of ten years.  Only a resource transfer of this magnitude will <Col N="2005" /> create an economic balance between the exploited periphery and the developed core of the European Union which will in turn lead to greater social justice and political cohesion.  Without such a transfer the European Union will ultimately fail to meet its objectives, as has the European Community.</P>
    <P>In this connection, Labour support strongly the arguments set out in Chapter II A (a) of the Dooge report which indicate very clearly that the forming of new policies &mdash; such as a genuinely integrated regional policy &mdash; will entail additional resource transfers within the Community. As Dooge states:</P>
    <P>such resources would be made available in the context of a clearly identifable Community financing system firmly based on the own resource principle.  This system should endow the Community with a stable revenue base for a sufficiently long period.</P>
    <P>It is also clear that the future development of the economic and social aspects of the Community is dependent upon the proper working of the institutions and decision making systems which have been clogged up and reduced to near immobility in recent years.  Labour believe that the institutions of the Community must be developed and further diversified and we welcome the new sense of urgency in this regard which at last seems to be shared by many of the political forces and leadership groups within the member states.</P>
    <P>At the centre of the institutional debate lies the vexed question of the so-called veto.  We recognise that the Luxembourg accord has become the cause of an unforeseen and unacceptable level of delay and frustration in decision making. For every highly-publicised incident like the super-levy crisis or the cereals prices hold up this year there are hundreds of situations within the multiplicity of committees that discuss detailed policy where the veto approach is used to hold up progress, often in the interest of the bigger member states or of the multinational companies.  It cannot be denied <Col N="2006" /> that there is urgent need to free the system and to introduce a more rational and flexible element into decision making.  Labour will support any reasonable approach in this area.</P>
    <P>However, I must, in this connection, draw the attention of the House to the words of my party Leader, speaking in Madrid where he said:</P>
    <P>I must here also sound a word of warning.  Given the concerns which I have just indicated about the regional issue, you will recognise that it is of profound and vital interest to Ireland and to the Labour Party that any reform of institutions will ensure that in no circumstances and in no area of concern will the legitimate and vital interests of any member state be over ridden by temporary cobbled, majorities. Union will be a meaningless and devalued word, if in Europe, it can mean the hegemony of the biggest and rechest.  If on the other hand, it can be seen to encompass fully the ideal of solidarity it will be a positive and widely supported concept for all Europeans.</P>
    <P>We have no doubt that a new and constructive approach in this area is possible given goodwill on all sides.  This important issue has been discussed in detail by the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities in their Report, No. 14, on the Draft Treaty for European Unity.</P>
    <P>I have taken note of the comments made by the Opposition spokesman on Foreign Affairs, Deputy Collins, in relation to the discussion of these reports in his capacity as chairman of that committee. I hope the House will be able in the future to afford time to discuss the important work of that committee of which I was once a member.  In their very comprehensive and balanced discussion of all aspects of Community issues, the joint committee, at paragraph 65, make the valid point that &ldquo;the need for the Council to act with unanimity is in accordance with the Treaties but is the result of subsequent political action and recognises that majority voting would <Col N="2007" /> enable the Community to speed up its decision making and embark upon new programmes of activity&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>However, at paragraph 66, the committee very rightly assert that &ldquo;agreement to abide by the will of the majority presupposes a high level of common interest and mutual support.  The Joint Committee therefore considers that any eventual phasing-out of the veto must follow the introduction of an effective redistributive mechanism which shows a high level of solidarity from the strong to the weaker&rdquo;.  That is a principle with which the Labour Party are clearly in agreement.</P>
    <P>On this question of the veto it is very significant that Senator Dooge himself entered a very clear reservation to the text of his committee's report and argued that it should have contained, in his own words, &ldquo;an explicit reference to the protection of vital national interests in exceptional circumstances&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his comprehensive statement at the outset of the discussions, the Taoiseach made reference to that area and discussed in clear and explicit terms how it should be operated, how it could operate in a manner that would recognise the vital interest of member states without at the same time clogging up, as happens now, all of the decision making process throughout the various committees and Councils of the Community.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the question of Irish neutrality.  Ireland's neutrality is one of the most fundamental aspects of Labour's political stance.  Our position on neutrality goes back to the period of the outbreak of the First World War and to James Connolly's avowal of Irish neutrality in that struggle of the great powers.  Labour's policy on neutrality has been stated again and again in terms of basic principle and of positive political approach.  As the Tanaiste stated in Madrid: &ldquo;It is not negotiable in any way or in any setting.  The unique contribution which an actively neutral Ireland can make to the reduction of international tensions, and to the promotion of world <Col N="2008" /> peace must be recognised and respected&rdquo;. He went on to make the point that: &ldquo;We must work together to make our community a factor for peace and justice in the world.  Part of the Community which has this world responsibility is a neutral Ireland.  Our neutrality is a positive thing&mdash;an assertion of our independence and of our determination to work for true and peaceful development in the world on the basis of clear principles and political openness outside any form of entanglements in military alliances.  Our neutrality is not conditional, nor is it a convenience&mdash;it is fundamental to our political stance&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>At this year's annual conference in Cork, the Labour Party adopted a major policy statement on Ireland and world peace in which the question of neutrality is dealt with at length.</P>
    <P>The debate that is taking place here on the eve of the Milan Summit is of major importance because, as the Taoiseach has stated in outlining the Government's position of support for the intergovernmental meeting proposed to be held some time later this year, at that meeting the impetus for renewing Europe and for going towards the next stage in some form of European union will be given added strength and added support, certainly from the original six members and possibly from two others but certainly including Ireland.  The Labour Party welcome that impetus.  We welcome the renewed drive for an integrated social Europe.</P>
    <P>In relation to the points made by Deputy Collins on the question of the issues that concern ordinary Europeans &mdash; primarily those are employment and social security in the broadest sense &mdash; during my time as a member of the Council of Ministers for Social Affairs and also during our period of the Presidency, I sought and got agreement to make unemployment the major issue confronting that Council.  That was the stance adopted also by the Taoiseach at full Council level during the Irish Presidency.  So far as Labour are concerned, unless we attain an integrated European Union in economic terms, our capacity to provide <Col N="2009" /> employment for all our citizens whether in Ireland, France or Germany will be seriously, if not totally, diminished.</P>
    <P>Clearly, the different member states, whether socialist France, Thatcherite Britain or any other, can no longer on their own, in pursuit of their own national policies, achieve the objective of full employment, an objective that is shared by all the member states and of course by all the Members of this House.  If there is a lesson to be learned from the past five or six years, and in the aftermath of the 1979 second oil crisis, it is that the capacity for European Governments at regional or national level to provide an economic framework within which substantial, if not full, employment can be achieved no longer exists within the framework of the EC as it is at present. A broadening out and an integrating of the Community is a prerequisite for such renewed economic initiative.</P>
    <P>However, it is simply not sufficient to believe that an integrated market on its own, without checks or balances, will provide the levels of employment that are required in those areas where the unemployed are located, unless there is a conscious choice on the part of the leaders of the Community to make available the substantial transfer of resources required to correct the historic and geographical imbalances that exist within the EC.</P>
    <P>We have already heard from the Taoiseach that the calculations of various study groups in the past estimate that something of the order of 5 per cent of own resources would be needed to make that kind of objective a reality.  At present we are operating on the enlarged ceiling of 1.4 per cent of own resources. There have already been indications this year that at least 1.35 per cent of that capacity will be absorbed, when once again we will be right up to the very edge of limitations in relation to the amount of transfer funds which are available to make a reality out of the social objectives of Europe.</P>
    <P>I personally welcome this debate.  I welcome it on behalf of my party and I welcome the participation of all political <Col N="2010" /> parties.  In 1972-73 the Labour Party opposed entry to the EC on the grounds that the conditions then prevailing, the terms of our entry, were detrimental to the interests of Irish workers in general and to the Irish community in the broader sense.  A referendum was held and 83 per cent of the population voted for membership of the Community.  On the evening on which that result was announced the Leader of the Labour Party, Mr. Brendan Corish, indicated that it was then the responsibility of the Labour Party to work within the Community, to maximise the advantages for Ireland and endeavour to achieve the objectives which could be achieved within the framework of a united Europe.</P>
    <P>That is our position today.  We must move to the next stage of integration and release much of the frustrated energies which have been locked up for too long within the EC because of difficulties in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy, to enlargement and to the contributions and payments from the United Kingdom.  Those three areas, which have characterised immobility within the Community, by and large, have been satisfactorily resolved.  I support the Taoiseach in his contribution in this respect. We are indebted to Altiero Spinelli for having reinvigorated a sense of purpose and commitment to an integrated Europe in his Draft Treaty Report which emerged from the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>We may get frustrated and annoyed at the slowness of progress within the European Community.  I do frequently. I know Deputy O'Kennedy with his experience as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Finance, with his intimate knowledge of the Community at that level and his knowledge as a Commissioner in Brussels will be aware in a much more meaningful way than most other people in this House of just how frustrating is the slowness of decision-making. But we should take stock of how far we have travelled already in the last 30 to 40 years.</P>
    <P>We should not take it for granted that we can, for the first time in 1,000 years on this Continent, confidently say that we <Col N="2011" /> will never again go to war against each other, that we can now confidently say that within the states of Spain, Greece, Portugal, Germany and Italy we shall never again see dictatorships, as was the reality within the living memory of people in this House.  We should recognise the fact that we have for the first time ever a democratically elected European Parliament which contains the seeds of a force for integration and unity which should not be discounted but rather celebrated.</P>
    <P>It is with a note of optimism that we approach the end of this century.  As far as I am concerned there is no doubt but that we shall see an integrated European Union that will have within itself the resources and capacity to provide full employment and social security for all of the 320 million citizens who at present reside within that enlarged Community. It is within that Community that the Republic of Ireland, with its population of just under 4,000,000, has an absolutely unrivalled opportunity to participate freely, openly and publicly within a market of that dimension in such a way that, if we have the will and the energy, there is no reason we cannot secure an adequate standard of living and full employment for all of the people of this island.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There has been a tradition in this House, when discussing matters of external policy in which we are deeply involved, to endeavour to find a common purpose which will strengthen the hand of our Government in negotiating within the European Community to advance our interests within that Community and within the principles of the Community itself.  There has been a tradition that, where possible, we speak with one voice.  There has been the understandable principle particularly that the Government speak with one voice.  Both of those traditions have already been breached by the Taoiseach this morning and now by the Minister for Labour who has just spoken.  In the course of his very general and, I have to say, vague analysis, the Taoiseach ignored some of the most <Col N="2012" /> important principles that have been enunciated in the European Community, particularly within the past five to ten years.  This latest Milan Summit, follows many others, many of which I attended. There will be another report, other proposals that may or may not be adopted in what the Taoiseach has acknowledged is a fluid state of discussion at this point. He failed to address himself to the reasons why coming up to a European Summit, we are not at a stage of real development within the Community.</P>
      <P>For the first time in the House we heard a Minister of the Government draw a clear distinction between the policy of the Government, as he sees it, or the Fine Gael element in the Government, and that of the Labour Party.  At the end of his remarks, clearly signposting the position of the Labour Party, the Minister for Labour suggested that he would support the Taoiseach in his contribution in respect of some references to the need for economic conversions.  But in every other direction of the Minister who has just spoken was clearly distancing the Labour Party as much as possible from a Government position.  The important thing is that as our Head of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs attend this weekend summit in Milan, they are ready to be greeted with statements they have made in this House to weaken Ireland's case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me begin with the Taoiseach's statements which already weaken Ireland's case as we approach this summit in Milan, indeed not just Ireland's case, but what we have always pursued in promoting the European Community we joined, based on economic policies leading to economic cohesion, and a political union following economic cohesion.  In the course of his remarks the Taoiseach spent a considerable amount of time pointing out the immeasurable benefits to us since we joined the European Community, pointing out particularly that more than any other member state, we have benefited in terms of net measurable transfers.  I never thought I would hear from a Taoiseach going to a European <Col N="2013" /> summit of Heads of Government a recognition which can and will be used against him that the principle of <i>juste retour</i>&mdash; of a fair return for what one puts in will emerge &mdash; has now assumed a new eminence in Ireland.</P>
    <P>We always opposed as a measure of European Community benefit the relationship between what one puts in and what one gets out.  We always insisted that that was not a guide to the opportunities and obligations of member states. Yet this morning the Taoiseach set out in great detail that we are the most significant beneficiary of EC membership in terms of net measurable transfers.  In case his colleagues attending the summit will not have an argument to beat over his head, he goes further when he says:</P>
    <P>I realise that other member states gain substantial advantages e.g. from the Customs Union, advantages which cannot so easily be segregated but if we limit ourselves &mdash; because we have to &mdash; to net measurable transfers, those to Ireland are ten times greater than to &mdash; or from &mdash; most other member states, amounting to 3.9 per cent of our GDP in 1983, compared with 0.19 per cent to Italy, 0.2 per cent to The Netherlands, 0.4 per cent to Denmark and net transfers the other way from Germany, France and the UK amounting to 0.4 per cent, 0.04 per cent and 0.19 per cent, respectively of GDP.</P>
    <P>Are we here beginning to argue in favour of the case of those, particularly the UK who have put a brake on the development of the European Community over the past ten years in particular?  We have our Taoiseach, before going to attend the Milan Summit, pointing out that the British are net contributors to a considerable extent while we are net and significant beneficiaries.  The principle of <i>juste retour</i> has not only been adumbrated for the first time in this House by a man who always proclaimed to be a great European, but he has underlined the case of members states, and particularly the UK, who have deprived the European Community of realising the fundamental aims set out in the Treaties and which existed <Col N="2014" /> When we joined under the Treaty of Accession.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he has considered the comments made by the Chairman of the Association of Higher Civil Servants, Mr. James O'Brien, at the Association's recent Annual Delegate Conference, suggesting the introduction of a Public Information Act to dispel much of the unnecessary secrecy surrounding the work of the Civil Service; if the Government have any plans to introduce such legislation; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have had the general subject of wider public access to information held by public bodies under consideration for some time.  Legislation to govern such access could impinge on the Official Secrets Act and would require prior consultation with all the authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will be aware that the Joint Committee on Legislation has recently decided to consider the necessity for a Freedom of Information Act and has invited submissions from interested persons or organisations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that the Joint Committee on Legislation are considering this question.  I am asking the Minister what is his attitude to a Freedom of Information Act?  Does the Minister agree with the statement of the chairman <Col N="2015" /> of the Association of Higher Civil Servants that this would help to create more openness in Government and that it could also lead to greater efficiency in the Civil Service by virtue of the fact that their activities would be more open to public scrutiny?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a number of factors to be taken into account when considering the question of having wider public access to information held by public bodies.  All of those are under consideration in my Department and in other Departments which have an interest in the matter.  Obviously the review which has presently been commissioned by the Joint Committee on Legislation will have an important bearing in helping the Government to come to a decision on this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is again trying to evade the issue by using the Joint Committee on Legislation.  The Minister promised a White Paper on the Civil Service.  Will he produce this paper or will he wait for the Joint Committee on Legislation to consider what he should do?  Will the Minister tell us what is his attitude in regard to a reform of the Civil Service?  Does the Minister believe it would be a good thing to have more freedom of information and in this connection does he think therefore that the Official Secrets Act should be looked at and altered?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of a review of the Official Secrets Act would not be primarily for me in my ministerial responsibility.  The question of a Freedom of Information Act would have relevance for me in my sphere of responsibility but it would also have connotations for a wide range of public bodies.  From that point of view it is necessary to get the views of the personnel concerned and to ascertain in what way the matter might best be approached.  It was in that context that I suggested that the investigation or review which the Joint Committee on Legislation have just recently initiated will be very helpful <Col N="2016" /> in allowing the Government to come to a reasonable conclusion on this matter. In relation to the Deputy's query regarding the White Paper on the Public Service the Deputy can expect to be edified by its publication and his perusal of it within the next few weeks.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service the total cost of providing the phone-in service on the Budget, 1985; the number of people involved; their rank and the Departments from which they were drawn, including people from Bord Telecom Éireann; the duration of the phone-in service and the cost of media advertising of the service; the number of consultants employed and the firms they represented, if any; the total amount of moneys due to consultants for their service; and the number of people who availed of the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which the Deputy seeks is as follows: The cost of the Freefone Budget Information Service which was provided under the auspices of the Government Information Services was approximately £30,500, excluding VAT.</P>
      <P>Approximately 56 Civil Service staff were involved in providing the service on a rota basis.  They were drawn from the Departments of Agriculture, Environment, Finance, Public Service, Social Welfare, Taoiseach and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The grades ranged from clerical to executive and administrative.  Telecom Éireann provided technical facilities at a specified global cost.</P>
      <P>The service was provided on the Thursday, Friday and Monday following the budget on Wednesday, 30 January 1985. No consultants were employed.  Approximately 14,000 calls were processed during the three days of the service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to each of the three questions the answer would be no. The situation is probably highlighted quite well by the fact, if the Deputy casts his mind back to the previous question, that Deputy Mac Giolla suggested that there should be greater access to information held by public bodies; yet now Deputy Wallace seems to be suggesting that the Government ought not make information available regarding one of the most important events of the year, the annual budget.  I would have thought that the plethora of comment emanating from many sources in the immediate aftermath of the budget could sometimes have the effect of confusing the general public as to the implications of the budget which is quite a complex document from the point of view of the general public. The fact that 14,000 calls were received and processed during the three days of the service is evidence and proof that this service was welcomed by the general public and availed of very widely by them.  My only regret is that greater information services are not made available by Government Departments on all aspects and facts of Government services.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that the phone-in cost was £30,500.  Has he any figure for the total wages cost of officials?  I do not think it is sufficient to say that they were seconded from other <Col N="2019" /> Departments.  They still had to be paid and I would like to have a figure for that. Also, is the Minister satisfied&mdash;he seems to indicate that he is&mdash;that the exercise was worthwhile?  We can all have our views on that and I am doubtful about it. In the likely event of a supplementary budget being introduced will the same facility be accorded in the days immediately after the supplementary budget?</P>

      <P>We all accept and everybody knows that there is a shortage of staff in various Departments.  Is it not extraordinary that we could pluck some people out to do this exercise?  Is the Minister satisfied that the secondment of staff from various Departments did not leave any void in those Departments?  If such is arising, will he ensure that in the <Col N="2020" /> event of this exercise taking place again the plucking out of staff from the various Departments will not affect adversely the performance of the Departments?</P>

The Deputy can be satisfied that the staff came from five or six different Departments and the Offices of the Revenue Commissioners, and their absence did not in any way impinge on the normal working of those Departments.</P>

      <P>The total number of posts left unfilled as a result of the one-inthree embargo in the non-industrial Civil Service is 2,900.  The general question of the arrangements to apply in future in relation to the control of Civil Service numbers is being considered in the context of the proposed White Paper on the <Col N="2022" /> Public Service.  The operation of the onein-three embargo is being reviewed as part of that exercise.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that the embargo as it applies at the moment is a very blunt instrument and is causing severe shortages in some parts of the public service, particularly in the Revenue Commissioners and in the teaching and nursing areas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all, I should clarify that the figure I have given in relation to the embargo applies only to the Civil Service, which is the area in which I have direct responsibility for the implementation of the embargo.  I agree that the embargo is a blunt instrument and I was probably the first person to so describe it publicly.  The single merit it has had in the three or four years since its introduction is that it has worked and has been effective in reducing numbers in comparison to any other scheme which was attempted previously when all such attempts were unsuccessful.  It is interesting to reflect that for the first time since the Second World War the numbers of the Civil Service in real terms have reduced in the last few years.  We have endeavoured where a particular need was identified to deploy staff from other areas.  On one occasion during the lifetime of the embargo additional staff of the order of 110 were redeployed from other Departments to the staff of the Revenue Commissioners.  The Deputy may recall having had a discussion in the House previously.  It is as well also for the House to realise that the staff of the Revenue Commissioners amount to some 7,000 or almost one quarter of the total Civil Service.  Obviously, from the overall numbers within the Revenue Commissioners one would hope that it should be within the compass of the management in the Revenue Commissioners to deploy staff into the areas where the need and demand are greatest at any given time.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that this blanket imposition of the <Col N="2023" /> embargo has caused frightful decisions to be made in some cases and that some allowance should be made for exceptional cases?  Is the Minister aware that in the administrative staff of Kildare VEC the staff numbers have gone down by 13 per cent and the number of pupils and the workload have gone up by 46 per cent?  Does he not agree that that is ridiculous&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>The number of occasions on which incidents of one kind or another occurred involving Irish troops serving with UNIFIL in the 12 months ended 19 June 1985 was forty-eight.  Thirty-six of these incidents have occured this year.  Irish troops or positions came under fire on twenty-five occasions.  The incidents arose mainly from the activities of Israeli-backed militia, unknown gunmen, and on two occasions the Israeli Defence Forces in the area of operations patrolled by the Irish contingent.</P>
      <P>Our troops are issued with the most modern range of weapons and equipment and I am fully satisfied that their training and equipment provide very adequately for their protection.  The Government continue to monitor developments in South Lebanon and will take whatever measures are necessary to ensure the safety and welfare of our troops.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister indicate whether the question of the mandate under which the troops are operating has been reviewed and whether it is proposed to change it from a peace-keeping to a peace-enforcing mandate?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the review of the mandate would not be a matter for me or the Government.  It would be a matter for the United Nations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>As a member of the United Nations and a country supplying troops, I presume that if the mandate is to be reviewed we will be consulted about it.  Has the question of the mandate been raised or reviewed by the United Nations or have we been consulted about it in any way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any specific proposal to review the terms of the mandate.  I understand it is a matter which is kept under review on a continuing basis.  The troop contributing countries meet informally through their representatives at the United Nations <Col N="2031" /> and I am sure this is one of the matters they discuss from time to time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that 48 incidents involving attacks on Irish troops while on peace-keeping duties in foreign fields is a very serious matter.  Have any representations been made to the United Nations through our representative to have the troop supplying countries called together to review the situation and the mandate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Whenever an incident occurs it is protested.  There are various channels for these protests.  There is direct diplomatic protest by us to the Israeli Government, if that is relevant.  It is protested by the UN people on the ground and in the case of very serious incidents it may be raised formally at the United Nations.  The troop contributing countries keep in close touch through their permanent representatives in New York and the mandate and the general conduct of the operation in Lebanon is kept consultantly under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>It seems that there were 25 occasions on which Irish forces were attacked by militia during the past six months or so.  Would the Minister agree that these are illegal uniformed groups financed by the Israeli authorities and could he give any indication of the steps the Government have taken to bring this to the notice of the Israeli authorities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to clarify the position. The Deputy mentioned that Irish troops came under fire on 25 occasions. On many of those occasions there was crossfire in the area where they had outposts. That is not to say that Irish troops came under direct fire.  I want to make that quite clear.  Whenever an incident occurs involving the local militia, and the local people are satisfied that these militia are under the control or influence of the Israeli defence forces, appropriate representations are made to the appropriate Israeli authorities.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>One of those incidents was well published because it took place under the cameras of Independent Television network.  Gunfire was directed not at but in the general area where there was an Irish patrol.  The other incident involved crossfire between an Israeli patrol and some target they had identified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The involvement of the Israeli authorities has very serious implications since Israel is a member of the United Nations.  In view of the fact that the Israeli authorities appear to have ignored protests by the Government and have continued to back the SLA, has the question of these attacks been raised at United Nations level or is it proposed to raise it there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be wrong to call them all attacks but these hostile confrontations are raised as a matter of course at appropriate level, whether at diplomatic level between the two countries, at UN level in the area of operations or at the UN in New York.  They are constantly raised and protested.  Generally our experience is that the protests have the effect of claming the situation.</P>

      <P>A final question from Deputy Treacy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious situation from an Irish point of view. Can the Minister indicate whether he, the Taoiseach or the Government made formal complaints to the President of Israel, Chaim Hertzog, on his recent visit here, particularly since there was a very severe attack on Irish forces at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to exaggerate or minimise the nature of these incidents but many of them are hostile <Col N="2033" /> confrontations, no more than that. Occasionally they have escalated to something more.  They are protested in the normal diplomatic way.  A formal protest was not made to the Israeli President when he was here because he is a constitutional President.  As a matter of protocol, it would not be appropriate to make a formal protest to him and it would not be his place to receive such a protest. I have no doubt, however, that he became fully aware of what took place and our reaction to it.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he is satisfied with the situation whereby almost all members of the Defence Forces who go abroad for training go to NATO countries; if he has examined the possibility of more use being made of other neutral or non-aligned countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply was very unsatisfactory.  As a neutral country, does the Minister agree that when our Army are trained in NATO countries they are not alone given arms training but are indoctrinated with regard to the sources of attacks, etc?  Would it not be better to have our forces trained in a neutral country which would not be under the NATO umbrella and would give us an idea of how we should operate as a neutral country in time of war?  As we are not associated with any of the warring nations, this is the type of training our Army should be getting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the Defence Forces go abroad to gain experience in military techniques and I am satisfied that there is no question of indoctrination <Col N="2034" /> when they go on courses in NATO countries. It is arrant nonsense to suggest otherwise.  In the Eastern Bloc political indoctrination is part and parcel of the Soviet technique and armies in that part of the world, but they are not applied to armies in the West.  I am satisfied that, for reasons of particality, our troops and personnel of the Defence Forces who go abroad attend courses that best suit the requirements necessary at any particular time.  Their presence in NATO does not in any way prejudice our neutral position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister seriously saying that the armies of Ireland, Britain or the United States are not indoctrinated?  Are there no indoctrination courses here, in Britain, the United States and West Germany where our troops train?  Nobody seriously believes that armies are not indoctrinated.  Would it not be better, therefore, if Sweden or Switzerland were selected as the areas for continuous training of our armed forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that in the case of a neutral country like ourselves, which does not have the vast economic resources of other members of NATO, we are putting our soldiers in an invidious position by sending them there to be trained, because the arms and the armaments are of a much higher level than are available at home? The fact that they are being trained by NATO personnel puts them in a position where they would desire to have access to the same type of armaments &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister stated that the location of training is selected on the basis of the best available. What criteria is used to make such a decision?  Is he suggesting that neutral countries of Western Europe are less efficient, less effective or less well trained than NATO countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>We send our personnel to the countries that provide the most suitable courses for our personnel.  A number of factors are taken into account in our decision.  One factor is the cost involved and the nearest country to which we can send our troops on courses is Great Britain.  Another factor taken into account is language as courses have to be in English.  English must be the language of instructors and students, so that also is a limiting factor.  Much of our equipment is purchased from countries that are members of NATO and Western countries and it is often necessary to send personnel on courses in the operation and maintenance of equipment to keep abreast of technological changes.  These factors are all taken into consideration and obviously they will predetermine to some extent where these courses will take place.  There is no particularly rigid policy as to where they will go.  If there are suitable courses in non-NATO countries, they are taken up.  For example, this year personnel will go on courses to Switzerland, Sweden and Austria, so there is no rigid policy.  Wherever there is a suitable course, and having regard to all the factors determining suitability, we will send our Defence Forces there without any hang-ups.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence if he considers it appropriate that uniformed Civil Defence personnel should be used for security purposes at public meetings of local authorities; the training Civil Defence personnel get in relation to these duties; and if he will made a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not the practice that uniformed Civil Defence personnel are used for security purposes and I do not consider it appropriate that they should be so used; they are not trained for security purposes.</P>
      <P>The Deputy obviously has in mind a specific incident, involving Limerick city Civil Defence personnel, concerning which he put down a previous written question in March 1985.  I was subsequently assured, and so informed the Deputy, that the personnel were not used as security men on that occasion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is correct in saying that I am referring to the Limerick incident.  Is the Minister aware that on the occasion referred to&mdash; I have a letter from a member of the public which I can give him&mdash;the Civil Defence personnel refused entry to the public to the council chamber on 4 March 1985?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of that. My information is that they were there in a stewarding role to assist in controlling the crowds which were expected.  It is quite possible that in discharging that role they had to refuse or restrict admission into a chamber which was overcrowded.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2037" /> Obviously, as the Deputy appreciates, one man's security might be another man's stewarding and it could be a difficult border line to establish.  I would not be altogether happy to see Civil Defence personnel in a role that could lead to ambiguity in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate that the Minister is taking that view of the matter because I am also unhappy that Civil Defence could be used in that way. Is the Minister aware that some of the Civil Defence personnel were present without uniform, that one of them was inside the chamber on the occasion and had the control of locking and unlocking the door, that the chamber was empty at the time and the personnel outside the door, in fact, physically manhandled a member of the public who attempted to open the door?  Does the Minister consider that that person acted in a security fashion rather than in a crowd control fashion?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of the details to which the Deputy has referred but certainly I imagine that if any question of manhandling arose I would have heard about it loudly and long before now.  I would certainly deprecate anything like that.  If there is a case where there could be any ambiguity as to the nature of their role I would prefer that Civil Defence personnel would not be present.  Certainly, whenever they are present in a marshalling or crowd control role it is essential that they be in uniform.</P>

      <P>The provision of housing is primarily a matter for the local authorities. Members of the Defence Forces have an equal claim on such housing with other members of the community in the same category.</P>
      <P>My Department continues to provide accommodation for members of the Permanent Defence Force to supplement the efforts of the local authorities in areas where soldiers' needs are greatest.  The extent to which such accommodation can be provided and maintained by my Department is determined by the level of the resources available for that purpose.</P>
      <P>The relevant provisions in the Estimates for Defence for 1985 amount to £8.35 million for building works, an increase of 37 per cent on the 1984 outturn. Of this, approximately one quarter is expected to be spent on housing accommodation.</P>

      <P>Is it not a matter for the Minister, and the Defence Force, to ensure that adequate accommodation is available for serving personnel?  It <Col N="2039" /> appears that only £2 million is available for Army housing this year and I should like to know if the Minister will accept that in a number of barracks personnel are in dire need of renovated or new houses?  What plans has the Minister to expedite the provision of these facilities for personnel in 1985?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make it clear, as I thought I did in my reply, that the provision of housing is primarily a matter for local authorities.  It is not a case of the Minister for Defence providing houses.  Members of the Defence Force should be treated like all other citizens and not separately.  If there is a need in a place because a local authority is unable or unwilling or there is some special Defence Force reason, I could see a specific role for the Department of Defence.  The married quarters about the country mostly exist since pre-Treaty days.  They were built for a specific purpose because in the days of the British Army regiments moved all over the then British Empire and families moved with them.  They stayed in such quarters in the course of their regiments' tour of duty in a specific place.  That position no longer pertains and is not relevant to our situation. The fact that we have married quarters is fortuitous or incidental.  I am anxious that they are kept in good repair and, where they are in bad repair, that they be replaced.  That is happening on a continuing basis.  In this city, where there were very old married quarters, arrangements have been made with Dublin Corporation to hand over the sites.  Dublin Corporation are providing new houses on those sites.</P>
      <P>In Athlone, for example, major improvements are to be made to the married quarters in McCormack Park.  There is an ongoing scheme of providing accommodation throughout the country but the primary responsibility for providing housing for citizens rests with local authorities and not with the Department of Defence.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that <Col N="2040" /> those living in Army married quarters who are anxious to provide themselves with a house do not have the same grants and subsidies available to them as those who live in local authority houses who hand up their house?  Will the Minister arrange that these facilities be extended to those who live in Army married quarters? The Minister has enunciated a concept that he feels those in married quarters should be extended the same facilities as others on local authority housing lists and I should like to ask him to pursue this matter at Cabinet level to ensure that equity is extended to members of the Defence Force.</P>

At one time there was close liaison between the Department of Defence and local authorities, particularly in the Kildare area, to try to relieve the problem of overholders and I should like to know if that is continuing and if attention is being given to try to solve that problem?  Is an effort being made to have a special number of houses in each local authority scheme allocated specifically to overholders?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister to investigate the inequity <Col N="2041" /> referred to by Deputy Power.  The £5,000 grant is not available to Army personnel who leave Army accommodation.  Due to the fact that they are in such accommodation they appear to be treated as second class citizens when they approach the Housing Finance Agency or local authorities for house loans.  Will the Minister remove those anomalies to ensure that adequate housing and equal treatment is given to Army personnel?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that there is any prejudice against Army personnel in regard to how they are treated when they apply for loans.  A member of the Defence Force applying for a Housing Finance Agency loan or a local authority loan is treated in the same way as any other citizen.  No separate criteria are applied.  I do not accept that there is any inequitable position there.  I would be glad to hear the details from Deputy Power.  I should like to tell the House that the £5,000 grant was brought in specifically to be paid to local authority tenants to procure better use of the local authority housing stock.  It is perverse logic to say that because it is not available to soldiers they are thereby prejudiced. The grant is not available to people living in private rented accommodation.  The Deputy is making a case for the grant to be extended to everybody, but of course that would be patently impossible.</P>

Will the Minister agree that the reason for having Army personnel living near a barracks no longer pertains today and that this is something that should be pursued more vigorously than it was in the past?</P>

However, the overall conditions of employment of range wardens are more favourable.

      <P>Range wardens are not tradesmen and their pay would not be linked with that of tradesmen.

      <P>These are matters for negotiation by the unions concerned. There are differences in pay and conditions between various employees in my Department, as there are throughout the country.  I could not say that because one group have particular fringe benefits they should necessarily be extended to another group.  There may be a particular need arising from the nature of the duties carried out by those who have these fringe benefits which would not apply in the case of the range wardens.</P>

I repeat again that the question of recruiting additional female personnel is reviewed periodically in the light of current strengths and commitments. This is kept under review on a continuing basis in the light of our needs and current strengths.  Recruiting is restricted because of financial constraints and because of these restrictions recruiting has to be confined to male recruits. Because females do not have a combatant role that restricts the duties they can perform. In times of scarce manpower resources we have to make the maximum use of the manpower available to us, and this inhibits the recruiting of female personnel at the moment.  Hopefully this situation will change in the near future.</P>

      <P>Having regard to the fact that the total establishment figure for all sections of the Army is in excess of 18,000 persons, will the Minister not agree that there is a major difference between that and the basic figure for the moment of 13,668 and that there is an opportunity at least to recruit in the region of 3,000 more personnel into the Army?  Could he give us an indication of any proposals which he has to do this in 1985?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The establishment figure is, if you like, the maximum figure permissible by law and the establishment figure is never filled in peacetime.  The strength in peacetime is determined by the exigencies of the situation from time to time.  We try to keep Army figures at a level that will enable the Defence Forces to respond to the duties that are placed upon them and at the same time have regard to the financial position of the Exchequer.  It is a delicate enough operation and at times the Army people <Col N="2049" /> feel that it is overbalanced in favour of the Exchequer &mdash; a view with which I would sympathise from time to time. Recruiting this year will be limited to replacing wastage.  Next year I am hopeful that we will have more expanded recruiting.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would agree &mdash; and I know he does &mdash; that the Army is a primary service to our country.  We have now so many unemployed young people of such high talent and quality, many of whom are emigrating, that it would be a major opportunity for the Army to harness their abilities and talents and to expand Army recruitment rapidly in 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with that point of view.  Unfortunately, it is not practicable.  In 1977 an attempt was made to cure unemployment by expanding the public service.  Members of the Defence Forces are in the public service and have to be paid out of taxpayers' money.</P>

      <P>The British and American Defence Attachés are the only accredited military attachés resident in this country.  It is customary for both to visit all the commands during their term of office.  The visit to Ballymullen Barracks, Tralee, on 12 March, 1985, was part of their first official visit to the Southern Command.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>It would not be a matter for a specific press announcement.  These visits are routine and have been carried out by resident attachés since resident attachés came to be stationed here.  It is not a newsworthy item.  They are merely going about their diplomatic duties.  One might as well say that if an ambassador visits some particular place it should be highlighted.  It might well be by the local press, but it is not a matter requiring any particular press announcement.  It would not be normal to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the handover of Spike Island to the Department of Justice, Naval Service training, which had been conducted at that location, was transferred to Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, and to the Naval Base, Haulbow-line. This is considered a satisfactory interim measure pending a review of the long term requirements of the service.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The training that is taking place in Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, is recruit training and the potential NCO course will start there on 1 July 1985. Much of this training does not have to be done in a maritime environment.  It can <Col N="2052" /> be done satisfactorily in a normal military barracks.  I am satisfied that adequate training can be given there.  Obviously, it would be desirable that it would all take place within a naval environment, but the facilities available in Murphy Barracks are first-class and I am satisfied that the recruit training and potential NCO course will be up to normal high standards.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot say how long the Department of Justice will require Spike Island.  I am sure that the Deputy will share with me the wish that they will be able to leave that island very shortly.

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take these two questions together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been monitoring the situation in the Irish Leathers Group very closely for <Col N="2054" /> some time.  Very considerable efforts have been made by the relevant State agencies to support the industry.</P>
    <P>Despite the remedial action taken, however, the group's continuing losses have proved unsustainable, and Fóir Teoranta, who have provided substantial financial support over a number of years, yesterday appointed a receiver-manager.</P>
    <P>The receiver-manager has been requested by Fóir Teoranta to make every effort to dispose of the businesses as going concerns.  I have asked the State agencies to provide all the further assistance they can towards maintaining the Irish Leather plants and saving as many jobs as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I make a heartfelt plea to the Minister of State to keep the plants in question open and retain the workforce pending the outcome of the negotiations with the receiver-manager.  Will he state what representations or proposals were made to him by the management of Irish Leathers Limited for the continuation of operations?  If such proposals were made to him or to any of the agencies under the auspices of his Department, will he state why such proposals were seemingly rejected?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my understanding that the receiver has indicated that he is examining the operations of the group and that he intends to continue trading in the expectation that the group will be sold on an ongoing business basis. Regarding representations by the company, probably these would have been made to Fóir Teoranta, an independent body under the aegis of the Minister for Finance.  Members of the House will appreciate that Fóir Teoranta have invested substantial sums as well as taking preference shares and giving guarantees which, I understand, were in the region of £10 million in total.  There is a very heavy involvement by Fóir Teoranta in this case.  I understand that the prospect of the group making very heavy losses this year was very real.  The ongoing loss making was the basic reason a receiver was appointed.</P>

      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I pointed out that the Taoiseach had already undermined his position before going to the European Council in Milan at the weekend.  Never have I seen a Taoiseach hand so many arguments to those opposed to the principles of the EC.  The Taoiseach has conceded the argument before he goes and if the Prime Minister of Great Britain or the Chancellor of the Federal Republic wanted to demonstrate to the Taoiseach in Milan that Ireland has no cause for complaint and has benefited much more than other nations from membership of the EC and should keep her peace, they could refer to no better authority than to the statement which the Taoiseach made this morning.  By outlining the benefits we have enjoyed he has pointed out the fact that by comparison with any of the other member states in terms of our budget contributions and net receipts from EC funds, we have been the most <Col N="2073" /> significant beneficiary of EC membership. That is totally and utterly against anything I understood the Taoiseach to say at any time in our joint campaigns as members of the common European movement before we joined the EC and both as Ministers for Foreign Affairs and spokesmen for the Opposition.  I have never heard a Taoiseach apply the principle of juste retour to demonstrate that we have benefited from the Community at a level which no one else has.  That principle has been anathema not just to us but to anyone who has a care for the European commitment.</P>
      <P>Mrs. Thatcher can point to the Taoiseach and say: &ldquo;You said, Taoiseach, before you came here that you were a major beneficiary and you also said, Taoiseach, that the net transfers the other way, meaning the contributors, were in respect of Germany, France and the UK amounting to negative transfers of European Community resources&rdquo;.  That is unacceptable from any Taoiseach.  It is time we heard some straight, plain talking from the Taoiseach in the manner in which Mrs. Thatcher has spoken at Council meetings in recent years.  She had no reluctance to put it in simple terms.  She said: &ldquo;I want my money back&rdquo;.  I heard her at the European Council in 1979 put it in those stark terms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>She had no reluctance in stating that she would not accept the level of contribution being demanded or to underline the principles of the EC. From that moment the European Community was turned inward on itself, focusing only on the budget contributions. The basic principles of the EC enshrined in the Treaties has been totally ignored.  Is the Taoiseach so anxious to present himself as being a committed European&mdash;my commitment started at the same time as his in the early sixties when I was a member of the same movement and attended the same meetings with him &mdash; that he is prepared to ignore the problems? He tells us that one of the <Col N="2074" /> matters that could arise in the European Union discussion might be as he said in his speech:</P>
      <P>Other issues that could arise in relation to the movement towards a European union include the development of the EMS; the closely associated issues of economic convergence of member states....</P>
      <P>The way that was stated by any Taoiseach was that an issue that must arise is the issue of convergence of the economies of the member states not just because Ireland says so but because that is the basis of the Treaty was signed.  That is what the preamble in the Treaty of Rome states.  It affirms as the essential objectives of their efforts, namely the signatory states, the constant improvement of the living and working conditions of their peoples and underlines as an essential objectives the need to bring about a more balanced economic development throughout the European Community. In view of the failure to move in line with the obligations already established in the Treaty, there has been a tendency in recent years to develop a new notion of European union which is not based on the Treaties signed by the original member states and which was not part of the Treaty of Accession that we committed ourselves to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The European Union to which the Taoiseach referred this morning when he quoted Seán Lemass was a union based on the economic policies of the EC to balance the policies of the Common Market. Let me put it bluntly to the Taoiseach before he goes out with this craven attitude to Margaret Thatcher or Chancellor Kohl that the advantage which accrues to the major economies of the EC accrue from the Common Market with their economic force, industrial expansion and technological expertise. The opportunities they have to exploit the Common Market is the balance that must be protected in our interest by economic policies for regional development, social development, agricultural development, research development.  They have had the benefit of exploiting the <Col N="2075" /> market in a way in which we never could. Some of them are at the centre of the market both geographically and traditionally but we are at the periphery.</P>
    <P>The opportunity that has accrued to the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands and France particularly, and which would have accrued to the UK had they any awareness of their European commitment, has been such as to enable these members to expand and to exploit it.  The only protection for the peripheral regions were the necessary funds that were made available by way of the regional, social and agricultural policies but there was not a word from the Taoiseach in relation to all of that.</P>
    <P>What is required is a word of condemnation but that was not forthcoming either. As we have now reached about No. 10 on the list, is the Taoiseach asking us to live in cloud cuckooland? Is he not aware of all the reports that emanated from the Heads of Government down through the years, those very Heads of Government who wanted to block progress towards the aim of the Community? We can go back as far as the Vedel and Tindemans reports.  One recalls when that great European, Tindemans came on the scene, all the jargon was used again &mdash; a new relaunch of Europe and so on.  This was the initiative of the Council but the Council buried the report because there were other Prime Ministers and Presidents in office when the report was returned.</P>
    <P>Then there were other Prime Ministers such as D'Estaing and Schmidt, men of great European commitment, but they asked for a further report.  On that occasion there followed the report of the Three Wise Men.  That report was debated but when other Prime Ministers came to office nothing was done to implement any of its recommendations.  Then there was the Mandate Report from the Commission, a report that had been sought by the European Council and in which I was directly involved.  A detailed document was presented by the Commission in which it was pointed out, <Col N="2076" /> among other things, that unless Europe provided adequate resources for research and development, for technological development, for important programmes and adequate resources to develop an international market for our agricultural produce, there would be problems.  But the people, among them Mrs. Thatcher in particular, who are now talking about another report on European Union buried that detailed document.</P>
    <P>Are we to pretend in the light of all this that next week's chat or 24 hour discussion with the high profile of another summit will relaunch Europe? It is not surprising that the founding fathers of Europe excluded deliberately from the institutions of the Community the Heads of Government who meet three times a year for one day each time.  One could not possibly expect from such an institution any real European commitment because each Head of State is anxious to return and demonstrate to the citizens at home that she or he has held the ground or, as Mrs. Thatcher has demonstrated so often in recent times, has not conceded to the others in Europe.  That is not the way Europe was built.</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that the authority of the Commission should be re-established because that authority has been totally undermined by the same Heads of Government.  The Taoiseach said blandly that it is important to re-establish the independence of the Commission.  Would he not be frank enough for once to say that the Three Wise Men Report, the Commission Mandate Report and at least two other reports recommended that there should be one Commissioner from each member state? Would the Taoiseach not be man enough for once to state that the very people who ensured that would not happen are the Heads of Government to whom he has conceded before going to Milan? Are we reaching the stage when an Irish voice has to be qualified by some vague European commitment, by our talking in terms of some Luxembourg compromise or common interest? Are we reaching the stage when we cannot do as the others do and talk in plain terms?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2077" /> The EC has become a sick Community and the reasons for that are clear.  Four years ago the total number unemployed in the Community was 8.79 million. Today the figure is 14 million.  The peoples of the member states see the Community as an institution that is not relevant, not caring and not effective.  It is very different from the Europe that was launched at the high tide of democracy in Europe when there was a common commitment and when the founding fathers said they were resolved to substitute for age old rivalries the merging of their essential interest to create, by establishing an economic community, the basis for a broader and deeper community among people long divided and to lay the foundation for institutions which would give direction to a destiny to be shared. Where is the basis now for establishing a deeper economic community?  In his famous speech in Florence on convergence, President Jenkins of the Commission on behalf of all, pointed out that the direction that was part and parcel of the Community was the elimination of major imbalances, thereby giving rise to greater economic cohesion, greater economic union and, finally from that, the political union of which we are now talking.</P>
    <P>He was talking about the internal cohesion which subsequently would lead to an external common position.  There cannot be a foreign policy on the part of a unit that has no internal cohesion.  These are simple facts that apply to any community at any stage in history, but anyone reading the Taoiseach's statement today would have to despair in so far as the Irish are concerned.  We have a commitment to Europe and we look at that Europe which has turned in on itself and which has turned away from the developing countries.</P>
    <P>There is the scandal whereby not only is food production being reduced in the Community but it is penalised while at the same time we cannot even get into an international marketing situation to alleviate the crushing problems of the starving peoples, most of whom had very special relations with the member states <Col N="2078" /> of the Community.  There will never be a worthwhile, dignified Europe until there is a concern for and an awareness of its obligations to others.  Even then we could demonstrate that it would be in our common economic interest to promote the economic development of these nations, or are we always to sit back and assume that the African sub-continent particularly is to be cast permanently in the role of semi-starving and in receipt only of our charity by way of development programmes?</P>
    <P>These are the issues that should be discussed in Milan.  I hope one of the things of which the Taoiseach will remind them is that we have had a plethora of reports in the past ten years in particular. There must be a library of them.  I have mentioned some.  He has mentioned many himself, including the MacDougall Report.  They all argued towards the right conclusion based on the Treaties and were all thrown aside.</P>
    <P>Now we are engaged in a new dimension. When Europe fails to realise its stated aims those with very limited aims &mdash; and Margaret Thatcher must be numbered proudly among them &mdash; then dream up another concept of European Union and try to side-track the issues into debates that are not and never were relevant to the Treaties.  That said, when Europe begins to achieve economic and political union &mdash; as Séan Lemass said here some time ago &mdash; then consequences can follow, but not before.  When Europe begins to be really a political entity then consequences can follow.  But when we decide to introduce obligations which are excluded specifically, such as security, then we are turning not only against our stated policies but deliberately turning away from the stated policies of the Treaties of the European Community.</P>
    <P>If the Taoiseach has that degree of conviction as a European, that does not always mean that one has to mince words in one way or another &mdash; he might first ask the British Government would they, at this late stage, join the European Monetary System.  I attended the European Council at which that was launched in 1978.  It is unacceptable that any <Col N="2079" /> member state should see itself in the privileged situation of having an association with an essential element of European development &mdash; which is what Britain claims to do at this point &mdash; while contributing, as the British Government are doing, to the weightings in the basket, to the weightings of the other currencies <i>vis-</i><i>á-vis</i> each other.  Through sterling they deposit their currency in the ECU basket but they are not part of the system.  Is it not time it was pointed out that that kind of &ldquo;in a bit, out a bit&rdquo; is not consistent with membership of the European Community?</P>
    <P>That was one significant development that took place in recent times.  The other that should follow from that was the development of banking and loan facilities in the ECU and particularly in our case.  Most of the less developed regions of the Community have one thing in common, that is, that the servicing of their debt to international banking is a major issue.  If we are to avoid the disastrous consequences of policies we have seen the Minister for Finance pursue this year &mdash; in borrowing in dollars almost to the exclusion of other currencies &mdash; we should insist on the development of the ECU as an established European domestic currency.  How can you have a union &mdash; about which we are told the Heads of Government will be talking &mdash; if it does not have even the beginning of a currency to identify that union?  Such a currency unit &mdash; in this instance the ECU &mdash; would enable many of us who are determined to promote our economic policies within the European Union to work within a more manageable constraint and system where exchange and interest rates would be more effectively controlled.  Those are two practical points on which the Taoiseach might concentrate.</P>
    <P>I also ask him to concentrate on our relationship with the other member states because, outside of Europe, the Treaty of Rome recognised the obligation of the member states to confirm the solidarity which binds Europe and the overseas countries in order to ensure the development of their prosperity.  That was well <Col N="2080" /> over 30 years ago.  I wonder what the ghosts of Schumann, de Gasperi, Paul Henri Spaak, the founding fathers would think now?  The god figures are mentioned from time to time.  I have heard them mentioned by people, who do not seem to have the commitment they had.  They call down their names somehow to imply that they share their commitment.  I wonder how those earlier Europeans &mdash; and we are proud to be part of the same European family &mdash; would feel about current developments?</P>
    <P>How would they feel about the cosy chat that will take place in Milan over the weekend?  Some voice must be raised to tell our European friends, as true Europeans, that it is time we stopped fooling ourselves with these continuous analyses, reports, committees, by whoever &mdash; it does not matter whether it is Dooge, Vedel, or whoever.  All that has emerged from Europe in recent times is a litany of names.  With 14 million people unemployed &mdash; which is twice what it was 14 years ago &mdash; with that part of Europe outside the European Community &mdash; Finland, Austria, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland &mdash; experiencing economic growth of a kind that makes the European Community seem undeveloped can we say to our people here that Europe has been good for them in terms of the European Community?  Could we not say perhaps that if it continues as it is those who are outside &mdash; Austria, Finland, Sweden, Norway, Switzerland &mdash; were perhaps more fortunate because at least they engaged in consistent policies unlike the constant analyses and reporting in which our Taoiseach has been prone to engage? I wish him well but, before he goes, he should be prepared to answer to the others when they quote his speech against him.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one consistent theme in Fianna Fáil's speeches on the question of European Union and Irish unity, that is, a reluctance to accept that progress can be made, should be made, or should be allowed to be made while Fianna Fáil are not in Government.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was disappointed with the tenor of <Col N="2081" /> Deputy O'Kennedy's speech &mdash; this reluctance to accept that objectives shared by many Members on his side of the House can legitimately be expressed and interests guarded by people on this side of the House, a tendency to attack and belittle the very well deserved European reputation of the Taoiseach.  I feel confident that the interests of this country are in safe hands in the discussions taking place, that these interests will be married to a genuine concept of what the European ideal really means.</P>
    <P>First, we should be grateful for the opportunity to have this debate, but not too grateful, because the way in which the House treats major European questions is nothing short of disgraceful.  This debate &mdash; not through the fault of anybody in the Chamber at this time &mdash; is taking place far too late.  The amount of time allocated to it is far too short &mdash; six hours with a very limited number of speakers to debate a matter which, while a decision is not imminent, nonetheless is of immediate importance.  It is a subject which is of equal importance to our initial decision to join the European Community in 1972.</P>
    <P>In 1972 this country held a great national debate on the merits of whether we should become members of the European Community.  Right across the country, in farming and urban areas, in ICA halls, schools and universities, the debate took place with a very high level of information. When the people went to vote in the referendum in 1972 they did so probably as one of the best informed electorates in Europe on the implications of membership of the Community.</P>
    <P>The changes which face the Community today, the decisions which will be taken, if not this year, over the next two or three years, in their own way are just as important as was the initial decision to join the Community.  Unfortunately, this time there is no accompanying debate. The issue is almost being kept from the people as if European questions were too important for this House to discuss, that the matters are complicated and best confined to a small group of Euro experts. I certainly deplore this tendency and, like <Col N="2082" /> other speakers, I wish that the oft made call here for greater time and more regular debates on European affairs did not just become the platitude it is as far as those who organise time are concerned but would become a reality in the timetable in this House.</P>
    <P>The question was raised as to whether or not politicians are interested and informed about the possibility of a European union.  The answer to that, if we believe the spoken record of what our leaders of all parties have said over the past number of years, is that we are.  From the very beginning of the decision to seek membership of the European Community every Taoiseach and every Minister for Foreign Affairs has stated unequivocally that we were joining the EC not in one final step in 1972 but that we saw ourselves as being fully committed to the letter, to the philosophy and to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome.  From the beginning we have been committed to some ongoing concept of a European Union and to playing our full part.  Every Taoiseach and every Minister for Foreign Affairs has made it very clear that this was not something without regard to price, that Irish interests would be guarded and that there was no question of rushing ahead to the detriment of vital national interests. Nevertheless, it is important to say to people who ask the question why we are discussing various concepts of European Union that what we are discussing has from the beginning been implicit in our decision to join the EC.  We accepted it as it was, knowing that the founding fathers of Europe had made it clear that they were moving towards a concept of European Union.  We should not be surprised because that was what we voted on and accepted in 1972.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately the debate outside of this House up to now on European Union &mdash;the debate generated by the seminar in the Royal Hibernian Academy earlier this year and so on &mdash; has largely centered on the question of Irish neutrality and the belief put forward that any further move towards European Union by this country must inevitably damage our neutrality. This debate is not a debate about the <Col N="2083" /> concept of neutrality.  Neutrality is an element, but not more than that.  It is unfortunate, but perhaps inevitable, that the debate to date has focussed so much on this theme and has excluded the much bigger issues which are involved.  Our obsession with this topic has certainly ruled out many of the wider and perhaps more significant long term issues.</P>
    <P>There are very few subjects in Irish public life about which it is more difficult to have a rational informed discussion than that of neutrality.  It is almost as difficult to have a rational discussion about it as it is to get agreement on a definition about what we mean by neutrality. Neutrality is not and never has been an essential element of our sovereignty. On the contrary it is because we are sovereign that we have the right to choose whether or not to be neutral.  The other countries in the European Community are no less sovereign than we because they have chosen to align themselves with other European Community and non-European Community countries for their common defence.  I would ask The Workers' Party whether or not the countries in the Warsaw Pact are any less sovereign because they too chose to align themselves.  It is important to say to various groups, especially the Irish Sovereignty Movement, that the question of neutrality is not the same as the question of sovereignty and that it is because we are sovereign that we have the right to choose whether or not to be neutral.</P>
    <P>We as a country have opted voluntarily for this policy of neutrality.  It is a policy which has the support of all parties in the House and of a strong majority of the people.  It is a policy which most people believe serves our best interests and it is a policy which we want to maintain.  Our neutrality is something of which most of us are proud and which makes us different at a time when it is difficult to have any distinction between nations.  But let us be honest and admit that when we define what we mean by neutrality that definition is very narrow.  Our neutrality operates within strict confines.  Unlike <Col N="2084" /> the neutrality of Austria, Sweden and Switzerland, ours is not a neutrality of strict observance.  We are not prepared to pay in economic terms the cost which these countries pay to ensure that their neutrality is an active, vigilant one which cannot be infringed by any other country. We could not afford that, and we hope we will not have to do it; but the situation is that we have our neutrality on the cheap, to a large extent.</P>
    <P>The vast majority of people in this House and the vast majority of people outside the House are not neutral in terms of ideology.  We are not neutral between the values of the system of government and the countries in the Eastern bloc as contrasted with the values, however imperfect and flawed, enshrined in the Western parliamentary way of life. There is not much point in saying that there is not a difference between the democracies of Western Europe and the central democracy of the Eastern bloc countries and that the Irish people are neutral as to the values of the type of government involved.  It is a verifiable fact that we are not.  Nor can we say that we are economically neutral.  Our economy is intertwined in every way with the economies of the other nine countries of Europe.  For us to say that we are neutral in the way in which we were during the Second World War when we had no alignments of any kind is wrong because that situation has long since passed.</P>
    <P>Our involvement in European political co-operation means that on very many issues our foreign policy is aligned with that of other countries by agreement. When during our Presidency of the European Community our ambassador to the UN stands up and speaks on agreed issues for the countries of Europe, that is hardly an indication to the rest of the world that Ireland is speaking there as a country with pristine neutrality and that we are isolated from political alignment with other European countries.  We do it voluntarily, but it weakens the whole appearance and the reality of our concept of neutrality.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2085" /> Even historically, looking at the attitude of Irish leaders in the past to neutrality, it has always been a question of pragmatism rather than a question of principle &mdash; from the earliest Government of W. T. Cosgrave to the Governments of Eamon de Valera.  To a certain extent it was Eamon de Valera who invented and made a reality of our policy of neutrality.  We should be extremely grateful to him for the way in which he steered us so adroitly and with such skill through the difficulties of the second World War.  Even Mr. de Valera never went so far as to say that neutrality was an unalterable aspect of foreign policy and he never went so far as to say that we could never change that policy. We were neutral because it was in our best interests.  It is ironic to hear that distinguished Irish statesman, Mr. Seán MacBride, talk of neutrality as if it were a immutable principle of Irish foreign policy for all time.  The historical fact is that the only Minister for Foreign Affairs who ever contemplated having a defence agreement with any other country was Mr. MacBride during the 1948-1951 Government when he was prepared in the best interests of this country to enter discussions with the US about a bilateral defence agreement between this country and the US.  It never got very far and it was just as well it did not.  Nonetheless, I am illustrating the case I am making with the well known historical fact that when he was Minister for External Affairs, Mr. MacBride was prepared to treat Irish neutrality as something pragmatic which could be in some way&mdash; bartered is not the right word &mdash; become part of negotiations if it was in the best interests of this country.</P>
    <P>It would be fundamentally wrong if this debate were to focus on neutrality, if European Union was to be equated with the abandonment of our neutrality.  I am sure my colleagues here from the European Parliament who will be speaking later today will bear out very clearly that nobody in Europe wants us to abandon our neutrality or expects us to give up our neutrality, that it is not a burning issue in Europe, that if we are to be part <Col N="2086" /> of some new concept of European Union our neutrality which we value, which is distinctive and which has the agreement of all parties in this House, is something which we can maintain and keep, which may well even be of benefit in some further concept of European Union and emphatically is neither an obstacle not under threat.</P>
    <P>The starting point here today for any discussion on European Union must be the fact that within the six founding members of the EC there is now a very strong determination to reform the structures of the EC and to expand its spheres of activity.  This determination on their part to change is, as has been spelled out by other speakers, the result of a number of factors.  The view is that some sort of European Union has always been inherent in the Treaties as being the ultimate goal.  Perhaps, we in this country, with our sense of isolation from Europe and our lack of involvement in the world wars of this century, find it hard to grasp the fact that there is in the EC, in the midst of the everyday discussions of quotas, tariffs, the economy and convergence in the midst of all the crises, a genuine sense of idealism born perhaps out of the crucible of suffering of two world wars, a genuine commitment to some concept of European Union.  This is there.  It was there from the very beginning and is still a powerful driving force amongst some at least of the leading politicians of the EC.</P>
    <P>There is also, leading towards some sort of European Union, a factor born out of frustration with the slowness of the decision-making process.  The decision-making process is frequently close to paralysis. Indeed, at times one wonders how decisions are taken at all.  In many ways the decision-making process is not working. Decisions which are urgent and vital are put off.  The number of possibilities of blocking decisions are numerous and perhaps too easily availed of.  We as much as others have availed of these possibilities and perhaps in many ways we have suffered more from the failure to reach agreement on issues of vital national interest to this country.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2087" /> There is also the feeling amongst many of the leading members of the EC that unless Europe is revitalised, unless we can streamline the decision-making process, we will lose out in the vital areas, that unless we can move quickly in certain areas we will not be able to match the US and Japan in terms of markets.  The Taoiseach was right to point out this morning the contrast between the economies of the US and Japan and those of most countries of Europe.  Most of the leaders of the EC can point out areas where reforms are needed which would be of benefit immediately in the vital areas of creating jobs and increasing exports from the EC.</P>
    <P>There is nothing very new in all of this. We have all been here before and, as Deputy O'Kennedy and other speakers have said, the way to European Union is paved with various reports, the reports of the Three Wise Men, the Tindemans Report and the most recent reports of Dooge and Spinelli.  There is no shortage of blueprints or of pointing the way forward to European Union, but what is different this time is the determination of the Six to push ahead.  Whether the other countries, ourselves included, agree or not, they intend to push ahead towards some concept of European Union.  This is not bluff on their part.  They are determined to put whatever pressure they must on the other member states and, if the other member states, the Four or the Six, are not willing to go ahead, not fully, not without compromise, discussion, agreement, the Six are determined to go ahead anyway and establish what has become known as a two-tier Europe with us very much on the outer tier, again with consequences which we have not explored.  The only speaker of note who has attempted to examine in detail the implications of this for our country was John Temple Lang at a seminar in the Royal Hibernian Academy at Easter.  If even half of what he said then is accurate &mdash;I believe it is &mdash; then the consequences for us, for the CAP and other aspects of our economy could be great.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2088" /> The reasons why at this point of European and Irish history we are on the point of major decisions about European Union are very straightforward.  What is not so straight forward, as the Taoiseach pointed out this morning, is to get an adequate definition of what we mean by European Union.  We have had the reports.  Each one has tried to spell out the elements of these reports.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee examined the Spinelli Report and tried to find out the implications of European Union for this country.</P>
    <P>In part the difficulty in trying to define what we mean by European Union is that many elements of it exist already.  For example, most of these elements have come into existence in an <i>ad hoc</i> way.  The addition year by year of new functions for the EC has meant that the Europe we joined 13 years ago is a very different Community from the Community today. Enormous developments which perhaps are obscured by everyday detail have occurred.  If we look back now, 13 years later, on the Europe we joined on 1 January 1973 we find a very different Community. We have been moving step by step, sometimes two steps forward and one and a half steps back, towards some concept of European Union.  We have common policies on agriculture, fisheries, competition, regional matters and the Social Fund.  All of these are part of the infrastructure of European Union and, should there be European Union tomorrow, little would be different in these policy areas.</P>
    <P>To a certain extent we are there although we do not quite use that term. The policy decisions, for example, would be taken at European level and they would be implemented at national or regional level with provision for variation or exemptions to suit national circumstances. That is true also, though not to the same extent, in the area of political co-operation.  Therefore to this extent much of the prerequisite for European Union is there already.  The argument now being put forward is that much of this has happened.  Indeed, most of it has happened in an <i>ad hoc</i>, unplanned way.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2089" /> There is duplication.  Areas need to be improved and there is now, for a variety of reasons, a need to rationalise and bring the Treaties up to date.  At the very lowest level that is what we mean when we talk today about European Union. The Treaties need to be updated to take into account the developments of the past 15 or 20 years.</P>
    <P>We are fortunate that we have had a number of attempts to outline in detail what is meant by European Union.  There was the Spinelli Report and now we have the Dooge Report.  I will focus for the last part of this short contribution on the Spinelli Report because as chairman of the sub-committee of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities I chaired the committee which reported back to the Oireachtas on the implications of the Spinelli Report for this country. I regret very much that it is only now, many months later, that we are having a very truncated debate on this report.</P>
    <P>The first reaction of the all-party group which examined the Spinelli Report was one of welcome.  Whatever about the detail, there was a commitment to the whole idea of European Union and a recognition that this has always been the policy of all parties.  There was obviously a desire too to safeguard our national interests.  When we examined the Spinelli Report to see how European Union would affect this country we isolated a number of areas which could cause problems, but there was none which proved insuperable.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the most dramatic one was the whole question of security and defence with which I have dealt already.  I have made it fairly clear today &mdash; I think any fair-minded person would agree with me &mdash; that the maintenance of our policy of neutrality does not in any way act as an impediment towards our involvement in some form of European Union.  There is an acceptance in the other countries of Europe that this is a policy which has the support of the vast majority of the Irish people, a policy which is not going to be changed and which is not in the way of our taking part in any new form of European <Col N="2090" /> Union.  It would be great tragedy for this House and the country if the future debate were to centre on what is essentially a non-issue.  It may suit groups of people outside this House or people inside this House to build up a paranoia about a threat to our neutrality and to see it as the undermining of something which has always been fundamental to this country.  That would be wrong, mischievous and unhistorical and would do great damage to the real issues in this debate.</P>
    <P>Some of the other points which worried members of the joint committee included the possible effects on this House and on our Government of greater powers for the European Parliament. Perhaps we were wrong, over-cautious and over-defensive.  I believe greater powers for the European Parliament certainly constitute no threat to the ordinary backbench Member of this House &mdash; it would be difficult to take away from us what we have not got anyway.  Greater powers for the European Parliament could be beneficial to the practice of the democratic process here.  The committee report was unduly timid in the treatment of the dangers they saw in greater powers for the European Parliament.  We saw certain dangers in an improvement of the decision-making process and especially the phasing out of the veto.  On reflection I feel strongly that any analysis of the veto over the past 13 years will show that its existence has been more harmful to the real interests of this country than it has been beneficial in safeguarding our national interests.  We could face a European Union based on agreement and trust in the absence of the veto without any great cause for worry or fear.  This is something which will need to be teased out in very great detail.</P>
    <P>I repeat that like many other Members I am angry that such a short amount of time has been given for this major debate.  I feel sorry for those other speakers who wanted to make their contribution. The subject is of enormous importance.  I hope this debate will simply be the beginning and that we will have the opportunity to spell out in detail the <Col N="2091" /> enormous implications of what is involved so that public opinion guiding our politicians will be informed and based on a full knowledge of what is best for this country through our membership of the European Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this report.  It is important in certain aspects and it is a pity the House has not more time to deal with it in greater detail. There is much to be encouraged in this report but equally there is much that should perhaps sound alarm bells for anyone who fears that Ireland, its culture and traditions, will eventually be swamped in the sea of European Union.  We must be very careful about this.  Ireland has benefited from membership of the European Community, especially as regards agriculture.  In return the Irish have consistently been good Europeans, upholding the principles of the Treaty of our accession and abiding by the rules of the club.</P>
      <P>Although it was Fianna Fáil who led this country into Europe in the first place, there was always a hint of reservation in the party about the possible compromise such a move could entail.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments have fought hard to ensure that Ireland's unique position as well as its unique and cherished traditions and culture were safeguarded in any negotiations in Europe.  Having read this report, I fear that many of those safeguards may be removed if the Council adopt this report in its entirety.  I cannot see the Fine Gael Party objecting very strongly to it.  The chairman of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee was Senator James Dooge, who could rightly claim to be at the heart of the Fine Gael Party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As an Irishman who cares for and values Irish traditions and culture, I am gravely concerned when I read in the report that one of its main aims would be &ldquo;the promotion of common values of civilisation&rdquo; and of a &ldquo;common cultural identity&rdquo;.  This is all very worthy but I ask whether this would be at the expense of our national cultural identity.  This is a <Col N="2092" /> question which should be considered very carefully.  I am also concerned to read in section B.4 that the promotion of common cultural values and the European cultural identity requires measures to overcome any language barriers, the development of new media in a European-wide context and the elimination of obstacles to the free circulation of cultural goods and communication.  Again these are worthy objectives, yet I cannot see how moves in these directions can do anything but harm to our native Irish language on which so much of our native culture is based and in which most of our heritage is written.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Already Europe has omitted Irish as a language of the Community and there is nothing in the Dooge Report to suggest that it will be any different in future.  If obstacles to the free circulation of cultural goods and communications are eliminated, our censorship laws will not longer be enforceable. This might bring works of art and culture to Ireland which were not previously available but it would also open the door to pornography in books and films. films.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> If that is <Col N="2093" /> what greater European unity means, we must object to it.</P>
      <P>As the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Agriculture, I welcome the efforts of the <i>ad</i><i>hoc</i> committee to improve the decision making process in the Council.  Year after year, Irish farmers have suffered great losses due to the failure of the Community's agricultural Ministers to reach decisions. Anything which speeds up the process of decision making would be welcome but I am doubtful if it is in our interests that the new general principle should be adopted whereby decisions would be made on a qualified or simple majority.  For example, if this had been in operation when the milk super-levy was first threatened, the then Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture, Deputy MacSharry, would have been powerless to prevent its immediate implementation. Equally, of course, Britain would have been unable to pursue its stubborn stance on Community finances which paralysed decision making in Europe for some time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the qualifications in the report regarding a member state's very important interest would solve the problem, but to do so, those very important interests would have to be known and agreed to in advance.  Otherwise, any member state could call a very important interest on any issue and slow up the decision making process once again.  A workable method of agreement regarding what constitutes a very important interest would be essential if these proposals are to work.  The proposal to speed up the decision making process is the only real and necessary one in the whole report.  Pious aspirations remain just that but the problem of decision making will have to be tackled.  It is ironic that it would probably take the Council a very long time to decide on new procedures in regard to decision making but that is the way of the European Community.  Perhaps that is why there are 14 million people unemployed in an economic community which possesses all the means of eliminating unemployment. High minded Principles are all <Col N="2094" /> very well for the Eurocrats but unemployed people do not care about European unity if they cannot get a job.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> He said that the Taoiseach and Professor Dooge would be better advised to address their minds to the realities of their economic policies which have put 250,000 on to the dole queues.  They are trying to divert attention to an impossible dream.  European unity, which may come about at some stage but not in the immediate future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to concentrate on the political side of the report and to declare a general predisposition which I have always had in favour of closer European integration, and I mean political as well as economic integration.</P>
      <P>I accept, as Deputy O'Kennedy said, that economic integration ought to be something which precedes political integration but I do not accept that, in the absence of one, one cannot benefit from the other.  I do not see that logic of the suggestion that until we get parity of prosperity in all quarters of Europe, which is unlikely ever to be reached, it is premature to talk about political integration. Not only do I not see the logic in it, but a position like that seems to fly in the face of what are absolutely strident Irish priorities, or ought to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>European integration or institutional linkage with the democracies of Western Europe is something of the greatest importance to us, not merely so that we can produce indefinite quantities of beef, mutton, milk and dairy products but also for the stability and future of the State.  I remember the campaign in 1972 which culminated in the referendum in September of that year on adhesion to the European Economic Community as it was then called.  The Taoiseach recalled this morning that the vote in favour of joining was about 83 per cent on a very high poll. uniquely high in a mere referendum, of <Col N="2095" /> 70 per cent.  In other words, roughly 58 per cent of the entire electorate voted in favour of the move.  That was a uniquely high consensus in Irish history.  It was, of course, produced by the fact that this party, as well as Fianna Fáil, jointly recommended membership and the organisations of both parties were put into action, perhaps rather languidly, because there was no question of one trying to do down the other.  The village competitiveness had gone out of the vote, so to speak, but it was a uniquely high poll.  I believe the collaboration of the two big parties produced that big poll. Another factor which I have always thought helped in the production of a very high poll was the sight held up to the people by those interests who were saying to them, vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Labour Party had an absolutely genuine, logical, clearcut and perfectly arguable case against membership.  That party performed a major democratic service in arguing that case temperately, soberly, logically and bravely up and down the country.  That party's service to the country on that occasion was something which, perhaps, contributed not in the electoral contest in 1972 but in 1973 to a good general election result for themselves. The responsibility they showed and the temperateness and logicality they showed in debating this issue contributed to a good election result for them in 1973. The same has to be said in regard to the temperateness and logic of some of the extra-parliamentary societies or individuals who did not believe in membership and who took the same line as the Labour Party and suggested voting &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  I have spent a length of time talking about the Labour Party because I want to make it clear that I do not associate the Labour Party with people who may find themselves accidentally on the same side of an argument, but I observed then, and anybody who can remember 1972 will recall, that every bully in Ireland also wanted the people to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  Every subversive organisation that stinks so far as civilised democracy is concerned and every organisation that would pull this <Col N="2096" /> democracy in fitters if it got the chance was also on the side advocating a &ldquo;no&rdquo; vote.</P>
    <P>One can find oneself on the same side of an argument with the strangest people and it is not the fault of the Labour Party that they happened to share that side of the platform with every bully in Ireland. The IRA of all shades were against it. Whatever communists there were in the country were against it and whatever further out bullies of either far Left or far Right there were, were against it.  The reason why those people were against our membership of the EC was that it was in their interests to keep this country weak, friendless, isolated and at odds, so far as it could be done, with our European neighbours.  It was in their interests in 1972 and it is far more in their interests today.  The year 1972 was a time when the outlook for the country was very black.  It is hard to measure degrees of blackness and I will not compare it with 1983 in every respect but it certainly was the worst year for violence in the North of Ireland that ever had been experienced. No year since then has come anywhere near it.  Almost 500 people were murdered in one shape of from by one side or the other in the course of 1972 in the North.  The year 1971 had been nearly as bad.  The casualty figures have fallen steeply off.</P>
    <P>It seems to me, and to many people who made up that huge plurality that went out and voted &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, that everybody in whose interest it was to keep the pot stirred, to keep the country destablished, to keep it with its immunity and resistance broken down so that it would be an easy victim to revolution, was out urging the people to vote &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  We do not have exactly the same conditions in 1985 as we had in 1972 but the essential problems we faced then are still there and some of them have got worse.</P>
    <P>The year 1972 was before the oil crisis and the great crisis in the European economies generally which resulted in huge inflation and unemployment figures, the crisis of confidence in the EC as to where it is going and, in particular, where it is <Col N="2097" /> going by comparison with the economies of America, Japan and other countries in the Far East.  We still remain, even more so now because the EC is no longer as confident as it was, somewhat isolated, no longer, perhaps, friendless and not isolated.  It is in the interests of this country to move politically nearer and nearer to the civilised parliamentary democracies of Western Europe and form as close a union with them as we can.  It is in our interest and it should be in their interest not to allow this country to degenerate into the sick man of the West whose immunities have broken down and who forms a prime target for subversion and revolution.</P>
    <P>Unaided, and relying on our own defences, I would feel a lot less secure than I would if I could be certain that I was part of a structure in which it was equally in the interests of somebody living in Jutland or in Sardinia that there should be civility, order and democracy here.  I would be far less happy if we were left to defend that position on our own than if it were in the interests of another 250 million people that it should continue so.</P>
    <P>Therefore, in general terms increasing political integration is of quite peculiar value to us.  It is of a quality quite different from any value it may have for the Dutch or the Danes.  They are not threatened in the same way as we are. They are not weak, geographically isolated, relatively defenceless with a very volatile population assailed by all kinds of troubles, chronic unemployment &mdash; structural unemployment the worst of the lot &mdash; and with the situation in the North of Ireland apparently never going to go away.  Certainly, I do not have any solution for it, none that can be put into effect in the absence of a consensus of a kind which I do not see emerging in the House.</P>
    <P>The geographical position of the country has a second disadvantage which I regard as of some importance in regard to making a judgement about political integration.  Our isolation results in us being mentally, intellectually and culturally somewhat isolated.  It results in our <Col N="2098" /> having a scale of values which other people find hard to understand, which appear to them to be even somewhat childish.  I do not think one should run one's life in deference to other people's opinions and I have said that very often in the House in regard to our looking over our shoulder at the British but many of the things we do not say, many of our attitudes of mind seem absolutely childlike, impossible to explain to anybody not alone the British.  In fact, the British are more likely to have some sympathy for them than anybody else because they live quite near and have had a taste for themselves for many hundreds of years.  One is perhaps likely to find more sympathy or understanding for the peculiar Irish mind there than on the Continent. Certainly nowhere outside our shores can some of our attitudes be understood.  We are absolutely isolated and deprived of measures of reality with which other people have to live.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan is a Member with whom I have civil and friendly contacts. I meet him in the lift occasionally and we pass the time of day.  I have never had the faintest bit of trouble with him.  I hope he did not mind me interrupting him uncouthly a few minutes ago.  I have no wish to offend him even though he is not in the House any longer.  However, when I heard him say something it brought me back to the days when I was first a Member 12 years ago when there were a couple of elderly Deputies, now gone, who breathed the last enchantments of the nineteenth century in their speeches with their romantic evocations of conditions which, perhaps, might have raised the blood pressure of my grandfather or greatgrandfather but certainly is no longer able to raise mine.</P>
    <P>I heard Deputy Noonan talking about our unique cultural heritage and our unique Irish language.  I do not mean to point at him in particular but he was the person who mentioned it.  In my years in the House I rarely heard him open his mouth in any language but never in Irish. I do not know what his grip of the thing is or how much interest he has in it.  I am willing to suppose he has no less than <Col N="2099" /> anybody else but that is not a lot.  What is a Dutch man to make of his complaint that Irish has not been made one of the Community's official languages?  The Dutchman, if he is the Dutchman I have met, will say: &ldquo;Where is it in your personal scale of priorities?  Do you speak it yourself?  Say a few words for us in Irish that will not just be the Our Father or the Apostles Creed that you may have learned off in school.  Translate the conversation we had about the abominable meal we had in the railway station in Milan into Irish off the top of your head like a good man until I hear what the thing sounds like.&rdquo;  I do not believe that he, like a lot of other Members, would be glad to be asked such a thing.  Why then does he expect the Dutchman or Greek to take seriously pleas of that kind?  It would not have crossed my mind to mention that, were it not for the fact that I heard this bit of 1927ish flim-flamery float across the House from a man who must have heard it when he was a small child from Dev who at least believed this stuff.</P>
    <P>Dev at least believed what he was saying and went to some lengths to practise it, but they did not extend to forcing his followers to do so.  He was willing to put up with the most perfunctory observance from them.  As I said, he believed what he said and went to some length to practise it, and it rubbed off on the young Deputy Noonan.  I can see him in his short trousers, with the wind whistling across the square of Newcastle West listening to Dev speaking from the back of a lorry and saying to himself that if he wanted to get on in politics he would occasionally have to take off his cap to the Irish language and refer to its status as a unique, cultural asset and inheritance.</P>
    <P>That is the kind of talk no one outside these shores can understand because it does not come across as serious talk.  The stranger judges us by what we do.  What he sees when he comes to Ireland on holiday or on a business trip is the cultural situation.  I mean &ldquo;cultural&rdquo; in a general sense and not just the language we speak but the way we live which, to his eyes, is <Col N="2100" /> barely distinguishable from what happens in England.  There are the some boring rows of boring semi-detached houses, the same interests, the same sports, the same slang and jargon.  We use expressions like &ldquo;no way&rdquo; and &ldquo;hopefully&rdquo;, which nobody used 15 years ago, because the English do.  He will see the same type of clothes, the same manners, the same places to go on holiday, the same standards of everything.</P>
    <P>Where is this priceless heritage?  I mention this only as an example of the awful isolation which our geographical situation forces on us.  The sooner we get integrated in Europe and send streams and cycles of our young people to live there the better.  Eventually some of them will come back bringing with them skills and experience and, above all, a scale of values, a tariff of the importance of things, not necessarily taking over holus bolus from a German or a Greek, but a tariff which will at least represent a modification of this peculiar Irish mentality in which sanctimonious hypocrisy, unreality, the willingness to know one thing but to believe, or pretend to believe, are such significant parts.  That form of mentality works detrimentally to us in industry, agriculture, industrial relations and in politics.</P>
    <P>The more we can integrate with people who will give us a standard to measure our own way of doing things, which will enable us to see when we are talking seafóid, which will enable us to understand that we have been preaching something that is not a viable proposition, that will provide some standard by which we can measure our own beliefs, and perhaps modify them, the more we will benefit from it intellectually and even spiritually but certainly industrially, commercially, agriculturally and politically.</P>
    <P>It is important to regard Europe as one country in order to get rid of the fetish we have of working anywhere save at the end of our own boreen.  As I said many times, the EC was founded not just to sustain a Common Agricultural Policy and provide us with an endless market for a limited number of products, but to <Col N="2101" /> provide mobility of capital, establishment and labour.  We are not interested in these things.  We are not interested in the fact that in north-western Europe, the richest part of Europe, there is a sinking population which could provide job opportunities for our young people provided they are properly trained, have skills or are not dumb and incompetent when they get there.</P>
    <P>Instead of grasping these opportunities we say the scourage of emigration is here again.  It is a scourge, a shame and a disgrace if all we can provide by way of equipment is what the young boy can take in a fibre suitcase on the boat to Euston, hoping he can sleep in the corner of somebody's bedroom for a couple of weeks and, as likely as not, ending up as a social casualty.  That type of emigration is a curse as was the emigration at the time of the Queenstown Wakes.  Parents knew they would never again see their children who were emigrating across the Atlantic.  If they survived that crossing and the trauma of trying to get established, they never hoped to rise above the level of a navvy or domestic servant. They never hoped they would earn the money to come back to Ireland, let alone settle down here in comfort.  These things were curses.</P>
    <P>We ought to see Europe as a place which can be reached in 90 minutes.  I am not talking about the price of air fares. That is another day's work.  All I am saying is that the social disruption occasioned by migration &mdash; it does not have to be permanent &mdash; to some other part of Western Europe is nothing compared to what it once was.  It is wicked to continue to speak of emigration in those terms.  It is wicked for a politician to keep this fetish alive in the minds of young people that they are failures if they do not find work in their own townland.  It also is wicked to pretend that a Government have a duty to so distribute industry that there is a little factory at the end of every boreen.  This is the kind of things politicians when in Opposition pretend a Government should be doing.  There is no such obligation on any Government. How do the Italians or the Greeks feel <Col N="2102" /> about this?  They are as proud as we are. They do not consider it a humiliation that millions of their people work in central and northern Europe, earn good money and the majority eventually come home. They do not consider that a curse.  They consider they are damn lucky to have the chance to belong to a Community which cannot erect walls against them.</P>
    <P>My last comment bears on this bogey about neutrality.  I heard it reported on the wireless at lunchtime that Deputy Haughey said the Government were not defending our traditional policy of neutrality with sufficient conviction.  I want to say two things about that.  First, I have never heard in a private meeting of the Fine Gael Party, or when I was in Government, or on the Front Bench in Opposition, either the Taoiseach or any other Member of the Front Bench say one word which would lead me to think that they are not sincere in speaking about a policy of neutrality.</P>
    <P>I want to declare myself as being in dissent from them.  I see nothing in what we call our traditional policy of neutrality and I do not see how anyone could defend it with conviction.  I have thought that ever since the fifties when I used to hear partition being trotted out as a reason for our inability to join a military alliance. At that time it was said that we could not join such an alliance because it would be an implicit recognition of the Border.  If we do not implicitly recognise the Border, why keep a customs post at every Border crossing?  If we want to pretend it is not there, why not allow people to come and go as they wish and not exercise excise controls?  In other words, we use it when it suits it and ignore it when it does not.  I hated that hypocrisy in the fifties.  I hate is just as much in the eighties that we have a traditional policy of neutrality because it is thought we would be likely to influence the outside world more if we were neutral.</P>
    <P>We are members of UNIFIL in the Lebanon.  So too are the French, the Canadians and the Italians, and yet they find it possible to collaborate on Western defence.  Are they any less acceptable as a peace keeping force as a result of that?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2103" /> When I hear Deputy O'Kennedy saying that we have a deep commitment to Europe and hear the talk about culture, I do not reach for my revolver, I reach for my sick bag.  What is our commitment to Europe worth?  The only commitment I ever hear talked about in this House is our commitment to ensuring that we can squeeze every last dollar while contributing the absolute basic rockbottom minimum.  When I say that, I am talking about money.  As far as any other contribution is concerned, we are very free with talk.  We will go to meetings, collaborate on reports, provide chairmen for committees, but is our commitment worth a damn to anybody if it means that we will not lift one finger to protect the values we are talking about, things which make Europe up, which lie behind this ancient, shared civilisation and which are under threat as we know?</P>
    <P>That is not to say that one defends everything that the Americans do.  Of course not.  One cannot do that, just as in any human relationship between husband and wife, parents and children, one accepts the faults as well as the good points, as one hopes will be done in one's own case.  I am not under any illusions about the Americans.  Putting the very best gloss one can on it, one can say that their behaviour is insensitive and one could say a great deal worse about it. However, we have to make choices in this life and it is a lie and a hypocrisy to pretend that it is a matter of indifference to us in this country as to who would come out on top in a global confrontation.  God forbid that we shall ever live to see such a thing.  If we had not had that confrontation &mdash; and Europe has now survived for 40 years without a major war in European territory &mdash; it is because of the will of the western democracies, many on the European Continent, to defend those values and to defend them with their fists.</P>
    <P>The IRA do not like to hear me saying that and neither does Deputy Mac Giolla. Every subversive organisation whose interest it is to weaken a country, make it vulnerable, leaving it a prey to revolution, does not like to hear that being said. <Col N="2104" /> However, it has to be said.  I do not think that I have any adherents in my party, although I have a few tacit fellow travellers who are not very significant, but I want to acquit the Taoiseach and the Government entirely of complicity with me &mdash; however ludicruous the idea is when I put it like that &mdash; in my opinions on this matter.  However, I do meet many people from time to time who say that they agree with my point of view and that it is a pity more people do not think it.  I believe that people in this House do think it and it should be said.</P>
    <P>Every other small country in western Europe started out in 1939 like us, neutral. Belgium, Holland, Luxemburg, Denmark, Norway and Greece wanted to remain neutral.  They remained neutral until they were over-run.  They learned their lesson.  When the war ended in 1945, there was no more talk about neutrality. The smallest of them, even Luxembourg, was willing, with greater or lesser degrees of willingness or reluctance &mdash; despite cuts, money, inconvenience, national service, all these things &mdash; to join the western defence in some shape or form. I do not suppose that a Dutch politician wants wholeheartedly to endorse everything the Americans do in Central America. I do not suppose that one would get applause in the Danish Parliament for American policy in Central America. However, these people are levelheaded. They do not have the magical, holy insights of the sanctimonious Pats.  They do not think that they are wiser than everyone else, able to have it both ways, able to preach their commitment while not risking a halfpenny or the end of a finger to defend it.  They do not think like that; they are made of lesser clay than we are and have much simpler ways of approaching things.  They just say, by and large, if a confrontation arose which involved Europe, if it ended with the defeat of the western powers there would be nothing left in Europe but a wilderness. What would be left in this country would be a population reduced materially to the poverty of the 1840s and to the political servitude of the 1740s, if not the 1640s.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2105" /> Nobody gets at me to say these things. I am not in the pay of anybody.  In fact, I have never had any such approach in regard to anything that I have said in this line at all.  I do not belong to any group and nobody corresponds with me on this subject.  I do not advocate any special mode of defensive alliance.  I am not advocating NATO membership.  I do not know enough about it to warrant having an opinion on the subject.  All I advocate is that we should shrug off this fetish about our traditional policy of neutrality. It should be thrown in the bin, along with the twin national objectives of our priceless cultural heritage and our unique spiritual empire.  This is all rubbish, cottonwool which prevents the mind of the ordinary Irishman from working.  It is a substitute for thought.  These things should be discarded.  We should look at the matter soberly.  There may be contexts in which it may make sense to be neutral, but there may well be conflicts in which it makes no sense and is inimical to our self-respect as well as to our selfinterest.</P>

      <P>I am glad to have the opportunity to congratulate Senator Dooge on producing this report under most extraordinarily difficult circumstances. I read and studied it very carefully. Like everybody else, I have a point of view on it.  I want to pay tribute in this House to the exceptional energy which Senator Dooge put into leading this group of very senior European politicians and into presenting this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, this debate is basically a European debate and because I hold a dual mandate I have an opportunity of taking part in it.  Other members of the European Parliament have no opportunity of attending in the Dáil or in the Seanad to put forward their views on this subject.  I have written to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, asking them to consider allowing members of the European Parliament to address the Dáil and the Seanad in certain circumstances dealing with matters relevant to Europe. I hope that there will be all-party agreement to that, so that when we reach the <Col N="2106" /> stage where there is no such thing as a dual mandate &mdash; and I hope, frankly, that will be very soon &mdash; we will be able to debate these matters.</P>
    <P>I have a great admiration for the manner in which Deputy Kelly addresses himself very colourfully to various subjects which come before this House.  He refers to the isolation in which we here appear to be living.  Apparently, he denigrates our cultural heritage, or does not recognise that we have one.  Those who can speak the Irish language are, apparently, people who are not as cultured perhaps as he thinks he himself is.  Of course, we are isolated from Europe, by Britain and by two seas.  It makes it more difficult for us Members and the citizens of this country, because of the expense and otherwise, to travel abroad and see what is happening in these areas.  While we might have some difficulty in this area, we are rapidly becoming too closely associated with the materialistic approaches taking place in Europe.</P>
    <P>In France, Germany and Belgium the birth rate has fallen to half a child per family.  Children are a rarity there and families are breaking up at a very rapid pace.  Children are replaced by dogs, if you do not mind.  In France and Germany a dog is given place of honour at the table in a restaurant.  Is this the kind of thing that we want to import into this country, where animals are replacing the family? I find that quite unacceptable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Andrews</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be due to economic circumstances.  We may talk about that later.  I wish to make it clear at the outset that I support absolutely the European Community.  In passing, I wish people would stop calling it the Common Market as though it were Moore Street or some market in Belfast or elsewhere. I am glad that Spain and Portugal are about to join us.  Their entry will lend a renewed vitality that is badly needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It seems strange that we should be talking about a united Europe at a time when Europe is divided in the ideological <Col N="2107" /> and military sense.  Eastern Europe is dominated by the totalitarian Government of the Soviet Union.  Czechoslovakia and East Germany are bristling with SS20s and SS21s that are aimed to destroy western Europe.  In reply to that, America controls the weaponry of western Europe.  They press the buttons; they decide our destiny.  There are no dual control buttons on the Pershing and Cruise missiles in western Europe.  While our neutrality may be military neutrality, certainly it is not ideological neutrality.</P>
    <P>I have great admiration for America and what it did to restore Europe and save it from the eastern threat after the War.  They did this by way of Marshall aid.  Sometimes I wish President Reagan would consider a similar possibility in Central America where human rights problems are critical and where the attack on Nicaragua goes on unabated.</P>
    <P>To me, neutrality is an option for peace and that is how we should view it.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of today's date we read that the re-elected Prime Minister of Greece, Dr. Papandreou, said that the two main foreign policy goals of his country are to work towards the unification of Europe and to banish US bases and nuclear weapons from Greek soil.  The newspaper report continued:</P>
    <P>On relations with the United States, he declared that his Government had a commitment to close the US bases when the present accord expires at the end of 1988, demonstrating the same determination as it had towards eliminating nuclear weapons from Greek soil.</P>
    <P>If Dr. Papandreou and the Greek Government are so anxious to remove US weapons from their soil, are we not a lucky nation that we did not get involved in accepting them in the first place? Equally, I welcome the renewed commitment of the Greek Prime Minister to stay in Europe and to improve the situation on this Continent.</P>
    <P>Of course, there are those who suggest that if one is critical of the violation of human rights on one side one is in a <Col N="2108" /> certain camp.  There are those in the Government here who suggest that, if one takes a position of the Vatican II theology of liberation and the option for the poor, one is a leftie, a Marxist, or something of that kind.  I do not think anyone could have accused Pope John XXIII of that.  I do not think anyone could accuse the many missionaries in South East Asia, Africa or in Central or Latin America of being Marxist-Leninist because they support the theology of the Second Vatican Council.  We should make that absolutely clear and I am delighted to have the opportunity to put it on the record of this House.</P>
    <P>In times past I have seen the damage caused by that kind of suggestion from the Government about members of this party.  I recall the history of the United States and the era of Senator McCarthy looking for &ldquo;Reds under the bed&rdquo; merely because they sought a centre ground between the left and the right.  Any nation that aims for growth on its own loses out very quickly.  Any nation trying to put its industry back on its feet by relying only on itself in the face of the industrial strength of the US and Japan will lose out and will have little chance of success unless it acts together with its partners.</P>
    <P>The EC has had to weather the storm of the worldwide recession.  Invitably certain member states refused to pull their weight and they created internal friction.  Their selfish actions weakened the ability of the Community to unite together to see out the storm.  The Community, with each of the member states, should now be forging ahead but, because of the eternal wrangling over budgetary matters, we have been forced to compete from behind for a top place in the international market.  I believe we can make up lost ground if we rededicate ourselves to achieving the objectives of the EC Treaties.</P>
    <P>The EC with its market of some 270 million people offers us the best hope of tackling the disastrous social and economic predicament in which this country finds itself, in common with other European countries.  Many of the new goals <Col N="2109" /> that are being set can be achieved within the framework of the existing Treaties. As a member of the European Economic Community &mdash; and I emphasise economic &mdash; Ireland participates fully in the formulation of policies and in the taking of decisions in the economic and trading sectors which vitally affect our national interests.</P>
    <P>At a time when the EC should be seeking to build on the targets it set itself in the Treaties, a totally unacceptable diversion has been set up to direct it into a security and defence Community.  In the White Paper of January 1972 on &ldquo;The Accession of Ireland to the European Communities&rdquo; our position was made quite clear.  That White Paper stated:</P>
    <P>The Irish Government in applying for membership of the Communities declared their acceptance of the Treaties of Rome and Paris, the decisions taken in their implementation and the political objectives of the treaties.  The Government have, furthermore, declared their readiness to join as a member of the enlarged Communities in working with the other member states towards the goal of political unification of Europe.  It should, however, be emphasised that the Treaties of Rome and Paris do not entail any military or defence commitments and no such commitments are involved in Ireland's acceptance of the treaties.</P>
    <P>The conclusions of the Dooge Committee have sent aftershocks rumbling through the Community.  This committee which was set up to report to the European Council on institutional affairs has jeopardised Ireland's neutrality.  Among the proposals put forward by the committee is one which states that during consultations relating to EC foreign affairs there should be a discussion on the way in which member states' security interest may be affected in the international context, in particular by developments in weapons technology and strategic doctrines, changes in relations between the great Powers and the progress of negotiations on disarmament and arms control.</P>
    <P>The member states of the EC are <Col N="2110" /> democratic, that is, they believe in government by the people for the people. A full and open public discussion on what the Dooge Committee is proposing has been taking place and this must continue. The future direction of policies which will have a major impact on our affairs is being considered.  It is essential that the issues put forward come out into the open.</P>
    <P>It is proposed in the concluding paragraphs of the Dooge Report that an intergovernmental conference should be convened in the near future to negotiate a draft European union treaty.  That report states:</P>
    <P>The very decision of the Heads of State or Government to convene such a conference would have great symbolic value and would represent the initial act of European Union.</P>
    <P>Such a decision may be taken within the next few days when the Heads of Government meet in Italy.</P>
    <P>It is to be noted &mdash; I agree with what it says in <i>The Irish Times</i>&mdash; that the Taoiseach goes to Milan with a deserved reputation as a &ldquo;good European&rdquo;.  I presume there are a few other good Europeans around apart from the Taoiseach. Most of us would consider ourselves to be good Europeans.  I hope they will stop using that expression when referring to one person.  The article in <i>The Irish Times</i> states:</P>
    <P>... that is someone who sees real value in much closer integration in Western Europe, and who has had, in the past at least, the imagination to contemplate new forms of economic and political management that transcend traditional national sovereignties.</P>
    <P>According to the article, the debates taking place in the Dáil and Seanad today on European integration have little chance of influencing the Taoiseach when he goes to Milan. &ldquo;Slim in the extreme&rdquo;<i>The Irish Times</i> calls it and I agree.  This debate should have taken place within one or two weeks of the debate being published.  All Members of the European <Col N="2111" /> Parliament who represent Ireland should have an opportunity to address themselves to the Dáil or Seanad when issues of this kind arise.  That would be useful.</P>
    <P>Our membership of the EC committed us to the Treaty of Rome, its objectives and provisions.  Its aim was the formation of a common market.  A common market it may well be but it is not a European economic and social market.  It aims through the progressive approximation of the economic policies of the member states to promote throughout the community the harmonious development of economic activities, a continuous and balanced expansion, increased stability, an accelerated raising of living standards and closer relations between its member states.  Very significantly for us it aims to reduce the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less favoured regions.  Many of these aims we know have not yet been achieved.  It is our task to see that they are achieved.</P>
    <P>Based on the conclusions of the Dooge Committee, what type of new treaty would be drawn up?  How would it compare with the existing treaty?  While it is difficult to predict the outcome of an inter-governmental conference on the drafting of a new treaty, a conference in which the European Parliament may be closely involved, certain trends may be foreseen.  In a number of key areas the report of the Dooge Committee and Parliament's Draft Treaty are very similar. Both texts are comparable where they propose that there should be majority voting in the Council and that unanimity should be retained only for certain exceptional decisions.  This latter point is of major significance to Ireland.  The proposals that the role of the Commission be strengthened follows the line taken by the Spinelli Draft Treaty.  Both documents seek to reinforce the powers of control of the European Parliament in the field of external relations and that responsibilities be conferred on Parliament where revenue-related decisions are concerned.</P>
    <P>I want to return for a moment to the need to reduce imbalances between the <Col N="2112" /> member states, an aim which is clearly identified in the existing Rome Treaty. It was a Fianna Fáil Government who negotiated a special Protocol of Accession for Ireland.  This Protocol in no uncertain manner recognises that it is in the interests of the member states to see that policy of industrialisation and economic development, designed to align the standards of living in Ireland with those of other European nations and to eliminate under-employment while progressively evening out regional differences in levels of development, is implemented.  What will be the status of this special Protocol 30 if a new treaty is drawn up?  There was no reservation by Senator Dooge to the two paragraphs on the promotion of economic convergence.  Such a reservation was left to the Greek member of the Dooge Committee.  The Dooge text merely calls for the promotion of solidarity among member states aimed at reducing structural imbalances which prevent the convergence of living standards, through the strengthening of specific community instruments and a judicious definition of Community policy.  It calls for positive action to counter inequality and promote the convergence of living standards.</P>
    <P>The Greek representative, Mr. Papantoniou, argued correctly that the text should stress more explicitly the need to support policies aiming at economic convergence and should give a more comprehensive definition to their scope.  Our Irish Chairman, Senator Dooge, voiced no objection to this imprecise and vague text.  What confidence can we have that the Irish Government would seek to have an unequivocal re-statement of the aims of Protocol 30 reconfirmed in any new Treaty?  We want a clear and unamibiguous commitment from the Community that it will be totally committed to reducing the differences existing between the various regions and the backwardness of the less-favoured regions.</P>
    <P>I put it to the House that there is no doubt that the existing Treaty of Rome has served Ireland well and will continue to do so.  No Irish person need be reminded of the crucial role played by <Col N="2113" /> the Common Agricultural Policy in our economy.  It is one of the cornerstones of the Rome Treaty.  Between 1973 and 1983, the guarantee and guidance section of the Common Agricultural Policy were worth £3,109.95 million.  In the Spinelli Draft Treaty the Common Agricultural Policy is relegated to a few indents under economic sectoral policies.</P>
    <P>In the Dooge Report, there is a reference to the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; as a footnote.  The Danish representative stressed that all the measures in the agricultural area which have in recent years been introduced with the intention of renationalising the Common Agricultural Policy should be dismantled.  Where do the Irish Government stand on this issue?  What would a new treaty do to agriculture?  These questions must be addressed to the Government.  We have no doubt where we stand on that issue but there is some doubt as to where the Government stand.</P>
    <P>In the European elections last year in our election platform we clearly stated our position of a policy of positive neutrality. I stress military neutrality for the information of the Taoiseach.  In recent times it has been suggested that European political co-operation, that is, the EC's foreign policy, should be extended to military affairs.  Fianna Fáil are totally opposed to this.  Fianna Fáil are opposed to any involvement in either military or defence matters by EC institutions.  This opposition is rooted in our status as a member state which does not belong to any military alliance.  Our military neutrality must be presented in the Communities as an aspect of a policy of positive neutrality.  Our status of not belonging to any military alliance enables us to back without equivocation the right of all nations to self determination, be it in Afghanistan, Central America, Poland, Lithuania, Guatemala or Chile.</P>
    <P>The footnotes of the Dooge report when dealing with the question of security and defence state that Senator Dooge did not agree to the inclusion of this section.  This section stresses the need for an Atlantic Alliance to maintain adequate military strength in Europe and <Col N="2114" /> developing and strengthening consultation on security problems as part of political co-operation.  Why did Senator Dooge not enter reservations earlier in the report to other references to security?  In the first chapter on &ldquo;A Genuine Political Entity&rdquo;, that is, a European Union, the Danish representative on the committee considered that the reference to security should be limited to the political and economic aspects of security.  Senator Dooge entered no such reservations here, nor on the section dealing with &ldquo;An External Identity&rdquo; which describes &ldquo;security&rdquo; as a fundamental aim of European Union.</P>
    <P>Senator Dooge thereby implicitly accepts that the proposed political union should deal with the military aspects of security.  As he represented the Taoiseach on this committee, this must also reflect the Government's position: if not, I should like to have that made clear.</P>
    <P>Just how much further is Ireland to be led down the road towards abandoning our traditional neutrality at the behest of those who are clearly prepared to go much further?</P>
    <P>We have a major unemployment problem courtesy of the Coalition Government.  We have a major crime wave which the Coalition are mishandling. Government borrowing is out of control.  Our shipping industry has been allowed to collapse.  More and more people are falling into the poverty trap. Let us not be deflected down the sacrificial path of lost neutrality.  This country and the European Economic Community have business to do.  We must step up our efforts to create jobs, to reduce the economic and social differences that exist between the member states.  There are policies to create for new technologies, food processing, energy, forestry, construction, research and development, aid for the homeless and the disadvantaged. In short we need an economic relaunching of Europe backed up with adequate resources.  We need to build on the aims of the existing EC treaties.  We have had enough reports from the time of Spinelli and before him and now another.  What <Col N="2115" /> is needed is a re-examination of our commitment to a totally united Europe, a Europe that could be united from east to west but before then let us not forget, when talking of European unity, that we have a divided Ireland, a country occupied by a member of the Community, that there is a Germany divided, east and west and which epitomises the results of the tragedy of the last war.</P>
    <P>I can only suggest that when a debate of this kind is to take place here again, all of us who are members of the European Parliament are given the opportunity to contribute.  I suggest also that any such debate should take place well in advance of the Taoiseach taking off for a summit at which the issue in question is to be discussed.  He is going to Milan, not knowing what is happening because of his not being involved personally in the debate.  It is regrettable that he should be going away without taking careful note of what is being said here during this debate.</P>

      <P>Aontaím leis an chuid is mó atá ráite ag an Teachta Alice Glenn. Is mór an trua nach bhfuil níos mó ama againn chun ceist chomh tábhachtach leis seo a phlé.  Ar an dtaobh eile den scéal bhí na ráitis inniu an-fhada ar fad &mdash; 30 nóiméad.  I bParlaimint na hEorpa ní bhíonn ach trí nó cúig nóiméad ag gach Teachta chun labhairt.  I ndíospóireachtaí mar seo i bParlaiminte na hEorpa bíonn dhá nóiméad ag gach Teachta.  Labhair mé uair amháin agus ní raibh ach nóiméad amháin agam.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fáiltím roimh an deis seo atá tugtha do Dháil Éireann chun an cheist an-tábhach-tach seo a phlé, ceist Aontas na hEorpa sa todhchaí.  Ba mhaith liom mo chomhgháirdeas a dhéanamh, ní amháin mar Theachta Dála ach mar bhall de Pharlaimint na hEorpa chomh maith leis an Seanadóir Jim Dooge as ucht na hoibre iontaí atá déanta aige chun an tuarascáil atá curtha le chéile aige a chur chun dea-críche. Chomh maith leis sin fáiltím roimh an ráiteas a thug an Taoiseach maidin inniu.

    <P>I am pleased that the Dáil has the opportunity of this major debate on such an important issue.  There is merit in what has been said by Deputy Glenn.  It is regrettable that because of the pressure on time and the large amount of business that has to be concluded between now and the summer recess, more time could not have been given to this debate.  However, perhaps the Dáil might follow the example of the European Parliament where, as I have said already, the average speaking time available to a member is from three to five minutes.</P>
    <P>On one occasion I made a speech in the European Parliament which lasted one minute while Deputy Andrews spoke recently for two minutes.  Perhaps in the context of the whole question of the reform of the Dáil, this is an aspect that might be considered.  The advantage of such a restricted speaking time is that it disciplines members to concentrate, in the short time available to them, on the main points of an issue.</P>
    <P>The issue being debated today in this Parliament concerning the latest proposals for European Union are of the utmost importance to the future of Europe and of every member state. These proposals have vital and far-reaching implications for this small country which is on the periphery of the Community. The final decision on these proposals will have a profound effect on the lives and fortunes of our people and on the people of Europe as a whole for many years to come.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate and perhaps timely also that this debate on the question of European Union should be taking place throughout Europe after the passing of a quarter of a century since the signing of the Treaty of Rome and on the occasion of the fortieth anniversary of the ending of World War II.</P>
    <P>It is appropriate and timely that we should be discussing European Union in the week following the signature by Spain and Portugal of the Treaty of their Accession to the EC.  I might express the <Col N="2118" /> hope that the debate now taking place here and in other national Parliaments throughout the Community will help to forge new links between national Parliaments and the European Parliament.  I am convinced that these links must be strengthened.</P>
    <P>Those of us who still retain the dual mandate have the privilege of speaking in our national Parliaments but the vast majority of MEPs do not have such opportunity.  It is impossible for any individual to discharge a dual mandate effectively and indefinitely.  I believe some system must be devised which will ensure close and continuous liaison between the European Parliament and national Parliaments. For that reason I am still in favour of granting the privilege to single mandate members of the European Parliament of addressing their national Parliaments on special occasions such as this.</P>
    <P>In advocating better liaison between national Parliaments and the European Parliament, I contend that such would contribute to creating greater public awareness of the importance and significance of EC membership to the lives and fortunes of our people.  We are all only too well aware of the great need for creating well informed public opinion on Community matters.  The establishment of closer links between national Parliaments and the European Parliament, and providing opportunities to members of the European Parliament to address the Dáil, Séanad or both Houses on special occasions, will help to overcome the problems of the irrelevancy in the eyes of the ordinary citizen of the EC and of the European Parliament.</P>
    <P>I wish to pay a very special tribute to Senator James Dooge on the outstanding work he has done and on the brilliant manner in which he has discharged the very important, onerous and difficult task assigned him in chairing this special committee on European Union.  The widespread and favourable acceptance and response throughout the Community to the Dooge report is a tribute to his ability and his hard and patient work.  I hope that his work and that of his other colleaguse on the committee, who compiled the <Col N="2119" /> report we are now discussing, will bear fruit at the forthcoming Milan Summit.</P>
    <P>I believe the Dooge report identifies the real issues and pinpoints the problems confronting the Community at present and in the immediate future.  More importantly, it clearly signposts the road ahead.  Let there be no mistake about it. The European Community is now, and has been for a considerable time, at the crossroads.  If we take one road it will lead to continued stagnation, political, economic, social and financial.  The EC has for some time now been drifting from crisis to crisis, a Community which, until two weeks ago, was unable to formulate a budget for the current year.  Let us be honest and realistic about this.  The EC can have no future if it continues along this road, drifting from crisis to crisis, trying to find <i>ad hoc</i> solutions to immediate problems with no proper long-term planning and no adequate system of long-term financing.  The Community has been travelling that road for far too long. Those of us who are Members of the European Parliament are only too well aware of this drift from crisis to crisis.  In December last the European Parliament rejected the 1985 budget because it covered ten months only of the year 1985. No Parliament or Government could accept a budget which made provision for ten months only.  Following a decision taken by the European Parliament a couple of weeks ago we now have a budget for the current year.  I believe that if this Community is to survive, if it is to make progress but above all, if it is to have real meaning for the people who belong to it, there is no other option but to travel the road signposted by the Dooge report.</P>
    <P>The EC today is faced with serious financial, economic and social problems. With massive unemployment the Community has failed to formulate realistic policies which could even begin to attempt to tackle the problem of the 14 million people unemployed within the Community.  However, the real significance of today's debate &mdash; I say this very sincerely and very much welcome the <Col N="2120" /> clear presentation by the Taoiseach this morning &mdash; is the vital issues facing the Community at this critical moment in its history.  I and most of my colleagues should be glad that the Taoiseach in that presentation put the various issues in their proper perspective and order of priority.</P>
    <P>In recent months almost every discussion on the subject of European Union seems to have been dominated by the neutrality controversy.  I had the privilege of participating in an open forum at the Fine Gael Árd Fheis.  As soon as the panel had made their introductory speeches, the first question that arose was neutrality.  In the media in particular this aspect of European Union has been highlighted on numerous occassions.  This is a most important and vital question, but there are other equally important and fundamental questions confronting the Community at present which have not received the attention they deserve.  I am very glad the Taoiseach spelled out very clearly Ireland's position in relation to defence and security in his remarks here this morning.</P>
    <P>The paragraph I shall now quote was crystal clear, leaving no room for misinterpretation and read as follows:</P>
    <P>In the discussion of these matters Ireland finds itself in a different position from its partners, all of whom are members of the North Alantic Alliance, while Ireland is neutral.  It should be made clear that no other Government have put any pressure at any time on us on this issue of neutrality.  Persistent reports to the contrary are quite simply inventions.  No one should allow themselves to be fooled by this propaganda.</P>
    <P>Then the Taoiseach referred to the fact that Senator Dooge could not accept the section on security and defence in the report and said that Senator Dooge was reflecting the position of the Government. He said further:</P>
    <P>Irish policy in this regard is both <Col N="2121" /> understood and accepted by our partners. In discussion of the report's proposals, we will continue to take the line that there are subsisting and valid distinctions between these aspects of security that are appropriate to political co-operation and those, such as operational defence questions, that are appropriate to alliance frameworks.</P>
    <P>I concur with the Taoiseach's final remark <i>vis-á-vis</i> this question of security and defence when he said:</P>
    <P>The fact is that our country's position in this matter is known to and understood by our partners and no question arises in this context of any change in the Government's commitment to maintain Ireland's neutral position of non-membership of military alliances.</P>
    <P>I was anxious to put this comment by the Taoiseach on the record in the light of the controversy that has been going on. I suspect that a lot of this is purely propaganda and it is deliberately provocative. I and my colleague, Deputy McCartin, who is a member of the same political grouping in the European Parliament, have had no problems in gaining acceptance and understanding from our colleagues from different countries on our special position <i>vis-á-vis</i> neutrality. Three weeks ago I had the privilege of attending the bi-annual conference of the European Christian Democratic Party. Twenty one political parties in Western Europe were represented at that conference. President Colombo, the President of the European Union of Christian Democrats, on the concluding morning of the conference referred to Ireland's special condition.  It was also spelled out at the beginning of the conference by Mr. Andreotti, the Italian Foreign Minister. I am glad the Taoiseach gave the lead in the manner in which he presented his address this morning.</P>
    <P>Many important issues have been raised in the Dooge report and these issues are becoming more and more serious as times goes on.  It is well known to members of the European Parliament that the question of the future financing of the Community the question of own <Col N="2122" /> resources, the question of the veto and the question of the role of the Commission and of the role and powers of the European Parliament are vital issues.  The Taoiseach dealt with these this morning.  I will not monopolise the time because my colleague, Deputy Joe McCartin, has come back from Brussels especially to participate in this debate and I propose to share some of my 30 minutes with him so I am prepared to lose the opportunity to present a speech which I have been preparing in the last few days.</P>
    <P>In relation to the question of own resources, the failure of governments to take appropriate decisions in relation to VAT and so on has created a ludicrous situation.  It is a waste of time to talk about European Union unless an appropriate system is formulated to ensure adequate financing of the Community in the years ahead to enable the Community to formulate and implement appropriate regional policies, social policies, research and development policies and so on.  We should not have this hit and miss situation year after year with totally inadequate financial resources available to implement appropriate policies.</P>
    <P>In relation to the decision making procedures referred to in the Dooge report and referred to by the Taoiseach this morning, every member of the European Parliament knows only too well the dire need to streamline the decision making processes.  I have been a member of the Transport Committee since 1979.  The Transport Committee is a very good committee with a good chairman.  Numerous reports were produced by that committee and no action was taken by the Council of Ministers.  The Transport Committee, with the full approval of the European Parliament, had in the past year to take the unprecedented and radical step of bringing the Council of Ministers before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg. While this was looked upon as being a gimmick, a preliminary judgment of the court was issued in recent weeks and has upheld the rights of the parliament to bring the Council to the Court of Justice <Col N="2123" /> and the final judgement will, I presume, be made available to us in due course.</P>
    <P>The question of the veto has been raised and in the few moments available to me I can do no more than to refer to what the Taoiseach said this morning in his speech when he stated:</P>
    <P>But overall we should be the net gainers if, in respect of the internal market, decisions could be blocked only by a country which does in fact have an objectively verifiable vital national interest &mdash; a situation which it is now generally recognised will have to be provided for by some solemn procedure of invocation that will discourage its use except in cases where there really is a vital national interest.</P>
    <P>That is something with which I thoroughly agree.  In the light of what I have seen in Europe since 1979 I could not give a <i>carte blanche</i> in relation to completely abolishing the veto; but the formula proposed by the Taoiseach, which says that a vital national interest must be determined by objective criteria, is an acceptable solution.</P>
    <P>The question of the super-levy on milk, on which the Government did a tremendous job, was a vital aspect for us because of the importance of the dairy industry to our economy.  I am not so sure that the action by the West German Government two weeks ago of applying the veto in relation to cereals could be regarded in the same way as a vital national interest to the West German economy which is that of a highly advanced industrialised nation.  There must be some formula to ensure that the veto is not used to hold up decision making for months and years. I agree with the Taoiseach's approach to this.</P>
    <P>I also agree that the powers conferred on the Commission by the Treaty must be fully restored.  These have been eroded in recent years and more and more initiatives seem to be taken by national governments than by the Commission.</P>
    <P>I have been involved in regional policy since 1979 and I have the privilege of being spokesman on regional policy for <Col N="2124" /> the European Christian Democrat Group.  Reference was made in the Dooge report, in the Taoiseach's speech and in the speech this morning by the Minister for Labour, Deputy Quinn, to the need for a massive transfer of resources and to the danger of a free-for-all internal market situation where the strong get stronger and the weak get weaker.  In the context of a European Union, the formulation and implementation of a realistic regional policy is of vital importance.  Such a policy must be backed by adequate financing.  The Minister for Labour referred this morning to the introduction of the Mediterranean plan.  I had the privilege of being involved in the regional policy committee over the last six years in the formulation of this plan.  It was one of my best friends in the parliament and one of my party colleagues, Dr. Hansgert Pottering, who produced a major report on the Mediterranean programme for the parliament.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Could I not get a minute or two past that?  My blood pressure was rising and I am extremely annoyed because I was engaged in Brussels for the last two days full time and I tried to arrange things so that I could get away this morning.  I threw away a ticket which I had bought because I could not change it.  I begged at a desk in London to please give me a flight half an hour earlier to enable me to get here to speak on this subject, and I find I have been given about seven minutes.  Furthermore, I have been begging for the last 12 months to get this subject discussed and not only the Dooge report but the draft treaty.  I have not been attending to my duties in this Parliament as regularly as I should because of my commitments in other places and in my constituency also, but if I had I would have made much more noise about the failure of those people in authority who have the right to do it and, I must say, people in my political party. <Col N="2126" /> to provide time in this House for a reasonable and sensible debate on what I regard as the most important subject that has come before this House in a year and is likely to come before it in the next year &mdash; and we had subjects that generated a great deal of heat.  I refer to the development of European Union.  On the way the economies of Europe proceed and the democracy in Europe survives and develops will depend our future more than on anything else.  As has been pointed out, we are small and peripheral.</P>
      <P>I am annoyed too at the whole negative approach of the people of Ireland, the media generally and Irish politicians to this subject.  When the European Parliament was opened there was a procedure by which the oldest person in the House chaired and opened proceedings, and a very elderly lady from France, Madame Weiss opened the proceedings.  She sat in the same group that Deputy Andrews sits in in the Parliament.  She started off by complimenting great figures in history. She spoke about Charlemagne who first united the Latin and German genius and she went on to say that he had the Saxon king crowned in his summer palace in the Alps while Irish monks cultivated the banks of the Marne.  I remember well the impressive way she opened the Parliament. Some time later I picked up in a library in Brussels a concise history of Europe.  It started on the night of the year 344 when the first serious Germanic invasion crossed the frozen Rhine into France and it finished up in the latter part of the 16th century.  I was amazed on turning the pages to find a chapter by that historian headed &ldquo;The Irish Monks Go Forth&rdquo;.  I am inclined to ask myself today after all that has happened in the 1,300 years, what is happening to the Irish people who made such an impression on Europe in early ages.  After the Romans had withdrawn we were, I am sure, only a few hundred thousand people in a continent of something like 20 million.  At that time the western empire was supposed to have a population of 20 million, and we made an immense impact with Irish education, scholarship and religion from Iona down to the South of Europe.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  Deputy John Kelly knows it well.  You do not want to misinterpret Deputy Kelly.  You need to understand him.  I agree completely with him.  What has happened in the meantime is that we have become afraid to put a foot outside Ireland today.  Our people who have gone to America, into the great melting pot of European peoples, and to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and wherever they have gone they have succeeded in holding their own and making their mark.  Yet today we can think of nothing but the dangers of the Continent of Europe and the powers that the European Commission or the European Parliament might take from us, and our culture, language and heritage and everything being lost in the European melting pot.</P>
      <P>We have a most depressing view of the whole European situation, a view that lacks imagination and courage and, worst of all, any moral thinking or goodwill. What was the burden of debate when we entered Europe first?  What we were getting out of it.  What has been the burden of all the questions and debates of Irish members in the European Parliament? It was what they were going to give us.  What has been the burden of what has come up here to date?  What they are going to give us or what they might take from us.  Implicit in all of this is the belief that we seem to hold that we have nothing to contribute and that there is no future for Ireland in Europe except by holding up the veto which we cling to, the Luxembourg compromise, because it has no basis in any Roman treaty.  We seem to think that by the use of this weapon we can tell 300 million people that we are not going to allow them to go any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most important points that has come up in the Oireachtas committee and in the debate here today is that everybody wants to hold on to this veto, this imaginary weapon by which we think we can prevent the people of Europe from making the sort of progress that they will <Col N="2128" /> try to make democratically.  I did not intend to go into the question of the veto but let me say that it is pure nonsense.  It is ridiculous.  The veto is a weapon by which every single member of the Ten has a right to hold up proceedings.  It will be every single member of the Twelve in the future.  I cannot think of anything that will not affect the vital interests of one of the Twelve or a considerable part or region of any of those nations.  There is no single possible subject, no single law that could be passed, no single directive you could impose on this Community that will not do an injustice to some major region or country or part of a country within the Community.</P>

      <P>I want to mention briefly the question of neutrality that has marred the whole discussion on the development of a European Union because people insist on asking if it is a threat to our neutrality and if they are seeking to force us in.  Why would they want us in? Some journalists suggested to me recently that they were after our young people, that they wanted them to pull triggers and be cannon fodder in the next war.  What nonsense.  Our total population would comprise half of 1 per cent of the people of Europe.  Whether we have 3 per cent or 4 per cent more young people than the Germans or the French does not make much difference.  I have no evidence whatever that Europe wants to stampede us into NATO or the Western European Union which is something&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The contributions that have been made to this debate today encourage me to strike a note of optimism.  The views expressed on all sides of the House have reasserted the continuing vitality of the decision to join the Community made by the large majority of our people in 1972. And for all the concern expressed today about the need to protect vital national interests, it is striking that a theme common to almost all speeches is that one of our more vital interests is our continued membership of the Community itself.  Therefore, it is at all times in the context of continued membership of <Col N="2130" /> the Community that we view the present process towards further European integration.</P>
    <P>Our approach to European Union is different from that of all other member states.  All of our partners suffered in the Second World War and there is consequently an emotional basis for their pursuit of this ideal.  Ireland, on the other hand, was spared this searing experience. Additionally, unlike our partners, we are young in statehood and have a pride in a sovereignty, the absense of which is still within living memory for some.  There is therefore a major task ahead in creating in Ireland, if not an emotional appeal for union, then at least the recognition by the public that further integration is in Ireland's long term interests.</P>
    <P>As Members are all no doubt aware, the European Council in Fontainebleau last year, in consequence of the Genscher-Columbo Declaration on Union, the Parliament's draft treaty on union and President Mitterrand's appeal for a relaunching of Europe, decided to set up the <i>Ad Hoc</i> Committee on Institutional Affairs to map out the next stage of integration.  The committee reported to the European Council last March and its recommendations will be the main topic for discussion at the Council's meeting in Milan this week.  Others have already discussed these recommendations but for the purpose of my exercise I shall repeat them briefly.</P>
    <P>They include a call for a genuine political entity; for a series of priority objectives which include, first the completion of the present treaty through the creation of an internal market, through increased competitiveness of the European economy and through the promotion of economic convergence; secondly, the promotion of what are called common values of civilisation and which include measures to protect the environment, the gradual achievement of a European social area, the gradual establishment of a homogeneous judicial area and the promotion of common cultural values; thirdly, the search for an external identity which includes the strengthening and <Col N="2131" /> improvement of European political co-operation and its extension to cover consultation on security and defence matters.</P>
    <P>To facilitate the achievement of these objectives and to reinvigorate the institutions for their own sake, the committee proposed a series of institutional reforms. These include recommendations for easier decision making in the Council, for a strengthened Commission, for an enhanced role for the European Parliament and for increased scope for the activities of the Court of Justice.</P>
    <P>Finally the committee proposed a method by which the member states might institute the recommendations.  It suggested that a Conference of the Representatives of the Governments of the Member States should be convened in the near future to negotiate a draft European Union Treaty based on the <i>acquis communautaire</i> (the body of Community legislation), the specific Dooge Recommendations, the Genscher-Columbo Declaration on European Union and would be guided by the spirit and method of the European Parliament's draft treaty.</P>
    <P>These then are the proposals for the next stage of European integration. Reactions to them vary.  Common to all of them is an acceptance that, unlike other efforts in past years, Senator Dooge and his colleagues have set forth a range of objectives which, in the light of present realities, one can at least conceive of being achieved.</P>
    <P>Let us now look from an Irish perspective at a selection of the recommendations and at their implications for Ireland. The first recommendation for a genuine political entity, that is, for a form of European union, is an ideal to which we can aspire and towards which I believe significant progress will be made in the present process.  However, its ultimate realisation, in part or in whole, will be in no small way dependent on the degree to which the other more immediate recommendations are acceptable to member states.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2132" /> The first priority objective for a homogeneous internal economic area includes a recommendation for the creation under the present treaty of a genuine internal market.  In common with all member states we see particular advantages in easing access to a single integrated market.  We therefore support the achievement of a Community-wide internal market and the promotion of economic convergence in the Community.  In working towards the achievement of an internal market free of any remaining obstacles to trade we will simply be meeting obligations to which we are already committed.  The proposals in the Dooge report include recommendations for the increased competitiveness of European industry and the European economy. This we very much favour.  The promotion of economic convergence is clearly in Ireland's interest and I shall deal with this subject in more detail later.</P>
    <P>Under the same heading are recommendations on the opening up of access to public contracts and the mutual recognition of national standards.  Here we recognise that two major elements in the abolition of the remaining obstacles to intra-Community trade are first, the adoption of common technical standards for products and secondly, the opening up of public contracts in the Community. These are keys to a resurgence in European industry.  The prospect of markets will provide the incentive to industry to make the advances in research and technology required to remain competitive on the international plane.  I can point to the fact that we have done our part in this area.  During the Irish Presidency, the Community adopted what is called the &ldquo;Single Administrative Document&rdquo;. This is a virtual European passport for goods which considerably eases customs procedures and will result in the elimination of excess cost, estimated at 5 per cent of frontier formalities.</P>
    <P>The simplification of formalities in trade between the member states will have a positive impact on the future development of intra-Community trade. In particular it will provide an incentive for firms, especially small ones, to view <Col N="2133" /> their activity in terms of the whole of the internal market.  In Europe we cannot take our prosperity for granted.  As we look to the future we must work to ensure that our European economy is securely based on advanced industry, efficient agriculture and competitive trading.</P>
    <P>On transport policy the Community's failure to develop a satisfactory common transport policy, despite the objectives laid down in the Treaty, is depressing.  It exemplifies the crippling caution and the obsession with niggling details to which the Community has too often been prone. In practical terms, it means that the movement of goods between member states is slower, more expensive and less efficient than it could be.  It is clear that without a common transport policy the creation of a truly homogeneous internal economic area &mdash; one of the Dooge committee's priority objectives &mdash; is impossible. We accordingly support rapid progress towards full liberalisation of road haulage, and can accept the parallel need for the harmonisation of conditions pointed to by other member states.  As already mentioned, it is a matter of some pride that our recent Presidency was quite successful in this area.  Both producers and consumers, notably on this comparatively isolated island would benefit from the cheaper and more competitive transport services thereby provided. Moreover, I believe that Irish hauliers are in a position to compete vigorously in a more open market.  As far as air transport is concerned, there is obviously scope for greater competition within the constraints which arise from the special nature of the industry.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the European Monetary System.  The strengthening of the EMS is an essential condition of further European integration.  Ireland has participated in the system since its inception on 13 March 1979.  We have found participation most useful in helping to promote exchange rate stability, particularly given the very wild fluctuations being experienced by the major currencies and given our relatively high dependence on international trade.  This stability is evidenced <Col N="2134" /> by the fact that over two years have elapsed since the last realignment of EMS currencies.</P>
    <P>Stability in exchange rates within the EMS has, in turn, resulted in a moderation in import prices and this has been accompanied by a dramatic convergence of Community inflation rates.  The rate of inflation in Ireland, at 5.2 per cent this year, is below the Community average and the lowest nationally for 18 years. EMS membership has also been of benefit in that it has necessitated the development of the foreign exchange and money markets in Dublin.</P>
    <P>When the EMS was founded the support arrangements for the less prosperous states participating in the system took the form of guaranteed access to subsidised Community loans.  Ireland received its subsidies in capitalised form and these amounted to 66.7 million ECU each year for the five year period 1979-83.  We received our full entitlement to the subsidised loans which were used to finance capital investment in the economic infrastructural area, mainly telecommunications and energy projects.</P>
    <P>Further development of the EMS would be welcomed by Ireland.  It will reinforce not only its technical mechanisms but will also improve prospects for economic development, including higher growth, employment and the raising of living standards in the less prosperous member states.  There have been calls on Britain to join the system.  Ireland, with its high proportion of sterling-denominated trade, would welcome the pound sterling into the EMS.  I take this opportunity to call on Britain to join the EMS to enhance the stability of the exchange rates in the Community.  The bulk of our trade would then be covered by the EMS arrangements and some of the problems with which we have had to cope in recent years, as a result of sharp movements of sterling outside the system, would be reduced.</P>
    <P>Given our view that a European Union must repose on a solid economic foundation, the promotion of economic convergence must obviously remain a priority objective in this country's approach to <Col N="2135" /> the deliberations and decisions arising from the Dooge report.  Translated into concrete terms, the pursuit of this objective will involve, among other things, advocating the exploitation of such possibilities as may exist for greater concentration of the economic policies of the member states of the Community, notably to combat unemployment; support for further increasing the Community's own resources in order to equip the Community to discharge its responsibilities and to meet the challenges facing it; and support for increasing the resources of the Community's structural funds in order to enable them to adequately discharge their tasks.  Despite the budgetarily restrictive views of a number of member states, we intend to pursue a policy of securing adequate resources to meet present needs and future objectives.</P>
    <P>I should like to say something now about the enlargement of the Community to include Spain and Portugal.  The impetus towards further enlarging the Community was in large part based upon political factors.  As the founding fathers of the Community made clear when they were drafting the Treaty of Rome, the Community is open to all democratic European states who share the European ideal.  We, therefore, welcome the accession of Spain and Portugal, which will do much to give added strength to the democratic institutions of our two new partners and will also help to widen the geographical, cultural and historical idea of Europe which underlies the European Community.</P>
    <P>The accession negotiations were long, complex and difficult.  I believe, however, that the final outcome is a balanced one for all parties concerned.  The opening up of the large Iberian market, which will add 48 million consumers to the existing Community, will provide a stimulus for European industry that is particularly important at this time of economic difficulties.</P>
    <P>One of the central problems of the negotiations was to secure agreement on <Col N="2136" /> the rate of dismantlement over a seven year period and the rate of dismantlement will lead to a reduction of over 52 per cent on duties over the first three years.  Moreover, apart from a limited number of products, quantitative restrictions between Spain and the Community will be abolished from accession.  This, like the early opening up of the Spanish market, should be of considerable assistance to some Irish exporters who in the past have experienced difficulty in gaining access to the market on account of non-tariff barriers.  In the case of Portugal, industrial tariffs will also be abolished over a seven year period involving a 50 per cent reduction over the first three years.  The opening up of the Iberian markets will also permit us to begin to develop our export potential on these markets for meat and dairy products.</P>
    <P>While I do not wish to anticipate now the debate which will take place in this House later this year when we consider the question of the ratification of the Accession Treaty, I wish to reaffirm now that the agreements reached in the fisheries chapter of the negotiations represent a very positive outcome in terms of the protection and further development of our fishing interests.  One of the most important elements from our point of view is, of course, the fact that Spanish and Portugese fishing vessels will be excluded for ten years from the Irish 50 mile box around our coast.  The achievement of this negotiating objective was all the more creditable when one realises that Spain had continually pressed for access to the Irish box with immediate effect from the date of accession.</P>
    <P>The accession of Spain and Portugal has significant implications for the future shape of the Community.  For instance, enlargement will almost double the size of population in regions with serious development problems.  Yet it is clear that one of the major shortcomings of the existing Community has been its failure to develop a regional policy effective enough to come near to fulfilling the Treaty objective of reducing the economic disparities between the Community's regions.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2137" /> If this were to continue to be the case the regional disparities in the enlarged Community would be even more pronounced than in the existing Community. This clearly would be an unacceptable situation, not only for us and for other existing member states with serious problems of regional development, but also for Spain and Portugal.  I am confident that the alignment of forces working for genuine economic convergence, involving the progressive elimination of imbalances between the Community's various areas and regions, will be considerably stronger in the enlarged Community than at present.  We shall work closely with those who share with us a common interest in promoting economic convergence involving, among other things, the desirability of increasing the Community's structural funds and to assign a greater proportion of these funds to the regions most in need, including Ireland.</P>
    <P>Turning again to specific Dooge proposals, I note that the report calls for the creation of a technological Community backed up by a genuine internal market which would enable Europe to become a powerful competitor internationally in the field of production and application of advanced technologies.</P>
    <P>Although the December and March European Councils also referred to this in their conclusions, the first more concrete initiative came in the form of a letter in April from French Foreign Minister Dumas to his Community colleagues.  In this he outlined his proposal for establishing a new agency, with legal and financial autonomy, for the purpose of organising and co-ordinating research and development activities of interested European countries in a number of high technology sectors. First reactions to the French initiative linked it to the United States &ldquo;Strategic Defence Initiative&rdquo; proposal and saw it very much as a rival undertaking.</P>
    <P>However, France has stressed that its proposal is motivated by long standing concerns, and is a logical conclusion of its thinking to date.  Furthermore, the French emphasise that, unlike the SDI, Eureka is a civil research programme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2138" /> Reactions to Eureka in other member states have mostly been very positive. This is due in large measure to the widespread recognition of the technological challenge to Europe from Japan and the USA and from the fear that participation by European allies of the United States in SDI research could lead to a siphoning off of European research capability. Motivated by these same concerns, the European Commission has more recently put forward ideas of its own for a qualitative leap in Community research activities.</P>
    <P>We regard the French proposal as interesting and significant and as one which seeks to address the challenges presented by the present state of European co-operation and the place of Europe in the world.  Naturally enough, there are aspects to the proposal which require further examination.  These would include such aspects as the way in which it relates to the European Community framework, the idea of variable participation in individual projects and the extent to which non-members of the Community can participate in it bearing in mind here precedents of successful extra-Community co-operation in ventures such as JET, COST and the European Space Agency.</P>
    <P>We are examining the proposal actively and also positively, out of the conviction that an initiative of this kind is essential to make up the ground Europe has lost and to maintain our competitiveness in the medium and longer term.  We are also examining the Commission ideas in the same spirit.  Of course, our overall concern is to ensure that whatever finally emerges, Ireland's technological needs and capacity are taken into account.  Incidentally, this is a concern shared by other small countries, especially in the context of Community funds.</P>
    <P>The Dooge report also makes recommendations in the areas of the environment, social policy and the harmonisation of national laws.  From an Irish viewpoint there are no difficulties here of a fundamental nature.  However, there are certain interests which must be accommodated.  For instance, in the <Col N="2139" /> environmental area we must ensure that moves to harmonise anti-pollution measures do not tie us to a standard which might apply in, for instance, the Ruhr. Again in the area of social policy there is a need to ensure that account is taken of the particular conditions and the level of development which apply in Ireland.  The Irish view in relation to the proposed harmonisation of laws is that such harmonisation presents greater difficulties for a country with a common law system than for one with a civil law system and must therefore be seen as a long term objective.  However, as already mentioned these considerations are not of such a fundamental nature as to preclude an overall positive approach to the report.</P>
    <P>Progress towards European Union is not confined to the economic sphere. Closer political co-operation and integration is also part of the objective of European Union and moves towards European Union must take account of this reality.</P>
    <P>The White Paper of January 1972, on the subject of Ireland's accession to the European Communities, stated the policy of the then Government succinctly and I quote from it:</P>
    <P>The Irish Government, in applying for membership of the Communities, declared their acceptance of the Treaties of Rome and Paris, the decisions taken in their implementation and the political objectives of the Treaties.  The Government have, furthermore, declared their readiness to join as a member of the enlarged Communities in working with the other member States towards the goal of political unification in Europe.  It should, however, be emphasised that the Treaties of Rome and Paris do not entail any military or defence commitments and so such commitments are involved in Ireland's acceptance of these Treaties.</P>
    <P>The political objectives of the Treaties have been accepted by every Irish Government since that time. Accordingly, we are in principle prepared <Col N="2140" /> to consider proposals aimed at furthering the political objectives of the Treaties. Nonetheless, the Government and their predecessors have consistently argued that progress towards European Union should be balanced, systematic and coherent.  In particular, we believe that greater political co-operation and integration should proceed hand in hand with closer economic co-operation and convergence.  This entails the creation of a genuine community of economic interests.</P>
    <P>The Dooge report, which in our view should form the basis of discussions at the forthcoming European Council in Milan, contains a number of proposals aimed at enhancing European political co-operation, the arrangement whereby member states consult and co-ordination on a range of foreign policy issues.  These proposals fall into three main categories.</P>
    <P>First, proposals that are aimed at improving the technical functioning of political co-operation &mdash; for example, by the creaton of a separate Secretariat as distinct from the present situation whereby the country holding the Presidency assumes all the tasks of a Secretariat. Under this heading there is also a proposal to transfer the official level meetings from the capital of the Presidency to Brussels, with the aim of harmonising and ensuring a closer link with the Community framework.</P>
    <P>The second set of proposal in the Dooge report is aimed at strengthening the commitment to European political co-operation, in particular by formalising the commitment to consult and by seeking to ensure that consensus, the basic rule of EPC, be sought in keeping with the majority opinion.  The thrust of this latter proposal is problematic.  Some of our partners appear to favour a departure from the rule of consensus based on unanimity. We, and others of our partners, are resistant to such a dilution of the consensus principle.  There is unlikely to be a broad measure of support in the Community for any change or dilution in the existing consensus principle in European political co-operation.</P>
    <P>The third set of proposals expressly <Col N="2141" /> concerns security and defence.  Senator Dooge put down a reserve on this section. The section aims to enlarge co-operation on security beyond the current guidelines which explicitly state that co-operation on security matters is restricted to political and economic aspects of security.  It envisages what could be broadly termed as politico-military consultations which would be complementary to the aims of the Atlantic Alliance.  This section of the report also envisages co-operation on arms procurement and production.  We have put down a reservation on that.</P>
    <P>Our general approach to these sets of proposals has taken into account certain considerations.  First, the merits of the proposals themselves.  That is, are these proposals justified on their own merits? Do they meet objective needs?  Would they lead to a situation where political co-operation works any better than it does at the present time?</P>
    <P>Second, we view these proposals within the framework of our overall approach to European construction.  In effect, this means that we believe that closer political co-operation should be based on the systematic creation of a growing community of economic and social interests.</P>
    <P>Third, in relation to proposals concerning security and defence, we shall not agree to any proposal which conflicts with the Government's policy of neutrality. Our partners have been made well aware of that position, which applies not only to proposals contained in the Dooge report but also to analogous proposals contained in the British draft agreement on European political co-operation which have been reported in recent days.</P>
    <P>I should like to turn now to the proposals for the institutions.  Looking at them in reverse order, we have no problems with the recommendation for the Court of Justice.  Indeed, most member states seem to have accepted the recommendation without comment, evidence that the proposal is sensible without altering the fundamental role of the Court.</P>
    <P>The Irish Government accept in principle the proposals for the European Parliament. It is clear to any observer that the European Parliament has an inad <Col N="2142" /> equate role which is inconsistent with its status as a directly elected body and that this inadequacy has a distorting effect on the way in which the Parliament handles its business.  However, there are some fears on the part of member states which need to be dissipated before the recommendations will find ready acceptance among all partners.  Some states are reluctant to support an enhanced role for the Parliament because of a fear that further powers will seriously complicate the decision making process and perhaps also because of a fear, less often expressed, that the recommendations will set a precedent which could in time affect the sovereignty of national parliaments. Behind this opposition one can detect a consciousness of the <i>ad hoc</i> way in which the Parliament has developed and the absence of a prior concept of the ultimate role of the Parliament.  Unless there is a shared perception among member states of its future development, it will be difficult to bring about any fundamental change in its role.  The Irish view is that the role of Parliament will have to be improved in some measure but that this should be done after due reflection and in the spirit of confidence which progress in other areas will create.</P>
    <P>The proposals on the Commission are ones which were part of Irish policy on the Community a decade before the Dooge Committee made them.  We have long felt that the Commission's powers of initiative and its role as guarantor of the Treaties have been eroded by encroachments from the Council, by its own growth as a Community bureaucracy and by the failure after two enlargements to reduce the number of its Commissioners in line with the number of real portfolios.  We will pursue the report's recommendations in this area as being in the best interest of the Community as a whole.</P>
    <P>I will deal now with the proposals for the Council.  For the past few years the Council has shown a creeping paralysis in the area of decision making.  The British budget problem, the creation of new own resources, budget discipline, reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, the <Col N="2143" /> accession of Spain and Portugal and integrated Mediterranean programmes are stark examples of areas where the Council decision-making process had almost ground to a halt.  The breakthrough of the past 12 months or so in dealing with these issues and in clearing the way for the reform of decision making has been unfortunately marred in recent weeks by a resurgence of decision-making problems on the question of cereal prices. While member states have different views on what should be done, they are all agreed on the need for reform.  Problems, however, do develop over the degree of this reform.</P>
    <P>Taken in conjunction with the proposals for a strengthened Commission, those on decision making are, in my view, the most significant of all the recommendations in the Dooge report.  They are significant for a number of reasons.  Firstly, they are relevant to the immediate problems of the Community.  Secondly, if realised, they have the potential to clear logjams going back many years.  Thirdly, a whole range of Treaty objectives in, for instance, competition, transport, social policy, free movement of workers, right of establishment, and so on, become that much easier to achieve.  Fourthly, they will add a real measure of othodoxy and predictability to Community decisions which will have the effect of making them more acceptable at national level.</P>
    <P>For all of these reasons we find the report's recommendations in this area acceptable, subject to Senator Dooge's reserve on the retention of the veto.  This retention of the veto is a matter of some importance to us.  We are quite convinced that, without provision for recourse to it, we will not be in a position to safeguard the vital interests threatened by Community action.  Having said that, we do recognise that the veto has been abused and that it must be modified so as to restrict its use to genuine, sustainable cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy characterised some comments by the Taoiseach on benefits to Ireland from the Community <Col N="2144" /> as an acceptance of the principle of <i>Juste</i><i>retour.</i> This seems to me to be a unique interpretation of the Taoiseach's comments. It is obviously not a case of us receiving back simply what we have put in; clearly the output has been much greater that the input and we have no plans to change that.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the report of the Joint Committee on the Secondary Legislation of the European Communities. I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the Members, including Deputy Manning and his group, on their detailed analysis on the Spinelli Draft Treaty.  I have spoken as a committed European, as someone who sees European Union as a desirable objective.  Let me be clear about this.  My commitment is not based on any sense of idealised attachment to this objective.  Rather I have arrived at this commitment from a pragmatic assessment of where Ireland's best interests lie.  As already mentioned, we all seem to be agreed that one of our more vital interests is membership of the Community itself.  It takes no feat of imagination to envisage further integration coming about as a result of the force of events.</P>
    <P>In Ireland already we can see such a process under way at a psychological level with demands for Community, rather than national, action to combat major international problems whether they be oil crises, unemployment, or international competition.  It is both logical and inevitable that this should be followed by measures of real integration. Seen thus, the question one should ask is not whether we support union, but how best to benefit from it.</P>
    <P>For the second time in 40 years, through the medium of the Dooge report, an invitation has been issued in Europe to move further along the path to union. We in Ireland have made our assessment and judge the invitation to be worth accepting.</P>
    <P>Statements adjourned. <Col N="2145" /></P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Irish Shipping Limited: Motion (Resumed)</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy Wilson on Tuesday, 25 June 1985:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann, in view of the loyal service given by employees of Irish Shipping to the people of Ireland until the liquidation of that company in November 1984 calls on the Government to:</P>
    <P> (i)  pay adequate compensation to the staff of Irish Shipping of six weeks salary per year of service; and</P>
    <P>(ii)  restore the pensions of all former Irish Shipping staff to their pre-liquidation level; </P>
    <P>and further calls on the Government to recognise the strategic and economic necessity for a national deep sea merchant shipping fleet and to provide for the reconstitution of such a fleet. </P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éir-eann&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    <P>notes the action taken by the Minister for Communications to deal with the problems arising in the aftermath of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>

      <P>We are sharing our time so that as many Government Deputies as possible can express their concern once again about this tragic situation.  I want to reiterate what I and many of my colleagues said on the last occasion this subject was debated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to establish a committee on strategic shipping requirements and the fact that he <Col N="2146" /> will be announcing the composition of the committee very shortly.  I want to emphasise the words &ldquo;very shortly&rdquo; because we are all aware that there is a need to urgently tackle this problem which is affecting so many families.  It is eight months since Irish Shipping went into liquidation and that is a very long period for the families who suffered this shock and now suffer a sense of insecurity, and even fear for the future.  I know the Minister and his Minister of State are aware of how the families of these employees are affected.</P>
    <P>The Minister said last night that the employees of Irish Shipping were a model for all workers and that their conduct in the area of industrial relations had been exemplary.  That is true but we must be loyal to them in turn.  When the Minister says he is constrained from taking further action, I ask him to look at every angle so that when we vote tonight we will be voting on action being taken.  Let us reach a decision as soon as possible to put an end to this sense of insecurity being suffered by the families.  Many of these families are starting to recover from this trauma and will soon be facing the practical expenses of living.</P>
    <P>This sense of insecurity does not apply only to ex-employees of Irish Shipping. It has a rippling effect on all members of their families.  We are not just talking about the ex-employees.  We are discussing the implications the closing of Irish Shipping will have on the security and happiness of all these families.  Again I beg the Minister to give every consideration to our suggestions.</P>

      <P>The role of a Government backbencher this evening is an extremely unhappy lot.  Many of us are already on record in support of pensioners and ex-employees of Irish Shipping in their difficulties that have arisen over the past number of months.  I speak tonight not only for myself but for others who will not have time to speak in the debate &mdash; Deputy Manning, Deputy <Col N="2147" /> Skelly, Deputy Coveney and many others whose opinions are already on the record.</P>
      <P>As is our wont I will be going into the lobbies at 8.30 p.m. supporting the Government's amendment.  The wording of the amendment is fairly innocuous given the issue before us, but I am extremely unhappy at the state of play.  I urge the Minister, the Department and the Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, to ensure &mdash; I will go further and insist and again I am speaking on behalf of my Fine Gael colleagues on the backbenches &mdash; that the Government continue to look at every possible avenue to help both the ex-employees and the pensioners of Irish Shipping in the plight they find themselves in today.</P>
      <P>There is no need for me to document the details of the tragedies, the numbers involved, the costs and the appalling pension scheme which had to be topped up with <i>ex gratia</i> payments.  There is no need for me to go over the tragic area of pension funds in the State sector generally. The saga of Irish Shipping is but the tip of the iceberg.  God know what is before us in the future.  I know the Minister and his Cabinet colleagues accept the moral obligation, but I ask him to go to the Cabinet and find a solution to help the people concerned.</P>
      <P>Legal opinion has been quoted at us. The area of precedent and the various dangers have been referred to.  I suggest these people look again, because legal opinion appears to differ very much on whether these issues can be resolved. Severance payment apparently is the thornier of the two issues on the agenda this evening in relation to the ex-employees. There is apparently a major problem &mdash; and Government legal opinion supports this &mdash; that the area of precedent could cause difficulties in the years ahead, indeed perhaps the months and weeks ahead.</P>

It is a tragedy for people who had no hand, act or part in the decision which had to be made and who had many years' service.  There were absolutely no industrial problems of any description.  Yet, these people are here today almost begging the Government to look after them. <Col N="2149" /> We accept the moral responsibility.

      <P>We put forward the facts about Irish Shipping and it has been looked at very carefully by means of the Members on this side of the House bringing the matter to the attention of the Minister and the examination which has taken place in the Department of Communications and further meetings with us.  This issue is being examined in every detail.  A Private Members' debate at this stage does not help if it is forcing the issue when a means is being sought by the Minister and the Government to resolve the situation.  We must take into consideration the consequences which might ensue, bearing in mind other semi-State bodies, as a result of a precedent being set here.  The Members on this side of the House have pressed the Minister on this.  They have expressed their support to the employees of Irish Shipping. They have aligned themselves with the one or two Members on the far side of the House who designed to show up at at the last debate.  The Minister stated very clearly last night what the position is. However, we continue to press and to challenge the legal arguments which have been put forward.  We continue to hold out hope on behalf of Irish Shipping employees and to believe that there is a moral obligation on the Government and the State to pay out in these circumstances. Because of this, we have not given up hope.</P>

There was still a list of people waiting to speak on that debate &mdash; Deputies Manning, Barnes, Avril Doyle, Skelly.

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>We should be examining the proposals put by the workers for some form of co-operative.  This is a mechanism which, if properly examined, will be able to be used to compensate the workers and get them back to work, to use their expertise to run a ship and a shipping company.  I do not think that the Minister has closed the door on that. He indicated &mdash; certainly to me in my communications with him &mdash; that discussions were still going on.  This House should be able to deal with the issue in a <Col N="2154" /> non-political way.  No side has a monopoly with regard to concern for the people involved.  It is not in the best interests of the workers or of this Parliament that we shout at one another.  I hope that between us we will be able to find some solution and that we will be able to compensate these people who have borne the brunt of bad management and bad decisions.</P>
      <P>This whole debacle highlights the need for a serious look at pension funds that have not sufficient money to meet the demand when people go out on pension. This matter affects many companies. Pension funds should be kept topped up so that people can feel secure in their old age that their pensions will not disappear if their company disappears.  I hope that out of this very sad situation some good will come and that others will not suffer the way the employees of Irish Shipping have suffered.</P>
      <P>I am angry and disappointed that as yet we have not found a mechanism to help these people.  I hope at the end of the day we will be able to help them within the constraints of legality.  We are legislators; we cannot break the law.  I am confident, given the goodwill and the commitment of the Government and backbenchers, that a solution will be found.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the motion that the Government pay adequate compensation to the staff of Irish Shipping of six weeks salary per year of service and that they restore the pension of the former Irish Shipping staff to pre-liquidation levels.  As the wife of a man who spent his <Col N="2155" /> working life in the service of this nation, I can identify very readily with the women and families of these unfortunate men who are now facing a most bleak future.  These families are the innocent victims of gross maladministration at every level.  The men concerned have a working record that is second to none because they were part of a disciplined service, as are the Army and the Garda.</P>
      <P>There are many unanswered questions about Irish Shipping and what went wrong.  I believe it would have taken a judicial inquiry to unravel precisely what went wrong.  Recently we spent £1 million on the so-called Kerry babies inquiry which was set up at the behest of many hysterical females and the media, all of it intended only to humiliate the Garda. I suggest the taxpayers' money would have been better spent if it had been used to find out precisely what went wrong in Irish Shipping, if it had been used to prevent making fall guys out of the unfortunate men who served the shipping line most loyally.</P>
      <P>As an island nation we need that kind of service.  It goes very hard for me and for others to see that one of the ships &mdash; I think it was the <i>Irish Rowan</i>&mdash; was sold recently for £2.2 million.  That is tantamount to madness because somewhere along the line we will have to have some kind of service that will give us the protection we will need.</P>
      <P>It is very hard to justify talking about a just society when we have from the President downwards to backbenchers who have served a few years here getting a multiplicity of pensions.  This is disgraceful when many of them are still serving here.  We are talking about a just society while that is happening.  On the other hand, the employees of Irish Shipping who have served the nation loyally are treated differently.  Some people who were captains of their ships with 31 years' service were let go with a sum of £3,700 and had to go on the dole.  In God's name, can any State that would condone that kind of treatment have the nerve to call itself a just society?  I say it cannot.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know there are difficulties with regard <Col N="2156" /> to the matter.  I have spoken to the Minister and he has told me there are technical and other difficulties in coming to terms with this problem.  There is great sympathy in the House at all levels for the people concerned, but sympathy will not put bread on the table.  In the course of my canvass I met a young man who had 12 years' service with Irish Shipping.  He has to pay a mortgage of £220 per month. This man has a three months old baby. What good is sympathy to him?  What good is sympathy to people who have to pay their mortgages and school fees and who have to provide the bare necessities of life?</P>
    <P>What has happened in this case is an outrage.  Quite frankly, I do not give two hoots what kind of machinations we have to go through in order to see that justice is done to these people.  The Minister has assured me he has explored many avenues.  I am asking him to go to the Attorney General.  He is paying him to come up with answers.  He should tell him to find an answer within the law so that justice can be done to these people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In my short contribution I will deal with a few points which I did not discuss during the debate last May. While I am not going to get into a row about who spoke or did not speak, I would point out for the benefit of people in the public gallery, if not for Members on the Government benches, that we had a debate on the liquidation of Irish Shipping last November.  Shortly after that we had a Private Members' motion.  We had a debate on the introduction of legislation for those who served during the War and we had a debate on the Estimate.  On all of those occasions there were many contributors from this side of the House. Deputy Wilson and I, as well as a number of our colleagues, have been consistent in our contributions on this matter since last November.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We understand clearly the arguments put forward by the Minister.  He has consistently said he will not do anything.  He is not really interested in any suggestions we put forward.  In our view he is totally responsible for the liquidation of Irish <Col N="2157" /> Shipping.  He has the powers and the means to deal with the matter but he did not do so.  In a letter dated 20 December 1984 to Mr. William A. Attley, General Secretary of the Federated Workers' Union of Ireland &mdash; the same letter was sent to everybody else who wrote to him &mdash; the Taoiseach stated the following:</P>
    <P>The Government very much regret the circumstances which lead to the Liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited. The company and its workforce have served the country well and it is a most tragic consequence of the events which led to the liquidation that the employees and their families are the innocent victims of the situation.  The financial problems of Irish Shipping Limited stem mainly from the decision to charter-in nine vessels without the knowledge or approval of the Government or even of the Ministers directly concerned&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>That has been refuted several times in this House.  It was the responsibility of three people.  The Government had certain knowledge of it.  It was in the reports of the company in earlier years.  We have consistently asked the Minister not to allow these employees to be treated in this way.</P>
    <P>The liquidation was on 14 November. A few days before on 5 November a letter issued from the Minister for Communications to the chairman of Irish Shipping. This is the same Minister who is now refusing to give severance pay or extra redundancy pay to these people.  The letter states:</P>
    <P>Dear Chairman,</P>
    <P>You will recall that I wrote to you earlier this year about the criteria to be taken into account when approaching negotiations on pay claims in your organisation.  The Government has now issued its National Plan &mdash;&ldquo;Building on Reality 1985-1987&rdquo;&mdash;in which the principle underlying the determination of pay and employment in the period ahead are stated.  It is now opportune to update the arrangements <Col N="2158" /> which will apply to the treatment of claims in your organisation.</P>
    <P>As with the existing standing arrangement, <i>all</i> claims, on both pay and conditions, are to be notified, on receipt, to my Department.  <i>Before</i> any discussions on the claims take place with staff interests, advance consultations are to be held with my officials. No offers or commitments (conditional or otherwise) are to be made without <i>prior</i> clearance from my Department. In addition, it will also be necessary to give full details of the financial implications of any proposed offer or commitment &mdash; how the costs could be funded and from what source.</P>
    <P>I would welcome confirmation that your Board and management will co-operate fully with my Department in the foregoing measures.</P>
    <P>Yours sincerely,</P>
    <P>Jim Mitchell, T. D., Minister for Communications. </P>
    <P>A few days later the Minister liquidated the company and put those people out of work.  For six months he said he had no responsibility in the matter.  How can he justify that?  What logic is he following when one day he wants to know everything that is happening and all about the pay negotiations, and the next day he strikes the workers off the public service payroll and says he has no responsibility in the matter?  Some of these people served the State for 35 years and worked in very difficult times.  When Seán Lemass was Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave said no one would object to giving permanent effect to emergency legislation under which the State had a shipping service of its own.  The people realised the benefit they derived from Irish Shipping Limited.  Liam Cosgrave was quite willing to back Seán Lemass in 1941 and 1947 and in later years.</P>
    <P>What have this Government done? Letters have been sent from the Taoiseach and the Minister.  There have been special debates, adjournment debates and statements made in the House but <Col N="2159" /> each time the Minister says he cannot do anything.  To add insult to injury, not only did he fire the people but look at how the pensioners were treated.  Captain Granville had £268.66 per month pre-liquidation but post-liquidation he receives £40.33 per month.  To maintain the pensions would have cost £75,000 per year and there would have been a claw-back to the State through taxation and so on.</P>
    <P>Deputy Glenn said it was a disgrace and a shame.  I am glad the Minister has come into the House.  He failed to come into the House on 22 May.  Is it fair to deal with State employees in this way?  In the 1947 Act they were stated to be public servants.  Only 12 months ago in this House we passed the Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Act, 1984.  The paragraph on superannuation stated:</P>
    <P>Any alteration in the terms or conditions, in force at the commencement of this Act, governing the grant of pensions, gratuities, allowances or other payments on resignation, retirement or death, to or in respect of a member of the staff of the Company, including its chief officer, or any other arrangement to provide for benefits on resignation, retirement or death, additional to those aforesaid, shall not take effect unless the said alteration or arrangement has the approval of the Minister for Communications given with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
    <P>It is on record that the Minister was responsible.  Just because three people made bad management decisions in a company which made a profit for 15 years, the Minister took it out on the faithful employees.  If he stood over that I would say he was honest, but he continually says that he would like to do more for them and that he is concerned.  We are talking about people who saved the country time and again.  They have come into the House tonight and on other nights and forced the Government backbenchers to say they support them.  For £75,000 per year the Minister has said <Col N="2160" />&ldquo;no&rdquo;.  The Minister refuses to recognise the fact that they cannot get jobs in this country and that because of there expertise they will have to seek jobs in foreign countries.  They will lose their social welfare and other benefits in this State.  Some 40 per cent of the workers gave over 35 years' service to Irish Shipping.</P>
    <P>The Minister was once interested in industrial relations.  What company had a better record in the State than this one? It was an arm of the public service where there were no strikes.  The workers were disciplined and never lost an hour through industrial relations.  They worked under the Irish flag.  For the sake of £75,000 a year the Minister took away their pensions.  If the Minister says they were <i>ex gratia</i> payments, he failed to implement the Irish Shipping Limited (Amendment) Act.  That will not wash with the employees.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson and I have met their trade union on almost a fortnightly basis for the past six months.  They have told us of their frustration and of the way they have been almost resented for continuing to fight for their rights.  They have disputed the figures given by the Department.  Where is the justice when people who served the State for many years can lose their small pension rights? People who held small jobs in the company were struck off by the pen of the liquidator with no protection from the Minister.  The Minister was not here when I said that a week before he signed a letter.</P>

      <P>People with a pension of £75 ended up with nothing.  Those with £925 have £140.  People with over £200 now have under £30 and those who had £100 now have under £10.  Where is the justice in that?  This is the fifth or sixth debate we have had.  Will someone from the Government side explain the justice in the Minister's decision?  We did not want to make this an issue of party politics, but surely it is our job to fight for people who were public servants and who <Col N="2161" /> were bound by national agreements and every cutback that was ever introduced. When a public service agreement was cancelled or delayed, a letter similar to the one I quoted from was issued to the company.  It was signed by the Minister of the day.</P>
      <P>How could this company be liquidated? We hope the Minister can be forced to change his mind by the vote in the House tonight with the support of his concerned colleagues and the members of the Labour Party who have pledged their support to Mr. Attley and other senior trade union leaders.  The Minister could say that he will change his mind and out of the billions of pounds which are wasted in certain areas, perhaps he could find £75,000 per year to support the Irish Shipping staff who are still unemployed. Is it too much to admit that it was a mistake and that they were public service employees?  They gave all for the State and perhaps at this late stage in the debate the Minister would indicate that he will go back to the Cabinet and try to reverse the decision.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach has written letters indicating his sadness at the closure of the company but this is of no benefit to those who are unemployed and who only received the statutory redundancy payments. These people were public servants who worked for the State.  The company were set up by legislation.  The pension funds were enshrined in legislation and were supported by pension schemes.  It was the responsibility of the State to ensure that those pensions were paid. The workers deserve much better than. this Government have given them.  I appeal to the Minister to declare before this debate concludes that the Government have some concern for the workers because so far there has been no evidence of any such concern.</P>

      <P>Having been in the chair of the all-party committee on State sponsored bodies on and off for the past couple of months when we were dealing with Irish Shipping, all I can say is that the whole matter is somewhat like an episode of <i>Dallas.</i> Unfortunately, the <Col N="2162" /> outcome has been one of disgrace, ignominy and humiliation.  Hundreds of Irish citizens have been let down, not by some rogue company or rogue directors, or by some fancy firm of professionals, but by the Irish Government.</P>
      <P>Our committee made it clear that the company made some mistakes but I wish to emphasise this evening that it is clear also that the Government panicked in regard to Irish Shipping and took a legalistic rather than a commercial view of the whole matter.  Instead of rushing to their commercial advisers, they rushing to their legal advisers and, instead of coming out of the difficulty with a sensible solution which a commercial approach would have provided, they emerged with nothing but `ifs' and `buts' from the lawyers and the collapse of Irish Shipping leaving the excellent workers of the company in a dreadful situation.</P>
      <P>We all know that the long term charters, especially from 1979 onwards, were a major error of judgement.  They were totally disproportionate to the size of the company.  We know also that the board of the company have to be indicated for their failure to maintain control over some senior executives of the company who apparently acted without authority and independently of the board.  We know the litany of errors of judgement that were made and we know also that for some time before the collapse of the company, the profits were coming not so much from shipping but from the associated companies.  In the past eight or nine years, some 60 per cent of the profits came from the associated companies. There is not enough time at my disposal to enable me to open up the whole ICI debate, the relationship with Ocean Bank, the connection between the diretors of Irish Shipping and Ocean Bank and the Insurance Corporation of Ireland. I should like to open up, too, the whole nest of wasps in this regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Perhaps the House will afford me this opportunity by providing time to debate the all-party committee report which has been before the House for some months. For the moment, suffice it to say that many difficulties have been uncovered. <Col N="2163" /> that there is a lot of unfinished business, and that there are many questions to be asked about the behaviour of people in the Irish Shipping organisation and about the lack of control within the company. After being involved in examining the matter for some months, I find that there are many questions as yet unanswered which I should like to see answered on the Floor of the House.</P>
    <P>There is a new system emerging in this House whereby when a liquidator or a receiver or administrator is appointed or when the ICI system is set up, this House closes down as it were and we cannot then ask any further questions about the matter, whether the issue relates to B &amp; I or to some other company.  We are not allowed to ascertain what is happening to Irish people and to Irish money as a result of a blanket of legality being thrown over the issue.  While the Ministers concerned look responsible, they tell us that there is a legal or technical difficulty involved. This House is the place in which to change the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister should introduce legislation that would enable us to get to the root of what happened in Irish Shipping instead of telling us continuously that this is the business of the liquidator.  This is the business of the Minister, and of the Irish people and of this Parliament.  There is no justification for such a veil of secrecy in regard to such matters as the appointment of a liquidator to any State company, whether that relates to the Zeus management in B &amp; I or to any other company.  We must devise a way of surmounting this veil of legality.  Public representatives demand to know what is happening in these companies and we shall not be cut off because of the appointment of some legal or quasi-legal person to administer the affairs of a company. Undoubtedly the Government panicked in regard to Irish Shipping. They were not facing an immediate loss.</P>

      <P>Even after the liquidation, when some gentlemen from Hong Kong arrived here, the Minister's lawyers advised him that he should not meet these men because to do so would involve him in trying to solve the problem.  The Minister should have met them, not after the liquidation but months before then, and told them that the contracts could not be continued and that he had the full authority of the Cabinet to dispose of the contracts if necessary.  At least the contracts should have been renegotiated. Instead the Minister took the advice of the lawyers, panicked and ran for the liquidators.  This got him off the hook.</P>

      <P>That was not the proper approach.  The action taken was the same as the action the Government are taking on the financial side, that is, a total bookkeeping approach as opposed to a commercial approach.</P>
      <P>As I have been saying for months in regard to this company, a commercial approach on the part of the Minister to the Hong Kong people telling them that the contracts could not be continued would have met with the desired result. Was I not proved right when these people arrived here after the announcement of the liquidation, keen and ready to negotiate the best price possible.</P>

      <P>What else were they doing in Dublin?  The Minister did not meet them whereas, if he had met them before then, a deal could have been worked out and the company put back on their feet.  In addition to so many workers being left without jobs, the <Col N="2165" /> Government brought the State, which has proudly carried the Irish flag throughout the world, to disgrace and ignominy. Any Irish person visiting a foreign country from now on will bow his head in shame in the knowledge that an Irish Government closed one of their own companies, put the workers out of jobs and failed to meet their due debts.  I could continue for many hours in this way but the Minister knows it all only too well.</P>
      <P>The Minister told the House that the total cost of keeping Irish Shipping in operation for a further five years would have been £144 million but in replies to questions tabled by me, it transpired that the cost of closing Irish Shipping would be almost £60 million.  When the <i>Irish</i><i>Spruce</i> is included there is a difference of about £27 million.  In other words, for an expenditure of £27 million, Irish Shipping and Irish workers could have been given one more chance.  I suggest that that amount will be used up in a few short years by the disgrace that has been brought on the country and by our lack of credibility abroad.  I should like the Minister to confirm that Irish Shipping put two proposals to him, that one was to inject into the company an additional £27 million and that the other was to close the company.  The Minister opted for the latter on legal grounds.</P>
      <P>There is a lot of unfinished business in regard to this company.  The committee should be given additional powers to subpoena witnesses.  There should be no great difficulty in that regard if there is the will on the part of the Government to do so.  We should find out what is going on in Ocean Bank and reform the law to allow the Dáil to monitor the liquidation of the company instead of allowing a veil of legality to be thrown over all our inquiries. We should consider some form of repurchase from the liquidator and particularly we should wait for the High Court report.  The terms of reference in that respect include the phrase, &ldquo;having a very close look at whether there was fraud involved in the running of the company&rdquo;. We should be able to monitor the whole future of Irish Continental Lines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After that long litany of errors, most <Col N="2166" /> of which emanated from this Government, in that they failed to act commercially rather than legally, they should do the decent thing and respond to the appeal of Deputies B. Ahern and Wilson to pay the compensation required to their own employees.  The Minister cannot introduce a Bill in this House, as he is proposing to do soon, to weed out rogue directors, to weed out directors who run away from their responsibilities while he and his Government run away from their responsibilities in that regard.  I appeal to the Minister to listen to Deputies B. Ahern and Wilson and compensate the people involved who were employees of this State and who served us all proudly for many years.  I appeal to the Minister to live up to his responsibilities and pay these Irish public servants the funds due to them.</P>
    <P>I have made it crystal clear that the major mistake made was on the part of the board of the company in that they failed to keep control of the senior executives who landed the company in the difficulty in which it found itself.  But that was compounded by the panic of the Government, leading up to 14 November 1984, in which the Government had a number of options open to them but got bogged down completely in the legal approaches to the problem.  As I pointed out to the committee, and here time and time again, the Minister had an option.  I honestly believe that had the Minister sent for the Hong King people involved, on a commercial basis, and said to them: &ldquo;You have two choices: you renegotiate these contracts now with a responsible Irish Government or else you walk out of here, I liquidate the company and you get, which is very little if anything at all&rdquo;.  In those circumstances what decision does the Minister think the Hong Kong people would have taken?</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not detain the House very long.  Leaving aside for a moment the odour of political expediency about this motion I have to say that I support the thrust of what it says.  The House and Government have a moral obligation to the people affected by this disaster to ensure that some degree of recognition is made to them.  That recognition must be one which is financial in nature, which at least does the minimum to try to ensure that the debt that the State has to these blameless employees is paid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Weak politicians will give reasons things cannot happen but real leaders should be able to create a situation in which the right thing is done.  Unquestionably the right thing in this case is to ensure that the employees, who have been shabbily treated and continue to be shabbily treated, are given proper standards <Col N="2169" /> of respect, that we pay them at least a sum of money which would be some clear token that this State means what it says when it pays them the lip service it has been doing on all sides of this House over the last number of weeks in complimenting them on their unstinted loyalty to the State over the years.</P>
    <P>In the course of his remarks the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Of course, this whole House is united in sympathy with the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited who are the innocent victims of outrageous and irresponsible decisions taken by the company...</P>
    <P>In that context there should be no circumstances in which any semi-State organisation can be accused, probably rightly, of irresponsible decisions or behaviour without somebody being held accountable. It is no longer good enough for semi-State employees, squandering and wasting millions of pounds of taxpayer's money to be able, in some cases, to glibly walk away having received a golden handshake.  That is not good enough.  The taxpayers say it is not good enough and those of us who are concerned about it in this House say it is not good enough.  If people have been responsible for outrageous and irresponsible decisions they should face the full rigours of the law, if that is possible.  When the heat of this case. debate has died down I trust the Minister will ensure that that happens in this case. If a constituent in my lowly constituency was guilty of an outrageous or irresponsible decision I know what would happen to him or her.  The same standards should apply in so-called high places.  The fact that they do not is one of the reasons this House and the whole system are being discredited, as they are.</P>
    <P>No company occupies the same niche in the national psyche that Irish Shipping Limited has done.  No company deserves the admiration and respect of the Irish people because of its unstinted loyalty, because of its unblemished record of service, as does this one.  In the past ways have been found to ensure, for less <Col N="2170" /> worthy reasons, that people who might not be technically entitled under the law to certain financial benefits received them.  It is not the job of this House to work that one out.  We have sufficient paid officialdom of a statutory and in some cases of an advisory or non-statutory nature to work it out.  Undoubtedly it is the will of all sides of this House to ensure that this debt of respect is paid.</P>
    <P>I have great sympathy with the Minister who must face the difficulties of creating the mechanics of a system to ensure that it is done but, with respect to him and his colleagues, that it their problem, that is what Governments are about.  I have no doubt whatever but that if there is a will, a way will be found.</P>
    <P>I am not going to recount the harrowing stories I have heard from individual employees of this company but there is something extraordinary and unique about Irish Shipping Limited.  I hope we shall hear in due course that aspects of the company or parts of the company can be, if the House will pardon the very bad pun, salvaged or restored to some degree of pride of place in our national economy or landscape.  Nevertheless I hope we will do the decent thing in this case.</P>
    <P>The two arguments likely to be advanced for us not doing so will be, first, that some form of precedent may be established.  There are precedents established already, admittedly in some cases with different permutations.  For example, I remember the extraordinary decision in the case of the Irish Trust Bank, I remember the Verolme incident, I remember the Talbot workers, a totally private company where there was no moral obligation on anybody, but the State managed to turn upside down its whole recruitment and public sector employment policy in pursuit of a specific objective, the Government took a political decision to do a certain thing and to see it through.  Therefore, precedent does not arise.  If the Government say clearly and unequivocally that they have decided to reconsider, that in this case they feel in duty morally obliged to do something about the case and that it is <Col N="2171" /> not to be a precedent, then it will not be a precedent.  Each individual case deserves to be treated and considered on its merits.</P>
    <P>Second, I have no doubt but that in the labyrinthine corridors of bureaucracy there is someone somewhere who believes that there is some technical reason this should not be done.  Such bureaucracy is the curse of this country.  It ties down imagination and vision and has held us back for generations.</P>
    <P>All of us know that these men deserve better than they are getting and the State and everyone in this House, on all sides, demand that they get adequate and fair treatment.  I appeal to the Minister &mdash; whom I know from my discussions to be sympathetic &mdash; if at all possible to do something, to go back, look again, and as long as is necessary until he ensures that some modicum of decency and justice is granted in this case.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if that is done good will come from it.  Unfortunately, I admit that this debate may be to some extent bedevilled by political expediency, but the kernel of the case is just and deserves consideration.  I hope that in due course good will emerge and that we will do the right thing by these employees and their families and that we will do what is right and just by those who have created this incredible mess and I hope we are conscious of the other messes that unfortunately are possibly lining up to be dealt with in due course.  I hope that a similar situation will not be allowed to arise and that there will be proper accountability by semi-State organisations who will be the cornerstones of future fiscal and economic policy in this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Minister of State and Deputy Keating for making a few minutes available to me.  I will stay away from the politics and the commercial nature of the original decision and will confine myself to the area which has concerned me since the liquidation of Irish Shipping &mdash; the position in which the workers have found themselves.  On <Col N="2172" /> two or three occasions in this House I asked the Minister to consider acceding to the substance of certain sections of this motion in relation to pensions.  I would also ask the Minister for Labour to consider whether it is possible to alleviate the blow which Irish Shipping workers have suffered by providing some form of employment for them in other elements of the public service.  In response to all of these requests, and to continued requests from the backbenchers in Fine Gael in direct correspondence with the Minister, it has not been possible to proceed further on this than the commitment made to pensioners who had served during the World War II period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While we welcome that development I strongly believe that this has not gone far enough and the Minister should continue to seek until he finds a means of honouring the pensions which have been lost to Irish Shipping workers as a result of the liquidation.  I entirely accept that there is not a statutory obligation on the Government, but there is a moral obligation on us to do what we can.  There is no doubt that a person who goes to work in a public company goes into it with certain expectations of a permanent pensionable job.  A situation which is unique, certainly in my political life, demands unique action by the Government.  These workers cannot be compared with any other body of workers who suffer redundancy as a result a commercial liquidation, because in the nature of the commercial world there is a certain instability and people going into that world are aware of it.  Those who go into the public service go into it with a certain expectation and understanding.  While these are difficult times, people who have given 30 or 40 years of service and who are at the loss of pensions have found that their whole future is devastated.  For them there has been a great deal of personal trauma leading in some cases to hospitalisation for psychiatric problems.  We must not ignore our responsibilities and I would urge the Minister to do all he can to find a way round the legal and technical difficulties so as to soften the blow for these people.  Priority should be given to <Col N="2173" /> some method of honouring the pension entitlements and we should acknowledge in some way the years of service given by many of the workers.</P>

      <P>We all readily acknowledge the distressing situation in which the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited now find themselves through no fault of their own.  In the course of this debate many tributes have been paid to them, to their loyalty to their company, to their impeccable industrial relations record and, indeed, to their service to the country.  I add my voice to these tributes.</P>
      <P>Nevertheless, I have to dissent from the motion put down by the Opposition. It does not take account of the reality of the situation, harsh and all as that may be.  We cannot ignore the constraints of a very real practical nature which inhibit the Government and Ministers concerned in alleviating the position of the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited.  We would all wish that it were possible to wave a magic wand and find a ready solution to these problems, but unfortunately there is no ready solution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Ahern, in the course of his speech, said that it was normal when a company went into liquidation that a decent redundancy payment was made. This is surely not the case when a company goes into liquidation in an insolvent situation.  Irish Shipping Limited were insolvent.  They did not even have the cash to meet the statutory redundancy payments to the company's employees and the Minister for Labour was obliged to pay the redundancy lump sum in full to the employees from the Redundancy Fund.  Irish Shipping Limited did not have enough assets to meet their liabilities and, in consequence, there are many creditors of the company who have lost a great deal of money.  I must repeat, therefore, what the Minister for Communications said earlier in this debate, that <Col N="2174" /> it would be improper in these circumstances to seek to give preferential treatment to the former employees of the company.</P>

      <P>Deputy Vincent Brady accused the Government of acting hastily in the lead up to the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.  This is not in accordance with the facts.  On the contrary, every possible option in relation to the future of the company was identified and examined in considerable detail before the Government took the decision not to provide additional finance for the company. It is not true to say that the Government appointed a liquidator to Irish Shipping Limited.  The fact is that the liquidator was appointed by the High Court at the request of the board when they were informed that the Government could not provide additional finance for the company.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brady also suggested that the proposals by the board of the company did not recommend liquidation.  The Minister for Communications has already made it clear in this House that the board of Irish Shipping Limited put forward two options for consideration by the Government: the immediate winding-up of the company; or an attempt at a final re-negotiation with the foreign shipowners with Government support.</P>
      <P>The Board expressed the view that, before proceeding to make a final re-negotiation attempt, they were only prepared to contemplate this re-negotiation attempt, first, if the Government agreed in advance to finance commitments, including the cost of a possible settlement with the foreign interests concerned, of £74.5 million; and, secondly, if the desired result could not be achieved within the financial limit specified &mdash; and this, the board said, was a very real possibility &mdash; the winding-up of Irish Shipping would have to follow immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board of Irish Shipping Limited were clearly pessimistic about the outcome of their re-negotiation proposal. <Col N="2175" /> The Government have carefully considered all the options and made their decision.  In the light of proposals made by the foreign interests concerned to the liquidator after he was appointed, it is clear that re-negotiation of the charters on the basis of the cost figures envisaged by the board of Irish Shipping Limited in their report to the Minister for Communications could not possibly have succeeded. In this regard the judgement of the Government was more than vindicated.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the decision to liquidate Irish Shipping was the correct one.  Far from improving in recent months, the fact is that world freight markets have declined.  Even the horrendous losses which were projected by the company in last year's report to the Minister for Communications would have been surpassed if they had continued trading. The taxpayer would have been expected to pick up the bill for decisions which were taken without reference to the Government or the responsible Ministers. I have no doubt that the taxpayer would rightly have protested that he should not be expected to meet these bills.  World shipping is going through probably the worst recession in memory and there is no sign of an improvement. There could be no justification for giving support to Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister for Communications discussed in great detail the question of the need for a strategic fleet. There are many elements to this question, many considerations to be examined, and if the maintenance of a strategic fleet is a justifiable policy we need to quantify the size, structure and composition of that fleet.  The Minister has indicated that he will be establishing very shortly a committee on strategic shipping requirements to investigate and report on various matters affecting the question of a strategic fleet.  Since the matter has not been considered in more than 20 years, this is clearly the right way to go about it.  The investment in a strategic fleet could be significant and we must give all the factors involved the fullest possible <Col N="2176" /> consideration.  That will be the task of the committee.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brady inquired about the future of Irish Continental Line.  The question of what to do with the shareholding of Irish Shipping Limited in Ocean Bank Development Limited which owns Irish Continental Line is now a matter for the liquidator.  Irish Continental Line are a successful and profitmaking company even if they have been affected to some extent by the recent recession in tourism which we hope is at an end.  There is, to my mind, no reason why they should not continue as a going concern.  I do not foresee them being forced into liquidation or receivership. Presumably the liquidator's objective will be to dispose of Irish Shipping Limited's shareholding in the company to the best advantage of the creditors of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>

      <P>Certainly, the Government would be concerned that there should be an Ireland-Continent ferry service but there is no reason why such a service cannot be provided by a private enterprise company operating profitably. A point was raised on many occasions about the appointment of a receiver.  The Minister has explained, and I would like to reiterate, that this was not possible in the circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In conclusion I have regretfully to reiterate once again that there are constraints and sensitivities in the aftermath of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited which inhibited the Government or the Ministers concerned in what help they have been able to provide.  Every avenue has been explored to overcome these sensitivities and constraints but without success. However, the Minister for Communications has asked me to say what he has already said very emphatically and what I know from continuous talks with him on this matter.  He appreciates and shares the deep concern expressed by Deputies on both sides of the House in this and the earlier debates, and <Col N="2177" /> he is continuing to search for ways in which some assistance, relief or alleviation might be offered to a workforce who, we all acknowledge, deserved a better fate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The last part of the Minister's speech sums it all up.  When this Government want to do nothing about a problem that exists, they resort to setting up a committee, as they are saying in this instance they are going to do, to examine the possibilities of recreating an Irish shipping company in some shape or form.  That is the oldest excuse in the book for doing nothing.  For two years since they came into Government they did nothing but set up committees and task forces to look at problems which have grown greater and greater since then.  We have seen and heard from many of those task forces and committees.  It is quite clear that as far as the reconstitution of an Irish shipping company is concerned the Government have decided that they will put it into the lap of another committee as yet unnamed and probably with terms of reference which will run on for years, giving them enough time to save their bacon, get out from where they are, and leave the problem to somebody else.</P>
      <P>Consistently in this House I have spoken in every debate on Irish Shipping. For five and half months I was a member of a committee who inquired into the problems of Irish Shipping Limited.  Just when we were about to find some of the answers to the remaining unanswered questions, what happened?  The rug was pulled from under our feet and the Government decided to take refuge behind the legal situation, the appointment of a liquidator.  Only the liquidator can talk about anything.  Only the liquidator can do anything about it.  They are sheltering behind a legal position and a financial sensitivity.  I can only describe as hypocritical balderdash what they have poured out in this House tonight once again.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Government were a big creditor in Irish Shipping Limited as were many others in Ireland.  Why did the Government not create an instrument, a <Col N="2178" /> debenture, to let them put in a receiver under the Companies Act, 1963?  It was not jumped on them at the last minute. They knew what was coming for quite a long time, and if they had any real interest or had known their job properly, or if their advisers had known their job properly, for the protection of the Irish Shipping fleet, Irish creditors, the workforce and everybody else concerned, they would have taken the steps that are quite open to them to take and quite legal under the Companies Act, 1963, and appointed a receiver.</P>
    <P>They panicked and mishandled it as they have mishandled every major problem that has come up in other areas. We saw evidence of that every month of the year that has gone by.  Only last month I was talking here about miscalculation and mishandling of the Hyster project whereby 800 jobs were lost to Limerick.  For the sake of £1 million the Government tried to gamble on the bad advice they got.  Have they any minds of their own?  Do they know what Governments are all about? Governments are about solving the problems just as management is all about solving the problems.</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping management obviously made mistakes and those responsible for them are now walking scot free.  Some of them got golden handshakes.  I said then and I repeat now that every worker in that company was entitled to the same treatment as some of those people got. When did the principles of law change so that an employee is not a preferential creditor in any company and is not to be protected?  The Government panicked and ran away from a few big fellows out in Hong Kong when they should have sat back coolly and decided what was in the best interest of everybody, the company, the Irish taxpayer whom they constantly bemoan.  Yet day after day, week after week they are spending thousands and thousands on PR agencies, consultancies, new management companies.  There is no worry about the taxpayer when they do that.</P>
    <P>They have appointed a liquidator who will probably be ongoing for the next five <Col N="2179" /> years, and all the money he will get could look after those people who have served in Irish Shipping Limited under the Irish flag for so long.  Members of the Government come in here one after another crying crocodile tears.  I heard them one after another here tonight trying to extend their sympathy to the workers of Irish Shipping Limited who are being left stranded and destitute, but when I examined the record how many of these took part in the many debates?</P>
    <P>I have gone through the debate of 13 June 1985 in detail.  There is not a word there from Deputy Owen or from Deputy Skelly who was hypocritical here tonight when he spoke about the legal situation. I heard him in a corridor last night telling three people from Irish Shipping Limited that they need not worry about the Minister putting out this nonsense about hiding behind legal complications.  He said he was a lawyer and that he knew there were no legal complications.  Then he comes into the House tonight and acts the archhypocrite in trying to defend the indefensible situation of the Minister who is supposed to be caught up in legal complications.  There was not a word from Deputy Avril Doyle in that debate, from Deputy Keating or Deputy Flaherty. In fairness to Deputy Glenn, I must say that she talked about the situation with some humanity.  She knows what it is to run a household and that she could quite easily face the same problems that are faced by many of the families of Irish Shipping workers.  She knows what it is all about and is prepared to express that humanity.</P>
    <P>The Government expect the employees of Irish Shipping who have served this nation so well to accept the bona fides of the sympathy expressed here tonight.  What is being offered to them?  The ultimate insult of an innocuous amendment which proposes to delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; in our motion and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>notes the action taken by the Minister for Communications to deal with the <Col N="2180" /> problems arising in the aftermath of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Ltd.</P>
    <P>That is the most innocuous amendment I have ever seen.  The Government side want to hide behind that and say they are backing the Minister wholly and squarely, standing behind him in the actions he has taken.  On the other hand, they try to offer sympathy to the people of Irish Shipping.  What is this House all about?  What is Government about? Government is about legislating and every person should be treated fairly and equitably under the law.  Can anybody opposite hold his hand on his heart and say when he walks through the lobbies tonight that he is applying the law fairly and equitably to the people of Irish Shipping, making excuses about legal complications and financial sensitivities?  Where there is a will there is a way.  Do they want the people to accept that bureaucracy can stand in the way of this House in dealing fairly and equitably with the citizens of this State?</P>
    <P>From five and a half months examination of the workings of Irish Shipping I know how many times the staff and workers of Irish Shipping were prepared to forego wage increases, to restructure the whole set up, to make a magnanimous contribution to solving the problems of Irish Shipping.  At the end of the day all they have got from this Government is a kick in the teeth for doing all that was within their power to do.</P>
    <P>The Government should be ashamed of their readiness to insult our national flag around the world.  Irish citizens in Marseilles, Mombasa or anywhere else in the world are proud to see a ship with an Irish flag.  This may be a small nation but it has its national pride.  People never thought they would see an Irish Government or Minister take down the national flag, dishing out the greatest insult to Irish citizens around the world, and put up in its place the Jolly Roger, as they did in Nigeria when the staff of Irish Shipping had to prevent pirates from taking away the ship.  People who were proud to wear an Irish uniform and serve under the Irish flag suffered the greatest <Col N="2181" /> ignominy in Marseilles where they had to walk one and a half miles to make a telephone call to their people.  Minister after Minister said in this House that they were being looked after by the Department of Foreign Affairs but I know the treatment they received &mdash; one visit from a representative of the Irish Embassy in Paris.  They had to carry their garbage to a point two miles away for collection.  They were put into an isolated part of the port reserved for criminals and pirates.  That is what an Irish Government did to an Irish workforce.  They should be ashamed of themselves.  Nothing has served more to undermine our national pride and destroy the spirit of this nation than that act of national sabotage in liquidating and sinking Irish Shipping.  This act will never be forgiven by the generation of today or those who come after.  This Government will be written into the history books as one which reneged on national responsibilities, gave this country a bad name abroad and above all took away pride in serving under our national flag.</P>
    <P>At the end of the day the Government are prepared to let the workforce of Irish Shipping walk around this city begging for a living.  Why should they have to come to their Members of Parliament and go on their knees to beg for what is rightly theirs, having served this country in an emergency and built up a company which was the flagship of the semi-State humanly possible but in return the Government say there are legal complications and financial sensitivities.</P>
    <P>Governments are elected to serve the people and treat them with fairness and equity.  There is no legal complication which cannot be solved in this House. This is the supreme legislature.  We can change any law if the Government want to prove their concern, expressed so hypocritically time and again.  Let them be honest with the people for once and do something for the profession of politics. Since this Government came into power they have dragged it down into the muck. One of the leading backbenchers on the <Col N="2182" /> Government side said that the last election produced nothing but junk politicians. He is a disgrace to this House because he is prepared to deny the democratic system.  If that is the sort of people in Government today, is it any wonder that the people gave the answer they did last week and are only waiting to get to the hustings?</P>
    <P>If the Government want to solve this problem let them bring in the necessary legislation.  They will get full backing from us.  If they wish to reconstitute an Irish shipping company let them forget about another committee which will go on talking until the Government are talked out of power and leave the matter for a Fianna Fáil Government who are already committed to reconstituting a shipping company.</P>
    <P>There is a crew on the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and a co-operative could be set up.  There is a party in Government called the Labour Party.  If they want to be true to any of the ideals that they or Larkin ever stood for, let them look after the workers who have served so well and follow the principle of worker co-operatives.  Do they believe in it?  They talk about it often enough.  An opportunity is being presented to them now but will they take it and set up the co-operative?  Let us have no more of the hypocritical balderdash that the job cannot be done.  I heard the same sort of stuff in 1980 and when I had to solve a similar problem to do with superannuation and pensions in the aftermath of the Post Office strike.  Civil servants told me time and again that it could not be done.  It was done by Eamon de Valera in 1932 when he came into office, so why could I not do it as well?</P>
    <P>If the Minister wants to be true to his job let him bring in the legislation and make up his own mind for a change.  The advice he got in the first instance was wrong, as was his handling of the situation. He talks about the legal advice he received, yet one director of Irish Shipping Limited told the Joint Committee on State Sponsored Bodies that his legal advice was directly contrary to that of the Minister. Doctors differ and patients die and legal advice is as good as the judgement <Col N="2183" /> of one man against another.  At the end of the day the Government must decide what they want to do.  It is quite clear that in this case they wanted to make a name for themselves by destroying a semi-State structure.  They would take Irish Shipping first and follow on with many more.  No evidence produced in this House has convinced me or anybody else that the Minister is not trotting out the same silly, stupid stuff.  This Government are bedevilled by well-educated fools.  Let them get rid of the economists and bring in fellows with commonsense. The Government are dealing with people who are far removed from reality.  The amendment before us is far removed from the reality the families of Irish Shipping workers have to endure.</P>
    <P>In the dying days of this Government the Minister should make a name for himself by forgetting about the weird advice he is getting.  I am not sure whether the advice is coming from the Civil Service or outside.  I have always admired the Civil Service for their pride in the semi-State institutions and I am afraid the Minister's advice is coming from outside.  There is another input from the national handlers.  There is plenty of money when they have to be paid and plenty of money for consultants.  There was plenty of money during the election campaign to place half-page advertisements trying to explain the land tax. There was plenty of money for advertising of all kinds but there is no place for the ordinary working person.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £240,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Secretary to the President, and for certain other expenses of the President's Establishment.</P>
      <P>This is an increase of £76,000 on the 1984 outturn.  The main item giving rise to this increase is subhead B for travelling and incidental expenses&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Do I take it that the Minister has not a speech?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not a speech.  This is for travelling and incidental expenses for which a provision of £87,000 is made for this year.  The increase in the provision over last year's level is to provide for two State visits abroad by the President during the course of this year.  The first of these was to New Zealand and Australia last month and earlier this month and the second will be to Austria later in the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On Vote 2 for the Houses of the Oireachtas, the provision for this year is £11,931,000.  In relation to the items where there is an increase on that Vote, I would draw attention particularly to subhead F.4 which covers expenses of delegates to the Council of Europe, where the Estimate for 1985 is £110,000 &mdash; an increase of £33,000 over 1984.  The increased provision is necessary to provide <Col N="2191" /> for increased travel costs and for subsistence expenses of Members &mdash; that is, air fares and hotel charges &mdash; in connection with Council of Europe meetings, due to the fact that an increased number of these meetings are being held outside Strasbourg.  Were the meetings all in Strasbourg, the provision could be a little less than that, but that is a matter, of course, for the Council of Europe to decide.</P>
    <P>I mention also an increase in subhead G which is the grant-in-aid provision for inter-parliamentary activities, where the increase is £30,000 over last year's outturn of £70,000.  Again, the increase there is necessitated by increased costs of travel and subsistence expenses of Members in connection with these activities.  In relation both to the Council of Europe and the activities of Members of this House in the context of inter-parliamentary activities, the provisions that have been made are reasonable.  They are for a purpose which Members of this House might on occasion defend rather more vigorously.  I would take the view, which I think would be shared by all Members that, as a sovereign Parliament, it is right and proper that this House as an institution should have the proper inter-parliamentary relationships with parliaments and parliamentarians in other countries and that it is a necessary and, indeed, desirable part of the activities of Members of this House that they should be so involved.  I make those remarks in the context of discussions some months ago where a number of critical remarks were made about the fact that Members of this House were involved in those activities.  None of those criticisms is well founded.</P>
    <P>On subhead D.1 there is an increase in the provision this year.  This is in order to provide for additional secretarial assistance for Seanadóirí who are not office holders.  There again, we have now provided one secretary for every three Senators instead of one for every five as had been the case before that, a ratio that was causing some difficulties for the <Col N="2192" /> proper organisation of the work of the Members of Seanad Éireann.</P>
    <P>On subhead L, the increase this year over the the outturn for last year is £109,000 and that is the subhead which covers the employment of consultants for special assignments with committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The increase this year appears rather large because expenditure under that subhead in 1984 turned out to be less than half of the amount originally provided for. There was a delay in the employment of consultants for a number of assignments, which led to an underspend on that provision during 1984.</P>
    <P>Vote 7 is the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance, where we are providing for a sum of £20,592,000.  As I think is always found to be the case, the Vote for the Office of the Minister for Finance has traditionally been one of the most tightly drawn Votes in the nature of things.  This year, of course, is no exception. In relation to some of the changes and the increases by comparison with last year's provisions, I make the following remarks.  On subhead A.2 which covers consultancy services, there is a provision for 1985 of £95,000, compared with the 1984 outturn of £48,000.  That subhead provides for the payment of consultancy fees to the ICC for the services of two accountants on loan to my Department, an arrangement which has turned out to be a very useful one, particularly in relation to assisting my Department at looking at some of the more commercial aspects of the activities of semi-State bodies.</P>
    <P>It includes also a small amount &mdash; £5,300 &mdash; for the installation of financial modelling packages and contract programming for the Estimates in respect of which there was no expenditure during the course of 1984.  The total increase over last year on that subhead is £47,000. I picked it for a particular remark because there is a very generalised tendency to criticise subheads which cover consultancies. I should like to make it clear to the House in respect of this Vote that the total expenditure is modest and, secondly, <Col N="2193" /> it covers activities that have a particular value in relation to the proper operation of my Department and their contribution to the process of government. Otherwise, the increases under the various subheads are moderate and have been kept to the tightest limits.</P>
    <P>Subhead J provides for payments under the special Border areas programme.  We have provided for £5.5 million in 1985, as we did in 1984.  To date just under £21 million has been allocated to this programme, including the £5.5 million provided for during this year. That will bring us almost to the total amount of expenditure required under the programme to draw down fully the non-quota section allocation to this country from the Regional Fund.  The total required is £23 million to draw down the total amount made available to us.  This year's provision will bring our total to £20.7 million so that there will be a small balance remaining and I expect this will be taken up during 1986.  In relation to the other subheads, the increases have been kept within the strictest limits that can be operated.  Generally, they are in the region of 6 per cent to 8 per cent.</P>
    <P>Vote 8 covers the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  On all the subheads we have kept the increased allocation to very low levels with the exception of subhead C. dealing with post office services.  While the increase was high in percentage terms &mdash; 50 per cent &mdash; it was very small in money terms at £2,000.</P>
    <P>Vote 9 covers the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  The estimate for this year is £80,831,000 which is £4,583,000 higher than the 1984 outturn. This is an increase of 6 per cent on the total Vote over 1984.  Again, the subheads where the increases are greater than the average are the following: subhead B.1. for travelling and incidental expenses where the increase is 16 per cent over the provisional outturn for 1984. That covers the cost of various sanctioned increases in allowances.  There will be an unusually high level of expenditure during this year on uniforms because a <Col N="2194" /> substantial proportion of more expensive items fall to be replaced during this year. There is an increase of £777,000, or 19 per cent, on subhead B.2.  The principal item of expenditure under that subhead is the computer installation.  That accounts for just over £4.1 million out of £4.948 million on that subhead.  The other increases on that Vote are not of great magnitude in the context of the total sum.</P>
    <P>Vote 11 covers the State Laboratory. Again, the overall increase in the Vote this year has been kept to a fairly low level.  The particular item to which I would draw attention is subhead D. where there is an increase of £240,000 over the 1984 outturn.  That subhead covers apparatus and chemical equipment. The extra provision this year is for the purchase and installation of essential and expensive laboratory equipment, the purchase of which had been deferred while the laboratory was in inadequate and overcrowded premises in Merrion Street.  Some months ago I had the pleasure of opening the new premises.  I am sure the laboratory staff will be able to carry out their work in more comfort and in better circumstances than has been the case up to now.</P>
    <P>In Vote 12 which deals with the Secret Service we are providing £170,000.  Vote 13 covers the Office of the Attorney General. The only notable increase over last year occurs on subhead C., namely, a 49 per cent increase for postal and telecommunications services to cover anticipated increased post office charges and an increase in the general volume of post, telex and telephone use.  On subhead F. there is an increase of 400 per cent over last year's provision of £1,000.  That is the subhead that provides for defence of civil servants.  In 1984 the cost was extremely low and we have been prudent in providing for the costs that may occur during this year.</P>
    <P>Vote 14 is for the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Again, the main increases here are in relation to subhead B. for travelling and incidental expenses and subhead C. for post office services. The increases under those two headings amount to only £11,000 for both items. <Col N="2195" /> Vote 15 covers miscellaneous expenses.  Here we are providing for a smaller sum than last year.  We are providing £333,000 which is a reduction of £243,405 on the provisional outturn for 1984.  This is the Vote from which State entertainment costs are paid.  Last year we had to provide for extra expenditure arising from the fact that we held the Presidency of the European Community in the second half of last year.  In addition, last December we had the EC summit and we had the visit of President Reagan of America in June last year.  We do not have to cover such events this year, hence the reduction in the provision.</P>
    <P>Vote 16 is the vote for the Stationery Office.  This year the Estimate is £9.3 million, an increase of £861,000 or approximately 10 per cent on the 1984 provisional outturn.  There are no single notable increases on the subheads in this Vote apart from a 600 per cent increase in the provision for consultancy services where we are providing £6,000 this year as against £1,000 last year.  These are expenses which will be incurred in connection with the planning of the layout of the proposed new accommodation for the Stationery Office.  The other changes are not in themselves remarkable except in relation to subhead B.2. where there is a 25 per cent reduction in the provision for this year compared with last year, that is, the provision for office machinery and other office supplies.  The reduction is due to an anticipated reduction in the procurement of office machinery.</P>
    <P>Vote No. 17 covers the Valuation and Ordnance Survey offices.  The total increase under the provision is a fairly modest one.  There is a substantial increase under subhead B.2. of 120 per cent which is accounted for by the purchase of a system for organising and controlling flexi-time arrangements in the office.  There is an increase of £47,000 or 64 per cent in the provision for post office services due to the proposed installation this year of a new PABX telephone system.</P>
    <P>Vote No. 18 covers rates on Government property.  On subhead A. there is a <Col N="2196" /> reduction of £876,000.  That arises from the fact that payments in respect of property of the former Department of Posts and Telegraphs are no longer a charge on this Vote.  The other provisions on the Vote give rise to no particular comment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has dealt with the range of Votes covered in this Estimate.  They range from areas which for the purposes of the debate would not be relevant to him, for example, the Office of the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Stationery Office, and so on.  For that reason I propose to confine my remarks to the Office of the Minister for Finance and the Commission on Taxation. Deputy McEllistrim will deal with the Office of Public Works in greater detail.</P>
      <P>When one listens to the Minister introducing in a calm and detached fashion the Votes for which he is responsible, one gets the impression that we have a very calm and happy atmosphere in the nation but the reality is quite different.  The Minister who presides over the distressed nation at present is introducing these Votes.  I regret to say that the greatest contribution which the Minister for Finance could make to the economy would be to submit his resignation forthwith to the Taoiseach.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not sound very excited about that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of his parliamentary colleagues have called on him to do this.  The fact is that the Minister who is directly responsible for the management of the economy has depressed not only the economy but the people to a level from which it will be very difficult to raise them.  The continuous level of unemployment is a direct consequence of the Minister's uncaring policies and is causing distress and anger throughout the country.  The very deep, serious impact of this is aggravated by the cold and what sometimes appears to be arrogant insistence by the Minister in public statements on the radio and television that the Government are managing the economy in a consistent and disciplined fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2197" /> The Minister persists in making that point in face of the facts.  That further aggravates the reaction of the public to the Minister and the Government.  This is a blatant distortion of the reality.  That it is a distortion is underlined by a number of objective findings and reports from both within the country and externally.</P>
    <P>In recent times established reputable economists, some of whom were closely associated with the Minister's party, were seriously canvassing the likelihood for the first time of the IMF taking control of our economy.  That has appeared in a number of articles and in financial magazines and is being canvassed seriously as a possibility. It is clear that the Minister has presided over the most serious deterioration in our finances since the foundation of the State.  I will refer to some of the economic indicators, leaving aside the experience of the people in the home and the work place, or rather dole queues.</P>
    <P>The recent OECD report, April 1985, disclosed that the Government debt now stands at 128 per cent of GNP, by far the highest of the 24 member states of the OECD.  Our external public sector indebtedness is 70 per cent of GNP and interest payments on this account for 10 per cent of export earnings.  Interest payments on this debt now absorb over one third of total Exchequer tax revenue.  We have reached a point where our economic activity is so depressed due to lack of imagination, real planning, an awareness of the wealth of the nation and how we should promote that through our economic policies, that one third of our total tax revenue is taken up by foreign interest payments.  The interest payments on the external public debt pre-empt over 6 per cent of total national output.</P>
    <P>These are chilling figures when one recognises that in any comparable economy figures of that kind do not exist.  Let me underline the deterioration since the Minister took office.  Our total national debt was £12.8 billion.  As we address the issue now, that figure has soared to £20 billion in two and a half years.  On current trends it will reach at least £21 billion at the end of the year.  That is an increase of almost 55 per cent in little over two <Col N="2198" /> and a half years.  That is the state of the nation at this time in terms of our national debt.  We also have the highest level of taxation in the OECD area.  This is underlined by the fact that there is now a dramatic 15 per cent decline in real wages after taxation since 1979.  This figure is not being put forward as part of Fianna Fáil propaganda as some might suggest but by a most reputable international organisation, the OECD.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>A debate on taxation is not in order on the Estimate.  I did not interview up to now because I accepted what the Deputy was saying as being in order, but I must remind him that taxation is a matter for legislation and is therefore not in order during this debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall not go into the question of taxation in detail but you will be aware that among the areas we are dealing with in this debate is the Vote for the Revenue Commissioners, a Vote which, as the Minister has indicated, is of the order of £80 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also a matter of implementing tax provisions.  Surely I am allowed to make a passing reference to tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may help to confirm you in what I hope is a reasonable opinion if I say that among the Votes is the Vote for the Commission on Taxation who have been asked specifically by Governments to consider our taxation system, the levels of taxation and the spread of it.  It is not my intention during this short debate to cover the whole range of the reports of the Commission on Taxation but with respect, I should be entitled to say that we now find that real wages have declined by 15 per cent after taxation since 1979.  This has emerged <Col N="2199" /> also from the Commission's reports.  Such a depressing picture gives no joy to any of us and even less to those outside the House who are suffering the consequence of that depression.</P>
      <P>The situation is underlined further by the latest Exchequer returns which give total revenue receipts up to 14 June running at £68 million below last year's level. If we allow for inflation in real terms, that is a major drop in the revenue receipts that one would have expected in the first half of the year, because normally these receipts should be running at a level of £100 million more than the previous year and that would not be even keeping in line with inflation.  When we have the first half yearly returns we will be in a position to comment further.</P>
      <P>It is now fairly clear that the current budget deficit for the first half of the year will be of the order of £850 million and that is almost 70 per cent of the target deficit of £1,234 million set by the Minister in the budget.  Many thought that was a dangerously high target deficit but now there is a dramatic overrun on that.  Clearly the consequences of this will be disastrous for the economy.</P>
      <P>To consider the other side of the coin that emerged from the Exchequer returns up to 14 June, while revenue has dropped dramatically despite increasing tax levels, in the same period total expenditure by way of central fund services and supply services has increased by £326 million to £3.63 billion in comparison with last year. All of this demonstrates that the Government, and the Minister in particular, who made a virtue of their capacity and determination to control the economy, to adhere to targets, to adopt a disciplined approach and to bring Ireland face to face with reality, have brought about a most disastrous deterioration in terms of our current budget deficit, our growing foreign debt, our total national debt and any other area.  We all know too well from our recent contact with the people just how much they are suffering as a result of the Government's policies.  Some may not have been in contact with the people before.</P>

The increasing level of unemployment and the diminishing labour force who are being forced to foot the bill for the increasing numbers who are depending on social welfare are placing an enormous strain on the economy and are resulting in further tax contributions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, we will not get into a tizzy &mdash; passing references, whatever that means.  What I am saying in relation to the level of taxation is that it places such an intolerable strain on our economy that it gives rise to a vicious circle in terms of unemployment.  We are demanding further tax contributions from an ever-diminishing labour force. We find now nationally as emerges from OECD reports and economic surveys that real wages are diminishing to such an extent that unemployment benefits now replace 80 per cent of earnings compared with 70 per cent less than ten years ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we look at the economy, for which this Minister is particularly responsible on any one of its fronts, we find that the level of investment in the economy has declined dramatically in recent years. Net foreign investment last year was less than 1 per cent of GNP, and manufacturing activity, not surprisingly, declined by 40 per cent.  The decline is even steeper so far this year.  The OECD Report to which I have been referring points out that, as a result of what they call the tax wedge &mdash; they use the term specifically in <Col N="2204" /> relation to the Irish position &mdash; which is effectively the huge increase in the tax burden, income is being forcibly transferred in this country from the private to the public sector to an alarming extent.  They warn in a very objective and serious way about the effects of this tax wedge on the poor profit situation of a diminishing number of indigenous firms.</P>
    <P>Under this Minister the only growth areas have been all too obvious &mdash; the black economy, because of the level of taxation, unemployment, taxation itself, and, of course emigration.  We do not have to worry about emigrants, they are leaving us &mdash; they are no longer a burden on us &mdash; at the rate of 30,000 per annum. That is the only basis on which we can claim relief, that they are going elsewhere and finding little to satisfy them.  All of these distressing figures demonstrate that the country has been brought to the brink of economic ruin.  The public are frustrated and angry to an unprecedented extent.  Those public representatives who have had to face them on the ground in recent times know the extent of that frustration and anger.  It is time that those who have responsibility in Government recognised its extent.  For that reason if the Government as a whole are determined, and they do appear to be, to hold on and to ignore all these serious distress signals at present, then perhaps what I sought and suggested initially, with reluctance personally, but said seriously out of political responsibility &mdash; the resignation of the Minister for Finance &mdash; might signal some faint hope of survival.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham) Joseph Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. J. Bermingham)</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish particularly to speak on Vote No. 10. &mdash; Public Works and Buildings.  The net total Estimate for Public Works and Buildings for 1985 is £96,579,000.  While it is not among the top ten Estimates in terms of the amount of money being sought, nevertheless, it always generates a considerable amount of interest among Deputies on all sides of the House.  This is a reflection of the impact which the activities of the Office of Public Works <Col N="2205" /> have on so many aspects of life throughout the country.</P>
      <P>These activities may be considered under three broad headings &mdash; buildings, engineering works and conservation and amenity.</P>
      <P>The Office of Public Works is the Government's principal agent for the provision and care of buildings for State purposes at home and abroad.  Wherever possible, accommodation needs for Government services are provided for in premises owned by the State and the OPW's on-going building programme is designed to meet those needs as far as is possible within the constraints of the allocations in the Public Capital Programme.</P>
      <P>The office seems to be coming in for a certain amount of criticism lately in relation to its building programme.  One of the charges being levelled at them is an apparent lack of concern for the preservation of buildings of architectural and historic merit.  There is, of course, no such lack of concern.  The State is always mindful of its responsibilities in relation to important buildings in its care, and the Commissioners of Public Works in particular are aware of the fact that the public look to them in a special way to see that anything of merit from the past is treated with sympathy.  Some people seem to have difficulty in appreciating that it is often necessary, in maintaining the historic character and features of buildings, to cater at the same time for modern functional needs.  It must also be said that occasions can arise when a building which people might like to see retained has to go.  Decisions in such cases are not taken lightly but where, for example, considerations of public safety are concerned there may be no real choice to be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>An outstanding example of what the OPW have achieved in the field of preservation and restoration is the Royal Hospital, Kilmainham.  Last year I had the honour of formally accepting, on behalf of the State, the magnificently restored building from the contractors. The completed restoration scheme is an outstanding achievement and a major <Col N="2206" /> milestone in terms of the preservation of a unique element of our rich architectural, historical and cultural heritage.  I would like to pay tribute to the Office of Public Works, the design team, the contractors and their workforce for the wonderful work to which all who have seen the building will testify.  I might add that, contrary to the impression given from time to time in certain quarters, tight financial control was exercised throughout the project and the cost, at approximately £20 million, has been money well spent given the nature and scale of the works involved.</P>
    <P>In November last the Government announced that the Royal Hospital would be open to the public and developed as a major centre for culture and the arts.  An independent company has been established to manage and control the premises and the Office of Public Works, in consultation with the company, will undertake the fitting out works considered necessary.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works are also at present engaged in a major scheme of restoration of the stonework of the Custom House in Dublin.  It is expected that work will commence shortly on a similar scheme at the Registry of Deeds in Henrietta Street.</P>
    <P>Another group of buildings which it is intended to restore for posterity is the group of Georgian houses facing Government buildings in Merrion Street, one of the most important Georgian streets in Dublin.  Present plans envisage the faithful restoration, as far as is practicable, of the interior and exterior of the houses and the installation of modern services to make them functionally useful.  The work will be undertaken in a phased manner over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Buildings for the Garda form a significant part of the OPW building programme.  Work on the erection of new Garda stations is in progress at various centres throughout the country and is expected to commence at a number of others before the end of the year.  Planning of other new stations will continue. This year will also see the refurbishment of part of the Clock Block at the Garda <Col N="2207" /> Depot in the Phoenix Park, which will provide improved accommodation for senior Garda personnel.  Also at the Phoenix Park, on a site adjoining the depot, the construction of a further stage of the Garda Headquarters will commence. New accommodation for Garda industrial-type services, such as garages, stores etc., at present in cramped and unsuitable buildings at the depot, Phoenix Park and St. John's Road, will be provided at the former Talbot premises at Santry, Dublin, where adaptation works are due to commence this year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will see from the list supplied to them that there are many other building projects included in the 1985 programme apart from those which I have mentioned specifically.  It would take too long for me to talk about each one of them but, if any Deputy requires information on a particular project, I will be happy to give it in my reply.  Apart from the initial provision and fitting-out of premises, the Office of Public Works also have responsibility for furnishing, heating and lighting and on-going repair and maintenance.</P>
    <P>When introducing this Estimate last year I stressed the importance of proper maintenance of buildings and property generally.  In pursuance of this policy, at the suggestion of the Office of Public Works, an accommodation officer is to be appointed in each Department and from 1 January next these officers will be entrusted with certain maintenance responsibilitues within their own Departments. This, I hope, will lead to a general improvement in maintenance standards.</P>
    <P>Because of the on-going demand for new and improved accommodation for Government services and the unavoidably restricted amount of capital available for building it is likely that, for some time to come, it will be necessary to continue to meet some needs by way of rented accommodation.  The provision for rents in 1985 is £17.495 million&mdash; Subhead F.3.</P>
    <P>The engineering works provided for in the Estimate fall into two main categories: Arterial Drainage and Marine <Col N="2208" /> Works.  Last year I alluded to the review of arterial drainage policy undertaken by the Office of Public Works at the direction of the Government.  The review has been drawn up and has been given consideration by the Department of Finance. Some additional data required before submission to the Government are now being collected and I hope that the review and all necessary data will be before the Government before the end of this year.</P>
    <P>I will now deal with the requirements for implementation of the programme envisaged in 1985.  Amounts totalling £15,537,000 are included under subheads G.1., G.2. and G.3. of the Estimate to provide for the survey, design and construction of arterial drainage schemes, together with the maintenance of upwards of 30 completed schemes.</P>
    <P>The programme includes the continuation of the collection and analysis of hydrometric data on many rivers throughout the country which provides valuable information in regard to the country's water resources.  I expect that the specialist studies being undertaken in the Dunkellin-Lavally catchments will be completed this year.</P>
    <P>This year should also see the completion of construction works on the Boyne catchment drainage scheme, which is the biggest single scheme so far undertaken by the Commissioners of Public Works. When completed it will have conferred benefit on about 120,000 acres of land. Work will continue on the Maigue, Corrib-Mask-Robe, Boyle and Bonet schemes.  In addition I expect progress on the joint scheme for the Ulster-Monaghan Blackwater, being undertaken in co-operation with the Department of Agriculture, Northern Ireland, to have reached the stage whereby it will be possible for the Commissioners of Public Works to commence operations in the southern reaches of the catchment in County Monaghan.  Substantial EEC grants towards the cost of drainage construction works will be available again this year.  The cost of maintaining completed schemes is met from Subhead G3 initially and is recoverable from the relevant county councils. <Col N="2209" /> The Office of Public Works are the statutory authority responsible for the management and control of the three State harbours, Dún Laoghaire, Howth and Dunmore East.  Provision is included in the Estimate for some necessary improvements to the passenger terminal building at the mailboat pier in Dún Laoghaire.  A contract is in progress for the replacement of stairs with ramps and when that is completed any redecoration needed will be done.  I am conscious that the existing passenger handling facilities and arrangements at the harbour need to be reviewed and to this end a working group, set up by the Minister for Communications, is at present examining the options.  Pending the outcome of the group's deliberations, it clearly would be unwise to embark on major capital works and the cost of the necessary improvements to which I have referred represents prudent use of available resources in the interim.</P>
    <P>Provision is also included in this year's Estimate for a marine project at Roonagh, County Mayo.  The project involves provision of a new pier, an access road and a car parking area at an estimated cost of £550,000 and, when completed, will allow vessels to berth at all stages of the tides.  This will be a considerable boon to the inhabitants of Clare Island where new landing facilities have already been provided by the Office of Public Works.</P>
    <P>In accordance with the provisions of the Coast Protection Act, 1963, the Office of Public Works are charged with the responsibility of undertaking and maintaining coast protection schemes.  The provision included in this Year's estimate will cover the cost of maintenance only and the bulk of it will be spend at Rosslare and Youghal.  The expenditure on maintenance is recoverable from the county councils concerned.  As far as conservation and amenity are concerned, work continues on the development and maintenance of the natural and cultural resources in the care of the office.</P>
    <P>Glenveagh National Park in County Donegal was successfully opened to the public in July of last year and received almost 35,000 visitors by the end of the <Col N="2210" /> tourist season.  Facilities at the park include the first stage of a visitor centre incorporating an interpretive display, toilets and car-parks, an audio-visual show, tea-room, nature trail, a guide service and a range of explanatory booklets. Work is proceeding on the second stage of the visitor centre which will include further interpretive displays, a permanent auditorium and a restaurant-rest area and on maintenance work to Glenveagh Castle.  This building programme is being part-funded by the EC Regional Development Fund.  I hope that the full visitor centre and the castle will be open to the public in 1986.  As most of the trees in the Phoenix Park have reached maturity, a major replacement programme has commenced.  It is hoped to plant 20,000 trees within the next five years.</P>
    <P>A new audiovisual show on the lives of the Pearse brothers was produced for the Pearse Museum in St. Enda's Park, Rathfarnham.  This can be seen any day of the week free of charge.  It is a very interesting show.  It should be of particular value to schoolchildren but anyone with an interest in the history of Ireland in the early part of this century will find it well worthwhile to pay a visit to St. Enda's.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the decision to transfer the Grand and Royal Canals from CIE to the Commissioners.  The Commissioners existing highly successful role in respect of the management of the Shannon Navigation had a great bearing on this decision.  However, this Estimate does not include any provision for the canals and, accordingly, other than saying that I am confident that the Commissioners will be as successful in their management of the canals, I will confine my comments to matters relevant to the Shannon Navigation.  The financing of the canals on their transfer will be dealt with as a separate matter.</P>
    <P>My office's role in the management of the Shannon Navigation is worthy of the highest praise.  This can be appreciated by the fact that even in these difficult times the usage of the navigation facilities is increasing.  The Commissioners are <Col N="2211" /> fully conscious of the need to continuously improve, extend, and provide new facilities wherever required on the navigation. Their resources are fully utilised to ensure the maximum return for the navigation and the benefits of this policy can be seen by all who visit the Shannon or avail of its facilities.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on major development works in 1985 will be £80,000.  This will cover works at Clonmacnoise, Dromineer, Lecarrow and Williamstown.  The provision of these facilities will greatly enhance the navigation and, I hope, attract more people to it.  It should be appreciated that the management of a navigation as extensive as the Shannon involves a massive maintenance programme not alone to ensure that the works do not deteriorate but also to ensure that safety standards are of the highest.  An indication of the extent of this programme is that in excess of 600 navigation marks such as buoys and perches have to be maintained.  Other navigation works such as harbours, quays, locks, sluices, pumping stations etc., also have to be maintained.  The Commissioners record in this respect is second to none and the £665,000 which will be expended under the F1 Subhead on this maintenance programme will ensure that the high standards will continue.</P>
    <P>A sum of £2,980,000 is required under Subhead J for the conservation and presentation of national monuments in State care, for archaeological excavations and for archaeological survey work.  Conservation of national monuments in State care is one of the statutory duties of the Commissioners of Public Works.  This year major projects are in hands at some 34 sites throughout Ireland.</P>
    <P>The provision of visitor services at our better known monuments is now a major undertaking.  This summer 50 guide information officers will be working at 16 locations. This service is constantly monitored and resources are made available to cope with increased numbers of visitors.  Last year 320,000 visitors paid <Col N="2212" /> for admission to these locations.  At the Rock of Cashel numbers were at an all time high &mdash; just under 100,000.  Grants for archaeological excavations, totalling £90,000 are being made this year under a scheme operated in consultation with the Royal Irish Academy.  The major works are at Knowth in County Meath, Lisleagh, County Cork and Loher, County Kerry.</P>
    <P>I am happy to be able to report that the archaeological survey continues to make steady progress.  A sites and monuments record for County Louth was released last year and similar records for Counties Monaghan and Westmeath were recently issued.  Sites and monuments records for the four other counties. already surveyed by the commissioners, that is Counties Kildare, Offaly, Cavan and Longford, will be issued inside the next three years.  The preliminary surveys of Counties Cork and Galway being done on contract for the commissioners by University Colleges Cork and Galway, respectively, are nearing completion and records for these counties will be available next year.  Including County Donegal, which was surveyed some years ago under a scheme operated through the employment guarantee fund, and for which a sites and monuments record will be available later this year, the ten counties where field survey has been completed will have records available for them by 1988.</P>
    <P>To augment progress on the archaeological survey, a paper survey of the 16 remaining counties got under way in March 1985.  This survey, which will concern itself with an examination of ordnance survey maps, estate maps and all published material in respect of the county being surveyed, is scheduled to be completed by the end of 1988.  Thus inside the next three years or so sites and monuments records will be available for all 26 counties.  On the basis of the favourable reactions from planning officers and agencies concerned with environmental change to the records for Counties Louth, Monaghan and Westmeath, I am satisfied that we are on the right course in our <Col N="2213" /> efforts to halt the destruction of monuments and sites of archaeological significance.</P>
    <P>I have given here only a broad outline of the main activities of the Office of Public Works covered by this Estimate. In addition to these works, the office of course also undertake major programmes of work on a repayment basis on behalf of various other Government services, such as the prisons service, fisheries, telecommunications etc.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to continue to go through all the items or phases of activities of the OPW, and I will not have an opportunity to come in here again on this, but if anyone has any serious question to ask I will make available whatever information is needed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasMcEllistrimJnr" hpid="Mr. McEllistrim Mr. McEllistrim">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McEllistrim</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the OPW for 1985 is £96.5 million.  This is not adequate for that office.  I maintain that the OPW are a very important office who deal with every Department of Government, and the money allocated to the OPW is a great barometer for assessing a Government and their performance. When the OPW are left without enough finance for the year, every Department in Government feel the pinch.  Sufficient money has not been allocated this year to the OPW and enough allowance was not made for inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The OPW can be examined under three headings: buildings, engineering works and conservation and amenity. Taking buildings first, the OPW have come under a great deal of criticism recently for their activities in providing buildings for Government Departments. Some of this criticism is unjustified as the OPW must provide and have space ready in anticipation of any Government Department needing extra office space at any given time.  Every Government Department need office space near Dáil Éireann and especially in the St. Stephen's Green area.  When I was in that Department as Minister of State we had several requests for office space and all the Departments intimated to us that <Col N="2214" /> they needed office space near Dáil Éire-ann.</P>
    <P>The OPW should start on the renovation of the old Land Commission buildings in Merrion Street.  The Minister of State spoke about some houses in Merrion Street being renovated.  I do not know whether these are the old Land Commission buildings, but I was in those buildings when I was Minister of State and as far as I know they belong to the Government.  They should be renovated as quickly as possible and prepared for use by some Department.  Also the OPW should purchase sites when they become available in the St. Stephen's Green area or near the Dáil.  When the old Hibernian Hotel was demolished recently, a site became available which would be very suitable for an office block.  The erection of a building by the OPW would be a better investment than renting office space.</P>
    <P>I am particularly interested in a new block of offices for the Civil Service Departments in my town of Tralee.  All the offices are scattered around the town and it is important that all of them should be in one centre.  A very suitable site was purchased from Tralee UDC when I was Minister of State in the OPW and a building was designed at that time which has not yet been erected by the Government. It is needed to house approximately 200 civil servants who are scattered all over the town of Tralee, some of them in very inferior offices.  Some of the offices, particularly the offices of the Department of Agriculture, are too far out of town and very difficult for farmers to get to. The Revenue Commissioners are obliged to manage with three prefabricated buildings and that accommodation is completely inadequate for them.  The Minister for Energy, Deputy Spring, promised during the local election campaign that this office block will be built next year.  I would like an assurance from the Minister of State that this Civil Service office block will be erected in Tralee next year.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State spoke about the Royal Hospital at Kilmainham.  I remind him that it was a Fianna Fáil Government who initiated the restoration of that <Col N="2215" /> building.  It should be opened to the public, a manager appointed and a guide service provided.  I congratulate the staff of the Office of Public Works who did such a magnificant job in restoring this building which is rich in architectural, historical and cultural heritage.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the OPW are engaged in major restoration job on the stonework of the Custom House.  This was suggested when we were discussing the Estimates last year and the work has since commenced.</P>
    <P>I notice that £90,000 is being provided for archaeological excavations.  An archaeological survey is being carried out in County Kerry by the National University of Ireland and I should like the OPW to give as much help and financial assistance as possible since my country is rich in national heritage.  I should welcome restoration work on the cathedral in Ardfert and the appointment of a guide to show visitors around this fine old building.</P>
    <P>On the subject of parks and monuments, I am delighted that the development of the Glenveagh National Park in Donegal is going ahead.  When will the castle be open to the public and how are the red deer progressing in this park? There was a danger that the red deer would become extinct in Killarney and some years ago steps were taken to ensure that this would not happen.  It is very important that the red deer in Glenveagh should also be looked after to ensure the preservation of this native species.  We have some of the most beautiful national parks in the world &mdash; Killarney, Glenveagh and Letterfrack &mdash; as well as the nucleus of a national park in the Burren in County Clare.  Killarney is reputed to be one of the most beautiful national parks in the world and there is a duty on the Government of the day to keep these parks in good condition and encourage our people to visit them.  The Minister should write to the principals of all national and post-primary schools suggesting that they encourage their students to visit our national parks.  Every school has a day out for sightseeing. <Col N="2216" /> I am delighted that a superintendent has been appointed to Phoenix Park.  The maintenance of that park has very much improved since the appointment.  This is one of the biggest and best urban parks in Europe and I would urge the Minister to ensure that buses are not allowed to travel through it.  We have one million people in Dublin, many of whom are unemployed, and the park should be preserved for the people.  It would spoil the beauty of the area if buses were allowed there.</P>
    <P>I request the Minister of State and the Minister for Finance to purchase the Great Blasket Island off the Kerry coast and retain it as an historic park.  It is important that some of the historic buildings on that island should be preserved and possibly renovated, especially the buildings occupied by some of our best writers.  A booklet should be made available on the history of the Great Blasket Island.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed at the amount being provided for arterial drainage. There are four main drainage schemes in progress &mdash; the Boyne, the Maigue, the Corrib-Robe-Mask and the Boyle&mdash; Bonet scheme.  I note that the Boyne scheme will be completed this year.  What river will be started next year?  The Government are very slow in producing the report on arterial drainage and there is no cost-benefit analysis being prepared. Those rivers on which work is to be done will have to be advertised in order to allow for objections.  A cost-benefit analysis survey should be carried out to avoid any delay in the arterial drainage programme.  It takes at least six months to deal with objections and, if the Government do not have this report prepared as soon as possible, there will be no schemes ready to go ahead in the next few years.  The four schemes in progress were started and effectively pursued by Fianna Fáil.  There has been a slowing down of arterial drainage work under the Coalition Government.  More money should be allocated for arterial drainage and schemes should be prepared to ensure that there is further progress in that area.  It is important to mention that <Col N="2217" /> four of these arterial drainage schemes are 50 per cent EC funded.</P>
    <P>I note that there is no money provided to do a survey on the River Shannon even though this also could be 50 per cent EC funded.  Arterial drainage is of great importance to the agricultural sector. Many of our farmers cannot carry out a farm drainage scheme because there is no arterial drainage in their area.  The Shannon floods nine counties, Cavan, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway, Westmeath, Tipperary and Limerick.  The dredging of the Shannon would provide anything from 1,500 to 2,000 jobs so, as well as making more acres of land workable and viable, it would give much needed employment.</P>
    <P>The Office of Public Works made an awful mistake in offering for sale this year the 13 sites purchased for decentralisation. It was a retrograde step.  Some of those sites were purchased from urban and county councils and private individuals also went out of their way to co-operate with the Office of Public Works in facilitating the purchase of sites in anticipation of Civil Service offices being built in their area.  The areas which would have benefited were Killarney, Limerick, Nenagh, Cavan, Ennis, Letterkenny and Galway.  I appeal to the Minister to retain those sites.  When Fianna Fáil come back to office we will start our decentralisation programme again and this will mean the transfer of many civil servants to the country.  This project was welcomed by the Civil Service and would have afforded many rural people living in Dublin an opportunity to go back to their own towns.  With the present state of the property market, those sites will not make very much money and it would be much better to retain them.  Any money acquired from the sale of these sites would not be of much benefit to the Government.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that no new schemes were selected this year for coast protection work.  A very paltry sum is allocated for coast protection and the Government stated in the national plan that no new coast protection work would be done during their five year period in office. The Maharees, Castlegregory, are badly <Col N="2218" /> in need of coast protection work and if it is not done very soon, the Maharees will become another island.  There are also other areas in County Kerry which need coast protection work, including the area between Tralee and Fenit and the Ballyea Barrow area also.  Parts of County Waterford such as Ballyvoyle, Strabally, Belair and Ardmore also badly need coast protection work.  I suggest to the Minister of State that he should try to get EC funds to have this work done because, if it is not undertaken soon, much of our coastline will be eaten away.</P>
    <P>I am delighted that the Office of Public Works have taken over the Royal and Grand Canals and I am looking forward to a substantial amount of money being made available for the development of those canals next year.  The Office of Public Works are very important and the Minister of State should be allowed to sit in when the Estimates are being prepared for the budget so that he can make a case for his Department because the Office of Public Works are forgotten at budget time as they have no one to speak on their behalf.</P>
    <P>I note from the speech of the Minister of State that the Garda facilities in the Phoenix Park are to be improved.  Many Garda barracks throughout the country need replacement and renovation.  The Garda now need much better facilities and I appeal to the Department of Justice to allocate more money to the OPW so that Garda barracks can be renovated and repaired.  In this year's Estimate, there was a big shortfall in the amount of money allocated to the OPW.  I am disappointed in the allocation of money made to that office this year as they are doing a tremendous job with limited resources.  As the Minister for Finance is here, I ask him to ensure that, when they are preparing the budget next year, a bigger amount of money will be allocated for coast protection work and arterial drainage.</P>

      <P>I wish to deal with the question of security in this House which rests with staff of the House under the Captain of the Guard and the ushers.  The <Col N="2219" /> next people with whom security rests are the Garda Síochána and the Army.  As a Deputy elected by the people of Laois-Offaly I would object to the security of the House being placed in the hands of outsiders or allowing any foreign group of friendly persuasion or otherwise to play a role in the security of the House. My reason for drawing the attention of the House to this important point arises out of the visits of President Reagan and President Herzog.  I an very well disposed towards America and its government.  On the occasion of the visit of President Reagan I noticed when I arrived in the House that a large number of security people from the United States were present.  I was concerned that people who were obviously armed were able to wander around the House.  I strenuously object to any Government &mdash;</P>

In so far as the Deputy may be referring to ushers, I should point out that they are paid out of funds voted here, but the Deputy appears to be dealing with visiting presidents and their personal staff who would be looking after their security perhaps, and not the security of the House properly so called.

    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to raise the question of staffing in the Office of the DPP and the Chief State Solicitor.  Problems have arisen recently in regard to a number of cases being dismissed in court because they were not brought expeditiously enough.  It is a pity if cases are dismissed because the State is not able to process them expeditiously.  If there is a shortage of staff in those offices it should be dealt with by the relevant Minister.  Members of the Garda Síochána go to the trouble of investigating cases and bringing people to court but, because of a shortage of staff in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, the book of evidence is not prepared in time.  It is essential that such cases are dealt with more speedily and that can only be done if additional staff are appointed.  It is serious if people who opt for trial by judge and jury have their cases dismissed because the book of evidence is not prepared in time.  That is a matter of great importance.  It is being stated by the DPP, and officials in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, that they do not have sufficient staff to process these cases.  Gardaí have a difficult task to perform and when they bring people before our courts it is essential that the necessary ancillary services are provided for them to deal with the cases. <Col N="2222" /> The Office of Public Works are an important section of the Department of Finance.  I am concerned that there has not been a proper approach to carrying out drainage work on the Shannon and its tributaries.  Each year from October to March huge tracts of land in the midlands are flooded, particularly in west and south Offaly.  A number of rivers are affected, including the Brosna.  This problem recurs year after year and farmers complain of flooding but on each occasion they are told they will have to wait until some of the tributaries are drained before the Shannon can be drained properly.</P>
    <P>We have a serious unemployment problem.  One of the ways to provide sizeable employment would be by undertaking major drainage work.  This would have a twofold effect.  There would be a sizeable number of jobs created in the areas of design, engineering, architectural and planning areas and so on.  On the architectural and planning sides a great number of staff would be employed doing very important work for a number of years, and at the same time huge tracts of land would be improved.</P>
    <P>If drainage work on the Shannon was undertaken it would benefit everybody and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Bermingham, to look into this matter.  For too long the excuse was that work on the Shannon could not be started until work on the tributaries was completed. This has been talked about since the thirties and many Deputies have spoken about this matter late into the night over a number of decades, and sad to say they will probably be talking about it for many decades to come.</P>
    <P>As I said, we have a very serious unemployment problem and thousands of people in the midlands are very anxious to be gainfully employed.  On their behalf I appeal to the Minister and his Minister of State to look very seriously at this area and they will see the many jobs that will be created if this work is undertaken.  The drainage of the Shannon would benefit people from Cavan to Clare.  This work should be undertaken with care because the Shannon is a wonderful amenity for <Col N="2223" /> boating, cruising, fishing and all the ancillary industries, but with common sense a lot of land could be improved as well as the amenities at present provided.  Many more landing points and jetties could be provided.  There is enormous revenue generated from boats on the Shannon, especially in my area of Offaly, Shannonbridge and Banagher.  This is a source of enjoyment for many, and people from all over the country travel there regularly.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to seriously consider draining the Shannon, because this would benefit everybody.  It is very important to provide jetties and proper berthing facilities.  At present there is a vast increase in the number of cruisers on the Shannon, particularly at weekends when a number of cruisers are unable to berth properly in the limited space available. Further extensions will have to be undertaken by the Office of Public Works in co-operation with Bord Fáilte, the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the local authorities.  This is very important and would be welcomed by all.</P>
    <P>As regards the Slieve Bloom area I ask that a survey of the Glendine Valley, which has been requested by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry in order to provide a new forest park, be looked at by the Office of Public Works. The Department of Fisheries and Forestry considered providing an artificial lake there but they then discovered that they did not have sufficient staff to carry out the work.  I am reliably informed that they have been in touch with the Office Of Public Works asking them to investigate the provision of this artificial lake and a forest park.  If this work were undertaken it would provide hundreds of jobs in the midlands over the next few years and it would provide a wonderful amenity for everybody who visits the area.</P>
    <P>The Slieve Bloom area is a very important tourist attraction.  The Slieve Bloom Association, Laois County Council, Offaly County Council and all the public representatives in Laois and Offaly are <Col N="2224" /> very anxious that this amenity be provided because it would be a great boost to the area and the capital cost would be minimal.  The Office of Public Works have been asked to investigate the feasibility of providing this artificial lake.  The land has been acquired by the Department of Fisheries and Forestry who have expressed their willingness to give the land for the artificial lake and the forest park if the Office of Public Works carry out the survey.  The Minister may not be in a position to reply to these points tonight but I would ask him or some of his officials to communicate with me and let me know the position as soon as possible.  I am informed that at present the land is lying idle.  This amenity has been sought for a considerable length of time and I ask the Minister to look into the matter at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>To conclude, in case the Ceann Comhairle got the wrong impression from what I was saying earlier, the people to whom I referred were very welcome to visit this country.  Any guest of any Irish Government and of any Taoiseach is welcome, as far as I am concerned.  Some of the demonstrations which took place during one of these visits saddened me.  As a nation, we are friendly disposed towards these people.  I would not like the wrong interpretation to be put on any of my remarks.  I shall not repeat the point I made because it is on record, but it is something that I felt needed to be raised here.  However, I accepted the ruling of the Chair.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State in charge of Public Works mentioned activities under buildings, engineering works, conservation and amenities and I have a few points to raise regarding buildings and arterial drainage.  He mentioned the maintenance of the historical character and features of buildings and that at the same time they would cater for modern functional needs.  The Office <Col N="2225" /> of Public Works are to be congratulated for what they are doing in this connection in many areas.  It is very important to maintain such buildings and have them functioning and in proper use.</P>
      <P>However, I have some criticism of the Office of Public Works regarding their building schemes.  With regard to my own county, over the last ten year period a number of buildings have been erected &mdash; schools, barracks, and local authority buildings for which the Minister has no responsibility but which are dependent on public subscriptions.  There should be more co-operation and better utilisation of buildings and closer examination of any advanced development.  In county towns there are Departments of Agriculture, veterinary offices and ACOT offices which should be more centralised.  The services are too fragmented and it is far too costly an operation.</P>
      <P>Many sites in Monaghan have been taken over by the Office of Public Works. I know of two instances, one in Monaghan town and one in Clones, where substantial, good quality brick and mortar buildings were demolished and shoddy enough short-lived replacements made.  The original buildings could have been used for other purposes.  The building around Monaghan town over the past ten years has been substantial, involving much money and many jobs.  However, if the usual business procedures were used, this work would be approached differently and much money would be saved, with a much better job done at the end of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the southern part of the county there were two Garda houses which had not been used for ten years and which had been originally in good repair, worth perhaps, at present day prices, £20,000 a piece &mdash; this despite much pressure at county council level for housing needs. Eventually, the Office of Public Works made an examination of these buildings and took a long time in deciding on how to dispose of them.  There should not have to be such a detailed examination and the Office of Public Works should be able to go to the local authority and ask them to make an offer for such houses, <Col N="2226" /> or get an independent valuer to value them and have them put back into use. It is a ridiculous situation that these two houses are now probably gone to rack and ruin and if the local authority did take them over it would cost an amount of money to put them into even reasonable repair.</P>
    <P>For many years a Garda station was badly needed in Monaghan where there was such a number of Garda personnel stationed, it being the district headquarters. Over 100 people were housed in a building which was not suitable for that number.  One-fifth of that number would not have been properly accommodated there.  A fine barracks is now being built, but there again it is built on a site which it would not take an engineer to know would be fairly doubtful, necessitating piling.  A substantial amount of money had to be spent before the building commenced and this was in an area where admittedly sites were at a premium but sites could have been obtained which would have provided a better quality foundation.  These matters should be closely examined.</P>
    <P>There is a demand now for customs clearance stations and in Monaghan there is a need for extra accommodation and extra parking space.  The clearance station there was erected when I came into Dáil Éireann 11 years ago and I remember saying here on one occasion that they were moving from a hazardous corner regarding traffic to an equally dangerous place, which turned out to be correct. The area around the station is too small for parking, which is causing a real problem on the roadway.  Certainly, it is good to see a row of lorries going north or south because that is a sign of activity, but parking would have been much safer if there had been forward planning.  It is a pity that space is so restricted.</P>
    <P>The Minister also mentioned the maintenance of buildings.  With the curtailment on funding, we are probably neglecting the maintenance of many of our buildings, whether local authority, health board, or Office of Public Works buildings.  In all probability, there will need to be a substantial input within the <Col N="2227" /> next couple of years to correct the position.</P>
    <P>The Minister also dealt with arterial drainage and referred to the work due to commence on the Ulster Blackwater. This is a scheme which I have long been pursuing very actively.  Last Sunday, on the way home from a football match in the athletic grounds in Armagh, I went to Kelvin to see the famous weir which has been causing the hold-up of water on the Blackwater River.  The weir was eight foot and they are taking another seven foot out of the channel.  They are doing a very good job.  The Minister of State said they could commence work on the Blackwater.  I understand an engineer has been appointed but they have not yet a compound for the machinery.  It is a pity this was not done in advance because I understand that within the next three months they will be in a position to commence work.  I suggest that they purchase a site and erect a substantial premises that could be used as a headquarters for the various drainage schemes.</P>
    <P>The work being carried out on arterial drainage is excellent.  I think that a sum of £54 million has been spent on the Boyne River since 1968 and the work done has been excellent.  The Office of Public Works will have to re-examine their approach to drainage schemes. While they do very good work on areas that are high on the priority list others will not be attended to for a considerable number of years.  There is no grant aid available to carry out any maintenance work.  Many rivers are silting up and large trees that have fallen into them have not been removed.  In a similar debate here a few years ago I said that engineers should be sent to County Fermanagh where they have a county drainage committee. They have carried out such an effective job that they are not interested in the arterial drainage scheme we proposed in the cross-Border development talks.  They have carried out work on minor rivers at a much cheaper cost and they have drained approximately 16,000 hectares on a fairly low yearly budget. <Col N="2228" /> As well as having a major programme, the Office of Public Works should also have a minor programme to do necessary work.  There is no way that all the areas on the list will be attended to in the foreseeable future.  I suggest that the Office of Public Works should opt for having two schemes, namely, a major scheme and an ongoing maintenance scheme for small channels.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that a review of arterial drainage would be carried out and would be put before the Government before the end of the year. I await that development with special interest.  In the past ten years we have spent considerable time on cross-Border talks and the main point was the drainage of the Erne catchment which included Fermanagh, part of Tyrone, Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan.  Many reports were compiled on the matter, including the EC report, the North Eastern Regional Development Organisation report and a report that was commissioned jointly by the two sovereign Governments and the EC.  It would have given a new lease of life to an area that has become disadvantaged in recent years.  Many of the problems in that Border region were created by the Minister. We were rather annoyed that he did not give more favourable consideration to the area.  Instead, in his budget he imposed increased excise duties.  I will not dwell any further on that as I will be ruled out of order.</P>
    <P>I hope that the scheme to which I referred will be implemented.  When Cavan County Council got in touch with the Taoiseach regarding the slow progress in implementing the Erne catchment scheme, he threw cold water on that drainage scheme.  He questioned its viability and the desirability of the arterial drainage scheme as a whole. However, much of the spade work has been done and I hope that the scheme will proceed.</P>
    <P>Other speakers mentioned EC funds. While it is easy for us to say we should avail of such funds, they have to be matched pound for pound.  In future years many of us will probably regret that more <Col N="2229" /> use was not made of the fund.  The money comes into the Exchequer and it is the most effectively controlled scheme under the management of the Minister for Finance. There are many ambitious farmers who would do substantial drainage work if money could be made available.  I have discussed this matter with EC officials in relation to various projects where substantial local contributions would be made.  We could do much more than we are doing with the EC funds that are available.  We are not making the best use of the Regional Fund and we are not taking full advantage of the non-quota section.  I am sure that EC officials demand a continuing review of the system but there has been little substantial change in it.  Money is made available to the Exchequer and it is then dispersed to the various Departments.  I would remind the Minister that the cross-Border scheme was the basis of our discussions in the Forum report.  It would open the gates to more co-operation and development on a cross-Border basis. Many of the reports relating to agriculture and tourism could perhaps be the basis for greater cross-Border co-operation in these areas.  I hope that a serious effort will be made to implement a substantial part of the report in the years ahead.</P>

    <P>When Deputy O'Kennedy was not straying into taxation and other areas he complained that, in his view, the current deficit was too high.  The main thrust of Deputy McEllistrim's remarks was that we should spend more money on the various programmes funded by the OPW.  At no stage was any indication given by either Deputy as to how extra funding would be made available within the context of the projected current <Col N="2230" /> deficit for this year or the lower level to which Deputy O'Kennedy now seems to aspire.  The answer is that Deputy O'Kennedy and his colleagues are not able to make up their minds about anything. They are incapable of making choices or deciding on priorities.  I have the feeling, and the experience of past years bears this out, that even when they make up their minds about something, if someone shouts loudly at them for long enough they will decide on something new as well which will be in addition to everything that went before.  We know the problems that has brought in its wake.  However, I do not intend to say anything more about that at this stage.</P>
    <P>Deputy McEllistrim had a few specific queries on matters covered by the Vote for the OPW.  He asked about the provision of new Government offices in Tralee.  I can tell him, as I understand he has already been told by Deputy Spring, that the Commissioners of Public Works hope to be in a position to invite tenders for the construction of these offices around the end of this year, that is within the next six months.  The Deputy asked when the castle in Glenveagh Park would be opened to the public.  I refer him to the remarks of the Minister of State who said during the course of his speech that he hoped to have the castle opened to the public during the summer of 1986.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright and other Deputies referred to the drainage of the Shannon and to arterial drainage.  I have noted the remarks made about the general programme of arterial drainage.  I would refer Deputies to what the Minister of State said earlier this evening about the review of arterial drainage policy which has taken place.  As he pointed out, the review was drawn up and submitted to my Department but I require some additional data to complete the report which OPW are now putting together.  I hope that before the end of the year I will be able to bring the review to the Government and we will have a recommendation as to future policy in this area.  In advance of that I cannot be any more specific in my answer.  I am tempted to remark, as Deputy Enright did earlier, that the <Col N="2231" /> Shannon drainage scheme has been the subject of debate for a long time.  Deputy Leonard expects it to be the subject of debate for a long time to come.  We must recognise that it is probably the biggest drainage project that has ever been conceived and is of such a size as to pre-empt funding for any other part of the drainage programme.</P>
    <P>A number of Deputies have remarked on the fact that a large scale arterial drainage project would have a number of advantages not least of which would be an increase in employment.  Given the way that arterial drainage is carried out, that would be the case.  What has not been referred to with anything like the same attention is the question of funding such a programme.  None of the arguments made about the benefits in terms of extra employment, the productivity of the land and the greater convenience for the population generally from other points of view have included what would have to be done in order to provide the necessary funds.  Funds can be raised from taxation or they can be borrowed, which is the same thing in the end because it is from taxation that we raise money to pay for our borrowing.  The Opposition seem to be like a trapeze artist doing a half turn and wondering where the next trapeze will come from.  They are beginning to get excited about the level of borrowing and the current deficit and yet are still insisting that we spend more money on a lot of areas without suggesting how that money is to be provided. That is a defect in their presentation to which they should pay some attention.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard spoke at some length about facilities on the Shannon and Deputy Enright spoke about the value to the economy generally and the Shannon catchment area in particular of the continuation and development of the Shannon navigation.  As the Minister of State pointed out earlier, a number of development works are provided for on the Shannon during the course of the year at Clonmacnoise, Dromineer, Lecarrow and Williamstown.  The work at Clonmacnoise provides for a new landing <Col N="2232" /> stage for the reasons Deputy Enright pointed out.  That would be an important part of any development work on the Shannon.</P>
    <P>I understood Deputy Leonard in referring to the Blackwater drainage scheme to be suggesting that we move ahead quickly with the provision of headquarters property for the scheme.  I am happy to be able to tell the Deputy that we are reaching the point where decisions will be made on that matter in the near future. Suitable properties have been shortlisted and I trust that a final selection will not involve too much time.  As is said in all the best jargon, the matter is under active consideration and I trust it will be brought to fruition very shortly.  I do not intend to say any more about arterial drainage except to assure Deputies that, in bringing the review to the Government, I will bear in mind a number of the suggestions offered during the debate by Deputy Enright and Deputy Leonard in particular who offered specific recommendations on how we might proceed with furthering the programme.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard asked if we are making the best use of and extracting the best value from EC funds.  This question is a fairly frequent matter of discussion between Deputy Leonard and myself. We get good value from EC funds and we use all of those funds that are available to us.  Whatever Deputy Leonard might think about the procedures applied, and these are the ones that have been applied since we joined the EC and began to benefit from the Regional Fund, it is not the case that another way of dealing with these funds would increase the total amount of funding available to us.  That should be borne in mind because it has been my experience from talking to groups of people in various parts of the country that there is a widespread misconception that if only we proceeded somewhat differently, additional EC moneys would become available automatically. I wish that were so because there are a great many areas that would benefit from additional capital.  I doubt if any Member of the House would be short of ideas in that regard though I would <Col N="2233" /> subject any such suggestion to critical appraisal before reaching a decision on it.  However, changing the way we carry out the job would not suddenly make extra EC funds available for any project no matter how worthy or productive it might be and regardless of what extra employment it might generate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Enright referred to difficulties which he claims have arisen in the courts as a result, he alleges, of shortages of staff in the Chief State Solicitor's office. We are providing, under Vote 13, which is the Vote for the Office of the Attorney General, for additional professional staff.  The additional staff will enable services to the Director of Public Prosecutions to be improved.  This is the only area in this group of votes in which we are providing extra staff and we are doing so partly for reasons that are not unconnected with the difficulties Deputy Enright says he has encountered.  We have anticipated the difficulty raised by the Deputy and have taken steps to deal with it.</P>
    <P>I turn now to the more general questions dealt with by Deputy O'Kennedy. The Deputy followed a practice that he began about 18 months ago, that is, the practice of applying various adjectives to describe me.  The words &ldquo;calm&rdquo; and &ldquo;relaxed&rdquo; are two of those and for them I thank him.  Their use indicates a very accurate perception on his part.  Cold and arrogant are two more of the words he uses.  I am very sad at a man of Deputy O'Kennedy's parliamentary and other experience being obliged, apparently by the lack of anything substantial to say, to descend to that kind of abuse.  He has manufactured this kind of patter of cold words to describe me.  He seems to be becoming so bored by this repetition himself that I would almost have described him this evening as calm and relaxed. He could not work up a passion about anything.  He does not even seem to believe what he is saying when he is using those words to describe me.  However, that will not make any difference to me.</P>

      <P>Adjectives of that kind which have nothing to do with the substance of policy leave me totally unconcerned except to the extent that I consider the Deputy to be letting himself down by resorting to that kind of language.</P>
      <P>Obviously, Deputy O'Kennedy is missing a great deal of what is going on.  As I have said during debates here in the past couple of months, and indeed since the budget, we are now at a point where total employment is increasing.  In the past two years &mdash; and this will be repeated this year &mdash; we have clocked up a very respectable performance so far as the volume of manufacturing output is concerned.  We have clocked up an extremely good performance in relation to the volume of exports, as the trade figures released earlier this week will show even on the most cursory examination.  Inflation has been reduced to just over 5 per cent and interest rates are now lower than they were in the period leading up to the end of November last.  But Deputy O'Kennedy chooses to ignore all of this because this performance on our part does not suit the arguments he is making.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made a number of remarks and I trust the Chair will allow me to make a passing reference to one or two of those.  They relate to levels of expenditure and to debt.  As I had been saying before the Deputy chose to rejoin us, he was followed by Deputy McEllistrim who was recommending more expenditure.  Other colleagues of Deputy O'Kennedy also recommended more expenditure.  I suggest it is time Deputy O'Kennedy decided what he is opting for and, having made that decision, have a chat with the other members of his party because they are going in all directions and not paying any attention to the concerns the Deputy is expressing about the level of the deficit and the level of borrowing. What these Deputies are doing is in line with the line that has been taken always by Fianna Fáil, that is, not to consider the level of the deficit or the level of borrowing and since many people wish us to spend more money, we should do so.  Life must be very difficult for <Col N="2235" /> Deputy O'Kennedy because he is not getting any support from the remainder of his colleagues.</P>

While none of us can condone the breaking of the law in this country under any circumstances, this Government have certainly brought the laws in regard to broadcasting into disrepute by presiding over a sad situation in relation to illegal broadcasting for a very long time now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mr. Ó Baoill, one might say, got a number of opportunities of paying the fine which was imposed on him at a court in my constituency in 1984.  The reason for his continuing not to pay the fine was that he was mistakenly led to believe, from <i>The Irish Times</i> of 25 February 1985 that the present Minister for Communications was going to introduce major reforms in the area of television broadcasting, in particular, in relation to the culture and the language.  That was a statement made by the Minister for Communications in which he said that some of the influences which now threaten our cultural identity were of more dubious value.  He went on to talk about the influences being popularised by the mass media, a kind of a bland, undifferentiated mid-Atlantic mass culture, as he called <Col N="2242" /> it.  Mr. Ó Baoill did not pay his fine because he believed that the pledge by the Minister for Communications, which included the words &ldquo;we must be on our guard to ensure that the improvements which I have outlined are used to heighten and improve our cultural inheritance rather than swamp it&rdquo;, would be carried out; hence his reason for not paying the fine.</P>
    <P>All of us in this House have agreed for many years that there is a point of principle in relation to the proportion of Irish language programmes on our national media.  Section 17 of the Broadcasting Act of 1960 outlines the statutory duties of RTE regarding the Irish language and I quote:</P>
    <P>In performing its functions, the Authority shall bear constantly in mind the national aims of restoring the Irish language and preserving and developing the national culture and shall endeavour to promote the attainment of those aims.</P>
    <P>I would suggest that it might be more appropriate to take the national television station to the courts rather than an individual who is trying to bring up his children through the medium of Irish in the heartland of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>I said I would outline the cost to the State of this man's imprisonment.  Today a taxi was hired, with taxpayers' money to go from Galway city to this prisoner's home in Connemara to take himself and a local garda all the way to Dublin, to Mountjoy, to deposit the prisoner there. The taxi then returned &mdash; at a further cost to the State &mdash; to Galway city and delivered the garda to his home in Connemara. The charge to the State for such a service is approximately 50p per mile. They stopped for a meal and I presume that was paid for with taxpayer's money. I am sure all this cost much more than the fine imposed and would pay for many television licences.  I wonder if that cost to the State is warranted.</P>
    <P>There seems to be some confusion about the prison sentence.  When I spoke to the prisoner this evening in Mountjoy he said that his recollection was that he <Col N="2243" /> had been fined or sentenced to one month in jail, whereas the warrant states two months in jail.  Perhaps the Minister would confirm the actual term of imprisonment imposed.</P>
    <P>The prisoner is the personnel director of Údarás na Gaeltachta a semi-State body.  He is a very hardworking person, a good husband, a loyal father who worked abroad for many years and came back here because he thought it was the best country in which to raise his family.  The prisoner worked abroad for a number of years and then worked in this city, but he then decided that this city did not bring him back to his cultural roots.  He felt he should uproot his family once again and take them to the heartland of the Gaeltacht.</P>
    <P>He has lived and worked there for many years and now the Irish language is the first official language of his home. He is one of the success stories in the Gaeltacht.  We have heard for many years of people coming into the Gaeltacht from other areas.  They do not speak Irish and they anglicize the Gaeltacht.  Here is a success story &mdash; a man who did not have Irish, who worked abroad and came home to work.  In his capacity as personnel manager for Údarás na Gaeltachta he has been writing for many years to RTE on behalf of the organisation since his first letter on 24 July 1981 asking for an increase in the percentage of Irish programmes on that medium.  He had to write on three occasions before he finally got a reply from that body.</P>
    <P>In relation to the conditions in Mountjoy, I am not sure when the Minister for Justice last visited Mountjoy, but my information is that it was on 19 May 1983.  Conditions cannot have improved in that period, especially having regard to the level of crime at the moment. Certainly the conditions did not impress me today.  To put a person who is not a criminal, who has not been involved in hard core crime, into Mountjoy prison is a tragedy.  The man was two hours in prison when I visited him today.  During that time his watch had been conficated and he had been kept in an underground <Col N="2244" /> waiting room with a number of other prisoners.  He had had no contact with anybody during that time.  A genuine hardworking man standing on a point of principle should not in any circumstances be treated like a hardened criminal.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister of State will agree with me there.  The Minister has the discretionary power and he has used it in the past.  As Minister for Justice we have all found him approachable and that is the main reason that I put the prisoner's point of view tonight.  It is important when our prisons are bursting at the seams, when hard core criminals involved in extreme violence can be released from prison within days of their sentence beginning, that somebody of the calibre of this man should not be in Mountjoy jail.  I ask the Minister of State to pass on my comments to the Minister tonight or tomorrow morning and hopefully the Minister will make a decision in the prisoner's favour by tomorrow.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell) Nuala Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Mrs. Fennell)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Justice is not here tonight due to a family bereavement.</P>
      <P>In relation to the statement made by the Deputy that offenders whom she describes as &ldquo;hardened criminals&rdquo; are released within days of commencement of their sentence, that statement is not correct unless, of course, the sentence imposed was a short one which would be unlikely in the case of hardened criminals. The vast majority of those offenders serve their full sentence and get only remission to which they are statutorily entitled.  Some offenders may be granted temporary release either as part of a prerelease programme for the offender or subject to conditions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the present case, it appears the offender was convicted on 13 December 1983 of not having a television licence.  I say &ldquo;appears&rdquo; because the Minister for Justice became aware of this case only this afternoon.  Indeed, the offender arrived in Mountjoy at about 3 o'clock this evening.  It has not been possible at such short notice to get full details of the background to this case.  This prisoner would <Col N="2245" /> not have been treated differently from any other prisoner entering Mountjoy.</P>
    <P>To get further details of the background to this case would have meant getting agencies, not all of whom are under the control of the Minister, to drop tasks on which they are working and rush in reports on this case.  It would be quite unreasonable to expect the Minister to do that.  The court imposed a fine of £50 or, alternatively, a prison sentence of two months.  As regards the conviction and the penalty, those are matters properly within the competence of the court and it would be inappropriate for the Minister to comment on them.  I am, however, somewhat intrigued by the implication in the Deputy's statement that to break the law on what she describes as a matter of principle is, somehow, different from other breaches of the law.</P>
    <P>This offender deliberately chose not to purchase a television licence.  The court gave him the option of paying a fine.  He did not take that option.  Consequently he was arrested this morning &mdash; over 18 months after the fine was imposed &mdash; and arrived in Mountjoy prison this afternoon. On the face of it, this offender has deliberately taken the course he has chosen with all the implications that has for this House.  It is, of course, open to any Deputy to approach the Minister in relation to any individual prisoner but I see no aspect of this case which warrants the type of instant reaction which the Deputy seems to be asking the Minister to take.</P>
    <P>While the Minister for Justice has statutory power to release prisoners, it is a power which successive Ministers have exercised sparingly and certainly not a power which should be freely exercised to the effect that it sets at nought a decision of a court.  If the courts send somebody to prison it is the duty of the prison authorities to receive that prisoner. Imprisonment is, in practical terms, the ultimate sanction in this country and, as such, is the sanction that ensures that the law is obeyed.  For that reason alone it is necessary, regardless of cost, to uphold that sanction, particularly in cases where <Col N="2246" /> people deliberately decide not to abide by the law.</P>
    <P>Furthermore, it is the duty of the prison authorities to retain a prisoner for as long as the Minister considers appropriate following careful consideration of each case. It is totally unreasonable to expect the Minister to give any assessment of the present case, bearing in mind that the prisoner was committed this evening. The Minister will consider this case in the normal way.  Finally, I might emphasise that if this prisoner wishes to be released immediately he can achieve that himself, or indeed anybody else on his behalf, by simply paying the £50 fine to the governor of the prison.</P>

      <P>A market development strategy aimed at expanding the Irish <Col N="2064" /> market for fresh and processed fish products was drawn up and introduced in 1984 by An Bord Iascaigh Mhara.  The main components of this market strategy are (i) to protect the established &ldquo;Friday&rdquo; market for fish and (ii) to expand the demand and market share on other weekdays in the household and catering segments of the market and effect import substitution.  The home market development objectives which form the basis of the board's promotional strategy for the period 1984-88 include:</P>
      <P>&mdash;increased per capita consumption of fish by 0.4 lbs per annum,</P>
      <P>&mdash;increased market share of fish against the main protein alternatives (beef, mutton, pigmeat, poultry) from 6.9 per cent to 7.4 per cent per annum,</P>
      <P>&mdash;an increase in the number of housewives serving fish twice or more per week from 8 per cent in 1983 to 16 per cent in 1988,</P>
      <P>&mdash;the development of retail fish sales in supermarket outlets so that 50 per cent of fish is purchased in supermarkets in 1988 compared to 22 per cent in 1983,</P>
      <P>&mdash;improvement in fish distribution and the effecting of import substitution in processed fish.  In regard to the latter, the aim is to secure a 25 per cent share of the market for those imported prepared fish products, which can be manufactured here.</P>
      <P>An Bord Iascaigh Mhara will endeavour to attain these objectives largely through expansion and intensification of effort in the following areas:</P>

It is not the practice, for security reasons, to reveal the names of consultants employed on projects such as these.</P>

    <P>In March last the Council of Ministers adopted a Regulation (797/85) on improving the efficiency of agricultural structures, which replaces the former <Col N="2070" /> directives on the modernisation of farms and on mountain and hill farming. I am at present preparing measures to implement the Regulation and in this connedtion consideration is being given as to how best to utilise the assistance available for less-favoured areas.</P>
    <P>During the negotiations leading up to the adoption by the Council of the new Regulation efforts were made to have the relevant criteria modified so that the most severely disadvantaged areas in the west of Ireland would be put on a par with mountain areas in other parts of the Community. The Commission, however, was not prepared to make a proposal to that effect.</P>

Formal ratification by Ireland of the Convention should follow shortly after the enactment of the legislation.</P>
      <P>I must point out to the Deputy that, even when the Convention has been ratified by us, it will not enter into force here unless and until it has been ratified by all of the original six member states. Up to now only five of the original six member states have ratified the Convention.</P>
      <P>I might add that the legislation, when passed, will also enable Ireland to ratify the Convention, signed in October 1982, on the accession of Greece to the 1968 Judgements Convention as adjusted by the 1978 Convention.</P>
