      <P>It is proposed to take Items Nos. 3, 9 and 10.  By agreement Item No. 10 shall be taken at 3.30 p.m. today and the order shall not be resumed thereafter.  Private Members' Business shall be No. 24.</P>

      <P>On the Order of Business, would the Tánaiste or the Minister for Communications assure the House, in order to allay rumours, that he is in full support of B &amp; I in getting out of their debts and getting into a commercial position, as of now, because there are rumours with regard to that company. Perhaps the Minister for Communications would give the House that assurance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the fact that the Tánaiste and I would have an interest in worker directors, perhaps he would now consider it because there is not much point in having worker directors if they are not allowed be in on most important matters.</P>

      <P>I might refer to Item No. 74 on today's Order Paper, a motion in the name of myself and Deputy Mac Giolla concerning the Social Welfare (Supplementary Welfare Allowances) (Amendment) Regulations, 1985.  It is a motion seeking to disallow the regulations made by the Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps you would hear me out for a minute.  We have discussed the matter with the Government Whip.  We have been informed that the only way we can move it is in Private Members' time.  As we do not have Private Members' time it means that we are precluded from moving this motion which has to be moved, if it is to be effective, within 21 days of the regulations being made.  Can you advise us, Sir, how we <Col N="2216" /> can have this motion moved, which is an important one regarding supplementary welfare allowances?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to seek your guidance on a matter of protocol in the House, Sir.  Is it appropriate for the Minister for Communications to refer to the Opposition in very offensive terms as being irresponsible and hypocritical when we merely sought to raise in this House, in a mature and responsible way, the situation of a very important institution in this city?  In view of the history of recent times, when a number of important national institutions have practically gone bankrupt overnight, it was inappropriate for the Minister for Communications to refer to our vigilance in regard to the Port and Docks Board in these derogatory and offensive terms.</P>

      <P>Order, please. The Chair listened attentively to the debate.  He did not consider that his intervention was called for.  There may have <Col N="2217" /> been charges or remarks of a political nature which are not out of order, Deputy, and&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that charges of a political nature are acceptable in this House.  Indeed I am sure I have been the subject of more of them than most.  But you Sir, in exercise of your prerogative, decided that this matter was worthy of the Dáils attention and suitable to be raised on the Adjournment.  Do you not think, Sir, that the description of the Minister for Communications that our raising it was irresponsible and hypocritical was, if nothing else, a reflection on your decision to allow it be raised on the Adjournment?</P>

      <P>The case I am trying to make is that we are being denied the right to move this motion.  I can find nothing in Standing Orders which precludes us from moving this motion.  It is simply, apparently, the unwillingness of the Government to allow it to be moved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That the Revised Estimates for Public Services for the year 1985 which were presented to the Dáil and circulated to members on 23 April 1985 be deemed to be the Estimates for the year 1985 for the purposes of Standing Order 122 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has moved to authorise the bringing before the Dáil of the revised Book of Estimates for 1985.  This is the first opportunity which we on this side of the House have had of commenting on the revised Book of Estimates.  The procedure followed in this regard this year has been quite unusual.  Deputies will recall that there were at least three very dubious figures included in the budgetary arithmetic. There was an amount of £28.6 million provided for cuts in expenditure <Col N="2221" /> on the Estimates as originally put forward, there was a nice neat round amount of £30 million provided for staff savings and an amount of £50 million provided for buoyancy of revenue.</P>
      <P>In each of these three cases grave doubt arises about the validity of the figures and their insertion into the budgetary arithmetic.  We were not given any details on these figures at budget time.  We were denied any access to the details of the £28.6 million supposed cuts in expenditure and the £30 million savings on the staff side.  We are now told that these two figures have been incorporated into this revised Book of Estimates before us.  The Minister for Finance, as a matter of courtesy to the House and as a matter of good parliamentary practice, should have provided us with an itemised list how this important figure of £58.6 million was made up, that is, the £30 million staff savings and the £28.6 million on general expenditure cuts.  We sought in going through the Book of Estimates to identify where these savings will be made.  On the staff side we put together a list of what seems to us to be the manner in which the £30 million savings will be achieved.  There are some quite extraordinary proposals in the make-up of that £30 million.  I hope the Minister, when he comes to reply, will give us firm and detailed information about that £30 million and the £28.6 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as we can make out on this side of the House the £30 million saving would involve a saving of £3.7 million on the Garda Síochána.  It appears that there would be a £3.7 million reduction in the Estimate for the Garda Síochána although the crime situation is the way it is.  As far as we can establish, £2.5 million of that figure will be made up by a reduction in Garda pay.  For the life of me I cannot see how it is proposed to achieve that saving in Garda pay this year.  As far as one can make out there is also a saving of £1.4 million on pay to prison staff. There is another extraordinary item which would seem to indicate that there will be a saving of £3.3 million on the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.  It is difficult to know how that is to be <Col N="2222" /> achieved.  Any information we have about the position is that the Revenue Commissioners are under very severe pressure and that the revenue collection machinery is creaking.  How is it possible that the staff could be reduced to the extent of achieving a saving of £3.3 million? The entire £3.3 million may not be attributable to staff.  In fact, as far as we can gather the saving proposed for staff is £1.5 million.  The House would be expecting that additional staff would be provided for the Revenue Commissioners to catch up with all the arrears we hear so much about.</P>
    <P>There is a very dubious item elsewhere, a saving of £1.5 million attributed to a post office saving.  Are they not going to pay their bills to An Post or An Bord Telecom?  There is another £1.8 million purported to be saved on the Office of Public Works; again £200,000 of a post office saving.  There is a saving in the Statistics Office of £500,000.  Those figures are ones we have been able to deduce from the revised Book of Estimates which is now before us.  There is a saving of £7.5 million under the heading of Defence, £3.5 million being attributable to aircraft which, perhaps, can be explained but where the rest will be made up is far from clear.</P>
    <P>Apparently £5 million will be saved under the heading of Health Estimate.  It is described as a reduction of £5 million in payments to health agencies in respect of balance of grants for years prior to 1985.  My proposition to the House is that these purported savings are totally unreal.  Some of them may be valid enough, they may be well based but, in general, they do not seem to be a reasonable proposition in so far as the different Departments to which they are attributed are concerned.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of what exactly is happening with the £7 million in regard to youth employment levy expenditure.  I should like to ask the Minister to clear that up.  There was some sleight of hand indulged in in that regard. There is a statement to the effect that savings will be achieved by substituting <Col N="2223" /> £7 million of Exchequer funds on Education, the post-primary Vote, by youth employment levy funds.  The statement goes on to say that there will be no reduction in the level of post-primary activities. A saving of £7 million must come from somewhere.  If it is not to come from post-primary education then it will come from the youth employment schemes.  The whole position in regard to these savings is very obscure indeed.  I am asking the Minister to give us clear, specific, itemised details of how these amounts are made up because they are of crucial significance to the public finances this year.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that the £50 million buoyancy of revenue is now a possibility at all.  The Minister knows that in fact there was a serious falling off in the early part of the year in VAT and income tax. It is almost impossible to visualise a substantial sum of £50 million arising this year in the form of revenue buoyancy when, in fact, the returns of income tax and VAT have fallen off so seriously. That £50 million is not likely to materialise and if one adds to that figure the two figures I mentioned, the £28.6 million and £30 million cuts in expenditure, one gets a total of £108 million shortfall in the receipts on the revenue side of the budgetary arithmetic.</P>
    <P>The House is entitled to know the status or the validity of these cuts, £30 million on staff and £28.6 million on general expenditure headings.  If they are not to materialise or be achieved there is no doubt that the whole budgetary arithmetic will be seriously out of line, apart altogether from the falling off in receipts on VAT and income tax, and the current budget deficit will be greater by that amount.  It is already high enough, £1,234 million, but if it is to be added to and that amount has to be borrowed it has serious implications for the public finances and the level of borrowing.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out again that the manner in which this whole affair has been handled by the Government, and the way the House has been treated in regard to these alleged savings, is most <Col N="2224" /> unsatisfactory.  The time has come, now that we are discussing the revised Book of Estimates, for the Minister to come clean and tell us exactly where the savings are to be achieved, what validity there is in his hopes that they will be achieved and what his expectations are at this stage in regard to the budgetary arithmetic of which the figures I have mentioned are an essential part.</P>

      <P>The motion before the House is that which is required in order to conform with Standing Order No. 122 so that the revised Estimates may be discussed by the House.  This is a mechanical motion to enable the process to begin.  I am not quite sure that a detailed discussion, Estimate by Estimate, today is really what we are about but since the Leader of the Opposition has raised a number of general points I intend to address those general points, not the specific details.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The procedure we are following this year is exactly the same as that followed every two years.  We introduced the abridged Book of Estimates in the House last November and we are now producing the revised Book of Estimates to take account of the differences between the situation set out in the abridged book published before Christmas and the position now, taking account of the changes made as a result of budgetary decisions. I said on budget day that there would be £28.6 million savings in current expenditure compared to the pre-budget situation and that we would make savings of £30 million on pay.  In fact, the amounts set out in the revised Book of Estimates provide for savings compared to the pre-budget situation of £23.9 million on pay rather than £30 million, and £34.53 million on non-pay.  I would point out that I gave that information last week in response to a question by Deputy O'Kennedy. The savings that were involved were the details of the £28.6 million savings which I mentioned on budget day and were made public by me on 6 February last, so to that extent the House has already been informed of the breakdown of those savings.  The differences between <Col N="2225" /> the two are apparent from the details given in this revised Book of Estimates now before us.  It is not even valid for Deputy Haughey to add up £50 million revenue buoyancy&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister about that.  He speaks about the list he gave of the £28.6 million.  We have that list, but that has now been changed.  It has gone up to £33 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The £28.6 million has increased and the differences will be seen from the detailed figures in each of the subheads in this Book of Estimates.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Should the Minister not give us a list of them as revised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I will communicate with Deputy Haughey about that.  The details of that are set out in the individual subheads in this Book of Estimates.  I do not wish to be contentious with Deputy Haughey.  They can be discussed item by item as we come to discuss these revised Estimates, and I am quite sure they will be discussed in that way.</P>
      <P>For the rest, Deputy Haughey has attempted to add up what seemed to be his doubts about £50 million revenue buoyancy this year, £30 million savings on pay and £28.6 million on the other savings and to claim as a result of that rapid addition that there is a problem of £108 million as far as public finances are concerned this year.  There is not.  We have made provision for and set out in the Book of Estimates £23.9 million pay savings compared to the pre-budget situation and £34.5 million non-pay savings compared to the pre-budget situation, and the House will be aware that over the last two years we have certainly kept public expenditure both on pay and non-pay within the ranges we set out at budget time, and I have no doubt that we will do the same again this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as the revenue buoyancy figure is concerned, Deputy Haughey is attempting to forecast what the situation might be for the remainder of the year <Col N="2226" /> based on certain trends which he seemed to discern in the returns for the first quarter.  The statements that Deputy Haughey made are based on information to which I drew attention in the first quarter figures but, as I said on the publication of the first quarter figures, I have no reason to be other than confident that the budget target this year will be met and, as Deputy Haughey knows from his own experience, you cannot project a trend for the whole year from any one tax revenue figure or expenditure figure during the course of the first quarter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am grateful to the Minister for the information, but would it be in order to ask a technical question?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>In Cork the Taoiseach in dealing with this matter of revenue outcome did not quite agree with what the Minister has just said.  As far as I can gather he indicated that he would like to have the April and May figures before he would come to any conclusions, but on that occasion he made a reference to a monthly monitoring of the Exchequer position.  Could the Minister tell us if there is such a monitoring of income expenditure and can it be made public or made available to the House?  I hope the Minister understands what I am talking about.  It is a reference to what the Taoiseach said in Cork recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to parse and analyse statements made by the Taoiseach or Deputy Haughey's understanding of what was in that statement, it seems that it was perfectly in accord with what I said when I published the first quarter figures.  As I have said now, one cannot make a judgment on the trend of tax revenue under any heading on the basis of differences that appear to arise between the expectation for the first quarter and the outturn for the first quarter.  The first quarter of the year is particularly a quarter when a number of influences are at work, including the effect of budgetary changes.  What the <Col N="2227" /> Taoiseach said in Cork was that you could not draw conclusions from the first quarter figures, that he would want information for some further months before conclusions could be drawn as to what the outturn was likely to be compared to the budget targets.</P>
      <P>On the other question that Deputy Haughey has just raised, I carry out a monthly monitoring of the budget position for the purpose of carrying out my functions in that regard, and I would not think that it is the kind of information that I would wish to make public or that it would be proper or useful to make public.  It is part of the normal, day-to-day expenditure monitoring function that is carried out by me and my Department, which we have improved very substantially over the last couple of years and which I hope to improve still further for my benefit and that of my successors, whoever they might be.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, line 27, before &ldquo;fares&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;maximum&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to empower the Minister to fix maximum fares rather than simply to fix fares, rates or other charges.  It is important and goes to the root of the widespread opposition to this Bill, that this amendment should be made because it will get over some of the more obvious difficulties that the Bill is otherwise likely to create.</P>
      <P>At this stage I should mention some of the history of this Bill.  Eleven months have passed since this Bill was read a Second Time in this House.  On 27 June last we were informed there was a dire emergency, that there would be appalling consequences if the Bill, which was introduced at very short notice, was not passed within a matter of days.  We were told that it would have a disastrous effect on Aer Lingus particularly, and that all sorts of improper operations would take place if the Bill were not passed in a matter of days.  Happily those dire forebodings have not come to pass.  Here we are, 11 months later, beginning Committee Stage of this Bill which was so urgent last June that it was moved by a Minister of State in the absence in Japan of the Minister himself.  We are entitled to ask what was that so-called emergency? What was the serious loophole, as it was described, that the Bill had to plug and that if it were not plugged within a matter of days appalling things would happen? It is clear there was no such emergency, that there was no need for that legislation. I thought that after an interval of nearly 11 months the Government had got sense and had abandoned the Bill. They have a number of amendments put down&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>May I direct the Deputy's attention to the fact that we are on Committee Stage and he appears to <Col N="2230" /> be making a Second Stage speech.  We are on amendment No. 1 and related amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. 1 is one of the more fundamental amendments of the large number which are down to this Bill.  If the House were to accept that the Minister had power to fix maximum fares that would be perfectly satisfactory, in so far as this Bill can be satisfactory, because it would not prevent people charging less than the maximum. The Minister for Communications would then be in the same position as, for example, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who fixes maximum prices for a number of commodities but gives every encouragement to retailers and others to charge less than the maximum if they so desire.</P>
      <P>It is proposed in this Bill if this amendment is not accepted, to make it a crime to charge less than the maximum, the whole point being to keep prices up rather than get them down.  If the Minister is appointed personal honours and feels he has to go on with this rather foolish Bill, he would get over many of the difficulties he is creating and the foolishness associated with this Bill if he accepts this very simple amendment and accepts, as the prices legislation generally accepts, and as the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism accepts, that when certain prices are fixed they are maximum prices, not minimum prices or obligatory prices, we have the normal competition which is so essential, and which is recognised in virtually every field as being essential, but which is anathema to this Government, to the Department of Communications and to Aer Lingus. Increasingly it is becoming obvious to everyone connected with aviation in Europe that this element of competition will have to be encouraged to a much greater extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been developments since the last debate on this Bill in June 1984. At that time I mentioned the element of competition which had been brought in by the Anglo-Dutch agreement which reduced the ordinary return fare between <Col N="2231" /> London and Amsterdam to £49 sterling. I had a long argument in the House with the Minister of State who told me that was the one way fare.  He subsequently had the good grace to write to me privately telling me he was wrong and I was right, which might as well be put on the record now.  In addition to the Anglo-Dutch agreement, in terms of fixing maximum fares, we had the Anglo-German agreement which had the effect of very drastically reducing air fares between those two countries and the Anglo-Luxembourg agreement which had the same effect and has greatly reduced air fares between Britain and Luxembourg.</P>
    <P>Last autumn the Minister gave a press conference on air fares.  One of the things he said was that he looked forward to an Anglo-Irish free trade area agreement in relation to air fares and that he would like to see free trade on cross-channel routes between Britain and Ireland. When I read that, I said, &ldquo;Amen.  I would love to see that&rdquo;.  I would like to take this opportunity of inquiring when that will happen.  I would like to ask the Minister why he is proceeding with this Bill if it is his intention to try to bring about an Anglo-Irish free trade bi-lateral agreement to introduce full competition into cross-channel air fares.  The truth is not what the Minister said publicly, that was only said for the benefit of the press and the consumers; the truth is very different. We have to look at what has happened in relation to the fixing of fares on cross-channel routes since the beginning of this year.</P>
    <P>Early this year a well known and large independent airline, Dan-Air, proposed to introduce, and had the support of the British authorities, a return fare between Gatwick and Dublin of £80 sterling, roughly £95 Irish, and they proposed a similar fare on the route between Gatwick and Cork, where it received a considerable amount of encouragement because of the difficulties Cork is suffering in terms of access from Britain at the moment.  Negotiations started last January. Towards the end of March Dan-Air informed the people in the trade that <Col N="2232" /> their proposal to introduce this ordinary £80 sterling return fare was going to be dropped.  The reason given was that they had been threatened by Aer Lingus that they would be taken out of the booking computer if they persisted in trying to establish that fare on cross-Channel routes.  Aer Lingus control the pooled computer in respect of British-Irish bookings. Aer Lingus also threatened, if Dan-Air were to persist in their proposal, to refuse them all ground handling at Irish airports, which they also control.  This is a matter of some concern and I have a later amendment down on this.</P>
    <P>The result is that Dan-Air have withdrawn their proposals and they retain simply their ordinary one flight per day between Gatwick and Dublin, for which they have to charge the cartel price of £204.  The cartel consists of Aer Lingus and British Airways and anybody else who wants to operate on the routes can only do so providing the rules of the cartel are observed.  We must ask how many more tens of thousands of people would be coming by air to Dublin and Cork or Shannon if Dan-Air were allowed to do what they and the British Government want to do &mdash; to charge a reasonable cost-related fare rather than an exorbitant cartel-supported fare.  The purpose of this amendment is to allow people to do this if they wish.</P>
    <P>It cannot be suggested that the British Government in any way interfered with this proposal.  They gave it every encouragement and the public proof is that they have negotiated similar bilateral deals with Belgium, Germany, Holland and Luxembourg.  They are more than anxious to do so with Ireland, which has a fair amount of air traffic with Britain but not a great amount.  The significant point as the British see it, and as we should see it, is that the Irish air market is one of the few markets out of Britain that is not growing.  While there was 9 per cent growth overall last year in air traffic out of Britain, there was 18 per cent growth on the Amsterdam route because of the attractive fares introduced.</P>
    <P>It is interesting for those who cannot <Col N="2233" /> see beyond the end of their nose in their desires for protectionism to look at the CSO figures for traffic between Ireland and Britain and compare 1976 and 1983. One finds that in 1976 the airlines had 47 per cent of the traffic into and out of Ireland and Britain while sea transport had the remainder; in 1983 the airlines had only 38 per cent of the traffic and the sea services, which many people might think are no great shakes, had the remainder.  I wonder if people are cutting off their nose to spite their face.  Perhaps they will come to realise it.</P>
    <P>During the debate last June on the question of the establishing of fares and the preventing of people charging lower fares, much centred around the fare which Transamerica wanted to charge between New York and Shannon, to which exception was taken by the Minister, the Department and Aer Lingus because it was below the fixed fare established by IATA for the North Atlantic out of Shannon.  I said that the purpose of the Bill seemed to be to screw Transamerica to the greatest possible extent and forecast that there was a possibility that Transamerica would depart the scene and that the Irish national interest could only lose if that were to happen. What has happened because of these provisions in regard to minimum fares?  Transamerica have left.  It is not surprising. We will be told on behalf of Aer Lingus and the Minister that they were fly-by-nights and that they could not be relied upon.  They left because they were not allowed to charge the competitive fares which they would wish to charge.  Where are they now operating their scheduled service?  They are operating a scheduled service out of Belfast airport where nobody places any restrictions on them. As far as the Belfast, Northern Ireland and British authorities are concerned, the lower the fares they charge the better because they are generating more business for Belfast.  More power to Belfast that they have people with common sense.  Not alone do the Belfast people seek to facilitate Transamerica in every way they can but they seek to facilitate passengers from the Republic of Ireland <Col N="2234" /> since the Belfast airport authority are providing free buses to Dublin and any other parts of the Republic where there is demand for these services.  One can connect free with a Transamerica flight from Belfast.  That is an ordinary, sensible marketing ploy.  I congratulate the Belfast people on being sensible enough to do it.</P>
    <P>Look at the loss to this part of the country.  What have we gained by allowing this to happen and by sticking our heads in the sand, trying to pretend that this is not 1985 but 30 or 40 years ago and that IATA and cartels rule the world? They no longer do and the whole question of maximum fares, competition and so on is exercising the minds of many people throughout Europe, with effect in every country in Europe other than this country which has a greater need than any other in the European Community to have easy and cheap access to it because of its geographical location.</P>

I understand from my conversation with the Commission yesterday that there is unlikely to be an oral hearing until June, a decicion coming in autumn.  The cases are on all fours with the kind of situation we have here.  This is because a number of reputable airlines and reputable travel agencies in France charged less than the cartel price for certain journeys and were prosecuted by the public prosecutor in France for a breach of the French civil code.</P>
      <P>The defence made by the various defendants, who included people like Air France, KLM and British Airways, was that the particular provisions of the French civil code were in conflict with the provisions of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty establishing freedom of competition within the Common Market.  The French judge held that so far as he was concerned that was the case but he said he was not competent to give a decision on the validity of the particular provisions of the French civil code.  He said that the incompatability of these provisions with Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty would have to be decided by the European Court and he referred the case to the court for that purpose.  The European Court is hearing the case and I am advised that they will give a decision in the autumn.  If the decision of the French court is upheld the whole point that this amendment is seeking to establish will be made clear and, therefore, to go ahead with this Bill without this amendment will be a futile exercise because if the primacy of Articles 85 and 86 in relation to the regulation of civil aviation is upheld the legislation will fall.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since the five cases are precisely important one is entitled to inquire from <Col N="2236" /> the Minister as to what attitude he takes in the circumstances.  In particular one is entitled to inquire why the Irish Government did not avail of the opportunity presented to them in December last to appear as a party in these proceedings and to argue their case.  Are the Government of the opinion that they cannot sustain their case?  They received notice of the existence of the cases and were invited to join themselves as a party in the proceedings and argue the case if they so wished on the grounds that, one way or the other, they would be bound by the decision.  We will be bound willy nilly by the decision of the European Court and that is why the decision is entirely relevant to the whole question underlining this legislation and which in particular is encapsulated in the point I am trying to make by way of this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has made a wide ranging speech on this amendment. As you said, it was really a Second Stage speech but I do not propose to deal with what he has said in a Second Stage speech manner.  Suffice it to say that much of what Deputy O'Malley says is incorrect or slanted or is a misinterpretation of the facts.  His opinion would not be shared by the vast majority who know anything about air transport.  For instance, the Deputy referred to some Dan-Air fare of £80.  I assure him that there was never any question of a Dan-Air fare of £80 being proposed to me.  However, I can tell the Deputy that when the British authorities, of whom he has been fulsome in his praise, approved increases in air fares between Dublin and London, I, as the civil aviation authority here, was the one who refused the increase and forced them to introduce a lesser increase, a sub inflation increase.  That is merely one example of the persistent policy that has been pursued by me since becoming Minister.  Overall we have succeeded in the past few years in keeping increases in air fares below the inflation rate.  That, too, was the fairly consistent policy of my predecessors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fundamentally this question is about <Col N="2237" /> whether we as a State should have the same regulatory powers as every other civil aviation authority have.  All we are seeking to do is to maintain powers we always understood we had but which were brought into question because of a case in the courts elsewhere and which the courts decided not to determine for the time being.  In order to remove any doubt we introduced this Bill in June last. The fact of the Bill being tabled had the desired effect; but, if tomorrow we should decide not to go ahead with the Bill, all the dangers that have been outlined by me and by others in the past number of months would be realised. Therefore, it is of vital national importance that we proceed with the legislation.</P>
    <P>In his contributions on this legislation in recent months Deputy O'Malley has created the impression also that all other countries, particularly Britain, Holland and America, have abandoned their national interest and that we should follow their example and abandon our national interest.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  All these countries and many more have retained the same enabling powers as the powers we are seeking here.  The question that is important is the way in which those powers are exercised.  Deputy Wilson and all my other predecessors have used these powers in the national interest and I have followed those policies too, that is, a down pressure on air fares in so far as that is consistent with continuity of service.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley did not refer once to that factor, which is vital to this country's national interest.  I refer to a continuity of air service from our airports to major points east and west of the country.  That is what the Bill is all about.  One can argue as much as one wishes about air fares but the exercise would be futile if we had no air service.  There have been many fly-by-night operators in the airline industry.  Many have been allowed use routes after promising to provide a much cheaper service but they have collapsed leaving behind a lot of debris.  I can think offhand of Air National, Air Florida, Laker Airways and so on.  There were cheap flights into Belfast but some time <Col N="2238" /> ago the airline concerned collapsed with the result that Aer Lingus had to move to rescue many of the stranded passengers.  I know that is not what Deputy O'Malley is advocating, but it would be the result of what he is advocating.  His purpose is to keep air fares as low as possible.  All of us would concur with that but I fear that the Deputy has fallen for a lot of propaganda.  No other country has abandoned the kind of controls we are seeking in this legislation.  No other country has abandoned its national interest and I have no intention of doing so either.</P>
    <P>Acceptance of the amendment and the associated amendments would be tantamount to introducing a de-regulation of fares.  In other words, to accept the amendments would render it illegal to sell fares at prices higher than the approved levels.  There would be no controls on the levels at which fares were sold.  There would not be any protection against predatory prices and we all know that in the airline industry down through the years there have been predators, fly-by-nights who claimed to have been able to provide the service at cheaper rates but who within a short time of beginning operations hiked up the fares and in many cases collapsed or withdrew from business. That is what has happened to some extent in the case of Transamerica.  They have withdrawn.  We could never depend on the Transamericas, the Pan-Ams, the TWAs or British Airways to service this country in all circumstances.  They will go wherever suits them best and Transamerica have since left this country.  To some extent, Deputy O'Malley blames this Bill for their departure.  I will quote what Susan Hamilton said in <i>Business and Finance</i> on 21 February 1985:</P>
    <P>After five years, the service has been terminated because Transamerica could not generate sufficient business out of Ireland due to the strength of the dollar.  We were going only for 20 per cent of the business to originate in Ireland but our forecasts said that we would not make it.  We were getting $200 a seat less from Irish travellers than from the Americans.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2239" /> She denied categorically that the pullout decision had anything to do with the Irish Government's hostility expressed in the controversial Air Transport Bill.</P>
    <P>Transamerica were allowed by me to charge fares significantly lower than those charged by Aer Lingus and by Northwest Orient.  There was no question of them being forced to charge Aer Lingus fares, they had a competitive edge as they were allowed to charge less and yet they withdrew.  The strongest advocates of change in Europe &mdash; I include the British and Dutch governments &mdash; are not seeking the kind of change which Deputy O'Malley proposes in this amendment.  Similarly, the EC Commission, in its memorandum No. 2, accept that deregulation, US style, is not suitable for Europe.  None of the proposals tabled by the Commission goes anywhere near as far as Deputy O'Malley's amendment seeks to do.</P>
    <P>I am as much an advocate of strong competition as anyone else in the House but I have no intention of contemplating a regulatory regime which might on the surface have attractions, especially from the consumer point of view, but which would mean abandoning all controls with the dangers which I have already mentioned. I do not believe that such an approach would be in the best national interests.</P>
    <P>Aviation is regulated by means of various multilateral and bilateral treaties. A regime along the lines proposed by Deputy O'Malley would breach Ireland's treaty obligations with other countries and could not be introduced unilaterally. Deputy O'Malley obviously ignored this point in tabling this and other amendments. He quoted me as saying at a press conference which I gave some months ago that I was in favour of an Anglo-Irish free trade area.  What I proposed and put to the British Secretary of State for Transport is the concept of a free air zone incorporating the two islands.  I mentioned that to Mr. Ridley on a couple of occasions and we intend pursuing that concept with the British.  However, when it comes to opening up the airways, the <Col N="2240" /> British, no more than any other country, will not act against their national interests. For example, Aer Lingus used to have fifth freedom rights out of Manchester when nobody else was serving these routes and they spent a lot of money in developing the routes to Amsterdam, Copenhagen and so on.  When these routes became profitable Aer Lingus were not allowed to operate them any more.  Similarly, when Aer Lingus had fifth freedom rights from Lourdes to Rome they developed the route at enormous expense, but as soon as they had done so the French would not let them operate it.  The same happened with the Italians and the Swiss on the Geneva-Milan route.</P>
    <P>I urge Deputy O'Malley to take into account that there is an awful lot of propaganda regarding airlines.  Take the £49 fare from London to Amsterdam, which he rightly said is a return fare and about which there was a mistake made by the Minister of State in the Second Stage debate.  That fare is very restricted. There is also a fare of £60 on the Dublin-London route which is also very restricted and which, on a per mile basis is cheaper than the London-Amsterdam fare, but we do not hear anything about that.  Of course, Aer Lingus and the other airlines involved did not put out much propaganda about it compared to the ballyhoo surrounding the £49 affair between London and Amsterdam.  I should like to ask Deputy O'Malley if it is a fact that the Dublin-London restricted fare is cheaper on a per mile basis than the London-Amsterdam restricted fare.  It is important that we have these powers which are, in essence, reserve powers and that we use them in the interests of the country overall, taking into account the air traveller, the needs of tourism, the need for industrial and economic development and, above all, the need to ensure continuity of air services.  I oppose the amendment.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that we did what we did on 27 June, which I remember very well because it was domestically a traumatic day for me, because if the <Col N="2241" /> court case had been allowed to continue they could not possibly have delayed for 11 months in giving a final and substantive decision on what the Minister put before it.  One of the factors that must be taken into account is the huge amount of propaganda launched and Aer Lingus suffered as a result.  The biggest file I ever amalgamated in any Department was on this matter and it was obvious that the propaganda was well funded.  I read it all looking in the granary of self-interest for a grain which would be in the public interest. Nevertheless, one's view on various amendments would be coloured by the reference to Dan-Air.  Deputy O'Malley made one statement, the Minister made another and I should like the matter to be fully clarified for the House because so many other amendments are connected with the truth of the matter.  One statement was made and another categorically denied it and it must be clarified before we go any further.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any conflict.  We certainly did not receive any such proposal from Dan-Air as suggested by Deputy O'Malley.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to clarify the situation for the benefit of Deputy Wilson and others.  The Minister said here today that he did not receive such a proposal from Dan-Air and I believe that is true.  It never got as far as the Minister because Aer Lingus clobbered it beforehand. They told Dan-Air that if they formally submitted such a proposal they would be taken out of the computer and deprived of ground services here.  That has been well known for the past month or more in the trade and among people who deal with these matters.  It was also known to various State bodies who were heartened to hear of this proposal from Dan-Air and who are now naturally bitterly disappointed that it is not coming to fruition.  Anything that the Minister said has not conflicted with what I said.  He simply said he did not get a formal proposal to that effect and I accept that he did not.  I have no doubt that he is telling the truth in that respect.  It never got to <Col N="2242" /> the stage of a formal proposal.  It was clobbered through the means I have described before it got to that stage.</P>
      <P>I shall not reply to some of the selective points the Minister made in response to what I said in moving the amendment.  I spoke about many things but the Minister did not reply to them for one reason or another.  I made some notes on what he said.  He said that the introduction of this Bill has had the desired effect.  He did not say what the desired effect was but it is fairly clear from the circumstances surrounding the introduction of the Bill, immediately after he had failed in court cases against Transamerica, that the desired effect of the Bill was to get Transamerica out of this country.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>He did not specify what the desired effect was but said that the desired effect had happened.  That is the major single event which is relevant to this Bill which has happened since the Bill was introduced on 27 June.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that Transamerica made a statement to the effect that they were getting out of here because they were not able to generate sufficient business. If that is the case why are they going to Belfast where clearly they will generate substantially less business than they would have from the Republic?  It does not seem to gel.  The public statements made from time do not always accord with the underlying truth but sometimes they have to be said for the sake of keeping the lines of communication open and so on.  The underlying truth about this matter is that the regime in Northern Ireland so far as air transport and civil aviation is concerned is far more open and liberal and far less restrictive than it is here.  Their prospects of generating business are much less&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not interrupt the Minister so perhaps he would allow me to reply to some of the points he made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2243" /> He told the House that as well as not disapproving of the £80 sterling fare proposed by Dan-Air he reduced the fare proposed by the cartel on the cross-channel route, the British Airways-Aer Lingus cartel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>And Dan-Air.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>He reduced it from £208 to £204.  I suppose we should thank him for that.  It would be far more useful if he created a climate here which would ensure that companies like Dan-Air and others who want to offer realistic cost-related fares were free to do so and were not pushed away by the means which were used to push them away.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that I fell for propaganda. It is remarkable that no legislation has ever generated such a highpowered and expensive public relations campaign for support to get it through as this Bill did for several weeks.  It was not just a once off effort but for three or four consecutive weeks there was open house in Buswells Hotel with lunches and chats with senior people from Aer Lingus for every Member of this House and presumably also for every Senator.  Needless to say there was the best of food and wine, and hang the expense, in order to get their point across.  When the Minister talks about propaganda he should look at where it came from.  People who object to this country being dragged down and kept out of the mainstream of movement in air transport are accused of falling for propaganda.  The facts are otherwise. Apart from the lavish entertainment put on for several weeks in Buswells Hotel the amount of material sent out by Aer Lingus was quite remarkable.  They employed a public relations firm specifically for the purpose of generating a climate of public opinion in support of the Bill.  That is very unusual.  One would like to know what it will all cost.  Estimates have been made that it cost tens of thousands of pounds.  I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister asked me whether I would say if the £49 sterling return fare between London and Amsterdam was <Col N="2244" /> dearer per mile than what he described as the IR£69 return fare between Dublin and London.  I will give him the answer and also demonstrate to him how foolish he is to get into these figures and how easily one can mislead people by making these comparisons.  Almost certainly on a per mile basis the £69 fare between Dublin and London is cheaper than the £49 sterling fare between London and Amsterdam.  The Minister described them both as restrictive fares.  He is correct. They are both restrictive fares but let us look at the degree of restriction. The only restriction on the London-Amsterdam fare or any British-Dutch fare &mdash; I believe there are cheaper fares between Gatwick and Maastricht &mdash; is that one has to buy the ticket the day before.  One can travel any day one wants and come back any day one wants but one must buy the ticket the day before from the airline and not from a travel agent.  That is the only restriction.  The result has been that a huge proportion of traffic between Britain and Holland use that fare.  That is why there has been such a huge increase in traffic between Holland and Britain.  Both sides are delighted and their national interests are served by it because each country has many more tourists.</P>
    <P>The Minister knows he is not comparing like with like.  The Minister gave a lecture in his infamous Ferenka speech when he devoted all nine pages of his text at a transport dinner in Limerick last October to abusing me and told us we should compare like with like.</P>
    <P>Let us look at what is described as the restrictive fare between Dublin and London.  Up to recently Aer Lingus did not even bother to advertise it.  It is so restrictive that virtually no one uses it. It is available only in winter and only on a Saturday.  One would have to go out on a Saturday and either come back on the same day or the following day.  One cannot wait until the following Saturday or come back on any day of the following week.  You can only go out on a Saturday. As a result hardly anybody uses it.  The only person who would use it is somebody <Col N="2245" /> who had to go to a dinner, or a show, or something like that in London on a Saturday night and wanted to come home the following day.  Very few people who want to go to London for social purposes want to come back the following day.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely useless to businessmen because you cannot do any business on a Saturday night or a Sunday morning and that is the only available time to you. Nothing is open except theatres, restaurants, and so on.  I inquired from Aer Lingus what proportion of their passengers on that route use it and the answer was 1 per cent.  On the other hand, the proportion of passengers between Holland and Britain using the £49 fare has grown to something like 25 per cent and perhaps it is up to 30 per cent now.  It will probably be 50 per cent in the course of 1985.</P>
    <P>There is no way that the £69 fare, the Saturday night fare, the Saturday night special, or whatever one wants to call it, will ever go above 1 per cent because hardly anybody wants to use it.  Therefore, the short answer to the Minister's question is that it is probably cheaper per mile if you can get the £69 fare, but who wants to fly on it?  It is pointless to make an argument based on something like that which, in practical terms, is quite useless. If Aer Lingus were to introduce a £69 fare on the same basis and with the same restrictions as operate between London and Amsterdam, I am sure the British would agree to it.  If they agree to it to Amsterdam, there is no reason why they would not agree to it to Dublin, to Cork, or to Shannon.  We would love to see it.  Instead of falling air traffic numbers across the Irish Sea, we would have increased numbers at long last.  We would love to see an increase.  Everywhere else in Europe is having an increase.  This country is not and its airports are not.  It must be pretty frustrating for Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks about the national interest not being served if this amendment were accepted.  All this amendment does is to say that the Minister shall fix the maximum fares the same as the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism fixes maximum prices of various <Col N="2246" /> things.  Happily it has been found, as a result of competition in recent years, that it has been possible to decontrol some prices.  People were prepared to compete.  I remember I used to fix the maximum price of bread.  It was put to me that supermarkets and shopkeepers were operating genuine competition in regard to the price of bread and it was suggested to me in 1982, I think, that I should decontrol the price of bread and not fix a maximum price.</P>
    <P>I did that.  We did not fix the price of bread and anybody could charge anything they liked for bread.  The price of bread dropped significantly in real terms since. The present Minister has been able to do that in respect of a few other commodities. Where there is not sufficient competition and where he retains the power to fix prices, he fixes maximum prices.  What is wrong with fixing maximum prices for airline tickets?  Every other country does it.  Why do we not do it?  Our Department of Communications are writing letters to people saying they cannot approve of their fares because they are too low and they should increase them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am inviting the Minister by means of this amendment to introduce into this company the same kind of situation <i>vis-á-vis</i> Britain, America and any other country he wants to name, as the British have introduced between their country and several others: Holland, Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg; and they are having discussions with Italy and some other countries with a view to arriving at similar arrangements.  The Minister will not get out of it by using the kind of tactics to which he is now reducing himself.</P>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity, if I may, to try to put an end to the nonsense which it suggests that, if you do not deal with certain types of airlines and keep your fares up to the maximum, you will not have continuity of service and certain people will pull out, and so on.  I inquired at Shannon Airport recently as to what was the factor of difference between their February business and their August business. The factor of difference is 11.  They have 11 times more traffic in August than in February.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's fatuous suggestion about continuity is that we should have people who are prepared to be there all the year round.  If he understood the commercial aspects of the operation he would realise that those who are willing to stay there all the year round are very glad that the others get off, because there is no business in the winter.  There is enough for one only.  Otherwise one airline would be forced into a position where they would have to provide all the equipment for peak demand in months like July and August.  They do not have to do that because others are there who take part of that peak demand.  This helps the main airline involved because they are able to avoid a situation in which they would otherwise have to provide and maintain over a 12 month period equipment which would not be used at all for six, seven or eight months.  This argument which is constantly trotted out about continuity <Col N="2248" /> and that everyone has to have continuity does not stand up in economic or commercial operations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with the last point first.  This illustrates the absurdity of Mr. O'Malley's position.  He is a Deputy for Limerick who should have a vital interest in Shannon Airport, as we all have.  He has made the absurd point that of course you should not expect commercial interests to provide an all-year-round service because business is not there in the off peak months.  That is the very point.  It is vital to our national interest and to industrial development that we should have an all-year-round service. Aer Lingus have to provide that service and they have to charge fares which average out over the year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy does not understand the argument.  There has to be a fare which takes into account the fact that there is such low demand in the winter and that there are such small numbers.  It is easy for an airline to come in for the three peak months of the year and say they can charge a fare 100 dollars cheaper than Aer Lingus.  Aer Lingus have to carry the can for the other nine months.  At that price Aer Lingus are losing a fortune on the Atlantic, as are almost all national carriers on the Atlantic. I should also say that the fares into Shannon from the New York and Boston gateways compared with London on average are about 100 dollars cheaper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry if I appear hard on Deputy O'Malley but we cannot afford nationally to have services in the peak months of the summer only and no continuity of service during the winter.  How would Deputy O'Malley have managed as Minister for Industry, which he was for many years, if there had not been this vital connection during the winter months?  Who would pay for it?  We hear all this criticism of Aer Lingus.  Has the Deputy ever thought about the burden Aer Lingus have carried in providing a <Col N="2249" /> national service which is totally uncommercial? Deputy O'Malley has made the astounding assertion that many other countries allow what he is proposing in these amendments &mdash; the fixing of maximum fares.  I asked him to name one country and he has not so done.  There is none.</P>

      <P>That is not so with regard to Britain.  Deputy O'Malley has illustrated his lack of knowledge in this area.  Every country retains precisely the powers which we are seeking in this Bill. What matters is how we use these powers, which other countries use. Deputy Wilson was Minister for eight or nine months and there were other Fianna Fáil predecessors in that office.  All Ministers of all Governments have used these powers, powers they always thought we had with regard to previous legislation, in the national interest, as far as possible keeping down the pressure on air fares.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Malley has said enough about his amendments.  He has illustrated that he does not know what he is talking about.  I defy him to name one country which does what he is proposing here.</P>

      <P>What is the normal procedure for an air company which want to fly in and have tariffs or fares approved? Is that application made through Aer Lingus?  This is in reference to what has been said here about Dan-Air.  It is not my purpose to raise any matter in order to fatten the dividends for the directors and owners of Dan-Air, particularly because of what happened with regard to this country and the fifth freedom rights. How could Dan-Air, if they were seriously thinking about a service, process it through Aer Lingus?  Surely the protocol would be to make application direct to the Department?  That is as I read it and I am totally puzzled by this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2250" /> I know what has been done with regard to the fifth freedom and markets developed by Aer Lingus.  I have no ambition to fatten the cheques for the owners of Dan-Air or the newly privatised British Airways or anyone else at the expense of Aer Lingus or of this country.  What is the protocol if you want to have a fare established?  Is it done through Aer Lingus or through the Minister?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer is that every airline is free to go direct to the Department.  However, there are circumstances when they can deal with Aer Lingus and <i>vice versa.</i> That depends entirely on themselves.  Deputy O'Malley talked about the £49 return fare London to Amsterdam.  I was sure that he was wrong but before I said anything I checked and I have an official statement. He talked about that £49 London-Amsterdam fare being available on 20 and 25 per cent of the traffic and soon to be on 50 per cent.  As part of the agreement between the two carriers, this is restricted to 5 per cent.  I ask the Deputy please to stop making non-factual assertions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposed to Deputy O'Malley's amendment because it is trying to bring into this small country of ours &mdash; an island nation off an island off the mainland of Europe &mdash; a set of regulations which does not appear in any other country in the world.  This whole proposal, I regret to say, appears to be a vindictive attack on Aer Lingus.  Having listened to the Deputy's contribution here today I am confirmed in that view. I regret to say that because Deputy O'Malley is a man for whose ability I have considerable personal regard, <Col N="2251" /> having served with and under him in the Department for approximately three years.  The level of his feeling against Aer Lingus was portrayed when he spoke in a scathing manner of the attempt by Aer Lingus to inform the Members of this House, through a legitimate lobbying exercise during the course of this debate, about exactly what was involved.</P>
      <P>That was a much belated attempt by Aer Lingus to try to correct the propaganda exercise that had been engaged in by Transamerica and others of their ilk and some of their cohorts in this country. Massive sums of money had been spent on a misinformation campaign by Transamerica and some of their agents here to try to hoodwink the Members of the House about what exactly was involved in this Bill and by the fallacious arguments which we have heard in regard to the £49 fare and other items.  Aer Lingus rightly responded by informing the Members of this House &mdash; and not by a propaganda exercise.  They gave the Members a forum at which they could ask at the highest level, chief executive level, any question they wished of the management of Aer Lingus about their operations and fares.  I was present at one of those sessions in which all sorts of questions were asked about the fares between Dublin-London, London-Amsterdam, Belfast-London, fares across the Atlantic, New York-Buffalo fares.  All these questions were answered in a reasonable and balanced way, showing the relevant exact per mile fares.  They also gave comparisons city by city per mile.  A slur has been cast on this legitimate and correct attempt by Aer Lingus, our national airline.  It should be the duty of the Members of this House as far as possible to protect our own national interest.  Our airline had to inform the Members of this House in an open, fair, free question and answer session about the misinformation which had been pumped into the system by Transamerica and some of their allies here to damage our national interest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is a nice, seductive argument which can be made and sounds smooth with regard to the consumer interests, <Col N="2252" /> that we should have fares of £40 or £50 from here to London and so forth.  I would like that and so would everybody else.  I am sure that the Minister would be delighted if we could have such airfares on every plane leaving Dublin for London.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would, of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>The reality is that you cannot have that.  There must be some regulatory powers which will give the Minister of the day the pressure to promote downward prices but without affecting the continuity of service which is so essential in the commercial and national interests of this country.</P>
      <P>We have heard much of the Dan-Airs and Transamericas and all that they were going to do for Ireland.  We were told that the arguments on behalf of our national airlines were from Neanderthal men who were talking 30 or 40 years back in air transport.  They talked about freedom of the air for the Dan-Airs who pose as the liberal, consumer interest protectors.  Let us look back on the record.  The same arguments were made 20 and 30 years ago &mdash; that if we could only have TWA and Pan-Am flying direct into Dublin there would be no difficulty, we would have millions of American tourists visiting here.  This was a propaganda exercise which went on for a number of years. These companies were eventually let in and within a couple of years they were gone again, having done the damage which they did to our own national airline. They did not bring in millions of people.  Aer Lingus carry out the hard slog for 12 months of the year across the Atlantic and on the European routes. They are doing the job and the others cannot compete or compare with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We heard the same seductive arguments 25 years ago and now we are hearing them again.  We heard them about Air Florida, but they went bust, and this time last year we heard all about Transamerica, but they pulled out.  At the moment Transamerica are doing charters into Belfast but they are not involved in scheduled services.  They are also doing <Col N="2253" /> charters into Shannon.  What happens to the ordinary day-by-day standard regulation flight out of Dublin or Shannon if we accept this nice seductive argument about the consumers?  Certainly it makes good copy and it reads well to bash another semi-State body, but that is not what this Parliament should be about.  We should not be bowing our knee to every damn breeze that passes by.  We should stand up and protect our own national interest. That is the function of this House.</P>
    <P>I refuse to accept the argument that if we put in the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; that will mean that the hands of the Minister will be tied in such a way that the consumer will win.  That looks nice but we must realise the consumer wins in two ways; he wins on prices and on services.  It was said that thankfully we have seen the end of IATA as a cartel.  IATA were not just about prices.  That organisation were set up to deal with the safety provided for passengers.  They were established to ensure that we would not have two-bit airlines flying the world with no controls, safety regulations or standards.  They were set up to protect the safety interests of passengers as well as to bring some reason and organisation into air fares. We heard about air fares across the Atlantic.  In the past ten years since Laker came and went we have had nothing short of a blood bath, with none of the airlines making money.  This Government, in order to maintain a national airline throughout the winter, had to provide a financial allowance to Aer Lingus.  When we were in Government we introduced the measure, it was implemented by the Coalition and it continued for the past few years.</P>
    <P>There has been enough bashing of Aer Lingus.  We have had enough of the seductive arguments on behalf of multinationals. They will come and go when it suits them, with no responsibility towards or respect for our national interests.  The argument reads well and makes good copy.  It is popular with certain elements of the media, but our national interest would be severely damaged if we were depending for our communications with the outside world on airlines such as <Col N="2254" /> Transamerica, Dan-Air and many of the other fly-by-nights that come and go.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I find myself in agreement with many of the comments of my North County Dublin colleague.  Deputy O'Malley may be an expert in a number of areas and he told the Minister to compare like with like.  I say to the Deputy he must practise what he preaches.  He made great play of the fact that Transamerica have pulled out of the South but, as Deputy Burke rightly pointed out, they are still operating charters here.  Deputy O'Malley emphasised that they find it lucrative to operate out of Belfast.  What they are operating in Belfast is an 11-weeks service from 11 July to 22 September. That is just too bad if I want to travel from Belfast on 9 July or 24 September. Deputy O'Malley is falling into his own trap when he implied that Transamerica have gone to the North to run a scheduled service because of the fact that there are much more desirable market forces there.</P>
      <P>To anyone flying in and out of the country Deputy O'Malley's argument is, on the surface seductive.  Obviously it is a pro-consumer argument but I think it is very lopsided.  Of course it would be a great help to consumers if we could keep air fares down to a certain level but we also have an obligation to the carriers and to the people running the service.  We must ensure that the fares charged are economical and that they will allow them to continue to operate.</P>
      <P>On 31 December 1984 there was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by a Melvin Brenner, an aviation industry consultant based in Wall Street.  He gives a fair assessment of what deregulation has done in the United States.  He made the following comment:</P>
      <P>From the distance of 3,500 miles, the public perception in Ireland is probably that deregulation has meant a low fare bonanza for the US consumer of air travel.  That perception is understandable since there have, in fact, been some spectacular bargains these past few years...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2255" /> However, he spells out clearly that deregulation is a two-edged sword.  In his amendment Deputy O'Malley is taking just one edge of the sword and forgetting that there is a second edge.  The Deputy is implying that if the Minister fixes maximum prices everything will be rosy, but that would bring about chaos such as we have seen on previous occasions, with travel agents going to the wall leaving the Government with the responsibility of bringing people home, with the help of Aer Lingus.  Deputy O'Malley's argument is one-sided, but he is far too experienced a Deputy not to realise there is another side.  Perhaps he does not want to put that side today.</P>
    <P>We must protect the services.  There is no point in having a service that costs £40 if it does not suit people, particularly business people who may have to fly at certain times.  Business people need to have a regular service, even if they have to pay more for it.  If carriers come in and develop a service people will get dependent on it.  Then, when it transpires that the prices are too low to be economical the passengers find themselves left high and dry.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley attacked Aer Lingus on their efforts to inform Deputies.  I am not going to get into an argument about the rights or wrongs of any group who wish to inform Deputies.  However, I must point out that we were also inundated with forms signed by supposedly thousands of consumers.  A lot of money was spent by the other side also in trying to tell people why the Bill should not be passed.  We should play fair and put both sides of the argument.  I do not know how many forms I got from people whom I am quite sure never read the Bill and had not the vaguest idea of what it was about. These people went to their travel agents to buy tickets for Majorca or elsewhere and this kind of form was shoved under their noses.  They were told to sign it and send it back to their TD or to their local representative.  I do not regard that as a proper exercise in public relations; I would much prefer the Aer Lingus <Col N="2256" /> method.  Many banks and private companies now realise that it is their job to inform public representatives so that they can make relevant contributions to debate here.  Therefore, I oppose this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like an opportunity of replying briefly to some of the things that have been said, to reply, unhappily, not so much to what was actually said but to its tone.  It is terribly unfortunate that any debate on a topic like this, it appears to me, reduces itself very rapidly into personal terms.  One is not allowed debate the merits or demerits of a more liberal or more restrictive air transport policy here, or more liberal access or restrictive access to the country. The whole thing is immediately painted in terms of whether one is for Aer Lingus or against them.  One is then accused of waging a personal vendetta and in Deputy Raphael Burke's words, of being &ldquo;vindictive&rdquo;, of being contrary to the national interest, because Deputy Burke and some other people make the serious error of thinking that the national interest equals the Aer Lingus interest.  I have sought to preach that that is not so.  The national interest is some delicate balance whereby a whole lot of factors must be taken into account.  It is not as black and white or as simplistic as Deputy Burke and some others would have us believe &mdash; that if things are right from Aer Lingus's point of view, therefore things are right from Ireland's point of view and, if one is attacking Aer Lingus, therefore one is attacking Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should look at a couple of figures that are relevant to the national interest. What is the national interest?  The national interest is the good of as many people in this country as possible, of every county, not just of a small group of people living on the north side of County Dublin or wherever.  That is not the national interest.  In this context the primary thing in which the national interest consists is the number of tourists brought in here.  Tourism is of enormous benefit <Col N="2257" /> to us and is dependent on access, transport, a lot of which in practice is dependent on air transport.  I want to quote some figures &mdash; which are not Aer Lingus figures, Transamerican figures, Dan-Air figures or anybody's else's &mdash; but published in the <i>Irish Statistical Bulletin,</i> by the Central Statistics Office, showing the number of overseas tourists who came here from Britain by air for the years 1975 to 1983 inclusive.  The 1984 figures, as I understand it, are not yet available from the CSO.  These figures are for genuine tourists, not for business types, not for residents coming back or people going to visit close relatives and so on. For the year 1975 the figure was 147,000, in 1976, 104,000, for 1977, 126,000, for 1978, 139,000, 1979, 126,000, 1980, 105,000, 1981, 81,000, 1982, 77,000 and for 1983, 76,000.  The 1983 figure of tourists coming to this country from Britain by air is just about half that of what it was in 1975.  That is a very serious matter. The best way by far to counteract that trend, there are other things one can do too, but the most important single one is to make it attractive to fly here and have competitive fares.</P>
    <P>It is tragic that the number of tourists travelling by air from Britain to Ireland, according to the CSO, has halved in that eight year period.  That is tragic and the national interest is losing out.  Indeed, every bit of Ireland loses by that because these people would spread out all over the country when they come here and they cannot spread out if they do not come.  That is the kind of situation in which the national interest is concerned. It is not these localised, specialised pleadings we hear and which are turned into personalised attacks on individual Deputies or other people because they take a certain point of view.  I know what this is from June last because it was reported to me many times what individual people were saying about me, that I was &ldquo;interfering with&rdquo;, &ldquo;anti-Aer Lingus&rdquo;, and so on.  That is one of the penalties one has to pay if one tries to stand up and analyse the thing from the broadest point of view as to what is in this country's interest.</P>
    <P>I am usually accused of making a <Col N="2258" /> special pleading for Shannon.  I will leave Shannon out of it for the moment.  At present in Cork severe difficulties are being encountered.  I invite any Cork Deputies who may be listening to contemplate the severe difficulties that arise, apart from industrial closures and everything else, on the tourist side, because of the close down or abandonment of a ferry from Britain to Cork &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>In terms of air services to Cork I will explain the background of some of the difficulties.  There was a possibility earlier this year of an attractive air fare to Cork.  At present it is extremely expensive.  Without going into detail on things that might not be directly relevant here, that has not come about. We are told by the Minister, by Deputy Raphael Burke and others that the national interest has thereby been protected because fly-by-nights, as they are called, have been kept out of this country, horrible, commercial people who have the temerity to be in business, to make money and support themselves, horrible commercial people like that who try to be efficient.  Those horrible fly-by-nights have been kept out of this country and therefore the national interest has been served.  I query that and I am entitled to query it.  Would the national interest not be at least equally well served if there were another 50,000 tourists in west Cork and south Kerry this year?  Does that matter at all?  Does the fact that hotels <Col N="2259" /> are closing down all over the place matter at all?  Do they not count in terms of the national interest?</P>
      <P>One would think we were in an enormous growth market.  I have figures here for passenger movements from Irish airports which show there has been no growth at all over the past six or seven years.  The figures are almost the same, hardly any difference.  We are about the only country in Europe that is not showing any growth.  British growth last year was 9 per cent overall.  As far as I can remember in some continental countries it was somewhat higher.  Give or take we have had in or about the same figure every year for the last six or seven years. Our national interest is not served by the fact that we are not increasing the number of people coming into the country, our national interest is losing.  We must look after Aer Lingus, certainly, but we must realise that there is more to Ireland and Ireland's national interest than Aer Lingus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One would think I was the only person in this country who questioned this. Although I have a lot of papers with me I cannot find a particular cutting which I cut out at the time.  It must be in another file.  There was an interview reported in <i>The Irish Times</i> business page on a Tuesday in September last with Mr. Martin Dully, the chief executive of Aer Rianta. I have no doubt the Minister has read that interview.  Members of the House generally should read it and see what he had to say because it is somewhat of a revelation.  He worked for Aer Lingus for, I think, a quarter of a century.  Aer Lingus are today his biggest customer in his position as chief executive to Aer Rianta.  I will not repeat some of what he said but it is worth reading that article; it is worth reading his views on what he believes to be the mistaken approach in relation to air transport and the regulation of civil aviation here, and his views as to huge increases that could be brought about if we got ourselves more into line in our thinking with what is happening on the ground throughout Europe, if we were less protectionist in our attitude and <Col N="2260" /> if we had a broader and more real definition of the national interest.  Some of the words he used are far stronger than anything I have said.  His experience is far greater than mine or than anyone else's in this House and far greater than any civil servant in the Department of Communications.  He knows where the national interest lies and he is very distressed by the air transport policies that have evolved.  It is obvious, although he does not mention this Bill by name, that he is very critical of the trend which this Bill epitomises and that he is very disturbed by it.  If this Bill is persisted with we will be out on a limb to an even greater extent.</P>
    <P>The success of Mr. Peter Sutherland as Commissioner for Competition, since his appointment a short time ago has been very heartening.  He has given a lot of his time to looking at the question of competition or the lack of it in European air transport.  An article in this week's <i>Economist</i> is very pertinent to this whole question and Deputies would do well to read it.  Mr. Sutherland is not setting out to damage the Irish national interest or any other national interest; he is trying to develop Europe, to get Europe into the real world and to stop the nonsense that has been part and parcel of air transport to Europe up to very recently.</P>
    <P>Deputies might also read an article in <i>Community Report</i> which is the Irish EC magazine, the issue of October/November 1984, on page 14.  The article is by Mr. F. Sorensen, head of the air transport division of the European Commission. That article is most revealing and it demonstrates pretty clearly the European air fares generally are very substantially higher than they are in other parts of the world, particularly in the US. It also demonstrates that between 1978 and 1983 the rate of increase in European air fares is out of all proportion to increases anywhere else and out of all proportion to the increases in the consumer price index in the various European countries during that time.  Why is it that of 90 given routes between the capitals of Europe prices increased by less than the consumer price index in <Col N="2261" /> only four and increased by more than the consumer price index and in many cases more than double the consumer price index on the other 86 routes?</P>
    <P>Mr. Sutherland, Mr. Sorensen and others whom I have mentioned are people whose business it is to deal with these matters.  They, no more than I, do not have a vindictive attitude towards anyone.  They are prepared to put forward reasoned arguments in relation to this.  People like Commissioner Sutherland and Mr. Sorensen say that what is happening in Europe cannot be allowed to continue, that it is grossly unfair to Europeans generally and that of all Europeans it is most unfair to us, because we are suffering most.  But, we are doing it by our own hand.  The European Court are considering this French judgment now which says that French legislation of this time is invalid because it conflicts with Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty of Rome.  At the very time when the European Court are hearing the case, we are trying to copperfasten the very thing that everyone else in Europe is sweeping aside.</P>
    <P>Would not the national interest be served if our national airline were to do the kind of things that, for example, among others Mr. Martin Dully suggested they do, if they were not to look inward all the time and if they did not take up this constant protectionist attitude, but went out to get more and more people in?  When I was speaking on this before I gave an example which unhappily remains perfectly valid now.  It is very much bound up with the national interest that I am accused of damaging.  I gave an example of an aeroplane flying to Ireland with a capacity of 200 seats and the only Irish airline would prefer to sell 100 of these seats at $200 per seat rather than sell the 200 seats at $100 per seat.  The revenue is the same, but look at the difference it would make to this country if empty seats were filled, even if half the empty seats coming in here were filled up.</P>
    <P>Can we not broaden our view to see that the national interest is more than just one company?  A company has not <Col N="2262" /> the right to assert, as they have done and as has been done here through Deputies contributions, that its incorporate welfare is the only thing that matters and that that is the same thing as the national interest.  It clearly is not.  Will we grow up enough in this House and outside of it to realise that when someone genuinely argues these matters and tries to underline the national interest, we can react to it in a somewhat more adult fashion than simply describing him as anti-Aer Lingus and personalising matters in a way that is utterly unhelpful and only brings arguments of this kind to a useless conclusion.</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy O'Malley on using the Legislature properly in fulfilling his role as a TD and on helping the rest of us to fulfil our roles as TDs.  All legislation should be properly examined going through the House.  The Bill would not have got that examination were it not for the interventions of Deputy O'Malley.  All Deputies, when considering legislation here, should listen to rational arguments and reasoned discussion rather than curling themselves up in shells and hurling abuse at each other.  I do not think any of us have anything to fear.  It is the public interest that we should be concerned about.</P>
      <P>I did not hear Deputy O'Malley's entire contribution but I should like to point out that the Aer Lingus briefing, attended by me, was a good and useful exercise.  Aer Lingus were as entitled as anybody else to hold such a briefing.  I would like to see some type of consumer body in every area of monopoly, in areas such as communal television and so on, where the consumer does not have an opportunity to go to another competitive source.  I would like to see consumers given the same right of approach to Members and having an organised input into this type of legislation.  In my view that is the kind of thinking that will come about.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it is very difficult, in my honest view, to justify the rates charged on the London-Dublin and Dublin-London routes.  I raised this matter with Aer Lingus and I cannot for the world understand why it is and why it continues to be so high.  It is not simply a case of carrying 100 people at £200 per ticket or 200 people at £100 per ticket but a case of people from the South not using the service at all.  I understand from a politician north of the Border that if one drives into Aldergrove Airport one will find it full of Southern registered cars. People within a reasonable distance of Northern Ireland cross the Border and fly on the shuttle service from Belfast to London which is about one quarter or one-third of the normal Aer Lingus cost.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The distance is the same.  The argument being used is that they do not have to pay international landing fees and so on but it does not make sense.  It is as easy for people who live in Donegal, Cavan, Monaghan or Sligo to drive to Aldergrove as it is for them to drive to Dublin and while the price remains one-quarter or one-third of the Aer Lingus fare it will be difficult for us to explain the price level.  I raised the matter with Aer Lingus and I have not got a satisfactory reply.  Business people and tourists must find the position impossible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2264" /> Special weekend rates, Apex fares and so on have been introduced but one finds that if one wants to go at any sort of reasonable time one cannot avail of those offers because hotel accommodation in London is not available.  The cost of the normal week-day flights are extraordinarily high.  I say that as a Member who is not anti-Aer Lingus.  In fact, I am well disposed towards Aer Lingus.  It is an excellent company, one of our better public companies.  I cannot see how the company can justify the Dublin-London fare.  As legislators it is not our job to justify Department or State company briefs but to do what is generally in the public interest.  If there are difficulties in Departments, local authorities or in the courts it is our job to iron them out.  The bottleneck in terms of the price level on the Dublin-London route is discouraging tourism and the development of business. That route should come under greater examination.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer to the comment by Deputy O'Malley about Aer Lingus.  The Deputy will note that I have not in any of my contributions sought to take the part of Aer Lingus. That is a different matter from the national interest.  In regard to the point raised by Deputy Gay Mitchell about the Dublin-London route I should like to point out that the British Civil Aviation authority who possess all types of statisticians and economists approved a higher increase in the charge for tickets on that route in the last 12 months than I would allow.  I forced the fare down.  Earlier Deputy O'Malley scoffed at that move remarking that it was only a £4 reduction. It was a reduction of 2 per cent.  The fact is that we forced the fare down as we have forced fares down persistently since I became Minister.  It must be remembered that two British airlines operate on that route and they charge the same fare.</P>
      <P>If one compares the Dublin-London route on a per mile basis with comparable routes, one will find that it is no more expensive.  In fact, it may be slightly less expensive.  We should get our facts straight about this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2265" /> Deputy O'Malley, quoting from a Community report, said that air fares in Europe over a period of years have gone up in some cases by as much as twice the rate of inflation.  Has the Deputy the statistics in regard to air fares to and from Ireland since I became Minister?  If he has he will see that air fares have increased by less than the rate of inflation since I became Minister.  That was as a result of my policy on air fares, a policy I intend to continue.  We have had a long debate on this matter and, perhaps, Deputies would agree to take the question soon.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would go a long way with Deputy O'Malley with regard to the consumer and tourism aspects of air travel and the cost.  The interests of Aer Lingus and Bord Fáilte are not mutually exclusive.  There is an obligation on Aer Lingus to fill their own planes and after that to encourage other people to fill their planes coming to Ireland.  I have a consumer-orientated amendment for consideration at a later stage in the debate.  I may be a little sorry that I missed the Lucullan feasts in Buswells Hotel &mdash; it made my mouth water when I heard all the talk about it &mdash; but I must point out that Aer Lingus were late in the field with their propaganda.  When I met Susan Hamilton in the company of a consumer group, legal experts and a travel agency, there was never any indication to me that there was a danger that a scheduled service by Transamerica would be withdrawn from this country.  I must say that I was fooled in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley lacks logic in one thing he said.  He quoted statistics from the Irish statistical bulletin. In logic one cannot say that because the statistics show that the numbers are going down, air companies, their tarrifs and fares are at fault.  In that period the recession was biting very deeply and holidaymakers generally, particularly from the UK had dropped.  I was in an area in southern England where people from the industrial north used go camping and there was a 25 per cent take-up in 1980-81.  The number of unemployed had increased <Col N="2266" /> and there was less money available for holidaying.</P>
    <P>We will want to keep our feet on the ground in regard to this but I go along with Deputy O'Malley in saying that our tourism industry is very important and that the idea of enticing tourists here should not be hampered by any policy.  I do not believe it is.  I remember very well an example of what tourism can do for the economy of a country and we need it here and Aer Lingus should contribute to it.  The first time I went on a course to Spain 600,000 people visited Spain in that year; last year 40 million people went there.  On the first occasion that I am quoting the <i>per capita</i> earnings in Spain were much lower than in Ireland; today the <i>per capita</i> earnings in Spain are much higher than they are here.  Therefore, we have an obligation in considering legislation such as this to take tourism heavily into account, but I part company with Deputy O'Malley in his belief that if the numbers are decreasing it is necessarily because of the tariffs of Aer Lingus or that the wellbeing of Aer Lingus is in some way involved in keeping tourism out of this country.  I do not believe that that is so and I cannot see any logic in that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay this debate.  We have had a full discussion but I want to clarify a few points and to comment on some of the contributions.  I have great admiration for the views and operations of Deputy O'Malley, having worked with him.  However, I refuse to accept that I should not voice some protection of the stand of Aer Lingus. Deputy O'Malley in an earlier contribution referred in a dismissive, derisory and quite insulting manner to the lobbying and information process that Aer Lingus involved themselves in in Buswell's Hotel.  That was done in a manner to suggest that something improper had been undertaken.  I refute that argument on my own behalf as I was a Deputy present at the briefing and I feel that the airline are entitled to have their point of view raised in this House with regard to that briefing.  As Deputy Wilson has just <Col N="2267" /> said, they were late into the field in trying to repair and correct much of the misinformation that had been churned out by Transamerica and some of their allies in this country.</P>
      <P>I agree fully that Aer Lingus should encourage tourism and the development of tourism in this country, and I believe that they have done that consistently down the years of their operations. Through their promotion work in America and on the Continent in the sums of money that they spend in their budget on promotion they are not just promoting Aer Lingus as such but are also promoting Ireland as a base for holidays and have been quite successful in that.  I would like to see greater use of charter tours into Ireland from right around Europe, the Ruhr Valley, Britain and continental Europe outside the Ruhr.  We should be bringing more tourists in here but that is not what we are talking about in this Bill. Here we are talking about the whole area of the standard regulatory powers dealing with the ordinary day-to-day operations, the scheduled services of the airlines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Malley attempts to suggest that because scheduled fares are at the rate that they are, the tourist trade by air has dropped to the figures he has suggested.  That is to disregard totally the international recessions and the Irish recession.  It is to disregard totally further Government decisions which have sent the pricing of a holiday in Ireland through the roof with regard to drink prices, food prices, holiday accommodation prices, transport within the country and so on.  I agree that tourism has a major role to play in the recovery of our economy in the years ahead, but that is to look at it in a national way for all Government Departments and for the Government to tackle the pricings within when the tourists arrive here.  To suggest that the lack of tourists in the country is a result of the special fares of Aer Lingus is twisting the facts to an extent that they do not stand up.  I would like to see the 50,000 tourists in west Cork that Deputy O'Malley spoke about and an extra 50,000 in every county in Ireland.  I would like to <Col N="2268" /> see more in my own north county Dublin. To suggest that it is only as a result of scheduled air fares or the pricing policy of Aer Lingus is to twist the truth.</P>

      <P>I make no apologies to this House or to anybody for standing up to speak on behalf of our national airline. They have served this country well and continue to serve it well, and they deserve as much assistance and protection as we as a Chamber can provide for them.  That is not to say that they should be featherbedded but they should be protected against unfair competition.  Much is made of the commercial operators.  Aer Lingus are operating in a commercial world.  Of their total assets at the moment they received only one-third of that funding from the State and through the efforts of their management and workers they developed their asset.  They developed the money that was given to them to the extent of 3:1 ratio.  They deserve any assistance we can give them.  To say that they are not operating on a commercial basis is incorrect.  They are doing so, and last year's profits were good and I am informed reliably that this year's profits will be equal to if not better than that. Basically they are providing a national service for industrial and other purposes to keep us in touch with the rest of Europe and with America.  The commercial operators whom Deputy O'Malley lauded so much are companies such as Transamerica, Florida and many others who come and go.  There is a list the length of your arm of those who have come and gone from America and the UK.  They have come to try to cream off business that Aer Lingus developed and then have gone, but where would this nation have been without Aer Lingus continuing to fly the routes?  I make no apologies to this House or to anybody outside for standing up and saying that the national interest and the health and prosperity of Aer Lingus are one and the same thing.</P>

      <P>As somebody very <Col N="2269" /> much involved in Shannon airport as a trade union official and who worked there for many years looking after the workers in Aer Lingus and throughout the airport generally, I am very much in favour of the Aer Lingus position.  While I appreciate the points made by Deputy O'Malley about not giving to anybody a monopoly that might be to the detriment of the national interest, nevertheless we must examine the situation.  We are really speaking here about the flag carrier of this nation.  I was involved in Labour Court submissions dealing with foreign companies such as TWA and Pan Am as far back as 1973.  We made the point successfully to the Labour Court then that any of these companies coming into the country should be made to compete on the same&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Prendergast</NameTxt>
      <P>I am directing my remarks to that and I am making the point that the flag carrier of this country should not be made to operate at terms less favourable than those applying to other companies coming in here.  To suggest that we should bend matters to provide for that is to allow all sorts of people to come in here.  These companies come here only when it suits them to do so. They will not care about this country.  It is like arguing against CIE having the transport monopoly.  Certain coach operators pick lucrative sections of the market but leave CIE to carry the unprofitable social elements of the service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Aer Lingus provide a service all the year round.  Except for Aeroflot, the Russian airline, using Shannon in the winter, we would not even have seagulls there were it not for Aer Lingus.  This is why I say their position should be protected by this House.  That is not to say that I am <Col N="2270" /> in favour of a monopoly or a cartel.  I want to make that clear.  I know, as well as anybody else, the kind of uisce faoi thalamh that goes on albeit with an apparent official imprimatur which operates between the European national flag carriers. They have a nice cosy arrangement among themselves.  Three different passengers on the one plane can fly to South Africa having paid three different fares, all apparently legitimate.</P>
    <P>We should not do anything which would be detrimental to our national flag carrier, Aer Lingus.  I take the point Deputy O'Malley is making about trying to encourage as many tourists as possible to visit Ireland.  This might underpin the need for this Government, and all Irish governments, getting their act together and co-ordinating the agencies concerned more effectively.  I am saying this as chairman of the committee on State-sponsored bodies.  We discovered four State agencies had different hotels within their responsibility when they should have been co-ordinating their operations.</P>
    <P>Last summer Shannon Airport had the best season since 1946.  The pattern has been established, no matter what we do to entice foreign airlines to use our airports. We gave TWA the right to overfly Shannon and come to Dublin, but despite all the concessions they got, the pattern has been so well established that eight out of every ten American tourists decided to land first at Shannon.  This country is different from other European countries. There the trend is to go to Vienna, Brussels, Paris and so on, the capital cities, but here, tourists go to the west and then go to Dublin or London.</P>

I am <Col N="2271" /> not altogether happy about Aer Lingus and what they might do if they were given <i>carte blanche</i>, but at the same time their position has to be protected against unfair outside competition.</P>

      <P>I was very interested to hear what difference the insertion of the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; would make.  I have been listening to a lot of invective for the past two hours which had nothing to do with this amendment.  I do not see any reason why the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; should be inserted.  The Minister will have power to determine the fare.  This amendment seems to be a vehicle for a general discussion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has difficulty in understanding this amendment, I will explain it to him.  If the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; is inserted, it means that the Minister fixes the maximum fare beyond which no airline on a particular route can charge.  It is a maximum fare, not an obligatory fare.  If one or more airlines on a particular route want to charge less, they are free to do so.  That is the difference the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; makes.  The Minister does not want to let them charge less.  He wants all airlines to charge the same.  He wants to retain the cartel.  My forecast is that all this will be swept aside in Europe.  We had better live in the real world rather than try to retain things which might have worked well for us in some respects in the past but which are no longer relevant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; to allow competition. He should not have everybody charging the same.  Dan-Air, I understand, hold a licence from the Minister for Gatwick to Shannon, but they have never used it because their licence makes it obligatory on them to charge the cartel fare.  They cannot charge less.  They say the fare is so high that this route will not be attractive and they will not draw customers.  If the change I am suggesting is made all routes of that kind will be opened up because people will not have to remain part of a cartel against their wishes.  The <Col N="2272" /> members of most cartels are in it voluntarily and want to stay there.  Cartels have to be broken up by Government action under the Restrictive Practices Acts, but here we are giving statutory underpinning to a cartel.  While Irish law is underpinning it by legislation, European law is going to sweep it away and if they do not do it this year, they will certainly do it next year or the year after.  There is a commissioner who is committed to that, the court is committed to it and the treaty seems fairly clear.</P>
    <P>The Minister should leave all these emotional arguments aside and insert the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo;.  If some people want to charge less, let them do so.  What awful crime is that?  Under this Bill it will be a crime if you charge less than the cartel arranged fare.  No longer will the jail sentence be imposed, but a £50,000 fine will be imposed; in the original proposal, it was £100,000 and two years in jail.</P>
    <P>Why not insert the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; in this Bill, as it is in all the prices Acts, and allow people to charge less than the maximum if they want to?  At present, if the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; is not included they all have to charge the same fare. There can be no competition.  I just want ordinary competition.  It is going to come anyway.  Why we should be legislating into the teeth of the wind I do not know.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>In his contribution Deputy O'Malley has persisted in making many errors.  For instance, he said Dan-Air cannot operate to Shannon.  The fact is they did not file for Shannon.  If they file a lower price than Aer Lingus or anybody else they will be considered.  He also said people had to operate within a cartel, that there was only one fare.  That is contrary to the facts.  As the Deputy must know, I have allowed Transamerica and Northwest Orient to charge different fares from Aer Lingus, all substantially cheaper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I think it is, because it is on the question of fares.  A letter was written and signed by an official in the Department &mdash; his name is not relevant but his signature is here &mdash; informing an airline that they could not operate a particular route from Shannon at the fare they proposed and that they would have to increase it substantially.  If they did not do so they were to stop operating.  That is the reality; that is life.  It is not what the Minister says.  That is why we do not have the volume of air traffic we should have.  I will read the letter if the Minister wishes.  It was not written during his time in office but just before.  The policy has never changed.  I was a member of Government for over eight years and I do not remember these matters ever being discussed at a Government meeting.  It is ministerial rather than Government policy.  In effect that means departmental policy.  Here is a letter from the Department telling an airline that they cannot operate on the Shannon-Amsterdam route because they are not charging enough and that they will have to increase their rates by 12 per cent or stop operating. That is wrong.  If anybody wants to operate on the Shannon-Amsterdam route at a lower rate, let them do so if they will generate business.</P>
      <P>The policy outlined in this letter is the type of thing I am trying to overcome.  It will be overcome, not by this House but by being swept aside by the European Commission and the European Court.  I cannot forecast how long it will take but it will happen, probably within the next two or three years.  It is quite mad that we are going in the opposite direction. That letter would be laughed out of court in Luxembourg.  I cannot imagine a similar letter being written in 1985 by any other civil aviation administration.</P>

I would be very worried if any position were brought about or subscribed to by this House which would undermine further the capacity of Aer Lingus to fight off unfair competition from outside carriers.  They are the national flag carrier and I would be very concerned about the impact on Shannon if we were to weaken the position of Aer Lingus <i>vis-á-vis</i> that of other large airlines, especially from America.  I have no great love for Aer Lingus <i>per se.</i> I do not imagine that they are boiling over with love for Shannon Airport.  I would be worried about a trans-Atlantic runway in Dublin.

      <P>In page 2, line 31, to delete &ldquo;mail or other cargo&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The purpose of this amendment is to remove the question of charges for cargo and mail from the new controls proposed <Col N="2275" /> in this Bill.  I do not know why the Minister should have any function in specifying minimum charges for cargo and mail.  It is none of his business.  It is a matter for An Post to negotiate their own agreements on charges.  I do not know why the Minister includes mail in these provisions.</P>
    <P>Why should the Minister wish to regulate the charges made for cargo?  Is it any of his business?  Are we going bureaucratically mad to the extent that Government and administration have to interfere in everything?  The question of cargo cannot be arranged by walking into a travel agency and buying a ticket.  Those who ship cargo usually deal in considerable quantities and are able to negotiate from a strong position.  If they have sufficient cargo they may be able to go to different carriers.  Cargo charges are very high and the service is not entirely satisfactory. Some aspects give rise to complaints and difficulties but I can also understand the difficulties of those who provide the service.  It is quite inappropriate that the Minister should be trying to set minimum terms for cargo.  Cargo is not one homogeneous commodity.  It cannot simply be charged by weight &mdash; volume, size and shape must also be considered, as well as factors such as whether it can be palletised.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister wants these controls?  Is it suggested that Aer Lingus or any other airline flying in here are under-charging in respect of cargo?  Certainly I have never heard that suggestion. This seems totally different from the area of air passenger transport.  Is there a danger that we will be beset by Flying Tigers or one of the other cargo lines?  I do not think there is any danger of it. Flying Tigers come here two or three times a week, as well as Seaboard and some of the other cargo people.  Why should their minimum charges be fixed? Is it suspected that they will undercut somebody else?  It is not appropriate that this kind of bureaucratic regulation of minimum charges should be part of our legislation.</P>

As a matter of practice we do not use it.  Deputy O'Malley has said that cargo charges in and out of this country are quite high.  They are unregulated.  I do not envisage using these powers but it is necessary to have reserve powers in relation to cargo and mail in the event of predatory pricing by operators.</P>

It is nonsense. This is not so much a reflection of the ministerial mind.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if it is his intention to honour the pledge, contained in the Joint Programme for Government, that a fundamental reform of the social welfare system will be undertaken with a view to its implementation within the lifetime of the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the commitment in the Programme for Government, a Commission on Social Welfare was set up in August 1983 to undertake a fundamental review of the social welfare code.  It is expected that the commission will publish its findings in the autumn.  Its conclusions and recommendations will enable a fundamental reassessment to be made of the future direction of the social welfare system.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that the administration of the social welfare system is breaking down? For example, there seems to be an industrial dispute in the Minister's Department and it is not possible to get through to make an inquiry.  There have been delays in the payments of disability benefit and in the length of time it takes to process unemployment assistance claims, which was highlighted yesterday in the House. Pending the findings of the Commission on Social Welfare, does the Minister accept that he should take action to ensure that the system works efficiently?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Yesterday I dealt extensively with the difficulties in the Department. Every effort is made to deal expeditiously with claims and, on average, the maximum delay is one to two days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister tell us what he is doing to ensure improved efficiency?  Surely he accepts that there is a delay of 17 weeks in processing a claim for unemployment assistance, a 21 week delay in processing a claim for deserted wife's allowance and that these delays are intolerable as these people are means tested and have no other source of income.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>

      <P>Does the embargo on <Col N="2278" /> jobs in the public service apply to the Department of Social Welfare in view of the fact that the workload in that Department has doubled since this Government came to office?  Has the Minister any plans to ensure that sufficient staff will be appointed to improve the efficiency of the service?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>

      <P>Do officials of the Department have to investigate cases within a specified time?  Furthermore, is the Minister satisfied with the deployment of staff as some areas seem to fare better than others in relation to decisions on claims?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not satisfied with delays of any kind.  In many cases there are explanations for delays, especially in areas from which a large number of applications come.  However, every effort is made to redeploy staff if a backlog of cases occurs in a certain area.  Delays mostly occur in cases where assessments have to be made and where people must be interviewed.  Because of the large number of such cases delays are inevitable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that it is the statutory and moral responsibility of the Minister for Social Welfare to pay promptly benefits to people in the social welfare system who are entitled to them?  At present, because of the breakdown in the administration of this Department, of which every Deputy is aware, the Minister is not discharging that solemn statutory and moral responsibility.  Were it not for the supplementary welfare benefit scheme, people would be hungry.  The Minister said that he did not have the necessary staff to administer the social welfare services as they should be administered and, therefore, the Government are in effect <Col N="2279" /> reneging on their duty to the poor and weaker sections of the community.  Is that a fair summing up of the position?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department do not have the necessary level of staffing to provide the kind of immediate response to certain claims, particularly those which have to be means tested, because entitlement to a particular form of assistance has to be established and that is where delays can occur.  This problem could be eased by providing additional staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason fuel vouchers are not being paid to retired nuns who often have their own accommodation within a convent since because of age and other considerations this often necessitates additional heat and light and is an unnecessary hardship in many cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="2280" />
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a general condition under the urban and national fuel schemes that only one fuel allowance is paid to any household.  If, however, the circumstances in a particular case are such that pensioners living under the same roof do not share common facilities it would be possible for separate fuel allowances to be awarded.  Any applications of this kind would be considered by the local authority or health board concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is a convent, about which I have been making representations, where elderly retired nuns live in separate accommodation have been refused a fuel voucher which would make a great contribution towards the very heavy heating costs incurred on their behalf?  They have been offered one fuel voucher for the entire community although there are a number of nuns living under the same roof but in different appartments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no discrimination against nuns as far as the fuel voucher scheme or any other scheme is concerned. If the nuns concerned make an application, which I understand they have not made, on the basis that they have separate accommodation it will be considered.  As a result of the Deputy's question certain inquiries were made at the convent by an official.  The position was explained to the nuns but no application was made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that when they approached the post office one voucher was offered for all the senior citizens despite the fact that they live in separate accommodation?  They are retired nuns and senior citizens who require additional heating.  Will the Minister tell the House what the outcome was of the official's visit to the convent?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>If the people in a household do not share facilities more than one voucher can be issued.  Dublin Corporation, who are the relevant authority in this case, were asked to investigate, on <Col N="2281" /> 21 February 1985, the circumstance of the nuns in this convent to see if the issue of more than one fuel voucher per week would be warranted.  An inquiry officer called to the convent a few days later and the sister in charge was surprised that the matter had gone so far.  She informed the inquiry officer that she did not want the matter pursued.  She only mentioned the subject of fuel vouchers in passing and was not making a complaint about the issue of one fuel voucher per week.  In the circumstances the inquiry officer took no further action in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>What procedure exists for appeals against a decision of the corporation or the health board?  Does the Minister accept that in the health board the superintendent welfare officer who sanctions entitlement to this scheme in the first place is also the person who hears the appeal?  Can the Minister say if there is any procedure whereby a different person would investigate a case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>No formal application was made.  When the matter was pursued as a result of the inquiry from Deputy Mitchell the nun in charge of the convent indicated quite clearly that she did not want the matter pursued.  The urban fuel scheme is operated on the basis of one voucher per household but if a claim is made that the people living in a household who are eligible for fuel vouchers live in separate accommodation that claim is looked at.  No question of appeal would arise on that stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that this was not mentioned to me in passing but was raised with me specifically? Is the Minister aware that the convent are more interested in avoiding publicity rather than in pursuing the matter?  Would he agree that it is insulting to offer one fuel voucher in this case?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no publicity about the matter until today.  All the inquiries on behalf of Dublin Corporation and my Department were made in as discreet a manner as possible.  The general guideline is for one fuel voucher per household.  If in any establishment a number of people have separate accommodation and have to have separate heating that is a different matter.  If the matter was pursued further with Dublin Corporation it would appear that it would be satisfactorily dealt with.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that some health boards are refusing as a matter of policy to make any supplementary welfare payments to assist in the payment of ESB bills, irrespective of the means of the applicant; if he approves of such a policy; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no general policy in any health board area of refusing applications for assistance in this type of case irrespective of the circumstances of the applicant.</P>
      <P>Applications for assistance towards payment of ESB bills may be dealt with under the provision in the supplementary welfare allowances scheme which enables a health board, in any case where it considers it reasonable, to make a single payment to meet an exceptional need. All applications for assistance with ESB bills are considered on their merits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>That may have been interpreted by the Deputy to mean assistance is not given in any case towards the cost of ESB bills as a matter of policy. That is not the case.  The notification referred to by the Deputy also advises the applicant of his right to appeal.</P>

      <P>If an applicant appeals who will hear the appeal?  Will it be the same officer or a different officer?

      <P>It is very important that we should establish who will hear that appeal and whether the Minister considers that the appeals system is fair.  It is even more important in view of the fact that since 1 April health boards have come under the aegis of the Ombudsman. The time has come when the health boards must set up a proper appeals system.  Has the Minister any plans to ensure that there is a proper appeals system and that when somebody appeals a different officer will look at the case?</P>

      <P>I understand that the purpose of the circular referred to by the Deputy, which was signed by the secretary of the superintendent community welfare officer's group of the Eastern Health Board, was to ensure that a uniform approach to the granting of exceptional needs for payment for clothing would be adopted by the community welfare officers.  There was also the problem that the impression had grown among a section of the public that there was an automatic entitlement to clothing grants at certain times of the year.  That is not so.  It is an exceptional payment based on the particular circumstances of the applicants.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware of the anomaly that exists for former State employees who because of a change in legislation in 1953 relating to social insurance payments are now deprived of their contributory old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The scheme of contributory old age pensions came into effect in 1961 and entitlement to benefit of necessity depended on the scheme of social insurance as it existed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons employed in the public sector, whose employments are permanent and pensionable, pay a modified rate of social insurance which gives entitlement to a limited range of benefits.  There is no element in the contribution which gives cover for contributory old age pension and for this reason these contributions <Col N="2290" /> cannot be reckoned in establishing entitlement to that pension.</P>
    <P>The question of pension entitlements is a matter which has been raised by a number of people in relation to various categories of insured persons and it is being considered by the Commission on Social Welfare which is carrying out a general review of all social welfare schemes.  In the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, there is a commitment on the part of the Government to publish a framework for a national pension plan. The matter will fall to be considered in this context also.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister realise that the difficulty in relation to these cases stems directly from the Exemption Order introduced in 1953 for this particular category of employees in CIE?

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the number of persons of old age pension age who are ineligible for a contributory pension despite unbroken service of in or about forty-five years <Col N="2292" /> including contributions to the social welfare scheme apart from one period of exemption; whether there is any prospect of allowing these people to make up their earlier voluntary contributions and hence have an entitlement to a contributory pension; if he agrees that their exclusion is anomalous, was not intended and would be inexpensive to rectify; and if he will comment on the case of a person (details supplied) in Dublin 11 who has been refused a contributory old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Numbers 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>Up to April 1974 there were remuneration limits above which persons in non-manual employment were not insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  The problems referred to in the questions appear to relate to such persons who had been insurable but ceased to be so because their remuneration exceeded the limit prescribed from time to time.  When the remuneration limit was abolished in April 1974 they again became insurable but, because of gaps in their insurance, a number of them failed to satisfy the statutory contribution conditions for contributory old age pensions.</P>
      <P>Many persons who went out of insurance because their remuneration exceeded the prescribed limit availed themselves of the option to become voluntary contributors, thus maintaining their entitlements.  Others had the same opportunity but chose not to exercise the option.</P>
      <P>It is not possible to give precise statistics of the numbers who have been adversely affected in the circumstances mentioned, but it is estimated that about 1,700 would be involved.  The cost of paying contributory pension to those would be about £5 million in a full year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem is not regarded as a priority matter.  Anyone who fails to qualify for a contributory pension may, if his circumstances warrant it, qualify for a non-contributory old age pension. There is no provision under the legislation whereby a person can pay contributions to establish entitlement after a risk <Col N="2293" /> has materialised.  Such a procedure is not considered appropriate to the social insurance system.  The matter is, however, one which will be examined by the Commission on Social Welfare and will be considered in the context of any recommendations made by the commission. It will also fall to be considered in the context of the commitment by the Government in the national plan to publish a framework for a national pension plan.</P>
    <P>The person referred to in Deputy Flaherty's question ceased to be insurable at the end of 1954 and had no further record of contributions from January 1955 to 31 March 1974.  He had a total of 349 contributions in the relevant average test period, in his case from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1979, giving him a yearly average of 13.  A minimum yearly average of 20 contributions would be required to enable him to qualify for pension.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the anomaly whereby a widow with insufficient contributions to qualify for a widow's pension who joins the public service is also ineligible for a contributory old age pension, he will (a) consider allowing such persons to buy into a superannuation scheme and obtain maximum pension at a cost comparable with the retirement gratuity, (b) amend social welfare legislation to allow a widow to qualify for a widow's pension on retirement on the basis of contributions made before and after widowhood, or (c) amend social welfare legislation to provide an option to widows to buy into the contributory old age pension scheme on retirement at a cost comparable to the retirement gratuity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As I understood the Deputy's question, part (a) concerns public service pension entitlements and this matter is the responsibility of the Minister for the Public Service.  I understand, however, that throughout the public service there are schemes which allow the purchase of service either by <Col N="2294" /> lump-sum payment or periodical deductions. Any more specific information should be sought from the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
      <P>In regard to (b), I explained in my written reply to a previous question from the Deputy on this issue that a widow with insufficient insurance contributions to qualify for widow's contributory pension and who subsequently joins the public service cannot have later contributions taken into account for this purpose. This would be providing for an event which had already happened and as such would be contrary to all accepted principles of insurance.  The later, and earlier, contributions would, of course, be reckonable should the women marry again and become a widow a second time. It is against this risk that she is insured for widow's pension as a public servant. There are no proposals under consideration to amend social welfare legislation in this respect.</P>
      <P>In regard to (c), public servants as a body are not insurable for contributory old age pension as it is considered that their State pensions, payable on retirement, afford them adequate cover.  A widow in the situation mentioned would qualify for a public service pension, subject to a minimum service requirement. There are no proposals to amend social welfare legislation in this respect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware of the anomaly in the situation in that if the person to whom I referred had remained a temporary civil servant she would have qualified for the contributory old age pension but because she opted to become permanent she is permanently excluded?  For that reason, would the Minister of State not consider that option (c), the option to buy into the contributory old age pension would be a reasonable amendment of social welfare legislation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the general objection to buying into an insurance scheme after an event has taken place. That is unknown in insurance schemes. Indeed, the concept of insurance schemes <Col N="2295" /> would be undermined if people were to reserve a possible option of contributing or not contributing, to wait and see if a certain event took place and then to pay up arrears and qualify.  The short answer to the Deputy's question is that there are no proposals to amend social welfare legislation in that respect.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>When this scheme was introduced with a great fanfare of trumpets last October or November, the Government stated clearly and unequivocally that 35,000 persons would benefit.  We find now that at the end of 1984 only 8,880 people had applied and only 1,326 had been sanctioned.  Is it not obvious that this scheme has proved an absolute disaster?  It is a farce and a failure. It has been used simply as a method to deceive people into believing they were getting something to compensate them for the loss of half the food subsidies. Will the Minister not admit that the scheme has been a tragic failure?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It was estimated at the introduction of the scheme &mdash; the estimation was based on PAYE returns &mdash; that up to 35,000 persons would qualify for supplement.  Despite the extensive publicity given to the scheme when it was launched, the take-up has been disappointingly low.  Up to 7 February <Col N="2296" /> 1985 a total of 9,300 applications were received and approximately 4,400 supplements were awarded.  By means of additional publicity in the near future it is hoped to encourage potential beneficiaries who have not yet submitted claims to do so.  I wish to point out that the figure of 35,000 was got from PAYE returns.  It was not picked out of the air.</P>

      <P>What I am saying is that it is possible in some cases that the amount of money received from the family income supplement may push people over the eligibility limit, which is quite low, for a medical card.  Therefore people who are on the margins of medical card eligibility limits would fear that if they applied for the family income supplement they would lose their medical card.

If you like, a gap in our social welfare system was identified, that it happens in some cases that people in employment, particularly married people with families, are worse off then, say, a comparable family on social welfare benefit.  The basis or purpose of the scheme was to endeavour to help those people in low paid employment.  That was explained over and over again.

Inquiries in the case have been taking place but the extent of her late husband's insurable employment has not yet been established.  The claimant has given some information regarding his employment in the years 1944 to 1948 and 1950 to 1951.  The Department is in touch with the employing organisations mentioned by her.  She has not given details about the years before or after those periods and she has recently been asked again if she can supply any such particulars.  No reply has been received.

      <P>The circular issued on 22 June 1983 contained the following phrase: &ldquo;persons on short term social welfare payments&rdquo; are excluded from the scheme.  The Limerick judgment on 12 November 1984 held that in so far as this paragraph purports to exclude absolutely from the discretion of the deciding officer the discretion to grant an allowance to a person in receipt of one of the payments referred to, it seemed to be <i>ultra vires</i> the Minister, and the Minister has power <Col N="2303" /> under section 209 (2) and (3) of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act, 1981, to prescribe matters in relation to social welfare allowances.  The judge stated that it was not intended, nor did it seem to him that it could be intended, that the issue of the circular could possibly be an exercise of his power by the Minister and the judge was satisfied that the decision on the plaintiff's claim was made solely on the understanding by the officers concerned that they were excluded by the terms of the circular from granting the allowance rather than on consideration of the question as to whether her means were insufficient to meet her needs.  The judge was accordingly satisfied that a valid decision was not reached on her application either initially or on appeal and that the two orders by way of decision must be quashed and the cause shown disallowed. The Minister, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, on 18 February 1985 made regulations under section 209 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act, 1981, prescribing conditions for the granting of fuel allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I was just observing, by way of a lead-in to section 1, that the more I listened to the Second Stage debate the more convinced I became that it would be all the more difficult to enforce this legislation in the absence of new legislation which I asked the Minister to introduce in conjunction with this Bill. Under the heading &ldquo;Interpretation&rdquo; the fourth paragraph says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;damage&rdquo; includes the death of, or injury to, any person (including any disease and any impairment of a person's physical or mental condition) and injury to or total or partial destruction of property;</P>
      <P>I would like to know if this definition of mental strain could be extended or if the Bill covers mental strain resulting from the continuing annoyance of barking dogs.  We all know that particularly in built-up areas dogs make a nuisance of themselves at night by barking continuously, and disrupting the peace of the locality.  That may cause a serious annoyance. Will the Minister clarify that matter?</P>
      <P>Will the definition section cover the mental strain resulting from the continuous annoyance of a dog barking or, in the case of disease, will the section relate to a person who picks up rabies or other skin diseases from a dog?  Will the owner of the dog be liable to damages arising from such incidents?  In my view having read the section people could have a claim for damages against a dog owner.</P>

      <P>I must protest very strongly at that reply.  The term &ldquo;damage&rdquo;, is not defined in section 2.

      <P>I am anxious to be helpful to the Minister because, like Deputy Hyland, I want to approach this matter in a constructive manner.  We are dealing with legislation which, hopefully, will have immediate practical effect in our constituencies and we want to see to it that the intention behind the legislation is carried effectively into the letter of the law.  I understand what the Minister is saying, that if the definition is in some way unclear &mdash; I accept it is impossible to get words to cover every situation &mdash;<Col N="2338" /> and if there is a lack of clarity or an ambiguity emerges the courts will make a decision on the matter.  That is the way it operates normally, but there is no question of ambiguity or lack of clarity in relation to the point raised by Deputy Hyland.  Deputy Hyland asked if the mental distress caused by the activities of a dog barking at night and keeping people awake will be covered in section 3, which deals with damage caused by dogs.  It is crystal clear to me, on the face of the legislation, that that sort of damage is not dealt with.  The only type of damage dealt with in the legislation is damage arising from a direct attack by a dog on person. Deputy Hyland is suggesting that damage such as mental distress should be covered in the legislation.  Will the Minister consult with the parliamentary draftsman and her advisers with a view to making it clear, whether in the interpretation section or in section 3 which deals with the matter directly, that that sort of damage is covered in the legislation?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Deputy's point.  &ldquo;Damage&rdquo; includes the death of, or injury to, any person, including any disease and any impairment of a person's physical or mental condition, and injury to or total or partial destruction of property. That is the definition and it has been used in other legislation.</P>

      <P>Let me interrupt the Minister of State.  Section 3 deals with damage done by dogs.  Section 3 (1) states:</P>
      <P>The owner of a dog shall be liable in damages for damage caused in an attack on any person by the dog.</P>
      <P>It is damage caused in an attack, which is altogether different and is not catered for in this section.</P>

      <P>I do not accept the viewpoint of the Minister of State that it is out of context.  We are still dealing with the Animals Bill, 1985, and with various interpretations of the terminology used in the Bill.  Let me take the Minister of State further along that road under the subhead of public roads.  In the Bill's terminology a &ldquo;public road&rdquo; means</P>
      <P>a road the responsibility for the maintenance of which lies on a road authority and includes a toll road within the meaning of the Local Government (Tolls Roads) Act, 1979, and, for the purposes of section 2, also includes any highwy;</P>
      <P>It goes on to expand on the definition. Under that subhead of public roads there are many public rights of way which would not legally be classified under that Act as public roads but from which livestock could stray.  Would the Minister of State clarify the position with regard to trespass from such rights of way as distinct from public roads?  Let me give the Minister of State an example with which she will be familiar.  We have many bog roads throughout the country serving boglands and agricultural holdings.  It is possible and feasible for livestock to stray from adjoining holdings on to that kind of public road which perhaps is not classified legally as in that category within the meaning of the Act.  What is the position under this legislation in relation to trespass from that kind of unscheduled and unspecified road?</P>

      <P>I cannot understand the Minister of State's reply.  I cannot find the word &ldquo;highway&rdquo; anywhere in section 2.  This is serious because it goes right to the root of the legislation.  We are amending the old Common Law which was established first of all in the UK by <Col N="2341" /> the House of Lords in the case of <i>Searle v. Wallbank</i> in 1947.  We are trying to impose liability in negligence on people whose animals stray on to the public highway or on to the roadway or on to any right of way where people happen to be. Deputy Hyland has made the very valid point, that this extension of liability that occurs in section 2 is confined to animals straying on to a public road and &ldquo;public road&rdquo; is defined quite narrowly in the interpretation section.</P>

If we are to accept that this is the definition of the pathway or roadway on to which animals stray and, therefore, give rise to liability in negligence under this Bill, the law has not been carried very far.  As Deputy Hyland has pointed out, in the rural parts of this country there are numerous roadways which do not fall within that very narrow definition in the interpretation section.</P>

It is impossible to make any progress in terms of preparing this legislation if we are not clear on the interpretation of the various sections.

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P Just="Center">SECTION 2.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 2 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2(1) defines the duty to take care to prevent damage by animals straying on to the public road.  I agree with the principle of this section. As legislators we must take every reasonable step to safeguard the lives of our people using the roads.  There are too many examples of loss of life, injury and damage with no redress or entitlement to compensation for the injured parties. This new section will safeguard within reason not only the right of injured parties but also the application of the ordinary rules of negligence which provide a reasonable degree of protection for the landowner.  In this regard I feel the Minister was right in not including in the section the provision for strict liability irrespective of fault.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am a little worried about this section with regard to the provision of, say, wandering horses straying into the front gardens of urban and rural houses.  This Bill does not provide adequate protection for the owners of property and could leave the owner open to a very serious injury <Col N="2343" /> claim.  I do not know how the Minister can get around this difficulty but we have tabled an amendment which I hope he will accept.</P>
    <P>Section 2(2) makes provision for areas where fencing is not customary.  This section is very vague in its interpretation.  I know of many areas where roadside fences are being removed for a number of reasons in the interest of better farming and in some cases for the elimination of rabbits which are becoming a menace. In the interest of road safety we should be moving towards adequate roadside fencing in all areas and this can be done very effectively.  It was done very effectively in the Curragh, one of the customary areas referred to in the Bill. However, in the absence of any regulations regarding the fencing of open spaces, similar protection should be provided in traditionally fenced areas where those fences are damaged by a third party without the knowledge of the landowner and where the farmer could be held liable for damage under the provisions of this Bill.  I would like the section to be more specific and to afford more protection to the landowner where there is no evidence of negligence on his part.</P>
    <P>This new section imposes very serious obligations on landowners to maintain roadside fences and this could have repercussions if they are in breach of the section. This is so serious that, in my opinion, one might be tempted to suggest that there should be a compulsory insurance to cover landowners.  While one does not favour compulsory schemes, in my view the situation is so serious for the agricultural community generally that the Minister should consider this insurance scheme.  I urge him, perhaps when the Bill becomes law, to avail of the national media to publicise the very serious implications of the likelihood of legal cases arising from damage to property, to animals, to vehicles or to loss of life.  The farmers should be made aware of the implications in this section and they should be advised to take out adequate insurance to protect them against the <Col N="2344" /> eventual sad outcome of legal action taken against them for damages.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support what Deputy Hyland said.  I know what the intention behind section 2 is because the Minister spelt it out quite clearly in his Second Stage speech, but in my view the section is not specific enough to carry that intention into effect.  Let us recapitulate.  The old common law position under the line of authority which came from <i>Searle v Wallbank</i> was that if animals strayed on to the public highway then the landowners from whose land the animals strayed would not be liable even if they were negligent, for instance, by not having proper fencing.  The Minister's intention is to change the law and to make those adjoining landowners liable but to ground that liability in negligence.</P>
      <P>Section 2 (1) is not specific enough to do that.  One interpretation of section 2 (1), despite the reference in the subsection to negligence, could be read as imposing strict liability.  That is the advice I have got.  Would the Minister discuss this with her officials to see if we could find some provision which would more clearly carry the stated intention of the Minister for Justice into effect?  As I have already acknowledged, it is difficult to find words to adequately cover every situation but this subsection, which is so fundamental to the purpose of the Bill, should be a lot clearer.</P>
      <P>What about the position of landowners whose land does not adjoin the highway but whose animals wander on to the public roadway?  In the case of <i>Searle v Wallbank</i>, which is being overruled by this legislation, I think the House of Lords' judgment was confined to landowners whose land actually adjoined the public highway.  It did not cover landowners whose animals came on to the land which other people owned but which adjoined the public highway and where the animals went from there directly on to the public highway.  I would like the Minister to answer that specific point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The points made by Deputy Hyland on section 2 (2) are very valid and deserving of an answer, especially the point he <Col N="2345" /> made about fencing.  I note that it is envisaged &mdash; and I would like the Minister to confirm whether this is envisaged &mdash; that liability in negligence can still operate in those areas where fencing is not customary. I would like to hear some examples because, apart from somebody wilfully turning animals on to the public highway, I cannot imagine any other example of negligence in that context, that is, negligence which is not related to fencing in some way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The interpretation of the word &ldquo;customary&rdquo; is very vague, broad and general.  As I said, we all know of agricultural areas where roadside hedges are being removed in the interests of good farming practice.  Can the interpretation of the word &ldquo;customary&rdquo; be extended to cover that situation?  For example, if a case arose in an unclassified customary area, how would the courts, the people interpreting this legislation, look at this section?  We know from practical experience that roadside hedges are disappearing. We are not legislating just for the present but also for the future.  Therefore, I believe it is important that we look to the future and cater for future likely developments because we will not be coming into this House to deal with legislation on animals every day.</P>
      <P>I do not want to put the Minister on the spot because I know this is something to which she cannot immediately respond and I appreciate that, nor do I want to score political points, but before the Report Stage perhaps the parliamentary draftsman would look at the implications of the word &ldquo;customary&rdquo; in the context of this Bill.  I understand what it means in the immediate context but it could take on a far different meaning in the future. It is extremely important that the situation be clearly defined in the period during which the courts will be adjudicating on claims arising from this legislation.</P>

      <P>The points raised by Deputies were discussed on Second Stage and the Minister clarified them in his reply.  The wording of the section is as <Col N="2346" /> recommended by the Law Reform Commission and is identical with that in the corresponding provision in the Animals Act, 1971, in England and the Animal Order, 1976, in Northern Ireland, the legal background being the same in those jurisdictions as here.  It was further discussed with the draftsman but he feels that the draft is adequate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister indicate that the draftsman will again look at that aspect in order to bring in a more clear definition on Report Stage?  I am not satisfied that the section is clearly defined for the purposes of the future implementation of the legislation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact that this is the definition used in another jurisdiction does not mean that it is right.  The definition in the 1971 UK Act has given rise to many problems and court cases.  I can send copies of the judgments to the Minister's office if the Minister finds it necessary to look at them.  Deputy Hyland discussed the meaning of the word &ldquo;customary&rdquo;. To me it means that something has been done for a long time or from time immemorial in a place which has remained unfenced.  It certainly does not cover the new situation which has arisen in the last couple of years.  The English definition was put on their statute book in 1971.  I will send to the office of the Minister for Justice copies of UK cases which indicate the grave difficulties to which this definition has given rise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I realise that many of the points raised were dealt with in the Minister's reply on Second Stage.  Nevertheless some of the points raised by Deputies opposite are extremely valid.  It is a major departure from existing legislation and the protection afforded to farmers whose animals strayed on the public highway.  The distinction must be drawn between animals who get on to the highway by accident and those who are deliberately driven there.  The Bill does not seem to cater for a malicious attempt to open a gateway and allow animals to stray along the public highway.  In the past the <Col N="2347" /> liability rested with the insured person and if an animal were damaged the farmer could claim.</P>
      <P>Under the new legislation no such protection is afforded to the owner of the animals and very severe liability could be incurred if it were proved that serious damage had been caused to a third party. What level of protection, if any, has been considered in that regard?</P>

      <P>Section 3 is an amendment of the Dogs Act, 1906, and I do not wish to quote the section.  It does nothing to deal with the root cause of the problem.  It imparts liability without removing the cause.  I am tempted to ask the Minister to consider broadening this section to enable the Bill to deal with the increasing uncontrollable dog population, a very big percentage of which are unlicensed.  It is well known that less than 25 per cent of dogs are licensed, so there is no legal control being enforced in relation to dogs.  For that reason, it will be possible to implement this section.  If there are no means of identification, it will be impossible to deal with the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot accept the implications in the Minister's reply on Second Stage that if stray dogs take up short term residence &mdash; I do not mean that in any jovial sense &mdash; without the permission of the owner of the premises and without his knowledge or approval, the owner of the premises should be liable for damage caused by that dog.  The Minister should consider an amendment to protect the interests of the blameless houseowner or landowner <Col N="2349" /> in such situations.  In the event of a civil action, how would such a householder prove, to the satisfaction of the law, that he was not the owner of the dog?  That is an extremely important point.</P>
    <P>We must tackle the broader area of dog control.  Dog licensing requires a new Act and, without it, this section will, to a great extent, be inoperative.  We are at cross-purposes here because the Bill is not broad enough to deal with the problem of dogs.  I do not blame the Minister but the Government have lost an ideal opportunity in that they did not broaden the scope of the Bill to cater for the whole problem which would have eliminated the need for a new Act to cater for the dog problem.  In a very short time, because of pressures from farming organisations and other interests, the Government will have to face up to this problem.</P>
    <P>Why are we wasting our time today bringing in legislation to deal with a fragmented section of the overall problem?  I know I must confine myself to the Bill but the Minister for Agriculture, in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, should have tackled the broader problem and brought in whatever legislation was necessary.  If the Minister cannot deal with the matter adequately, she should defer the implementation of this section until the Minister for Agriculture introduces legislation establishing a proper dog warden and control scheme.  Otherwise, the section could be unfair to innocent householders.</P>
    <P>My amendment goes some way towards protecting the interests of the householder arising from any action which might arise as a result of an attack by dogs and I hope that the Minister accepts it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>The case which Deputy Hyland made in relation to the deficiencies of the section is unanswerable.  I welcome the fact that the proposed section 3 amends the Dogs Act, 1906, in relation to damage done to human beings and puts it on the same level as damage done to cattle.  Under the 1906 legislation, there was strict liability for damage done by dogs to cattle which did not apply in <Col N="2350" /> the case of human beings, which indicated that the prevailing social philosophy at the time put cattle on a higher level than humans.  I welcome the fact that the Minister proposes to change this but there is very little else in the section to welcome.  That is unfortunate because we are here to get the best possible legislation for the control of animals in a constructive manner.  However, this legislation will not do that as it is deficient in many respects.  I have already made the point regarding the interpretations section and liability being confined to damage arising from an attack by a dog and the Minister has undertaken to have that looked at again.</P>
      <P>Strict liability will arise in relation to damage done by a dog unless the person whose premises the dog occupies proves that he or she was not the owner of the dog at the time the damage was done. This requires a person to prove that he was not the owner.  Surely the onus should be on the people seeking damages to prove that the occupier of the premises where the dog happened to be at the time of the damage owned the dog?  The defendant should not have to prove that he does not own the dog; it is extremely difficult to prove a negative.</P>
      <P>Subsection (5) relates to damage caused by dogs kept on any premises or structure to a person trespassing on that premises or structure.  The net effect of that section is that if a dog causes damage or injury to a trespasser in a particular house or premises, the owner of the dog may be liable in negligence.  He will not be strictly liable, he will be liable only if the trespasser can prove that he was injured due to the negligence of the owner of the dog.  Unfortunately, we are living in an era where attacks on old people are becoming increasingly prevalent and in many cases, particularly in isolated rural areas, the only protection people have is a dog.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have evidence that in Limerick city an increasingly large number of elderly people are purchasing guns to protect themselves such is the extent to which law and order has broken down.  It cannot be the intention of the Minister or the <Col N="2351" /> Government to encourage that development. An elderly person living in a remote rural area will keep a dog on the premises to protect him from a trespasser, robber or would-be murderer.  He could subsequently find himself liable in damages for negligence.  I know it is impossible to bring in wording to cover every eventuality but a dog could be kept on a premises to protect the owner of the premises and it could deal with a would-be intruder before the intruder actually entered the premises.  In that event the would-be intruder is not a trespasser and the owner of the dog would be strictly liable in damages to the would-be intruder.  Can anything be done to tidy up that anomaly?</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy referred to a number of areas some of which deal with the Department of Agriculture and are not appropriate to this discussion. The general points raised were dealt with on Second Stage.  I am opposed to this amendment.  The effect of section 3(2) is to create a presumption that the occupier of any premises where a dog is permitted to live at the time when the dog causes damage or injury is the owner of the dog. In an action for damages for such damage or injury the occupier can rebut this presumption by proving that he was not the owner of the dog at the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the amendment would be as follows.  In an action for damages it would make the presumption of ownership of the dog rebuttable so that even if the occupier of the premises could prove at the time that he was not the dog's owner this would not be available as a defence.  Accordingly, in order to obtain damages from the occupier the injured plaintiff would have to prove the fact of the damage or injury and the fact that the dog which caused it was attached to the occupier's premises.  Where the occupier of the premises in question was not the owner of the dog he would have no redress unless he could prove ownership of the dog by another person. Even if the occupier of the premises could prove ownership of the dog by another <Col N="2352" /> person he would have to take a separate action against such owner in order to avail himself of the indemnity provided for in the second part of the amendment.</P>
    <P>The essential principle of section 1 of the Dogs Act, 1906, is that the owner of the dog is made strictly liable for certain damages and injury which it causes.  The amendment is unacceptable because it would be inequitable to the occupier of any premises to which the dog had attached itself.  Under the amendment such a person would be strictly liable even if he could prove he was not the owner of the dog at the time the dog caused the damage or injury.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister has decided to oppose this amendment.  I tabled it to protect the interests of the blameless householder in cases where a person is attacked by a dog which happens to be on the premises for the time being.  On Second Stage the Minister clearly indicated that the premises on which a dog happened to be at the time of the attack would be interpreted in law as being the temporary residence of the dog at that time.  This is of fundamental importance in relation to protecting the interests of the blameless householder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister had been able to convince me that the amendment was not necessary I would have been glad to concede that but unfortunately she has not convinced me that a householder is protected under the Bill as presently constituted and that is why I am pressing her to accept what I consider to be an extremely important amendment.  I hope that even at this late stage her advisers will tell her that the amendment has merit and that on balance it weighs in favour of the householder in that kind of case.  The onus is on the House and on the Minister to protect the interests of a householder in such a case.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the merits of the amendment. I would be happy if the Minister could point out why she cannot accept it.  The amendment has an important bearing on the broader interpretation of the Bill.  It is fundamental in that it will afford a <Col N="2353" /> certain level of protection to the householder. I know the Minister would not deliberately want to deny the householder that kind of protection but I cannot understand why my amendment cannot be accepted.</P>
    <P>The amendment helps the Bill.  I gave a lot of thought and consideration to it and felt it was necessary in the interests of the householder.  I am sure many Members of the House could envisage a situation where someone walking along the street is attacked by a dog running out from the Minister's or my gate.  There could be a subsequent claim for damages and straight away the householder is in a difficult position.  I know that the Minister indicated that the legal process would sort that out but we should not have to deliberately put innocent householders to the expense of pursuing legal action to defend their innocence.  It would be much fairer if we could deal with that eventuality in the Bill.  If this amendment is accepted we would provide that level of protection to the householder.  I hope on reflection that the Minister will see her way towards accepting my amendment. The legislation should be weighted in favour of the innocent householder in such a case.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment as it is very relevant to the Bill.  It is essential and desirable that the Minister should accept it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a measure of rationale attached to the amendment proposed by the Deputy.  You cannot ask for additional measures in the Bill to control the increase in the dog population on the one hand if, on the other hand, you make it easier for stray dogs to find what might be regarded as an unnamed owner or householder.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section as drafted is reasonable.  It achieves what it sets out to achieve, that is, to control stray dogs.  In my experience dogs are reasonably intelligent animals. They do not hang around a place unless somebody invites them to hang around by feeding them or caring for them.  If people adopt that approach they are giving a licence for a dog to be on the <Col N="2354" /> premises and consequently they must assume some measure of responsibility. If we dilute the section as proposed by the Deputy, we are doing nothing to improve the present position.  I ask the Deputy to consider the points I have made.  While I agree with the point he is trying to make, in trying to achieve that, he misses the whole point of the section.</P>

      <P>I should also like to support Deputy Hyland's amendment. People should be entitled to have a dog on their premises for their own protection and they should not be liable for damage done by that dog.  In recent times old people living alone have been attacked. It is very desirable that they should have some form of protection.  Most of them have a dog for their own protection.  It is very unfair to introduce legislation which would make them liable for any damage done by the dog.  I ask the Minister to change the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Dowling is somewhat confused.  The amendment we have put forward has nothing to do with the point made about the legislation containing no provision to control marauding packs of dogs.  Unfortunately, the Government have brought in legislation to deal with a problem which constitutes about 1 per cent, or less than 1 per cent, of the whole problem relating to dogs. The question of legal liability or civil liability for damage done by dogs constitutes a very small part of the problem.  I have rarely encountered this problem in constituency clinics.  On an ever-increasing scale I have been encountering the problem of marauding packs of dogs about which nothing is being done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept the validity of the other point Deputy Dowling is trying to make.  The real problem relates to the fact that, if a person owns a house or a premises, or is in occupation of a house or a premises, and a dog comes to the house or premises even on a temporary basis, having lived some place else for 10 years, and he does damage on the day he comes to the house or premises, the owner or occupier will be liable for the damage done unless he <Col N="2355" /> or she can prove that he or she was not the owner of the dog.  In other words, to prove a negative.</P>
    <P>That is a very harsh provision.  Deputy Hyland is trying to dilute in some way the harshness of that provision.  He is saying that, if a civil action for damages is taken against people and they cannot prove they were not the owners of the dog, which is a very onerous thing to prove, damages can be recovered against them.  If they can prove subsequently that, on the day it caused the damage, the dog was in the ownership of somebody else, they should have the right to be indemnified for the damages which they had to bear wrongfully.  They should be indemnified against the true owner of the dog.  That is the dilution Deputy Hyland is trying to make in the legislation. This is a well worthwhile amendment. If the Minister refuses to accept the amendment, I should like to hear a more logical reason than I have heard so far.</P>

I do not think there is any great difficulty involved in proving or disproving ownership.  I cannot see that as a great difficulty.  Where the occupier proves that he was not the owner of the dog in question, he will not be liable for damages.  Therefore, the question of indemnifying him against such damages as suggested in the amendment does not arise.</P>

It is for the purpose of safeguarding the person in a rare event <Col N="2356" /> that we want to ensure that this legislation covers every possible aspect.  While I respect the views of Deputy Dowling, and while I agree that he has a very good knowledge of the problem in rural Ireland, I cannot go all the way with him.

      <P>Can the Minister tell me what owner would admit to ownership of a dog which made a vicious attack on somebody?  Until we deal with the broader aspect of dog control and have proper identification, we will not make any progress.  I will not say the Bill is a waste of time, but it is not as effective as it could be.  It will not be as effective as it should be until we cover the broader aspects of licensing, dog wardens, impounding dogs, and everything else that is necessary to deal with this great national problem.</P>
      <P>I am disappointed that the Minister cannot accept our amendment.  It was introduced mainly for the purpose of dealing with the odd or rare event to which the Minister referred.  We should be concerned about isolated cases and incidents.  Any Bill which does not cover eventualities adequately is not effective legislation.  I appeal to the Minister to think seriously about what I consider to be an objective and constructive amendment which would improve the Bill.  I should not like to feel that the Minister is opposing our amendment simply for the purpose of opposing it.  We gave very serious thought to this Bill and we want to ensure that our time has not been wasted.  When the President has finally put his seal of office to this Bill we want to ensure that it will do what it was intended and designed to do.

      <P>Perhaps the Deputy <Col N="2357" /> would reflect that the proposed amendment appears to have been designed to protect the position of the occupier of a house to which a dog becomes attached. It is not agreed that the amendment would have this effect.  It would put on the occupier the inevitable presumption of liability.  The occupier would then have to take a further action to avail of the indemnity referred to in the amendment. It appears that the amendment would worsen the position of the occupier of the house.  This provision has stood in the law since 1906.  The Department of Agriculture's present position on the point is useful and, indeed seems necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept that this amendment in any way worsens the position of a householder.  That position is made very invidious by section 3 (2) which, as the Minister has stated, gives rise to a presumption of ownership in certain cases.  It does more than that.  It states specifically, in black and white, that the occupier of the premises in question will be liable for any damage done by the dog anywhere, unless it can be proved that he was not the owner of the dog on that date.</P>
      <P>What Deputy Hyland is trying to do is mitigate the harshness of that, because it is very harsh on the occupier of a premises to have to prove a negative.  Deputy Hyland is trying to ensure that if at some future time after damages have already been recovered the occupier of the premises can prove that on the day the damage was done the dog was in somebody else's ownership, the occupier of the premises who has been wrongfully subjected to a claim for damages will be able to recoup his losses against the person really responsible, that is the owner of the dog.</P>

The Minister has her marching orders and will pursue her <Col N="2358" /> opposition to this amendment, even if a division is called from this side of the House.  That is a little regrettable, particularly in relation to a very genuine effort on our part to help the Minister to improve a Bill which is in the overall interests of the people of this nation.</P>
      <P>There is little point in exhausting myself talking for the next two hours on this section when one can anticipate that the Minister will oppose it regardless of what is said on this side of the House. This legislation is of general interest and there is no real political kudos or gain for anybody.  I appreciate the position of the Minister.  Obviously, she has been told by her Minister to oppose this amendment and, true to form, she will oppose it to the end.  No matter how objective or constructive one would like to be, her opposition will continue and the inevitable vote will decide the outcome.

      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 3, line 48, after the word &ldquo;caused&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or permitted&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I shall read this subsection, because it is important:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(4) Where cattle are injured by a dog on land on to which they had strayed, and either the dog belonged to the occupier of the land or its presence on <Col N="2359" /> the land was authorised by the occupier, a person is not liable under this section in respect of injury done to the cattle, unless the person caused the dog to attack the cattle.</P>
    <P>That phrase &ldquo;unless the person caused the dog to attack the cattle&rdquo; is the important part.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept this simple but nonetheless very desirable amendment.  It would be extremely difficult to prove that a person actually caused a dog to attack the cattle.  The fact that the owner is aware of the attack and permits it to take place or to continue should be sufficient grounds for liability in respect of injury. In other words, if a dog seriously attacks or damages livestock, it would be extremely difficult to prove that the owner of the dog was actually responsible for the attack, whereas the owner could be aware, indeed for a long time, that this attack was taking place.  This amendment provides for a level of protection for the landowner in that situation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>It may perhaps have been an oversight on the part of the parliamentary draftsman that the word &ldquo;permitted&rdquo; was not included here with the word &ldquo;caused&rdquo;.  The overwhelming majority of dog owners can control their dogs and tell them what to do or not to do, in terms of attacking people or cattle.  As Deputy Hyland as pointed out, it is extremely difficult to prove that a person has positively caused, provoked, encouraged or driven his dog to attack cattle.  The basis of our amendment is that the person who stands idly by when he could control his dog and prevent him from attacking cattle is equally as guilty as the person who positively causes his dog to attack cattle.  In those circumstances I would be more than surprised if the Minister does not see the merit in this amendment and accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment in the name of Deputy Hyland refers to the owner of the dog being aware of the attack and doing nothing to prevent it. <Col N="2360" /> There must be a level of protection.  An attempt could be made to prove that an owner was aware of an attack, but it would be extremely difficult to prove that he was not aware of an attack.  It might be an attack on sheep.  He could be aware of the attack but do nothing to prevent it.  Perhaps in that situation there is some merit in what is proposed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The operative word here is &ldquo;permitted&rdquo;.  Members of the House will understand what I mean by talking about causing a dog to stage an attack. Quite logically Deputy Dowling made the point that to permit the dog to cause the attack is the relevant point in the amendment.  It is only a technical point. As Deputy O'Dea stated, it could even be an omission on the part of the parliamentary draftsman when drafting the Bill.</P>
      <P>The amendment is important.  It deals with the addition of the words &ldquo;or permitted&rdquo;. Otherwise there will be no level of protection for the landowner whose animals are attacked by wandering dogs. Everyone knows that many farmers have been put out of business because of attacks by dogs on sheep herds.  Because of the proximity of Dublin city, the sheep number in Dublin county has been reduced to one-third of what it was ten years ago and that is an indication of the national dimension of the problem.  Even though this Bill is inadequate, we must endeavour to provide the maximum degree of protection for farmers in that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I ask the question: where will one get anyone to admit that his dog attacked sheep or where will one get evidence to indicate that the owner of the dog caused it to attack the sheep?  The fact that the sheep have been permitted to be attacked is the relevant point.  In my opinion this Bill will fall down totally in terms of protection for farmers and sheep owners if the Minister does not agree to the insertion of the words &ldquo;or permitted&rdquo;.  I do not know of any logical argument that could be made against our amendment. <Col N="2361" /> In my opinion it would strengthen the section considerably.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture and Members of this House who are interested in the development of agriculture are aware of the massive losses to the nation, quite apart from the loss to the individual farmers, incurred as a consequence of attacks on sheep.  The Minister of State should not allow this opportunity to pass to give maximum protection to sheep owners.  This is particularly important having regard to the fact that there is no control over the dog population.  As I indicated earlier, only one-third of dogs are licensed.  We should do everything possible to protect the owners whose animals are attacked by dogs.  I appeal to the Minister to accept the amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>The provision does not relate to attacks by wandering dogs on sheep.  It refers to trespassing animals injured on the occupier's land by the occupier's dog.  I must oppose the amendment, but I assure the Deputy there is no bias intended.  It is not a personal or a party matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The basic principle in subsection (4) of section 1 of the Dogs Act, 1906, is that strict liability is not incurred for injury caused by a dog to cattle where the injury is sustained on land onto which they have strayed and is caused by a dog owned by the occupier of the land.  The amendment now proposed would qualify the effect of the subsection to a considerable extent. There will be many cases in which the occupier of the land will use a dog to control or direct animals trespassing on it.  The intention of the subsection is that such a person should remain strictly liable where he uses the dog to attack and injure the trespassing cattle.  The occupier of the land in such a case must be construed as having permitted the dog to injure the trespassing cattle, where such injury was incidental to the shepherding of the cattle by the dog even though the person concerned did not instigate an attack by the dog.  The same construction might apply where the dog injures trespassing animals where it is not under the immediate supervision of its owner &mdash; for example, <Col N="2362" /> during the night.  This would be an unreasonable extension of the proviso in subsection (4).  I do not think the amendment should be accepted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it makes any difference under what circumstances the attack takes place, whether the animals are straying or are on the owner's land.  The fact that the attack is permitted to take place is the relevant point.  By not accepting the amendment the Minister is weakening the legislation from the point of view of the farmers.  On balance and irrespective of the merits or otherwise of including the words &ldquo;or permitted&rdquo;, I believe we should weigh the section in favour of the person who suffers the damages.  In such a situation the person most likely to suffer damage will be the owner of the livestock or the farmer.  Why should we provide a level of protection for the owner of a dog that is not licensed when one considers the damages and loss suffered by the landowner?  It is a source of disappointment to me that the Minister is pursuing her opposition to the amendments no matter how objective they may be.  It is my opinion that the provisions of this Bill will be all the weaker because of her failure to accept the wisdom of the amendments we are moving.</P>

      <P>I have listened carefully to the arguments put forward by Deputy Hyland.  In a sense they are valid.  I know it makes it easier to secure a conviction in a case where cattle are attacked if one inserts the word &ldquo;permitted&rdquo;.  Deputy Hyland and all rural Deputies are aware that sometimes great hostility can exist between neighbouring farmers.  I have experienced this myself.  If cattle were to break into a field of corn in the early part of April, certainly that would create severe tension and hostility.  I and Deputy Hyland know what a farmer would do in those circumstances.  He would cause his dog to get rid of those cattle very quickly, and that has happened on numerous occasions.  In that situation the word &ldquo;cause&rdquo; is important, but it must be proved.  Were such cattle pushed out onto <Col N="2363" /> the public road causing a major catastrophe, where would the liability lie then?  In the case of a casual interference or trespass by animals onto another farmer's land there will not be that kind of hostility which would create a situation in which a dog would be caused to attack the animals.  I think it would arise in extreme situations only.  The section is designed to afford protection to the farmer concerned, that if he has had enough of it, he can take action.  There would need to be strong proof to get a conviction against him, proving him liable for any damage he might do.</P>

      <P>I understand fully what Deputy Dowling is saying but I am not sure how it relates to the point Deputy Hyland has been making.  The refusal of the Minister to accept our amendment boils down to this.  Let us suppose there are two men, each owning a dog he can fully control.  One of them sets his dog on cattle.  The other knows that his dog is attacking cattle, he is present but he does not do anything to call off the dog even though he can do with the one word. The Minister's refusal to accept our amendment would suggest that the former is more morally culpable than the latter.  I find that approach completely and totally unsustainable.</P>

      <P>I listened attentively to what Deputy Dowling had to say.  He appeared to be talking in the context of, say, one farmer's dog attacking a neighbouring farmer's livestock.  If he considers the situation I am sure Deputy Dowling will agree that there are many other instances of, say, dogs from urban areas going out into the country and causing very serious damage to livestock.  I am thinking here particularly of sheep. On the part of the farmer it would be very difficult to prove that the owner of the dog, if he can be established &mdash; this, of course, is another problem and relates to my earlier comments &mdash; caused the dog to stage the attack.  On the other hand it would be much easier to prove, in many instances, that the owner permitted <Col N="2364" /> the dog to cause the attack.  That constitutes the really important distinction between what Deputy Dowling is saying and the case I am endeavouring to make here.  I am saying to the Minister that the addition of the word &ldquo;permitted&rdquo; would strengthen this section, weighing it in favour of the individual landowner.  What more can one say except to plead that the Minister would see the logic of the amendment.  I cannot see how it would in any way take from the provisions of the Bill, but I can see tremendous advantage in adding the word from the point of view of their improvement.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dowling referred to the isolated case.  We must deal with and make provision for the isolated case in the preparation of this legislation.  In regard to civil action, they are the cases that can really cause problems.  I would much prefer this section clearly defined, leaving no ambiguity in its interpretation.</P>

      <P>We all know that a dog will naturally chase animals that come into a yard.  Quite a number of dogs will go without permission: naturally a dog will run for cattle.  If one's neighbour is in the habit of having bad fences and cattle tend to stray continuosly, naturally the other farmer becomes somewhat hasty.  But dogs will go mostly on their own.  It is different if a farmer deliberately incites or causes a dog to chase or get after animals.  Then there is a case for &ldquo;causing&rdquo; because one can get a dog to go simply by a word or a wave of the hand.  One sees that regularly in any farmyard.  Usually the dog is called &ldquo;George&rdquo; and one hears a farmer say &ldquo;Come, George&rdquo; or &ldquo;George go&rdquo;.  At that stage a farmer will have caused the dog to go and he would be responsible. One has not much control over some dogs and a dog could go without permission. It is a difficult case &mdash; I am not a lawyer &mdash; but I would simply make that point.</P>

      <P>I accept fully what Deputy W. O'Brien has said, but if one has no control over a dog then one is not permitting him to do any damage.  What we are talking about is a situation in which one <Col N="2365" /> can actually call the dog back with a word and one does not do so.  That is the same as causing a dog to attack cattle.</P>

      <P>We are really missing the point.  Perhaps the Minister is at a slight disadvantage here in that probably she does not understand things on the agricultural scene.  That is not meant as any reflection on her.  But I would say to Deputies opposite, and I will give a more practical example, that we all know of cases where dogs have been tormenting sheep &mdash; terminology very often used on the agricultural scene &mdash; where the owner of the sheep has informed the owner of the dog that this threat is taking place and when over a period of time no action has been taken by the dog owner to prevent attacks on those sheep.  I am sure it could be argued in court that this was not a deliberate act on the part of the dog owner.  On the other hand, he was aware of it and, by being so aware and allowing it to continue, he was permitting the dog to continue that attack on the farmer's property.  While I appreciate the logical points made by the two Deputies opposite, the point I am now making is in further support of the logic of our amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As a farmer, I understand the situation in rural Ireland.  I am giving a practical example of what happens on a regular basis.  By refusing this amendment we are missing an opportunity to strengthen the Bill and provide a level of protection for the agricultural industry.  It would not be the Minister's intention to deliberately do that but the advice given her is not in the best interests of the agricultural community.  What advantage is there in excluding the word &ldquo;permit&rdquo;.  The House has clearly indicated to the Minister that there is a very obvious advantage in <Col N="2366" /> having the word included, so why must she persist in opposing the amendment?</P>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a very clear distinction between farmland, open land and land containing housing estates and so on.  We are all aware that damage is done in open planned housing areas, by animals, to the annoyance of residents associations and so on.  In relation to cattle which get in over fences and do considerable damage there is a measure of protection that can be obtained.  I do not see that as a real problem, although it can happen.  I have great sympathy for farmers whose cattle stray into housing estates.  This legislation is designed to protect the person on whose land the cattle trespass.  We must protect the farmer who gets the cattle off his land. There have been disputes between families over cattle trespassing and trespassing is one of the causes of protracted disaffection between farmers.  The cause is important here.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Hyland in relation to cases where cattle stray onto non-farming land such as a housing estate.  In that case a number of dogs could be set upon cattle and damage could be caused. There is a distinction to be drawn there. It is extremely difficult to do that in the context of this section.  Once this legislation is passed and permeates society, people will take note of fencing, their animals and the protection they must give to the animals and to the public against straying animals.  This is the whole purpose of the Bill.  Perhaps as the Deputy said we have lost an opportunity but there will be other opportunities to cover the Deputy's point and I will support such legislation.  Here we are dealing with liability and I would not wish to see the farmer whose land is trespassed upon and whose property is damaged being prosecuted without serious cause.</P>

Will the Minister explain to the House the disadvantages of accepting my amendment?  Even from the Minister's point of view I do not see how the Bill will be made deficient by accepting the amendment.  It takes nothing from the Bill and I would press the Minister to accept the simple addition of the word &ldquo;permit&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I thank contributors on both sides, The contributions certainly indicate that farmers can differ on issues. The farming organisations, and the Department of Agriculture, were consulted and had no objection to the present text of subsection (4).  I can only repeat that the subsection does not apply in relation to wandering dogs.  It applies to dogs which are on their owner's land.  The owner will feel obliged to protect his property, including land, crops, cattle and other animals from trespassing dogs. It is natural that he may use his own dog in these circumstances to control the trespassing animals.  Subsection (4) is an appropriate provision to meet that situation which will make the occupier liable only where he causes the dog to attack trespassing animals.</P>

      <P>There does not seem to be any point in calling for a division for the sake of having a vote.  However, it is extremely regrettable that the Minister has not found it possible to accept my amendment which would contribute in a big way to the Bill.  The Minister appears to be opposing the amendment simply for the sake of opposing it.  I must confess that it is a source of disappointment to this side of the House that logical amendments, designed to strengthen legislation, are, almost by way of routine, opposed.  We will not legislate in the best interests of the nation if that prevails.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the past I have participated in debates where the Minister saw the logic <Col N="2369" /> of Opposition amendments and accepted them.  Members on both sides have put forward objective and constructive comments about the Bill but it seems that we will be voted out of court because the Minister will continue to pursue the direction from her Minister to oppose us.

      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 4, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(7) Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, it shall be a defence to an action for damages arising from an attack on a person by a dog to establish that the attack complained of arose from provocation of any kind by the person attacked or by any person acting in consort with him.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hope the Minister will see the logic behind this amendment.  I am not inclined to stay on my feet all night making a case for accepting it, particularly if it is to be a routine practice on her part to say &ldquo;no&rdquo; to all our amendments.  We believe the amendment will broaden the scope of the Bill and strengthen it.  Many people in these difficult times have guard dogs for their protection.  We are all aware that such animals can be provoked into action. <Col N="2370" /> In fact, the action of such animals has resulted in the person who provoked the dog being injured.  Such incidents are often followed by a claim in court for compensation from the owner of the dog. The owners of such guard dogs should not be left open to claims for compensation arising out of attacks provoked by an intruder.  Our amendment represents a reasonable precaution to be included in the Bill.</P>
    <P>We have all heard of people having to resort to the use of firearms to protect their family and property.  I do not mean to give the impression that I am encouraging such activity, although I can understand the circumstances that provoke people into such action but surely the owner of a guard dog is entitled to use that animal to protect his family and his property.  That person is entitled to the protection of the law if an intruder is attacked and injured by his animal in the event of the injured person taking a civil action in court for damages.  We are moving a little in the wrong direction here.  Some days ago I referred to the award to a prisoner arising out of him having set fire to a mattress in a prison cell.  That is an indication of the thinking in regard to civil actions.  As far as we can we should weigh our legislation in favour of the citizen who seeks to protect his family and his property against crime and violence.  If the Minister does not accept my amendment I will be extremely disappointed.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I support the amendment and what Deputy Hyland has said in moving it.  I was the first Member to raise this matter in the course of the debate on the Bill. As a Dublin Deputy I am aware of the fears of people leaving their homes or premises unoccupied.  I am sure the Minister of State is aware of the number of break-ins that take place through the city.  Houses and business premises left vacant overnight or for any length of time are liable to be broken into.  Many young couples who must go out to work to pay <Col N="2371" /> their mortgages have bought dogs to protect their premises while they are unoccupied. This is a very good amendment because it eliminates the owner of the dog that is there for one purpose only &mdash; to protect his premises &mdash; from being responsible for any attack on an intruder who would deliberately break into the premises.  I beg the Minister of State to accept this amendment because of what I have outlined.</P>
      <P>The other point I raised in my contribution to the Bill is the number of blind people who have to use guide dogs.  The owner of a guide dog should be eliminated from being subjected to being taken to court and having to pay compensation if his guide dog attacks somebody.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support my two colleagues. Section 3 imposes strict liability on the owner of a dog for damage caused by the dog when it attacks somebody.  Surely that strict liability, which operates no matter what the dog owner proves or how he is provoked, should not operate when the person who is injured by a dog brings it on himself.  We are trying to exclude that and it is perfectly logical and reasonable that it be excluded.  The Minister of State should in all fairness accept the logic of this amendment?</P>

      <P>I congratulate Deputy <Col N="2372" /> O'Brien on what he has said.  It makes perfect sense to me.  To add to it, provocation does not just concern a criminal coming in your door or window.  It concerns also somebody who attacks the owner of a dog, such a situation as Deputy Barrett has mentioned in relation to guide dogs for the blind.  Somebody attacks a blind man and his dog responds. That attacker has brought it on himself and the owner of the dog should not be strictly liable.  The Minister of State should take a very serious look at this.</P>

      <P>I wish to make it clear that I have no objection to the principle of this amendment.  I have been advised that this is already covered essentially by section 3(6).  The effect of that subsection is that damages can be reduced for contributory negligence by the plaintiff.  Provocation by the plaintiff can be taken into account by the court in that context, so damages could be reduced possibly to nil by the court where there has been provocation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me put it to the Minister of State that we are endeavouring to weigh the legislation and the provisions of this Bill in favour of the owner of the dog which attacked.  Why should we want to seem to weigh legislation in favour of the person who provoked the attack in the first instance?  It is a question of which way we are going, whether we are going to protect the law-abiding, law-respecting citizen or whether we are going to weigh the legislation in favour of somebody who for ulterior motives attacks, robs or whatever.  Why should we weigh this Bill and the legislation which will result from it in favour of the lawbreaker when we should be seen to be providing the maximum degree of protection for the self-respecting, law-abiding citizen?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It gets me back to our overall approach that we seem to be providing a greater degree of protection for the criminal than we are for the law-abiding, law-respecting citizen.  Surely the Minister of State can see the logic of providing that degree of protection for the law-abiding and law-respecting citizen, and our amendment is <Col N="2373" /> simply striving to do that.  What can one say on this side of the House except to appeal to the Minister of State?  She has heard the views of two of her backbenchers. I do not want to put them on a spot but they can see the logic and reasoning behind the amendment we are moving here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to the Minister for State's advisers, I do not agree that the situation is covered properly in subsection (6).  The Civil Liability Act, 1961, allowed the concept of contributory negligence to be introduced into our law. That means that if somebody brings an action for damages for negligence against a defendant and the defendant can prove that the plaintiff was to some extent responsible, that he also was negligent, damages can be reduced.  I have not got the Civil Liability Act before me and I do not know to what extent the damage can be reduced.  Perhaps they can be reduced to nil, but in the course of my practice and contacts with members of the Bar and of the legal profession I have never seen a case where damages were reduced to nil.  Deputy Hyland by his amendment is trying to ensure that in the case of provocation damages will automatically be nil, that it will be a total defence to the action.  From that point of view I would not agree that the matter is completely covered by subsection (6), even though I appreciate fully the point the Minister of State is making.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West</i>): I believe that the Minister of State has a certain amount of sympathy for this amendment, but with regard to what she said in reply I will give an example.  An old person keeps a dog as a companion and to protect him or her if somebody breaks in.  Somebody breaks in and the dog defends the old person, as happens regularly nowadays.  The culprit who breaks into that house can take that unfortunate old person to court.  The old person has to be dragged through the courts.  I have seen such people in court. They must wait there and do not know what is happening.  It is entirely up to a <Col N="2374" /> judge to make a decision as to whether the old person is liable for damages.  This is the time, when the Bill is going through this House, to agree to this amendment and make it clear that people in that category should not be subjected sometimes to paying damages.  Nowadays one does not know what amount of damages they might have to pay.  I would like the Minister of State and her advisers to reconsider this in view of what has been said not alone on this side of the House but also by Deputy O'Brien on her side of the House.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree with the manner in which the amendment is proposed and the thinking behind it and what it is designed to achieve &mdash; to give the necessary level of protection to the type of people for whom the proposers are concerned &mdash; there is another side of the coin.  When a person goes on to property a dog could be set on him for no apparent reason.  The person may not necessarily be a trespasser in the criminal sense, if one may draw that distinction, but a measure of liability could be apportioned to him in that situation.  We must be careful.  That would appear to be the situation in subsection (6).  We are looking at one aspect.  I support fully the proposal that old people who have a dog for protection should have no liability at all apportioned against them if they protect themselves and are seen to protect themselves.  The tenor of Deputy Hyland's thinking is quite laudable in that regard.  On the other hand, we must protect people.  We here may find ourselves in the next few weeks in a situation where dogs can be set on us.  Will we have any redress or any degree of liability?  That situation can arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was mentioned earlier that there was no point in putting forward well intendioned amendments but I do not agree with that.  This debate had been exceedingly worth while because it was explained what lies behind the wording of this Bill from a legal point of view. This has been extremely helpful to people like Deputy O'Brien and myself.  I did not agree with the last amendment which <Col N="2375" /> dealt with cause, but I was prepared to see what was behind it and I said at the end that I would have to support keeping the cause in the Bill.  This is a different situation and I ask the Minister to see what can be done about this before the next stage is taken.</P>

Deputy Barrett gave the example of the old person living with a dog for protection.  Some hooligan comes up, throws stones at the dog and is attacked, and the inevitable outcome is a claim for damages caused.  In fairness <Col N="2376" /> the old person should not have to go to the expense of going to court to defend the action brought by a law breaking citizen. Nobody in this House, and I am sure the Minister if she were not under the Whip, could logically disagree with that point.</P>
    <P>This Bill could be vastly improved as a result of constructive and objective debate in this House and could emerge as entirely new legislation providing the maximum degree of protection for the citizen, but this will not happen even if I stayed here arguing until the cows come home.  No matter what I say it will all be in vain.  This is a disappointment to me. I look forward to hearing the Minister's explanation of how she sees this amendment as being damaging to this Bill.</P>

      <P>I have a certain amount of sympathy with the views expressed. The degree of provocation can vary. Under the present text, the court will take the degree of provocation into account.  Under the terms of the amendment, &ldquo;from provocation of any kind of person attacked&rdquo;, any degree of provocation would relieve the dog owner of liability and this might not be appropriate.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Dea mentioned case law.  We have not found any recent Irish case but in the Scottish case, <i>Gordon versus McKenzie</i>, 1913, it was decided that provoking or teasing a dog so that it bites would be contributory negligence, but merely passing a dog wandering in the street would not.  However, there seems to be a difference of opinion on this. Would the Deputies agree to let us have another look at this before the next stage?</P>

      <P>In page 4, subsection 2 (a), line 20,, after &ldquo;Garda Síochána&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;or any local authority&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is designed to give effect to amendment No. 7 in the name of Deputy Hyland which I propose to accept in principle.  However, I have been advised by the draftsman that all that is needed to give effect to this amendment is the insertion of the words &ldquo;or any local authority&rdquo; after &ldquo;Garda Síochána&rdquo; and that the words &ldquo;or servant or agent of such local authority&rdquo; in Deputy Hyland's proposed amendment are superfluous.</P>
      <P>One effect of this amendment will be that the local authority power to impound trespassing animals given by section 4 (2) (a) will not be confined to the functional area of the local authority in each case as under the present subsection (3).  However, I consider that the omission in the reference to functional area is acceptable since, in practice, local authorities confine such impounding to their own functional areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Amendment No. 8 is a drafting amendment consequential on amendment No. 6.  Because of the effect of amendment <Col N="2378" /> No. 6 it is necessary to delete the words &ldquo;on a member of the Garda Síochána&rdquo; from subsection (2) (b) of section 4.  It is also necessary to delete the words &ldquo;where the authority concerned has so requested&rdquo; and to substitute therefor the words &ldquo;on request by the authority by which such public park or open space is owned or occupied&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 8 also deletes the reference to the Garda Síochána in subsection (2) (b).  This is necessary as the impounding powers now conferred under amendment No. 6 will not be confined to the Garda but will also be conferred on the local authority. Arising from amendment No. 6 the phrase &ldquo;the authority concerned&rdquo; is being deleted from subsection (2) (b) and is being substituted by another phrase to prevent ambiguity.</P>

I acknowledge that the Minister has found her own formula for agreeing with the amendment put forward by Members on this side of the House.  It highlights the point I was making earlier that it always seems to be the policy that those on the Government side will not agree outright with the points made on this side of the House.  This amendment simply finds a new format of words to say exactly what was said in my amendment.  To that extent I am grateful to the Minister and I appreciate that she has seen the logic and wisdom of what I was trying to do.

      <P>I also thank the Minister for accepting the substance of our amendment. The purpose was to tighten up the provisions in relation to impounding, which are fundamental to this legislation. I accept that the Minister has gone as far as we suggested in our amendment.  The practical effect is that some people have power to impound animals in a public <Col N="2379" /> place; other people have power to impound animals in a public park.  An open space is slightly different and a public road is an entirely separate matter. Eric Blair, better known as George Orwell, gave us the wonderful concept of newspeak and oldspeak&mdash;this is a typical example of Dáilspeak.  The whole thing is in danger of being strangled by bureaucracy.</P>
      <P>Under subsection (2) (b), if animals are found wandering in a park owned or occupied by a local authority the Garda cannot move in to impound the animals without the prior approval of the local authority.  I am one of the few Deputies who represents a constituency where two local authorities are operating.  Limerick County Council, of which Deputy O'Brien is a member, is an excellent authority and if one gets in touch with them about getting something done it is dealt with very quickly.  We have another local authority, namely, Limerick Corporation, and I sometimes think that if the entire city fell down it would not wake up some of the people in the town hall.  I pity somebody who wants Limerick Corporation to give permission to a member of the Garda Síochána to remove a wandering animal in one of Limerick's public parks.</P>
      <P>Could any formula be devised to deal with the situation where an animal is about to cause immediate danger in a public park?  Could the procedure be short-circuited in such a case?  The garda is the best person to get things done quickly.  It is impossible to find words to cover every conceivable situation but I would ask the Minister to consider some provision whereby action could be taken in the case of imminent or immediate danger in a public park owned or controlled by a local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The definition of public place includes any street, road or other place to which the public have access with vehicles.  I presume the intention is to designate a public place as a place to which the public have access with mechanicaly propelled vehicles.  Does the word &ldquo;vehicle&rdquo; include a non-mechanical vehicle such as <Col N="2380" /> a bicycle?  Perhaps the Minister could clarify that point.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 10:</P>
      <P>In page 4, before section 5, to insert the following new section:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;In urban areas, no liability shall attach to occupiers of property where animals already straying enter into and escape from property where the occupier of the property is not the owner of and has not custody of such animals.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We tabled this important amendment as a result of views expressed on Second Stage and widespread public concern. Animals may stray from the road on to <Col N="2382" /> the property of a householder and, while leaving the property of their own accord or being driven off on to the public road, they may cause a serious accident.  It appears that adequate protection is not being provided for the owner of the property. It is extremely unfair that a householder or property owner could be open to a claim for damages arising from an accident taking place as a result of the animals leaving the property.  The animals could have strayed in and out of their own accord and could be injured by a car, a pedestrain or someone on a bicycle.  To take it a stage further, what would be the position of the property owner who drove the horses or cattle from his property on to the road and, as a result, caused an accident?  In that case, the owner of the property should be protected from the eventual claims which would arise and from which compensation could be claimed.  Naturally, the owner would not be responsible for having stray stock on his property and he should not be responsible either for any claim for malicious damage which might arise as a result.</P>
    <P>This might not seem to be a very significant part of the Bill but I am sure everybody here could envisage that kind of situation.  I am very strongly of the view that, if the Bill is to be fair and effective in dealing with the problems which may arise, we should cover all eventualities. The legislation and the terms of this Bill should weigh in favour of the innocent property owner and protect him or her against any claim for compensation which would arise following a court case which would cause serious financial difficulties for an innocent victim.  I notice that there has been a change of personnel in the front bench and I respect the Minister's views in relation to agricultural matters. He is a man with a rural background and an understanding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I support the views of Deputy Hyland.  The situation envisaged in our amendment applies to an urban area.  In Limerick city, stray horses wander into gardens and, under the terms of section 2, if the owner deliberately turns those animals out on the public road, he could be found liable for negligence. If he allows them to wander back on to the public roadway knowing that it is dangerous, he could also be found liable for negligence.  Deputy Hyland's amendment is simply seeking to eliminate that possibility which could give rise to most unfair consequences.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>That seems to give a new concept to section 2 and, if that is so, there is something wrong with the construction of the Bill.  If animals stray on my property, have I no authority to drive them back on to the public roadway?  Am I supposed to leave them there in case I cause an accident?  If that is the case, there is a serious defect in the Bill and I am asking the Minister to clarify it.</P>

      <P>As the law stands, if you drive cattle off your property on to the road, you are liable for any damage they may cause.  In many cases, cattle could stray in and out of your garden without being noticed.  Would you be responsible for an accident in such a case? You might be told that you should have kept your gates closed but many modern gardens do not have gates.  Would the same apply to an open park?</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West)</i>: I speak as a Dublin Deputy and I know the problem in respect of animals straying into people's gardens.  There is a serious problem in the city in regard to itinerants' <Col N="2384" /> horses continually straying in estates. People have a right to put those animals out of their gardens and if, in doing so, the animals are injured the person who put the animals out is responsible.  That law should be changed as this kind of thing happens continually.  Perhaps the Minister could clarify this and I should like him to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment deals to some extent with section 2.  It is trying to protect the owner of unfenced property or where there is trespass.  I thought that section 2 applied to places like the Curragh, County Kildare, which is open grazing land for sheep.  They come on to the public roadway but the owner of these sheep is not liable for any damage caused. I always assumed that that was the case and that where animals stray on private property in urban or rural areas the owners are not responsible for damage caused.  If that is not so I would need to have some reference made to it before I could offer further comment on the amendment.  I assume that what is embodied in the amendment is already part of the Bill.  I hope I am right in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 2 does not cater for this kind of situation.  The section is quite specific about areas such as the Curragh and other traditional open areas. It does not make any specific provision for the case I am endeavouring to cover by my amendment.  I have given the classical example of animals straying of their own accord and causing an accident and perhaps even loss of life.  The case where animals are driven out by the owner of the property on to the road and cause a serious accident will be interpreted more seriously in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would be happy to withdraw the amendment if the Minister can give us a categorical assurance that under the terms of the Bill the property owner is fully protected.  If she cannot give such an assurance she should not oppose the amendment until such time as she is in a position to satisfy Members on both sides of the House that property owners are <Col N="2385" /> not at risk but are fully protected in that kind of case.</P>
    <P>This is a fundamental amendment.  If it serves no purpose other than to clarify the matter it will have done a good job. There was quite an amount of public concern in relation to it arising from the debate on Second Stage.  We had a very constructive and objective debate and the Minister's replay was a very comprehensive one.  The Minister is almost off the hook now because this is the last controversial amendment but it is an important one.  I hope the Minister will be in a position to put our minds at ease and say that the property owner is fully and adequately protected in relation to any claim for damages which might result from an incident such as I have described.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NualaFennell" hpid="Mrs. Fennell Mrs. Fennell">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Fennell</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot give a categorical assurance.  It is not appropriate to lay down a black and white rule as to liability in such cases.  It would not be acceptable for an occupier of land to drive trespassing animals on to the public road into the path of an oncoming vehicle and then have statutory freedom from liability even where serious damage or injury was caused.  This is a case where it would be more appropriate for the court to decide the degree of liability having regard to the circumstances of the case.  It appears unlikely that a court would hold the occupier of the property to be liable for damages caused by an animal in the circumstances referred to in the amendment, that is, where the animal strays on to the occupier's land, escapes from it and subsequently causes damage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's reply confirms my worst fears in relation to the section and the House will now see the importance of my amendment.  It is impossible to accept that the owner of a property cannot remove animals which stray on to the property and cause considerable damage.  This amendment is very important.  Under the terms of the Bill the property owner could be held liable for damages arising from an accident as a result of having put animals off his or her property.  What is the owner of <Col N="2386" /> the property to do if he or she finds eight travellers' horses stampeding on his or her property and destroying, say, the front lawn?  Are they to close the gate and allow the horses to do further damage? Where does the person go to have the animals removed?  How long before they can be legally removed?  What amount of damage would be done in the meantime and what redress will the property owner have against the owner of the animals who very often cannot be found?</P>
      <P>There are two very serious aspects to this amendment.  I hoped the Minister would have been able to put my mind at ease and say that the property owner would not be liable.  The Minister should not oppose this amendment until we are in a position to have further clarification of it.  It is so serious that no one on either side of the House could accept this part of the Bill.  I hope the Minister will find it possible to accept the amendment but I think it is unlikely.  However, it is not unreasonable to ask that the remainder of Committee Stage be deferred so that we can have full clarification of this section. I do not want to create an undesirable position for the Minister but it would be for the best and in the interests of the people if we deferred the debate until we have been assured on this point.  On further consideration with her advisers and with the Minister it might be found possible to accept the amendment or to find some other form of wording to cover what I am asking the Minister to do.</P>
      <P>This is a matter we cannot slide over. I am tempted to have a division on this because it is of fundamental importance to the Bill but I do not want to call a vote unless I have to.  It would be better if the Minister accepted the suggestion I put to her.  We should defer further consideration of Committee Stage until the Minister is in a position to state exactly what the position is in relation to this section. Nobody will thank us for allowing the Bill to slip through the House without knowing exactly what the position is in relation to it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's answer is not acceptable. If necessary I will put our amendment and have a division on it.  It is <Col N="2387" /> fundamental to the Bill and it is fundamental in the interests of the protection of the rights of citizens.  We should endeavour to weight our legislation in favour of self-respecting, law-abiding citizens and not for the protection of people who are flouting the law and deliberately allowing animals to stray on the roads and cause destruction to property.</P>
    <P>I am not an urban Deputy.  The leader of my party and many urban Deputies in the party brought to my notice the very serious problem that exists in Dublin and other cities of wandering horses.  As a rural Deputy I can observe that casually. Since the introduction of the Bill I received many telephone calls and letters from urban dwellers pointing out that this is a major problem in the cities.  I would not have thought so as a rural Deputy. My colleague, Deputy Barrett, confirmed that in his contribution today.</P>
    <P>We must take a stand on this.  Instead of forcing me to call for a division, I would prefer the Minister to agree to my request to defer further consideration of the remainder of Committee Stage. There are only a couple of amendments left, some of which are the Minister's and I will be quite happy to accept them.  We would be doing a grave injustice to this House and to the people if we glossed over this.</P>
    <P>A division will not resolve the problem. It will resolve it from the Minister's point of view because she will succeed in getting Committee Stage through the House.  It would not be in the best interests of anybody to have a division and let that be the end of the story.  It would be much more desirable to have the point clarified.  The Minister should agree to my request until we can get definite clarification on the point.</P>

    <P>&ldquo;5.&mdash;In urban areas, no liability shall attach to occupiers of property where animals already straying enter <Col N="2388" /> into and escape from property where the occupier of the property is not the owner of and has not custody of such animals.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>It does not say that the occupier of the property has driven out the animals.  I do not think this amendment is necessary. The animals could go into and out of property without the occupier knowing it happened.  There may be an obligation on the owner of the animals.  I understand that the amendment deals with cattle that came from a farm and made their way into a public park or private property and left that property at 3 o'clock in the morning without the owner knowing that the cattle were there.  It would be most unreasonable to suggest that that person should be responsible for the cattle.  I could understand the logic in making the owner of the cattle responsible, but I cannot see in my wildest dreams why we should have an amendment to protect somebody who did not know the cattle were on his property.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated clearly that it was not legally acceptable to turn animals back out on to the road. If I understood her correctly she was not able to confirm that there could be a claim against the owner even if the stock strayed out of their own accord.  I do not think Deputy O'Brien's point of view is in accord with the Minister's reply.  The owner of the property would still be put to the expense of having to defend himself or herself in a court case arising from a claim for damages.  Why should the owner of a property be put to that unnecessary expense when he was not a contributor to the accident in the first instance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will withdraw my amendment if the Minister can give us a categorical assurance on this point.  She is right not to give it when she feels she cannot give it and when the advice available to her is that she cannot give it.  This is an essential part of the legislation.  I want to hear whether the Minister will accept my request that we adjourn Committee Stage to enable the matter to be clarified <Col N="2389" /> legally for the House.  If the best legal advice available to us confirms that the owner of the property is not protected, this is a very desirable amendment.  I should like to hear from the Minister.</P>

Under the existing law when animals stray on to a farmer's property, the animals are not turned back out on to the public road.  The Minister gave an assurance that that cannot be done now where animals trespass on to a farmer's land.  It would not be proper to turn them back out on to the road.</P>
      <P>There is an understanding between farmers that that does not happen and that the farmer will try to find the owner of the animals and draw his attention to the fact that they are trespassing and have them removed in the normal way.  Where animals trespassed into private housing estates the owners and occupiers were protected under the law and often sought and were granted a considerable amount of compensation for damage done.  The Bill is designed to give a measure of protection to people who have been injured, maimed or seriously disabled by straying animals on public roads.  Section 2 endeavours to give that protection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 5, as I understand it, deals with the impounding of animals and the procedures attached thereto.  Perhaps someone will explain why this amendment is being tabled.  I agree with the substance of it, but this protection is already embodied in legislation.  No adjudicator in court would give a decree against a person in a housing estate for even driving off animals in these circumstances and the amendment is not put as strongly as that. The animals have no business being in these areas.  They cannot be left in a front garden overnight.  Also the fact that there are open plan estates is taken into account.  I cannot see any difficulty arising out of that section.  I hope an assurance can be given to allay the Deputy's <Col N="2390" /> doubts.  If a case has been brought to court under that heading, attention should be drawn to it.  This amendment is drawing unnecessary attention by the Deputy's belief that something like that is necessary in the Bill.  I ask him to consider the amendment on those grounds.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Dublin North-West):</i> I should like to feel as Deputy Dowling does about this.  Under the present law if an owner of property drives an animal on to the road in an urban area, even though he is not the owner of the animal as the owner of that property he is liable.  With regard to my own constituency, I earlier used the word &ldquo;plague&rdquo; with regard to itinerants' horses.  I am referring to a vast area of Finglas, where there is a very serious problem with hundreds of straying horses.  If the owner of the property on to which these animals stray drives them out and they are in contact with a pedestrian or a motor vehicle with the resultant serious injuries, from whom can that injured person claim compensation except the owner of the property?  The itinerant can never be found.  If the Garda make inquiries about a certain named individual there could be ten with that name in the camp.</P>
      <P>I support Deputy Hyland in his plea to the Minister to accept this important amendment.  Deputy Dowling did not think there had ever been a court case but there is always a first time.  Perhaps there have been previous cases that we do not know about.  I appeal to the Minister and her advisers to accept this amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickDowling" hpid="Mr. Dowling Mr. Dowling">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment makes no reference to people driving out those animals.  It mentions animals straying. The amendment is not necessary to protect the person who owns the land, because he is probably in bed and unaware of the cattle straying on to his lawn and could not possibly be held liable.  If the amendment were reworded to include the driving of cattle on to the road, it would be a better amendment.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have looked at the wording of my amendment.  While I agree that it does not refer specifically to somebody turning out the animals on to the road, I would have thought that the spirit of the amendment would imply that.  The scope of the amendment could also be broadened in the sense that I commence with the phrase &ldquo;in urban areas&rdquo;.  That is the difference between what I have been saying and what Deputy Dowling has been saying in relation to agricultural areas.  I fully agree that, generally speaking, there is a good understanding between land owners and stock owners in rural areas in relation to the turning out of livestock on to the road.  What Deputy Dowling has said is absolutely correct.  I suppose in strict legal terms it would apply to rural as well as urban areas.  I was prompted to table this amendment because of the views of many urban dwellers who contacted me in relation to this problem.  I would be the first to admit that I am not familiar with the entire urban scene.</P>
      <P>I would have been very happy if the Minister had been able to tell the House that there would be no liability attaching to the owner of the property in the event of an accident occurring.  I was not sure of the exact legal position but did get legal advice.  That legal advice available to me indicated that it would be a marginal situation in legal terms.  Because we are putting together a Bill in relation to this area of administration, I thought the matter should be clarified.  That is what I am trying to do in this amendment: to get positive clarification about the position of the property owner.  The Minister's reply has not been very reassuring.  I think the Deputies opposite will agree with me on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dowling has said that I should not have raised this matter, although he did not put it as bluntly as that.  He implied that I was stirring up something that I should not.  That is not a fair comment to make.  The Members on this side of the House would be happy to accept the situation if the property owner were fully protected under this section.  From what we have heard from the Minister, <Col N="2392" /> he or she is not.  Instead of having to accept the accusation that I should not have raised the matter &mdash; and there was nothing vindictive in what Deputy Dowling said in this regard &mdash; I feel that I have done a service to the House in highlighting a possible serious anomaly in this Bill. We would all be delighted to accept from the Minister now or at some stage an assurance that the property owner is fully protected.  The Minister is more familiar with the urban scene than I am and I am sure she must come across this problem far more often than I.  I do not think I have ever come across it, personally.</P>
    <P>Dublin Deputies on this side of the House are no different from the Deputies on the Government side and they come across this problem on a very regular basis.  It is an area of extremely serious concern to a large number of urban dwellers. They would not thank us if in this Bill &mdash; which to some extent is designed for their protection, in fairness &mdash; there was a section which held them responsible for damages as a result of animals straying from their property on to the road.  The Minister has not yet indicated whether she would agree to postpone this section until we get definite legal advice on it.  If not, and I do not call votes for the sake of calling them, I would have to call for a division to highlight the importance and significance of this matter.  I assure Deputy Dowling that I am not doing this for ulterior political motives.  I am doing it because this is a matter which at least needs clarification and at worst needs amending.  My request to the Minister is fair and logical and I hope she can agree to it.</P>

      <P>If the Chair might intervene for a moment.  I wish to point out that under Standing Order 92 and rulings given on it by my predecessors it would not be possible at this stage to postpone consideration of the section in question after consideration has been started on it.  I am not going into the merits of the following, because that would be wrong of me, but a device sometimes used to get over a situation like this is that the Minister might say &ldquo;I will have <Col N="2393" /> a look at this between now and Report Stage and say what I think then&rdquo;.

      <P>We are discussing urban areas and the liability attaching to occupiers of property where animals, usually horses, stray.  It would be desirable if the owner of property or other agents who will be given power in this legislation would get the Garda to intervene and have the animals impounded.  On the other hand, there is the risk that an angry property owner would just open the gate and, with great gusto and energy, chase the animals out on to the road&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I have trouble with the amendment as it is worded.  I am an urban Deputy and I accept that perhaps there is not a sufficient safeguard for the property owner in this instance.  However, there would be difficulty with the amendment because it is rigid.</P>
      <P>I have said that I cannot accept the amendment but in view of the strength of the views expressed perhaps it could be looked at again.  I do not want to be unreasonable.  Perhaps the points raised could be considered on Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I have endeavoured to be reasonable with the Minister in the course of this debate.  The Minister has told us she finds it difficult to accept the wording of the amendment.  If that is so I have no objection to her bringing in her own form of wording provided it gives the level of assurance I am seeking in the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure Deputies on all sides will agree that the Minister has not been reassuring in her second reply.  She talks about the danger of the property owner driving stock on to the public road and, by implication, she is saying that in so doing the person is committing an offence and is breaking the law.  If that is the case, <Col N="2394" /> the section provides no level of protection for the unfortunate urban or rural dweller who finds his property being destroyed by, for example, travellers' horses.  With our knowledge of what is happening in urban areas and the destruction that is taking place, I consider we should avail of this Bill to provide that necessary level of protection for the property owner.</P>
    <P>Naturally I accept the viewpoint expressed by the Chair.  Perhaps I am not as familiar with the procedures of this House as I should be and perhaps the Chair will give me some guidance on the following point.  In the event of the Minister giving further consideration to the amendment on Report Stage, will I be in a position then to challenge the Minister in relation to this section?  I am asking this question because of my desire to cooperate with the Minister and with the Chair.  However, I would need a categorical and definite assurance that on Report Stage I will be in a position to put forward this amendment and, if necessary, to vote on it.  I do not want to involve the House in a division this evening.</P>

If the Deputy withdraws the amendment on the understanding that the Minister will look at the position again between now and Report Stage and perhaps advise him before Report Stage is taken whether she proposes to accept the amendment in a redrafted form and if she comes to the conclusion she cannot accept the amendment or that it is not necessary to bring in any amendment in its place, then it would be open to the Deputy to put down his amendment again on Report Stage and force it to a division.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to highlight the general neglect of Cork city and county areas in regard to the lack of job opportunities and of any kind of permanent employment in the southern part of the country.  I realise this is a national problem.  As usual, Cork expects to receive some kind of special treatment and, in this area, we are deserving of it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Cork city and county area has been haemorrhaging for some time.  The sad part is that old industries and, latterly, old traditional family firms, hardware firms and general merchants have been forced to the wall.  This is particularly sad because these families and their businesses went back several generations <Col N="2397" /> but, because of the environment in which they must now endeavour to make a living, they are being forced out of business. The Government should take action to create a better environment for industry and for the retention of jobs not alone in Cork but nationally.</P>
    <P>I might give some idea of the scale of the problem in my area in which I have a particular interest and will have around the middle of next month.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question on 13 February last the Minister for Labour indicated that there were then 458 people unemployed in Kinsale, 564 people in Bandon, 580 in Clonakilty, 371 in Dunmanway, 836 in Skibbereen, 539 in Bantry and 331 in Castletownbere.  I suggest that the general environment in which industry must now operate is totally adverse and penalises management and owners of firms alike.  The general effort to retain employment is rendered more difficult because of the taxation of jobs, the high levels of PRSI contributions rendering the general cost of maintaining somebody in employment for the average employer far too great.  If there is an option afforded an astute manager nowadays between machinery or equipment of some kind &mdash; in particular the automated equipment now available &mdash; and labour, then every encouragement is given him to opt for the machinery.  First, the firm can avail of very attractive grant aid for equipment, re-equipment or modernisation. Generally, because of the very difficult labour and work and management practices now in industry, an astute manager will find that he will have much less trouble with his equipment or machinery than he would with his labour force.</P>
    <P>It is about time we realised that if we cannot produce goods or services comparable to those available elsewhere, we shall rapidly go out of business and, unfortunately, that is what is happening. In the matter of quality of product or of service it is a sad fact of life here today that we cannot compete, though we should be able to compete because there are sufficient pressures on us to do so.  But more often than not &mdash; I know <Col N="2398" /> this from my contacts with people and from being in business myself &mdash; an Irish product will not have the same consistency of quality as an imported one.  That applies to both products and services.</P>
    <P>In the food area there have been a number of reports contending that our importation of food was a scandal.  In this respect Cork and many other areas have tremendous job potential.  One of the reasons there is so much food imported is that many of our traditional industries in this area were unable to compete because they did not keep pace with developments taking place in the market place.  If Irish firms do not realise that the consumer will purchase what they want, and more and more that they want something that suits them, which has a convenience feature built into it, that if they cannot produce suitable products, suitably packaged and merchandised, then all the &ldquo;Buy Irish&rdquo; campaigns in the world will be of no use.</P>
    <P>I call on the Government to examine the penalisation of the ordinary working man in terms of taxation.  Despite claims that there was some alleviation of his position in this year's budget the reality is that his situation has worsened.  I would request the Government to investigate the IDA operation in South Mall in Cork, giving them the personnel and resources required to get permanent jobs in the area.  I realise that the Minister of State at the Department of Labour is doing what he can.  I took the opportunity before of complimenting him on having introduced the enterprise allowance scheme which got people going, doing a decent day's work rather than being paid for doing nothing on the dole queues.  I should like to see more of that type of imaginative thinking.  I would ask him for heaven's sake to look at the overlapping quangos in some of our Government Departments who bicker with one another while people continue to go on to the dole queues, spending taxpayers' money in all directions simultaneously. There should be at least a section of the small industries grant aid division of the IDA situated in the South Mall in Cork. <Col N="2399" /> They should have at least one full technologist to develop the food and fishing industry; of that area.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>While I cannot claim the intensity of personal experience that other Deputies can I wish them to know that those of us who are not from the Cork region share their distress and anguish in the difficulties they have faced in recent years. Having said that, it is important that this debate be put in context and that it be seen against some overall background. We should not pretend to ourselves that Cork is somehow different, that it is a black spot when the situation is different. Unemployment in Cork county is less than the national average.  The situation in Cork city is more grave in that it is somewhat worse than the national average, but that is fairly typical for the larger urban areas all of which deviate upwards from the national average.  If Cork city is taken in comparison with some of the larger urban areas like Limerick and Dublin, it compares favourably.  I say that, not to diminish the seriousness of the situation and not in an attempt to downplay the difficult problems faced by people who through no fault of their own find themselves out of work there, but because it is necessary to say that what we are talking about is one part of a national challenge.  It is neither practical nor responsible to attempt to isolate that challenge in terms of looking at a region and solving the problems there.  There <Col N="2400" /> are only two ways in which that can be done.  We can take resources from somewhere else, thereby moving the problem or we can spend more money, which means squeezing more money out of the already oversqueezed taxpayers including the taxpayers of Cork city.  The experience in Cork as everywhere else has been that our excessively high rate of taxation required by the high levels of public expenditure that we require for ourselves has contributed in no small measure to the difficulties of enterprises in surviving in the present climate.</P>
    <P>If we accept that what we are talking about is the localised presentation of a national difficulty we must accept that the response to it must be a national response.  Deputy Joe Walsh in his comments addressed himself to a number of national issues, such as taxation, the role of various State agencies, the relevance of various special schemes and so on. That was a reasonable approach to take because the problems we face whether we are talking about Cork city and county or nationally will only be solved on the basis of our capacity to compete on the domestic and international market in terms of price and quality.  On that there is some good news &mdash; inflation is now closer to the EC average than it has been for many years.</P>
    <P>Our capacity to solve our problems nationally and in Cork depends on the extent to which a climate for investment can be created, on the performance of various job creation agencies such as the IDA, in future the NDC and in other parts of the country, Údarás na Gaeltachta and SFADCo, and it depends on Government policy such as the extent to which the public capital programme can be directed at labour-intensive areas. This applies on a national level and all of those helps will hopefully have the effect of creating a rising tide.  It would be possible for us to stop there and say as others have said that a rising tide will lift all boats.  We on this side of the House reject that philosophy because we accept that some boats were so fragile or have been so severely ruptured that for them the rising tide will be of no avail.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2401" /> We have accepted that while the overall responsibility must be to try to increase the level of economic activity, there is a need to identify groups who need special support and assistance.  In that context we have identified two groups who are particularly disadvantaged. One group which has only recently received attention is the long term unemployed. On the difficulties of the long term unemployed, it is worth saying that it is the case that the duration of unemployment in Cork is considerably shorter than the national average.  But all of the evidence available indicates that the fact of being long term unemployed diminishes one's prospects of securing employment and that when vacancies arise one's prospects of competing successfully are minimised.  The Government have introduced the social employment scheme aimed at that category who, to date were excluded from participation in the paid economy and who seemed condemned to a life of idleness through no fault of their own.  We are giving them an opportunity to be reintegrated into the paid economy.</P>
    <P>The other area of concern relates to the problems of the young, particularly those who have left the educational system without qualifications or with minimal qualifications.  As Deputies will be aware a whole range of special measures have been taken by the Government in that area.  I would mention the teamwork scheme operated by my Department. It may be of interest to Members to know that this year already some £965,000 has been allocated by way of grants in Cork city and county.  That allows for the employment of 343 workers on 33 projects.  The projects we have approved for this year will be of longer duration than those that have heretofore applied.  There are a number of other applications in hand and these will be processed without delay.</P>
    <P>In that regard, one thing that has been particularly satisfactory has been the quality and imagination of the programmes that have emerged from the Cork area.  I am thinking in particular of the scheme run last year &mdash; I understand it will be run again this year &mdash; by the <Col N="2402" /> county board of the GAA providing worthwhile employment for young people increasing traditional skills and at the same time providing a valuable social service for the young people of Cork.  I am thinking also of the quite extraordinary work of Fr. Rock who works with youngsters who might otherwise have been left aside.  He has rallied to their needs and in doing so has secured the support of the Department of Labour through the teamwork scheme.  The imagination shown by the voluntary sector in Cork, by the Fr. Rocks, by Ogra Corcaigh and some sporting organsiations could usefully be emulated in other parts of the world.</P>

      <P>Despite all the huffing and puffing that went on in the House last night we must all agree on one thing: that Cork has suffered worse than most places over the last number of years because of the closure of many of its traditional labour intensive industries.  At least we can agree on that point.  We should take it from there in a positive and constructive way.  There are two different sources <Col N="2403" /> from which we can get figures.  Those figures show that the rise in unemployment in 1984 in the Cork region was less than half that on the two previous years. The rise in unemployment was the same as the number of jobs gained in Cork.  The increase in unemployment came about because of the influx of 1,400 people onto the labour market.  That is the challenge that faces us in Cork.</P>

      <P>Minister Bruton last night outlined in detail the number of jobs that went to Cork in the last 12 months and Minister Birmingham gave us details of some of the youth projects in progress in the Cork region at present.  Last night we were told that the increase in VAT had an effect on the construction industry in Cork, but nobody mentioned the house grants were doubled from £1,000 to £2,000 and that the Government announced a £5,000 allocation to local authority tenants who surrendered their houses. The Opposition conveniently omitted to mention that.</P>
      <P>I should like to outline some of the infrastructural work carried out in Cork in recent times.  Two new bridges, the Custom House bridges, were opened in recent months and the Opera House bridge and the Grand Parade bridge are in the course of construction.</P>

The Department of the Environment have allocated £8.431 million to Cork for maintenance and roadworks this year and our neighbours in Cork County Council got £11.69 million under the same heading.

      <P>I spent all day last Friday at a conference in Cork organised by the Association of European Journalists which was addressed by many well known personalities.  It was sad that Opposition Members last night did not refer to how best we can use EC resources in conjunction with local and national programmes in order to correct the problem of the industrial structure of the Cork region. We can devote our resources to small and medium sized businesses and to the job opportunities such concerns can provide. I should like to know what our MEPs are doing in Europe.</P>

      <P>He is not a Member of the House.  European parliamentarians must be looking at why the economic recovery is doing little to brighten the prospect of the unemployed in the rest of Europe while at the same time millions of jobs are being created in Japan and the United States.  We should be asking why European economies are so inefficient in regard to job creation compared to their trading competitors.  Is it because there is a lack of co-ordination at national level? Those questions should be answered. Our European parliamentarians should be addressing themselves to those problems.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A proposal I should like to make is that the State seriously consider asking State employees to go into retirement at 60 years of age.  Should we be creating incentives for State employees to retire at 60 and let the jobs go to young people? Should some of the £200 million we get from the EC for youth projects be used in that area?  Last night the Opposition asked us not to make a political point about the runway for Cork Airport.  They made a case for the project to commence immediately.  There is dishonesty in that approach.  Two weeks ago we were told that Aer Rianta have not submitted a case to the Government on that proposal. I should like to congratulate Deputy Walsh on his constructive speech in which <Col N="2406" /> he raised a number of important issues. Some of the questions posed by him require serious answers.  I congratulate him on his constructive attitude to the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to dispel the nation that somehow or other unemployment is the fault of the Government and that they are not doing enough about the problem.  No Government will ever be able to do enough about the problem because resources will not permit them; but the Coalition, within the financial constraints, have done a great deal for Cork.  They have made some notable contributions in the areas of decentralisation which many Members talk about, although we see precious few examples of decentralisation.  The Government in decentralising the small industries board of the IDA set up an autonomous board in Cork to deal with small industrial development.  That move proved very successful and the idea is being applied to other parts of the country.  An Board Gáis, established by an earlier Coalition Government, looked like following the trend of so many other State organisations by being dragged to Dublin.  It is not so long ago since there was reference to a new headquarters for An Board Gáis being acquired in Dublin.  However, the Government took a practical step by appointing a Cork chairman of that concern. An Bord Gáis is now firmly established with headquarters in Cork due to the action of the Government.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Communications has announced that the local radio headquarters will be established in Cork.  With those examples I hope I have dispelled the notion that the Government are centralising everything in Dublin and not taking note of the aspirations of the regions, in particular the Cork region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to refer to some of the other things that are happening in Cork through the direct action of the Government.  Ringaskiddy has been designated for a higher level of grant and a major marketing campaign by the IDA has been conducted over the last 12 <Col N="2407" /> months which has led to the establishment of one major industry there and it is no secret that a number of other very serious inquiries are in the pipeline.  That is the direct result of a Government decision in relation to the task force report. In addition to that, the decision to designate it a free port will have a significant effect in the marketing of Ringaskiddy. On the other hand, I urge the Government to get ahead quickly with that legislation which I must say has been promised for too long.</P>
    <P>In relation to some new capital projects in Cork I would like to refer to the construction of a new enterprise centre at the North Mall by the IDA, the completion of a new craft centre at Shandon also by the IDA and substantial financial support to the electronics research centre at UCC, all of which will support actively an industrial infrastructure for the future of Cork.  Deputy Allen has referred to infrastructure of roads, quay walls, bridges, housing, schools and other projects of that kind and I want to mention a few others.  There are two new sports halls, one commencing construction in Mahon, and construction of the other will commence shortly in Carrigaline.  In addition to that, an announcement was made of a major new sorting office for An Post which is at the planning stage, and a badly needed new labour exchange in Cork.  A major expansion of the school of music is at the planning stage and will take place in the not too distant future.</P>
    <P>Cork industry, not just the new industry but the old also, is revitalising itself.  In particular I refer to the active support given to the revitalisation of Murphy's brewery with the international company Heineken.  Beamish and Crawford have extensive expansion plans which are being aided also by the IDA. Also commendable are the progress and improvement in the older industries such as Sunbeam and the Irish Refining Company. It is not all a black picture in Cork. Of course there are problems.  There will always be problems if you lose major industries like Fords and Dunlops over which no Government have any control. <Col N="2408" /> The new industries in the electronics and mechanicals fields such as Pfizer are revitalising themselves and expanding&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If we are talking about competitiveness and expansion of industry we must leave it to the industrialists to expand in the most competitive way they can, and we support that.  Of course, it does not create as many jobs as it did of old.</P>
      <P>I would like to refer to Cork 800.  Cork is helping itself there in a very practical way and the Government have supported that initiative by a grant of £300,000 to establish a new park in the centre of Cork which will make a major impact on the environment ther in the years ahead. On the question of transport, the airport is enjoying a much better performance than heretofore, and this Government will support the expansion of the airport. A ferry link is very important to the region and I will do everything I can to impress upon the Government the necessity of supporting the establishment of a ferry with private interests in 1986.  There are proposals, which will be published very shortly, by private interests to develop a ferry service for 1986.  A priming grant will be needed to assist and develop that ferry for the future and I will be looking to the Government for that.  That is very important to the region of Cork and Kerry.  Now I will defer to my colleague.</P>

Also I thank him for ensuring by grant aid a paper factory in Bartlemy last week.  It takes a while to turn the ship and the ship is turning, but I would like to make a number of concrete proposals here tonight.

      <NameTxt>Miss M. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that everything possible will be done to ensure that it has a sewerage scheme.  The dockyard in Cobh closed down last year and I appeal to the Minister also to see that it will be opened as soon as possible because Cobh is badly hit by unemployment.</P>
      <P>The IDA in Cork had very few inquiries from foreign companies in 1981 because nobody had confidence in our economy.  Any foreign investor with economic common sense did not want to invest in an economy that was going down the Swanee any more than any of us would want to invest in a company that was going bankrupt.  However, in 1983 there was a major increase in the number of inquiries from foreign companies and some of those inquiries have resulted in factories being established in the Cork region.  I am glad to report also the reopening in Fermoy of Silver Pail Dairy Limited after their closure in recent weeks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The tide is turning.  However, we have one major problem about employment from which other countries do not suffer so badly caused by (a) the high cost of electricity and (b) the high cost of transport. I urge the Minister to ensure that the oil comes in from our coast as quickly as possible.  Immediate and urgent steps should be taken to ensure that.  The cost of employment is a major determinant and in this International Youth Year the Minister should make some effort to alleviate PRSI for people under 25 to ensure that they are not caught in the vicious &ldquo;Catch 22&rdquo; cycle where they cannot get a job because they have no experience <Col N="2411" /> and they have no experience because they cannot get a job.</P>

      <P>Listening to my colleagues on the other side of the House I began to think that there were two County Corks in Ireland, that which I come from, where all the problems are, and that which they come from, where there are no problems.  What Deputy Allen and Deputy Coveney have been outlining here tonight is a fallacy.  For the last year and a half at least in the local press we have read reports that the Minister notified Deputy Allen and Deputy Coveney and Deputy someone else how this thing was going to start and that thing was going to start, that many of the things they have referred to here tonight are operating.  It is very unfair to be referring to these matters here tonight as if they were going to affect the unemployment situation in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister's contribution last night I was most disappointed with his response to the very serious situation both locally and nationally. This is a clear indication of the Government's lack of commitment in dealing with the problems of the nation. We have been saying for some considerable time that the economic strategy and the economic policies being pursued by the Government since they took office are the major contributory factor to the problems we face today.  In three budgets we criticised the Minister and Government and said the strategy being adopted would not achieve what they said.  That is where the buck stops.  Since this Government came into office 44,000 people have been added to the dole queues.  Tonight Government Deputies are criticising us for highlighting these facts and for standing up and saying what the people in Cork and the rest of the country have been saying for a very long time.  There is total disillusionment and a lack of confidence because there is no <Col N="2412" /> leadership in this Government and no confidence in the Minister with responsibility to deal with these problems.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister reminded us that the unemployment situation in the greater Cork area had already been the subject of a special report by a high level working group.  Unfortunately for us nothing has been done up to now as a result of that report.  Lots of things have been said about it and I am glad Deputy Coveney admitted that there has been no action taken on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughCoveney" hpid="Mr. Coveney Mr. Coveney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coveney</NameTxt>
      <P>That is one item.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanWallace" hpid="Mr. Wallace Mr. Wallace">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>The free port is the point about which we had all the noise in Cork. Six months after the EC authorised that report nothing has been done, and I will tell the House why.  It has been held over for the local elections as a political gimmick to ensure that the Government will have something to put before the people when the time comes.  That is the attitude of this Government to Cork and to the problems of the country generally.</P>
      <P>The report has not been publicised. We failed to get copies of it.  Why all the secrecy?  Why were the full contents not released?  There are a few copies available, but we have been unable to get any. I believe that we have been saying for a long time many of the things that are in that report and that they brought home the truth to the Minister and the Government about the situation in Cork.  That is why they did not release this report.  The industrialists and business people in Cork are more concerned about the problems in Cork than this Government and, unfortunately, the Deputies who represent that area have failed to make any impact on the problems in the Cork region.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe, as do many others, that the present difficult economic situation exists today because of the policies followed by this Government.  They are obsessed with eliminating the budget deficit instead of trying to eliminate the unemployment problem.  Their priorities are wrong.  As long as the Government adopt these monetary policies which look well on paper, they will not be concerned about <Col N="2413" /> the effect their policies are having on the country.  Their motto seems to be that if you are unwilling or unable to find a solution to a problem, then you simply redefine the problem.  In this case the elimination of the current budget deficit has replaced the elimination of unemployment as the primary aim of the Government policy.</P>
    <P>Last evening the Minister was very critical of my colleagues for bringing this matter before the House, for expressing their serious concern and for highlighting the serious problems that exist in Cork. He accused us of being political and parochial in our attitude to today's problem of unemployment.  I would like to remind him that the commercial and industrial people of Cork have spoken out repeatedly about the serious situation they are facing and appealed to the Government to treat the situation seriously but all that has fallen of deaf ears.</P>
    <P>The Protestant and Catholic bishops of Cork have also spoken out on numerous occasions about the problems and the Government's attitude to Cork. They have spoken about the Government's lack of concern in treating those problems seriously.  I am sure the Government will not accuse the bishops of being political when they speak out on behalf of the people.  The Auxiliary Bishop of Cork, Most Rev.  Dr. John Buckley, attended a meeting at which all political parties were represented, and some of the Deputies here tonight were present too.  He spoke out about the lack of concern being shown by the Government to the problems in Cork.  He indicated very clearly to 400 men and women that this Government appeared to be more concerned with social problems, such as contraception and divorce, than dealing with one of our most major problems, unemployment. The people were not looking for the things the Government were offering them.  What response did the bishops get that night?  The audience made it very clear who was speaking for them.</P>

      <P>Last night the Minister told the Cork Deputies to be more positive, to encourage the people and to say nice things about what was happening in Cork.  The Minister might think there are many good things happening in Cork, but there are even more things happening which are not so good about which he does not appear to know anything because, if he did, he would not have made that speech here last night.</P>
      <P>The Minister said he listened to the remedies put forward by Fianna Fáil Deputies, that they would cost £115 million of taxpayers' money to remedy the problems of Cork and that that was not on.  Unfortunately, it is because of the present economic policies pursued by this Government that we find ourselves in this situation and £115 million is not a great sum.  He did not say that much of that £115 million would be for some of the projects which Government Deputies are now claiming credit.  Last night my colleagues said many of the things that were spelled out here tonight by Deputy Allen and Deputy Coveney.  The Minister's sincerity in this area has to be looked at.</P>
      <P>The taxation system is the kernel of our problems.  How many Cork deputations have come to Dublin to meet Minister after Minister?  Deputy Allen referred to the benefits for the construction industry but he did not say that 53 per cent of the people who should be employed in that industry are unemployed.  That was not said here tonight but it is the reality.  Cork Deputies from all parties recently met the CIF and spelled out the problem, getting a very sympathetic hearing.  As far as the Government are concerned, it ended there.  They have taken no action in Cork.  Deputy Coveney knows better than any of us how the construction industry has been affected in Cork.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2415" /> The Minister says we are being negative in our attitude.  What assistance is being given to service industry?  When are we going to realise that it is entitled to develop and expand to the same extent as manufacturing industry?  This is an area where the Minister can make a positive contribution, if he so decides.  If leadership were given and incentives were made available people would respond in areas like agriculture, fisheries and food processing.</P>
    <P>People are demoralised and disillusioned, particularly young people. Another 50,000 young people will shortly be coming out of school.  What are they facing?  Recently the president of the IFA was taken on a tour of the constituency to show him the way people are living. Instead of employing political gimmicks and bringing IFA people to the constituency, who can make no decisions on behalf of the people, it would be better to bring the Ministers there and let them see what is going on.  They would then have much more appreciation of the realities. There is no leadership, no commitment and while this continues the country will go down the slippery slope.  I appeal to the Minister to give young people hope for the future by a reversal of the current economic strategy which is doing so much damage.  I wonder if we can ever recover if they do not see sense before it is too late.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you for the opportunity of speaking on this very important motion concerning employment in Cork city and county.  It is sad that we have had to put down such a motion because of what has happened to our city and county under this administration. When they took office a mere two-and-a-half years ago Cork had full employment but today there is a whole area of industrial wasteland.  It was nice to hear Deputy Coveney, a man who has a good industrial background, speak so practically and admit many of the Government's failings.  We must remember that it was under Seán Lemass that the industrial foundation was laid in the <Col N="2416" /> city and county of Cork.  It was continued under Jack Lynch as Taoiseach.  They developed our educational facilities and gave us a pool of graduates to develop our industrial wealth.  The Cork Regional College has a very large number of students and turns out graduates of a high calibre every year who are looking for jobs in the area of electronics and technology. Side by side we have University College, Cork, which has a proud history of turning out some of the brightest and best professional people.</P>
      <P>Cork county and city have a very large representation on the Government side. Tom Raftery represents us in Europe.  I was listening very attentively to Deputy Allen talking about what Deputy Fitzgerald is going to bring back, but a representative from one of the Government parties must have greater influence, although I have not heard very much from him except waffle Monday after Monday in <i>The Cork Examiner.</i> He has been a disappointment, especially in view of the promises he made during his election campaign.  We have ten Fine Gael Deputies, two Labour Deputies, two Fine Gael Senators, one Labour Senator and one Independent who has a sympathetic leaning towards the Labour Party and is proud to boast of it at times.  We have a senior Fine Gael Minister who was president of the Council of Ministers in Europe in his capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He has run away and gone into hiding when we have had problems in Cork.  We have two Ministers of State &mdash; one in the area of food processing development in the Department of Agriculture and the other in the Department of Foreign Affairs, who would rather be jet setting around the world than looking after the affairs of his county.  Now we have promise after promise as we face the local elections.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>That makes it worse. The total number of people out of work in the city and county of Cork is in the <Col N="2417" /> region of 25,000.  There are 13,500 in the city and 11,600 in the county.  We have one-eighth of the total population of the island, in the region of 400,000 or 500,000 people.  The county provides one-sixth of the total agricultural production of the island.</P>
      <P>In the food processing industry, where over the years the IDA have spent millions of pounds, we have seen a very serious milk war between the major co-operatives. I am very disappointed at the silence of the Minister for Agriculture in this matter of national importance where jobs will be lost and farmers will suffer seriously.  I call on him to take immediate steps to deal with this alarming situation. The milk processing business is our largest food industry and unless these problems are solved many jobs will be lost and diversification will be discontinued. Great progress had been made in this area and I appeal to the Minister to advise these co-operatives that it is in their own best interests to stop this war.</P>
      <P>When Fianna Fáil left office in 1982 there were 834 people unemployed in the town of Mallow.  Today that figure is in the region of 1,400, an alarming increase. The figure in Fermoy has also doubled. This has happened due to lack of Government policy.  People are despondent because there is no confidence and no will to invest.  Until that situation changes there will not be effective job creation. The indecisiveness of the Government must be blamed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Fermoy we have an industry which was developed from indigenous resources.  I refer to Home Grown Timber Limited, better known as Woodfab Ireland Limited.  That plant was recently threatened with closure because of the failure of the Minister for Fisheries and Forestry to make timber available at a time when further development could have been taking place.  We can become exporters of timber and we have a market on our doorstep in the UK where they import 90 per cent of their timber requirements. Our forestry development is suffering under this administration.  In my own <Col N="2418" /> constituency people working in the forestry division have told me that maintenance work is not being carried out and that storm damage is not being repaired. This will add to the problems of future development of the availability of timber because if you do not maintain the forests and remove the thinnings you will have abnormal growth and timber and trees will be of little use for processing.</P>
    <P>I welcome the development of Beehive but I hope it is not a local election promise, as that would be very sad.  We have seen many openings in the last few weeks and I hope that is not because 20 June is so near.  I shudder to think what will happen after that.  Cork is the gateway to the southern region and the lack of a ferry and the failure of the Government to develop Cork Airport are major constraints in the industrial development of that region.  We have been told that Cork has only a 6,000 feet runway and that they need one in the region of 8,000 feet to 10,000 feet.  I am aware, from meeting business people, that because of the lack of other facilities at Cork Airport it takes three days to go from Cork to Hamburg whereas, if you live in Dublin, you can do it in a day.  The Government must examine that whole area and see that Cork Airport is developed to its full status if we are to get the maximum from the region and the county.</P>
    <P>The lack of a ferry service is a major loss to the southern region, especially to Cork from the tourist point of view, the development of hotels and ancillary services which could help employment.  In the past, seasonal work was provided by hoteliers but that is no longer the case. To travel to the southern region now you must come via Rosslare and it is a long journey from there to Kenmare.  The journey could be cut by half if we had a ferry service.</P>
    <P>We have heard rumours about the threatened sale of Erin Foods at Mallow.  This industry was founded and built up by a Fianna Fáil administration and I appeal to the Government to make a statement regarding the position of Erin Foods.  Will it be closed?  Is it for sale?  The Government should allay the fears of the farming <Col N="2419" /> community and the workers in that industry because we have been told so many different things.</P>
    <P>We have a further scandal in relation to the closure of Irish Shipping.  On the day that a Japanese supertanker came to the Shannon Estuary with coal from Columbia for the ESB power station, the <i>Irish Rowan</i> was being offered for sale in the South China Sea.  Hong Kong ship-owners and others were involved in legal battles concerning Irish boats while ships and tugs were being brought from Glasgow to help berth a coal boat coming into Moneypoint.  This is just one indication of the shortsighted policy of the Government in scrapping Irish Shipping and then letting Japanese boats draw coal and materials to this island.  Every boatyard in the country has now closed down and there is nowhere to get a boat reconstructed or extended.  At the same time, the Minister for Energy is running around the country talking about offshore development, licensing and so on.</P>
    <P>I was very impressed when I got a copy this evening of the Cork Chamber of Commerce magazine.  In an article, the President of the Chamber of Commerce said that he believed the statement made by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism on 11 May 1984 regarding formal commitments to Cork and the Cork region.  The President said that these commitments must be acted on fully and without undue delay if the hopes of Cork people raised by the appointment of a task force were not to be dashed.  The failure to fulfil these commitments would reduce the appointment of a task force to a level of cynical political exercise designed to take the heat out of the situation pertaining in the city.</P>
    <P>The Lord Mayor of Cork referred to a sum of £300,000 provided for a city centre car park.  This is no substitute for the industries which have closed over the years.  Verolme, Fords and Dunlops are all gone because of the lack of will on the part of the Government.  I will be very disappointed if Deputies on the other side of the House do not vote with us <Col N="2420" /> tonight because I know they are ashamed and embarrassed by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ToddyOSullivan" hpid="Mr. O'Sullivan Mr. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any cause for shame or embarrassment on our part, although there is cause for concern.  Unfortunately, I was not present here last night but, from what I heard and read in the newspapers concerning the debate, very few constructive ideas were put forward as to how we could resolve these problems.  The problems were identified but no solutions offered.  It is the duty of the Government and Opposition to find solutions but we have ignored the reasons for the major problem in Cork.  It was strictly financial from the point of view of the major industries. They went where labour was cheaper; it is as simple as that.  Fords and Dunlops left this country because the workforce are paid less in other parts of the world.  The situation regarding Verolme Dockyard was in our own hands and something should be done about it. If there is any hope of revitalising the yard, which is extremely important because we do not have any engineering facility, the Government will have to ensure that this vital link in our industrial chain is maintained at all costs.  No other industry has the capacity to provide jobs in the short term.  If we even got an order for one ship, 800 jobs would be created in a matter of weeks.</P>
      <P>Wages were at such a high level that Fords and Dunlops opted out of this country but Deputies know that the Taoiseach offered considerable enticements to the Ford Motor Company and to Dunlops to remain here.  The Eagle Printing Company was Irish owned and managed and was a cornerstone of the industrial base in Cork for many years, yet it closed its doors simply because its profits were not good enough.  It was not making a loss.  It was actually making money but its profits were not great.  How far can human greed go?  They were prepared to make people redundant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many positive steps are being taken.  I was not here last night as I was present at a meeting of Cork VEC where proposals for the setting up of the Community <Col N="2421" /> Training and Employment Consortium were presented to the committee who are to be involved in this area.  Deputy Wallace said that some measure of the magnitude of the problem should be taken.  COMTEC will do that.</P>
    <P>Deputy Ahern referred to Whitegate. That has not been fully exploited.  There is ample scope for petro-chemical industries to be developed and I hope this will be one of the items the National Development Corporation will tackle. We are not getting the maximum out of our natural gas.  It is a cheap form of fuel but to go on burning it indefinitely would be foolhardy.  NET has proved it can be profitable.  I have no doubt that things will improve in the near future.</P>
    <P>Everyone accepts the plight of the building industry but unfortunately we have spare capacity with many thousands of square feet of factory floor space unoccupied in Cork at present.  That is regrettable. We should take a leaf out of the book of our European partners.  In Denmark 90 per cent of the industrial base is native owned.  In Cork there are very few firms, with the exception of <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and Sunbeam Wolsley, employing 400 people which are Irish owned.  This is regrettable.  Where is the Irish entrepreneur?  Is he a mythical figure?  What kind of incentives do we need to give?  It has been said that at present it is very expensive to employ people.  The Government will have to tackle this problem.  I am very aware of this as a Government backbencher.</P>
    <P>It is difficult for any Deputy to represent Cork at present.  I share the concern expressed by my colleagues on the other side of the House but we must not lose heart.  Glib remarks about contraceptives, condoms and other matters&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The decision by the Government to abandon the Fianna Fáil decentralisation programme was a disastrous mistake for the future development of the country.  This Government's lack of commitment to regional development will cost our people dearly.  A recent report on the growth of Dublin by the Eastern Regional Development Organisation is frightening and the fact that by the end of the century one in three people will live in Dublin has horrific implications for our economic and social development as a nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent paper entitled &ldquo;Ireland in Economic Space&rdquo; by a distinguished Corkman, Professor Leonard Wrigley, he compared decentralisation in a number of European countries and maintained that in public administration Ireland is 22 times more centralised than Switzerland and in industry it is the same. It is three times more centralised than Finland and four times more centralised in industry.  As regards Denmark it is twice as centralised as regards public administration and three times as centralised in industry.  These figures prove my point.  Regional planning and development is now more urgent than when we entered the EC.  Any decisions taken or moves made by Fianna Fáil have been shelved and abandoned by this Government. The reasons advanced are a scarcity of funds but the truth is that these <Col N="2423" /> decisions will prove far more costly in the long term and the real problem is lack of interest by the Government in the growth and development of the provinces.</P>
    <P>I appreciate what the Minister said last night about the unemployment problem not being confined to Cork.  I will quote some of the things he said and, along with what the Minister of State said tonight, they both appear to think that the problem in Cork is not as serious as in other parts of the country and that because of that all of us, including those Deputies on the Government benches, are wasting our time in moving a motion of this nature in the House.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister said:</P>
    <P>To put some facts on the record: let me be frank about it, there has been an unacceptably large increase in unemployment in Cork in the last year due to a number of factors, the recession, the very rapid growth in the labour force and the fact that there are more people seeking jobs for the first time than there are retiring but, unfortunately, there is nothing we can do about that.</P>
    <P>If that is not defeatism I do not know what is.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>Those people are there and we have to provide for them.  I recognise that there is a very serious unemployment problem but to pretend...that this problem is in some way unique to Cork is foolish.  The situation is quite the opposite.  Taking the figures from February 1984 to February 1985 we see that there has been a smaller increase in unemployment in Cork than in the State generally, yet the Opposition are looking for special treatment in an area where there has been a smaller increase than in the rest of the country.</P>
    <P>He is contradicting what the Taoiseach said a year ago.  I remind the House of the urgency with which the Taoiseach went to Cork because the Chamber of Commerce dinner happened to coincide with the closure of Fords.  That showed great handling by the national handlers. <Col N="2424" /> The Taoiseach hastened to get full value from the announcement about the task force and, having sympathised with the Cork people, he went on to say:</P>
    <P>The Government have, as you know, established a high-level working group to advise urgently on all possibilities to create new jobs and protect existing jobs in Cork.  The group have been working very intensively on the task with which they have been entrusted and have been meeting different interest groups in Cork, including representatives of this Chamber, to discuss with them the causes of existing job losses and how these might best be remedied.  The report of the working group is expected within a matter of weeks and the Government will act quickly and urgently on the recommendations which they make.</P>
    <P>I am quoting from the Taoiseach's speech as delivered at the annual dinner of the Cork Chamber of Commerce on 10 February 1984.  The report was issued some months later but to my knowledge no one has seen it.  What has been concealed? What is being covered up?  One must ask why the report was not released.</P>
    <P>I said I appreciated what the Minister had said about the problem not being confined to Cork.  The truth is that a number of major closures there have had a traumatic impact on a city already hit hard in the construction industry and other service industries.</P>
    <P>Last night's change of heart by the Minister from the commitments he made to Cork a year ago is disappointing.  He made some commitments on 11 or 12 May in the run up to the European elections. He made high-sounding noises about 1,000 jobs for Cork.  I do not blame him for the closure of Fords and Dunlops, once solid, gilt edged bastions of Cork.  I do blame him for not following up with replacement jobs and for not maintaining Verolme Cork Dockyard which is 48 per cent State-owned.  Last night the Minister said Cork must do it on its own.  I have absolute confidence in the spirit, resilience and determination of the people of Cork to recover, but they must have <Col N="2425" /> confident leadership and support which this Government have not given and obviously have no intention of giving. I am fed up with task forces, working parties, teams, committees, schemes, programmes and promises.  The people of Cork now want jobs.</P>
    <P>As a matter of urgency at least part of the European Regional Fund must be channelled directly into the regions. Local authorities must benefit directly, and then we can hope for a levelling off of living standards between regions. Remember this was one of the great hopes of our entry to Europe.  The reverse has been the reality.  Cork, then on the crest of a wave, has been going down ever since and has now been abandoned by this Government.  Ask the people who are working hard to attract industries what are the impediments in Cork for visiting industrialists.  They will list the approach roads to Cork from the Dublin side, the lower river crossing, the roads from Cork city to west Cork especially beyond Bandon, the inadequacies of Cork airport, the lack of access to Kilbarry industrial estate and the benefits we could get from an extension of the gas grid throughout Munster.  These are the type of programmes which should have Government support.  Regional fund aid would attract the productive industrial jobs the Minister made such play with last night.  These schemes would also boost a building industry on its knees in Cork at the moment.  Nobody knows that better than Deputy Coveney and the indications are that, by the end of the year, it will be flat on its face.</P>
    <P>The Minister claimed credit last night for investment in the deep water berth. The new harbour development was all Fianna Fáil's work with the exception of the last phase.  All the harbour development money was provided by Fianna Fáil. Let me remind Deputies of the difficulties we had in this House and outside it in forcing the Government's hand to make the last amount of money available.  It was deferred in their first budget in 1983.</P>
    <P>Not one Cork city or county Minister or Minister of State has contributed to this debate.  I welcome Deputy Creed as <Col N="2426" /> the only Minister of State from the area who had the courtesy to show his face in the House for a little while.  Only with sheer pressure from us and the embarrassment caused to the local Minister was the final phase proceeded with and then only after an unnecessary delay.  We all know infrastructural development must be proceeded with well in advance of the viable industrial jobs about which we heard so much from the Minister last night.</P>
    <P>Regional planning and development are vital for the future development of our nation.  The type of infrastructure I talk about is a necessary prerequisite to attracting viable permanent industry to replace the jobs lost and to provide the additional jobs needed for our young growing workforce.</P>
    <P>Once again we heard a new chapter in the story of the National Development Corporation.  I wish them well but I must be cynical and suspicious.  This latest airing is not unrelated to the Labour Party Conference at the weekend.  For once the RTE commentators agreed with me on that all day yesterday.  Remember the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism stabbed the Tánaiste in the back on the eve of last year's conference and was suitably admonished. The Tánaiste told delegates at that conference: &ldquo;By the time I speak to you again next year the National Development Corporation will be in operation&rdquo;. There is still a long way to go.  There is confusion.  Last night the Minister had a script which made certain references to the National Development Corporation. He refrained from delivering part of that script for some reason best known to himself, perhaps because of time constraints or some more sinister reason.  I will leave it to the Minister to answer that.</P>
    <P>This corporation has been with us in various shapes and sizes since the mid-seventies. It has been put forward as the cure for all our ills.  I predict that on the eve of next year's Labour Party Conference I will be telling the House that no job has been created by the corporation. A very serious consequence of the lack <Col N="2427" /> of interest by this Government in the regions is the lethargy now being shown by Government administration and State board personnel.  Some of our State boards made a big deal out of holding a board meeting in Cork to mark Cork's 800th anniversary.  Deputy Coveney claimed great kudos for keeping a State board in Cork.  I did not think that was a great achievement.  Our boards should meet in Cork far more often and indeed in the other regions.  This might improve the tunnel vision some people possess towards the regions.</P>
    <P>I referred to the inadequacies of Cork airport.  I appreciate that the investment needs are expensive but while waiting for those improvements - and I hope we will not have too long to wait for them - at no cost scheduled services out of Cork could be directed to connect with early morning services to the Continent. Because of the tunnel vision of a State board they cannot accommodate Cork and Shannon despite what they tell you about their trips to the Continent and what they cost.</P>
    <P>The ferry has been mentioned.  Deputy Coveney is an honest Member of the House but, with tongue in cheek, he referred ashamedly to the lack of a ferry in Cork's 800th year.  This was disgraceful. A small investment in that ferry could have paid dividends throughout the Cork-Kerry tourism region.  That was the greatest sin of this Government in Cork's 800th year.  The fare from Cork to London is too expensive for a family visit. Rosslare is the nearest connection by sea and this journey entails a long overland drive.</P>
    <P>We have been waiting for one year for legislation on a free port.  Is this because of a malaise at Government level?  I want to ask about the B &amp; I.  I understand that certain moves are being made today.  A <Col N="2428" /> good, sound, solid Corkman worked hard, as I am sure every Member of the House would agree, as chairman of that body.  I understand he has been replaced by a friend of the Minister.  Jim has fixed it.  On 10 February 1984 the Taoiseach said he hoped Verolme would be successful in achieving further orders not alone from the B &amp; I line but also from the international shipping scene and that Ireland must prove itself competitive in price and in quality in the market.  Now we have no Verolme.  We have strange happenings in B &amp; I.  We will hear more about that in this House and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If the Government give us the leadership and the necessary tools in Cork &mdash; and the tools to which I refer are the infrastructural needs of the area, which are in short supply &mdash; then Cork will recover its old spirit, its resilience and its independence.  Let the Government forget about their public relations exercises. We want jobs now &mdash; real jobs, not programmes or schemes, or teams, or promises.</P>

    <Title>Adjournment Debate. - Cork City Crime.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to thank the Chair for allowing me the opportunity of raising on the Adjournment the frightening growth of violent crime on the streets of Cork in recent weeks.  I am sorry that it has been necessary to do this. I am also sorry that a phenomenon that has appeared to be growing on the streets of our capital city for some time seems to be spreading to the provinces.  In the previous debate I spoke on the need for regional development but in this instance I do not want to see regional development taking place.</P>
      <P>The growth of crime in Cork city and its surroundings in recent weeks is causing grave concern to people in the area.  The alarming growth in the number of incidents coupled with the viciousness of the crimes, is terrifying people.  I fear that, if it is not dealt with urgently, loss of life or lives can be foreseen as well as continued harassment from these criminals.</P>
      <P>No doubt the House will be aware that in the past weekend a colleague's car was taken when he was at the Opera House at Cork on Sunday night where an over-sixties talent competition was being held. The car of Deputy Lyons was taken and it was driven to another car park.  Members of the public alerted the Garda, showing the good Cork spirit that still exists.  Deputy Lyons' car was taken to another car park and at one stage it was driven in the wrong direction in a one-way street, causing material damage to other vehicles.  There is also the dreadful thought of what could have happened if people had been on that street at that time.  It is a tribute to the Garda, that before Deputy Lyons even knew his car had been stolen when the show at the Opera House was over, the Garda recovered it.  In that connection they deserve to be complimented.</P>
      <P>A frightening aspect is that on Friday night a garda was physically injured when one of these thugs reversed a car over him.  That garda now has to use crutches. Gardaí and civilians have been injured in these incidents.  The Minister has an obligation to ensure that there is an adequate number of gardaí in Cork, the removal of restrictions on patrol duties and that there are no curbs on overtime that would deter the pursuit of criminals.</P>
      <P>I know there are difficulties with regard to the bail problem and I sympathise with the Minister.  However, the problem must be overcome.  It is extremely urgent that it be overcome if we are to see the ordinary people of our city and county, our region, generally get the type of protection to which they are entitled.  The rapid growth of crime in recent weeks is in stark contrast to the statements of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice that crime was on the decrease.  In the area of justice, this Government are as much out of touch as they are in any other area under their control at present.  All facilities appear to be available to Garda policing our unnatural Border at enormous cost to the taxpayer.  I believe that the citizens of Cork are entitled to the very same protection and facilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The relationship between the Garda and the people of Cork has been excellent since the inception of the force &mdash; I should make that clear &mdash; at all levels they have become involved in the sporting, cultural <Col N="2433" /> and community life of the region.  The kind of community spirit existing between them is positive and healthy and long may it continue.</P>
    <P>Deputy Lyons could tell the House that some parcels from his car, obviously lost in the streets, were returned to him since the incident on Sunday night, which commends the civic spirit displayed by so many good Cork people.  The Garda are entitled to be properly equipped, to be given every facility for their protection, helping them to protect the citizens as well.  Urgent action is needed and one must ask the Minister to take immediate steps to curb this growth.  I repeat that many people are absolutely frightened. On a rare occasion one may have seen a car careering along a one way street in the wrong direction, a genuine mistake on the part of its driver.  That in itself is frightening, but, when that act is done deliberately, how much more frightening, lethal and dangerous can it be for innocent, law-abiding citizens not in any way involved.</P>
    <P>The recent opening of a prison on Spike Island, while welcomed, caused considerable concern to many in the region.  The Minister may wonder why it caused concern.  It caused concern because the facilities of television and central heating received much publicity, though perhaps they were needed.  Certainly it constitutes a big change from the facilities available to our naval forces during their years of long service on the island.  That is why it was of some concern. Loyal people that they are, one will hear no complaints from those forces.  I sympathise with them in that it would appear that the facilities extended to them over a long number of years were not good enough for the people who replace them there.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister, the Minister for Justice of the day; it is his responsibility and I want him to stamp out the violent crime and thuggery taking place in Cork city at present.  If it is happening, the early closure of Garda stations must be discontinued.  If there are curbs on overtime they must be lifted.  Every opportunity must be given to the Garda <Col N="2434" /> to pursue these criminals, bring them to justice, making our streets what they always were, easy-going, happy streets in our southern capital.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East</i>): I am sorry to hear that Deputy Lyons lost his car the other night.  Part of the argument has been made by Deputy Gene Fitzgerald that he was able to get it back within a very short period of time.  Deputy Gene Fitzgerald also referred to another incident in Cork, that of a garda being injured on Friday night last.  He did not mention to the House that the perpetrator of that crime not alone was arrested by the Garda but was convicted and is now serving a jail sentence.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East</i>): I think Deputy Lyons's personal problem has interfered with his usual rationality in this House.  He should allow me to continue and not scream at me.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of January 1984 26 extra gardaí have been allocated to Cork. The Cork Garda are very well equipped. As the Deputy quite well knows three new Garda stations have been constructed in Cork and I hope to open them shortly.  As a matter of fact the situation in Cork is better than in most places in the country.  There is always crime but, in the two examples which the Deputy gave here this evening, one car was recovered within, as he said, a very short period of time &mdash; on which the Garda are to be congratulated &mdash; and in the other instance the perpetrator is now behind bars and serving a prison sentence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East)</i>): Unauthorised car taking in the Cork area over the past few months has been reduced.  I am sorry that there is still crime but I am afraid it is a fact of modern life that always we will have some level of crime in our cities, towns and country areas.  For example, in Cork, crime in the first three months of this year was reduced by 3.6 per cent.  There was a reduction last year as well.  While any Deputy can come into this House and point to a dramatic incident which occurred in any city, town or county in any week the overall trend in Cork is very good.  Cork is very well policed.  I was delighted to hear Deputy Gene Fitzgerald compliment the Garda Síochána this evening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Of course we cannot be complacent. Even though the Garda in Cork arrested and charged 40 people with the unauthorised taking of cars since 1 January last 20 of whom have been convicted already and are serving jail sentences, that allows <Col N="2436" /> no room for complacency.  I hope the process can be speeded up so that anybody awaiting trial in Cork will be convicted as well.</P>
    <P>Recently I announced that a special unit would be established to deal with the problem in the Dublin area.  That has proved very effective over the past couple of months.  I also said that the unit in Dublin would be issued with spiked chains to control the incidence of high speed joyriding and ramming of Garda cars.  I can say now that if the Garda believe there is a need for this equipment in the Cork area they will be provided with it.  I am not going to allow thugs or vandals to career through the streets of our capital city or any other of our cities. I am delighted that the Garda action in Cork has been so effective, so quick on the two incidents named by the Deputy here this evening.  I hope they will continue to be quick and efficient, that people will be processed through the courts and put into prison if that is the wish of the courts.</P>

      <Col N="2437" /> I am glad Deputy Gene Fitzgerald welcomed the opening of Spike Island.  I am sure he knows Cork Harbour very well. On a nice fine day it is very picturesque. It is nice to be on an island on a fine day, when the sea is calm, one can look back at Cobh looking like a postcard.  On the day the press went down there it was very beautiful.  But the previous week for three days in a row we could not get timber floorboards across to put floors into the billets across to the island because we could not get the boats out. That is the kind of place Spike Island can be in bad weather.</P>

I am not going to allow 15 prisoners in a dormitory with an open fire.  I am not going to stand over a situation in which they can pile mattresses and blankets on an open fire.  I <Col N="2438" /> will not stand over a situation in which they can take a shovelful of hot coals putting it on top of a bed in the middle of the night.  That is why I caused the open fires to be bricked up.  If there is a need for a different form of heating next year I will put it in.  But at present the fireplaces on Spike Island are bricked up and there is no form of heating there whatsoever.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>One of the conditions for the receipt of a deserted wife's payment is that a husband must have left his wife of his own volition.  The deciding officer held that this condition was not satisfied in this case and that there was a mutual responsibility in the circumstances leading up to the separation.  The person concerned was notified of the decision to disallow her claim on 21 May 1984 and of her right to appeal against the decision but she did not do so at the time.</P>
      <P>A letter was received from the claimant on 6 March 1985 stating that her circumstances had changed since the original disallowance of her claim, that her husband had now gone to the United States of America and that she therefore wished to appeal.  The fact that her husband has now gone to the United States would not in the normal course affect the circumstances giving rise to a separation which took place about two and a half years ago.  The person concerned was written to on 15 March 1985 and the position was explained to her and she was asked if there were any new facts or fresh evidence in relation to the separation which she wished to submit.  No reply to this letter has been received.  A further letter is being issued to her, inquiring whether she wishes to proceed with the appeal and if so to give her reasons for her appeal.</P>

      <P>The application in this case was rejected in October 1983 when an examination of the plans submitted showed that the floor area of the house exceeded the statutory limit of 125 sq. m. (1346 sq. ft.) However, following an appeal the applicants were informed that the house would be measured as completed. A final inspection by appointment, with a view to establishing the exact size of the house, etc., will be carried out shortly and the applicants will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.</P>

      <P>At the request of the Leinster House authorities carpet is being laid on the main staircase of the office block at an estimated cost of £10,947.00 inclusive of VAT.  The existing carpet covering one flight only was laid before President Reagan's visit. Due to the urgency at the time under-felt was not provided, a factor which has contributed to more than usual wear. Carpet is considered appropriate on the staircase as an extension of the carpeted corridors and stairways elsewhere in Leinster House.  Any question of reversal of the work is a matter initially for the Leinster House authorities.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 583 and 584 together.  The consultants in Jervis Street Hospital and St. Laurence's Hospital have rejected proposals I put to them regarding private practice facilities at Beaumont Hospital.  In view of this impasse, it is not now possible to meet the target date of 1 July 1985 for the opening of the hospital.</P>
      <P>Because of the detailed nature of the items of equipment remaining to be ordered for Beaumont Hospital, it is not possible for me to give a comprehensive list in this reply.</P>

      <P>It is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the net additional costs which would result from the inclusion of systematic lupus erythematosus among the list of prescribed illnesses which are currently covered by the long term illness scheme. This particular condition is one of a number of illnesses which have been the subject of representations over the years.</P>
      <P>The question of extending the scheme to encompass these conditions has been the subject of ongoing review by successive Ministers for Health.  It has not been found possible to contemplate any extension of the scheme at the present time, I am quite satisfied however that the present arrangements for the issue of medical cards, and the availability of the benefit of the refund of cost of drugs scheme are such as to ensure that no hardship should arise.</P>

      <P>All medical referees of my Department are doctors who are qualified in the diagnosis of dermatological conditions.</P>
      <P>The person concerned was medically examined by two medical referees who expressed the opinion that she was not incapable for working due to dermatitis. Disability benefit was discontinued accordingly from 6 August 1984.  The decision was upheld by an appeals officer following an oral hearing of the appeal and consideration of all the evidence available.  The appeals officer does not consider that a specialist's opinion in the case is required.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The age limit of 66 applies in these schemes except in the case of certain incapacitated persons who may qualify regardless of age.  However, to extend these schemes to include persons under 66 who are not permanently incapacitated would alter the nature of the <Col N="2327" /> schemes and would have significant cost implications.

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour the number of employer liability related accidents in both manufacturing and service industries that have occurred in each of the past five years in Ireland; how the rate of accidents in this country compares with other countries; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>The Safety in Industry Acts, 1955 and 1980, Mines and Quarries Act, 1965, and Dangerous Substances Acts, 1972 and 1979, administered by my Department, contain differing detailed provisions about reporting accidents.  Those reporting requirements do not focus on employer liability related accidents and I do not therefore have information on such accidents.</P>
      <P>The information received by my Department is not sufficiently comprehensive to allow for a valid comparison of accident rates in this country with other countries.</P>

      <P>I <Col N="2334" /> already replied to a similar question from the Deputy on 23 April 1985.  Three additional applications have been approved for grants under the enterprise allowance scheme since that date.</P>
      <P>My prime objective is to ensure that employment and training schemes administered by my Department and its agencies are run effectively and efficiently with no undue delay to the public. It will be appreciated, therefore, that it would not be possible to achieve this objective if resources had to be diverted to provide the information required by the Deputy on a weekly basis.</P>
