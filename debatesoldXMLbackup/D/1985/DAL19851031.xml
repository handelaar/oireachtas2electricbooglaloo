      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is proposed to take Nos. 6, 18, 19, and 20.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to item No. 6, we agreed to take this matter on short notice.  I would point out that we have no documents whatever as yet and no indication as to what it is about.  The motion refers to the terms of an agreement and contract.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would give an indication as to what is involved.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If it is agreed to take it perhaps that could wait until it is called.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to agree to take something when one does not know what it is about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Opposition are in some difficulty as this is something that has arisen at short notice.  I understand that the documents have been laid before the House probably in the very recent past.  I would be glad to facilitate the Opposition in any way I can.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The documents before the House will be in English.  I realise the difficulty and if I can help the Leader of the Opposition I will do so because I am grateful to him for his courtesy in agreeing to take this motion.  It will be of great value and importance to this country to have this arrangement.  I recognise that the Deputy has not received the documents, nor had a chance to look at them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>This side of the House have no wish to be disruptive in this matter because it is very important that cultural relations between Ireland and China should be pursued effectively. Many people are slightly worried about the implications of disturbing these warriors and horses of the Qin Dynasty.  We on this side of the House would be prepared to risk any supernatural manifestations that might confront us from these developments.  However, this is not a very satisfactory way of doing business. On this occasion, in view of the fact that this is an artistic and cultural matter we are prepared to facilitate the Government.</P>
      <P>Another matter I wish to raise with the Ceann Comhairle relates to Question Time.  I would direct the Chair's attention to a process which is taking place.  On two occasions I have put down questions to the Taoiseach, one in regard to the outrageous statements of the Chief Constable of the RUC and another in relation to the unfortunate and unhappy events in Árus an Uachtaráin last Monday.  Both of those question were transferred by the Taoiseach to other Ministers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Just a second.  Please let me finish.  I do not like this habit of the Chair's of interrupting people.  Before the Chair rules me out of order&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not ruling the Deputy out of order but the Deputy has referred to my habit of cutting in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="871" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I was always taught that it was bad manners to interrupt somebody who was speaking.  That is probably old fashioned now.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey and myself are in the same category.</P>
      <P>

      </P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Once it becomes clear to the Chair that the matter is not in order it would be a dereliction of duty on behalf of the Chair if he were to allow the Deputy in possession to proceed.  If Deputy Haughey wants to raise something about the practice of transferring questions from the Taoiseach to another Deputy and to correct, as he would see it, a tradition which has been here since the twenties, then the Order of Business is not the place to do it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would respectfully submit to the Chair that he could not possibly be in a position to know whether or not my questions are in order until I have finished making my submission.  I want to direct the Chair's attention to the fact that this is not just a matter of the Taoiseach transferring questions, though I regard as a serious dereliction of parliamentary duty the fact that the Taoiseach did that in both those instances.  However, my point is that the Taoiseach or his Department left it to the last moment to effect the transfer to other Ministers, and in both these cases the transfer resulted in the postponement of my questions almost indefinitely.  The question in regard to the unhappy ceremony in Árus an Uachtaráin was transferred to the Minister for Labour.  The Minister for Labour's questions were taken yesterday. That means that my question on a reasonably topical matter cannot now come before the House for about a month. That makes a mockery of the Government's intentions to make this House more relevant to contemporary events. The second question was transferred to another Minister and this had the same effect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="872" /> The new procedure for Question Time has a very important bearing on the transfer of questions from the Taoiseach to other Ministers and can result in questions being put back to a point where they are hopelessly out of date by the time they are arrived at in this House. The whole matter could be solved if the Taoiseach would accept questions which are legitimately addressed to him and not attempt to dodge them.  I want, Sir, to direct your attention to this new situation and the fall-out it is having in regard to questions being transferred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In an orderly manner without dealing with the question of the transfer of the question itself, I want to say that if the new procedure introduced has had an unintended effect &mdash; I am not clear that that is the case and I do not quite see how it is &mdash; the Whips should discuss it.  Certainly we would not wish the new procedure to have a disadvantageous effect to the Opposition of a kind that was not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach says that he does not understand how it had that effect.  Regarding the scandalous remarks by the Chief Constable of the RUC, I addressed a question on that matter to the Taoiseach when it was particularly relevant and urgent.  The Taoiseach's office delayed dealing with that question until Friday.  On Friday they indicated that it had been transferred to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The draw for questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs took place on Thursday.  Therefore, my question not alone was not answered by the Taoiseach but it did not go into the draw for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to whom it had been transferred.  Exactly the same thing has happened in regard to my question to the Taoiseach which has been transferred to the Minister for Labour.  I am prepared to accept, if the Taoiseach says so, that this is not a device to put these questions away into the future, but that is how it works in both these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I take the Leader of <Col N="873" /> the Opposition's point.  I appreciate it now and I believe the matter should be discussed between the Whips to ensure that the new procedure has not a disadvantageous effect which was not intended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly it should not be discussed here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to give notice of my intention to raise on the Adjournment the subject matter of the Gaisce President's award ceremonies in Áras an Uachtaráin last Monday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I will communicate with Deputy Haughey.  In regard to the matter he raised, the new system of Question Time has been in operation for a relatively short time.  Of course, it has teething problems as any new system has. If Deputies would bring this before the Committee on Procedure and Privileges it could be ironed out there.  That committee met yesterday, but it is not appropriate to try to argue it out across the floor on the Order of Business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point let me point out that that is not a very satisfactory remedy for us on this side of the House.  At the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges yesterday for the first time ever the Government forced through a proposal of their own by using their majority on the committee. That does not hold out much sustenance for this side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Taoiseach aware that his ill-considered and ill-named package of measures last week on job creation has resulted in 2,000 people being put out of work in the glass industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not arise on the Order of Business.  Deputy Burke will have to find another way of raising it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>

      <P>In reply to a question of mine in June last the Minister for the Environment promised what he called comprehensive new air pollution legislation which he said would be introduced in the autumn.  Let me ask him when it is intended to have that brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to ask the Taoiseach when he proposes to introduce legislation to deal with the jury system.  I think he and some of his Ministers promised that that legislation would be introduced in the near future.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>That legislation is in the course of preparation.  The issue is legally complex.  The text is awaited from the Attorney General at present.  I cannot give an exact time, therefore, for the presentation of the Bill, but the Government attach great urgency to it and we will get it through the House as soon as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to raise one <Col N="875" /> further matter.  Early in August a committe of inquiry into the building societies was set up and it was suggested that the report would be before the Government by the end of September.  I would like to ask the Taoiseach if the report has been brought to the Government and if the intention is to place it on the table of the House and give the House an opportunity to discuss it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think it arises on the Order of Business.  It is not promised legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that it would require some amending legislation if changes are to be introduced.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could indicate if the date, the end of September, has been complied with for the finalisation of the report.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am anxious to do so, as I mentioned to the Deputy privately. The day before yesterday I said in a reply that it would be introduced early next year.  The answer I gave in June was that I hoped to introduce it in this session. Shortly after that it became clear that this would not be possible.  I thought I had said that to the House but I find I was incorrect in my recollection.  It will be introduced early in the next session.  I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to clarify that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Nealon)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Agreement and Contract for the &ldquo;Exhibition of Terracotta Figures of Warriors and Horses of the Qin Dynasty, China&rdquo; which were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 29 October, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Taoiseach has said, we are extremely grateful for the co-operation we have received in regard to this matter. We had hoped to have the exhibition in about one year's time but it became <Col N="878" /> available to us very suddenly from Edinburgh a couple of weeks ago.  This represents an enormous saving in costs.  The unexpected availability is the reason for introducing this motion speedily.</P>
    <P>The terms of the agreement and contract are identical in form and content to those concluded by the Chinese authorities with several other countries in connection with this exhibition, including Britain, Sweden and Austria.  These terms were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 29 October and they are in English.</P>
    <P>This is an exhibition of what is known as the Emperor's Warriors.  It is a major prestige exhibition of one of the most interesting archaeological discoveries of modern times and I am confident that it will be a major attraction.  The exhibition will also enable us to open to the public for the first time the restored Royal Hospital at Kilmainham.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Naturally we welcome any cultural development of this kind.  I understand the dilemma of the Government in being offered the exhibition at short notice.  Again we must take the Government on trust in this matter though I am always suspicious of anything that is rushed through the House at short notice because frequently such acts rebound to someone's disadvantage. However, if the Minister of State assures us that this agreement is in order and is advantageous to us, we have no alternative but to accept that assurance.</P>

    <P>When will this exhibition be mounted? What will be its duration?  Perhaps the Minister would let us have some further details, if he has these to hand, of what exactly is involved.  For the time being at any rate I am prepared to forego the doubts that have been expressed to me as to the ill effects that might be suffered by us by reason of our being party to the disturbing of these figures from their historical resting place in China.  I do not know whether the Minister is aware that considerable fears are being expressed as to the terrible things that might happen to anyone who in any way participated in the disturbing of the resting place of these <Col N="879" /> soldiers and warriors from the Qin Dynasty.</P>

      <P>The figures that will feature in the exhibition date from about 200 BC.  They are from the Qin Dynasty and were discovered in 1974 by Chinese farmers digging for water in Xian Province &mdash; and are regarded as one of the most exciting, important and remarkable discoveries in the present century and many other centuries.  They consisted of a total of 7,500 life sized figures of soldiers and of horses, each of the soldiers cast individually, no two were alike.  A total of 33 pieces are being brought here.  The figures have been on exhibition in several centres and have proved enormously successful. The figures relate to the period of the first emperor Qin Shihuang.  He was the man who began the building of the Great Wall of China and the work on his tomb carried out to his orders <Col N="880" /> represent the second great piece of building for which he was responsible.  He was responsible also for major developments in currency and measures for the introduction of a common written language in China.</P>

The exhibition should be mounted around the end of November and will continue until January 10.  During a six week period in Edinburgh between 200,000 and 250,000 people visited the exhibition.  It was one of the most popular ever held in that city and I am confident that that will be the case here too.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to conclude what I was saying on the last occasion in relation to the accession of Spain and Portugal by giving a certain qualified support to this enlargement of the Community. This is because the competition that will result from the accession of these two countries has the potential to be of great benefit to Ireland.  I shall illustrate this by referring to the situation which prevailed on our accession to the EC.  We had confined our markets and trading to one or two areas, mainly the British who are our nearest neighbours and were our best customers and we theirs for many years.  Since then our economy has developed on a much more firm basis and to greater benefit to us from the balance of payments point of view with other European countries.  We have found new markets and that was mainly brought about by virtue of the increased competition which we had to face and the fact that we had to survive as a small fish in a pool with much larger fish.  Generally, that competition has been beneficial to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some quarters it has been suggested that the number in the Community should remain as it is and that it is not yet capable of withstanding the extra pressures of the accession of Spain and Portugal.  I do not think that attitude is at all acceptable.  Not so many years ago the late President de Gaulle adopted the same attitude to this country and others for quite some time, which was not of very great benefit to anybody at that time.  I see no reason why we should not <Col N="882" /> welcome other countries into the Community. Perhaps they will be our competitors in certain areas, but we should and will learn from them and welcome their competition.</P>
    <P>The major problem facing the Community is unemployment.  That has been with us for some time and will be with us to a larger extent as the Community becomes larger.  It is easy to put forward various resolutions suiting oneself as to how the problem of unemployment might be solved, but I have felt for a long time that a great deal more consideration should be given to the problem both here at home and on the European stage.  I concede that quite an amount of assistance, particularly in connection with youth unemployment, is already being given by the Community.  Nonetheless, the problem is so great that it now behoves us to examine the possibility of abolishing the whole concept of unemployment. My reasons are, first, that the problem has become so large a burden that the unemployed are almost breaking under the strain of a hopeless future.  It would be of benefit to the Community to fund training schemes available to everybody up to the age of 45 years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to the fact that the accession of Spain and Portugal will exacerbate this problem and am suggesting a means that could be considered in the Community for its solution.  The Minister of State at the Department is present and perhaps he might take it up at that level.  Secondly, such a scheme would relieve the burden placed on the Community and the individual member countries and would be a tremendous boost to the morale of all workers and employers throughout the entire Community. In some quarters last year it was suggested that perhaps we might be better off outside the Community.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Bill before the House gives us an opportunity to discuss the enlargement of the Community and the developing situation within the Community generally and its future prospects. First, in principle we agree with enlargement of the Community but we are critical of the manner in which the negotiations have been handled by the Government, especially in relation to one or two major issues.  We acknowledge fully the benefits of membership and the whole economic benefit which will come from an enlarged Community.  However, it is essential that we recognise the problems which need to be examined more fully and those against which we need to be protected more fully.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We would hope to see in the enlarged Community a greater recognition of the need to tackle some of the major outstanding problems that affect every area of the Community at this time, especially unemployment.  We cannot accept the unemployment situation within the European Community at present.  Millions of people are unemployed and there does not appear to be the necessary commitment within the Community to tackle and resolve that huge problem which is creating enormous problems for our economy.  I wish the spirit within the Community to be strengthened to deal with these major economical and social <Col N="884" /> problems at Community level.  Following on the decision to enlarge the Community a new drive should be created to resolve these problems in areas where at present the Community do not appear determined enough to tackle them effectively.</P>
    <P>The secrecy surrounding the enlargement negotiations has led to fears and anxieties in many sectors of the economy here.  The discussion today would certainly have been more useful a year ago. I am not satisfied that the full implications of enlargement for our economy have been put before us.  Many of the problems which we will face from next January could have been minimised if they had been anticipated and if we had had more useful documentation and discussion. The Government have done very little by way of research into the implications of enlargement and the possible damage to some of our existing industries.  Statements and restatements by the Minister for Foreign Affairs gloss over the subject without giving any detailed information on the possible ill effects on agriculture, regional development and tourism, apart from the fisheries question where it appears that development will be put back by 15 to 20 years.  The Government should have come forward at a much earlier stage with clear documentation on the implications.</P>
    <P>Although there is a possibility of damage to some existing industries, there may be opportunities in other areas.  The developmental potential of our tourist industry must be considered in terms of a closer involvement with Spain and Portugal. I have not heard any references in the Minister's speech about the prospects of getting involved in tourism ventures with Spain and Portugal.  Enlargement may direct some tourist business coming here towards Spain and Portugal.  We must bear in mind the expertise they have in this area and examine the prospect of closer links in order to expand our tourism potential.  These are matters we should have had an opportunity to discuss in more detail.  This debate is useful but an earlier opportunity would have been more welcome.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary for me to tell the <Col N="885" /> House that the enlargement of the Community will have a most detrimental effect on the fishing industry, which is in an almost hopeless situation.  We in Fianna Fáil have sought assurances from the Government over the past two years. This time last year we discussed the damage which would be done to the industry in an enlarged Community.  We had a framework agreement which was entered into to ensure that there would be a phased reduction in Spanish fishing activity in the Irish fishing areas.  The success of that agreement was demonstrated by a reduction of about 50 per cent in Spanish fishing activity over a two-year period from the signing of the agreement.  We believe the enlargement negotiations were mishandled by the Government and the prospect of future development and expansion of our fishing industry have been put in jeopardy.</P>
    <P>While certain limited restrictions have been negotiated, effectively under the new arrangement there will be a brake on expansion and development within the industry and a variety of species which we would have the potential to exploit will remain to be exploited by the Spanish fleet.  The prospects for expanding our fishing industry in the traditional species are limited because the stock situation has led to controls and quotas.  The prospect of an increase in activity in relation to herring and mackerel is almost nil.  The quota for mackerel this year is fished out and it is likely within the next few days that licensing for mackerel in the northwest will terminate.  That will jeopardise the jobs not only of those directly involved in the fishing industry but the 1,500 or 2,000 jobs in the processing industry.  Already the stock situation is limiting and controlling the expansion and development of the fleet.  Any alternative prospect would be in exploiting to the maximum the 200-mile economic zone and developing into new species in new fishing grounds where we have not been involved previously.  I refer to blue whiting and horse mackerel, two species in regard to which there has been very little activity but where the prospects are fairly substantial.  Because of Spanish <Col N="886" /> fishing efforts the development of those two species by the Irish fleet will be minimised.</P>
    <P>Since Spain applied for membership of the EC there have been flagrant violations of our fishing regulations by Spanish ships.  In the past few months a huge number of Spanish boats have been prosecuted and some cases are at present before the courts.  This activity has been stepped up because of the application and the fact that Spain will be joining the Community on 1 January.  Already they know there is huge potential in the economic zone to the south-west and west of Ireland which has been unexploited up to now and where they have prospects of getting fish, a scarce commodity in Spain at present.  Due to this we have a huge influx of Spanish boats violating our laws on a daily basis.  These illegal activities are likely to increase substantially and cause untold damage to our fish stocks which are scarce even now.</P>
    <P>Anybody familiar with the Spanish fleet will know the damage they can do. They have over-fished most of their own grounds and now they have been given an opportunity to fish in other waters.  So that we can estimate the possible damage they can do to our fish stocks I will refer to the size of their fishing fleet.  The Spanish have 17,500 vessels with a capacity of 75,000 tonnes.  Our equivalent is 1,600 vessels with a capacity of 3,600 tonnes. The Spanish fleet will represent 75 per cent of the entire EC fleet.  As I have said, this huge fleet has already over-fished the waters they have been using and will now expand their activities to our waters.</P>
    <P>I do not visualise the possibility of the entire Spanish fishing fleet working off our shores but they could deploy, say, 500 vessels to fish in our area.  Those ships are powered by engines displacing 700 h.p.  Our equivalent would be 20 h.p. at maximum, usually 15 or 16 h.p.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister for Foreign Affairs, or the Minister for Fisheries whose participation in the Spanish accession negotiations was only occasional, realise the full danger the <Col N="887" /> Spaniards represent to our fishing industry. If they did they would have sought a much tighter agreement for our fishermen in the accession negotiations.  Our position now <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Spanish fleet spells danger for our fishermen and for the jobs we have in fish processing.  We all appreciate the difficulties leading up to the negotiations for Spanish accession. We were told that a common fisheries policy would be the cornerstone of our fishing industry for the next 20 years.</P>
    <P>Before the ink was dry on the accession agreement we knew of the prospects of a huge Spanish fleet capable of depleting all our stocks in the north west in a short time.  There was no recognition in the EC of the damage this would do to our industry and there was no recognition by our Government of the serious problems our fishermen were facing.  We should have looked for a far better deal which would enable us to develop and to expand our fishing industry so that we would be able to exploit our resources.  That is now being left for others to do, with enormous loss of jobs and revenue to the State.  I do not think this has come home to the Government.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Fisheries, even at this stage, to go back to the EC to seek further protection and safeguards for our fishing industry.  At least we should negotiate for extra quotas which would help to sustain our industry.</P>
    <P>Not only are we confronted by that huge Spanish fishing fleet but we are sandwiched between the Spanish and the Norwegians which spells a far worse future for our fishermen and those engaged in the processing sector.  We have been told of possible expansion of our fish exports in the enlarged Community. The Minister spoke about these prospects which he said must not be missed.  It is well known that the Spanish have 106 joint venture agreements tied up, 20 of them involving fish supplies to the west coast of Africa and to the US. They are able to supply 200,000 tonnes of white fish to these markets, the equivalent of our total catch.  Instead of talking <Col N="888" /> about improved export opportunities for the Irish industry we should face the reality of the Spanish joint venture agreements which provide for the supply of white fish equivalent to our catch in a full year.</P>
    <P>Therefore, our opportunities to expand our exports are slim indeed.  Side by side with that we must realise that the Spanish fleet are in need of modernisation and restructuring and huge injections of capital will be needed to do that. Many of their vessels are obsolete and cannot fish effectively.  Therefore, the Spanish will be making enormous demands on EC resources.  This will be to the detriment of our fishery development plans.  The Minister has told us that Spain will have access to certain EC funds from the date of accession.  Therefore, our access to the Regional Fund for the provision of money to develop our harbours and infrastructure will be smaller, because member states' entitlements will be shared out and reduced on a percentage basis.  That is totally unacceptable. While recognising that the Spanish fleet has a capacity problem, a restructuring and modernisation problem that must be funded and dealt with in addition to our own, any such funding would have to be met by way of increased subvention to the FEOGA fund or into the structural or regional development fund.  It is not acceptable that the Community is being enlarged because of the decision to reduce in percentage terms the share out of the present funds for regional and structural aid.  This will entail a totally unsatisfactory and unacceptable situation from the point of view of our industry and Spanish industry.</P>
    <P>There will be need for huge capital injections to modernise the Spanish fleet. There will also be a need for huge capital investment here to modernise our fleet, rendering them capable of competing with the Spanish trawlers that will now be coming here because of our Government's negotiations.  That will not be done if one is talking about a resharing of the limited funds existing.  That can be done only by a commitment running hand <Col N="889" /> in hand with enlargement of the Community. There must be a commitment to augment the funds, the financial resources, available to strengthen the structural, social, regional development and guidance funds to enable the necessary developments to take place.  That would mean there would be a modern Community fleet, one capable of competing in the ever-changing situation, of exploiting available resources which can be done if carefully managed, protected and conserved.</P>
    <P>In the previous discussions in relation to enlargement negotiations we on this side of the House sought a 20-year transitional term.  We are thoroughly dissatisfied with the arrangement negotiated by the Government.  The Government have missed out entirely on the opportunities obtaining in the course of those enlargement negotiations.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs did not recognise fully the problems of our industry and the opportunities available to it had those negotiations been properly managed. The position in which we now find ourselves means that there will be untold damage done to our fishing fleet; its future prospects of development being hampered.  During our term of Presidency of the Council we were out-manoeuvred, at a time when our Government were afforded an ideal opportunity to deal with that situation.  They were out-manoeuvred by the Italians who sorted out their wine problems during our Presidency term.  We missed an opportunity to adopt a hard line on our fisheries negotiations, ensuring that the Community recognised our problems and dealt with them effectively.  We missed out also on the detailed negotiations which took place afterwards.  The result, from our fisheries point of view, has been a major disappointment and has undermined the confidence of our fishing industry.</P>
    <P>I mentioned earlier the proposed restrictions on the Regional Fund which will be detrimental to regional development. We have all been disappointed at the lack of progress in regional development since we joined the Community. <Col N="890" /> The major benefit which many of us thought would accrue as a result of our membership would be that for the first time we would have available to us more policy options and funds in relation to regional development to deal with the regional imbalances that obtained.  It is now common knowledge that most people interested in regional development have lost such interest and rely more on our Government to deal with those problems than anything done at Community level.  That is a mistake because the Community must be made to recognise that there are regional disparities within the Community that must be dealt with effectively.  The prospect of a reduction in funds for regional aid in the whole area of infrastructural development in isolated west coast areas, fish landing places and so on, is a further disappointment.</P>
    <P>I should like to impress on the Minister now the necessity to have another look at the decision to reduce resources from the Regional Fund in percentage terms because of enlargement.  The problems being encountered in the regions today are as great as when we first joined the Community.  There has been such little development in a regional sense one would question to what extent our membership of the Community has been of benefit to us.  There has been such little evidence of benefit from the Community in a regional sense that local authorities have been forced to erect signs on roads indicating that their building or repair is being funded by the Regional Fund, a most unsatisfactory position.</P>
    <P>Much of the regional infrastructural development which would create the climate for further investment and employment has not been undertaken, which could have been done had the Regional Fund been operated successfully.  Are there any funds available from the Regional Fund for harbour development, especially the smaller harbours and landing places?  Our fishing industry and the economic activity of these regions has been hampered by lack of development of such landing places in small harbours and estuaries.  For example, the potential <Col N="891" /> of the Shannon estuary has not been exploited.  The Minister might let us know whether the Government have applied for funds from the Regional Fund to carry out the type of development essential in estuarial areas such as the Shannon.  We are all aware that millions of pounds are needed even to render such harbours and landing places safe.  We cannot expect our fisheries, tourism or any other industry to develop in isolated harbours and landing places unless such development is undertaken.  I could list dozens of such harbours and landing places around the country, from Clogherhead to Burtonport, which are awaiting funding.  The Regional Fund should be funding development in these regions to ensure that effective work is undertaken.  Regional development is necessary to ensure that as many people as possible are maintained in these regions, working there, exploiting fully the opportunities available there if only the services and infrastructure are provided to enable this be done.</P>
    <P>There was no indication from the Minister in the course of his remarks that there would be any commitment on the part of the Government, or indeed on the part of the Community, to match enlargement with the revenue so urgently required to tackle these problems.  Unless such substantial increased funding is forthcoming one can foresee enlargement of the Community hampering rather than aiding development in such areas.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other issues to which I should like to refer which are very important in relation to the enlargement of the Community but I will just mention one, the lack of action at Community level in the whole area of pollution control and elimination as far as possible.  Community funds should be available to enable important development work to be undertaken which would minimise the risk of pollution here.  I am not satisfied that emissions from Moneypoint which will begin fairly soon when the station uses coal will be sufficiently <Col N="892" /> controlled to minimise the risk of pollution in the immediate and long term future.</P>
    <P>Has any application been made for funds, or has an examination been made of the total national requirement to reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide and to instal the necessary equipment to control emissions from stations like Moneypoint? We have seen the enormous damage done on the Continent to the environment and to state forestry plantations. In Germany it is estimated that 50 per cent of state forestry is damaged because of pollution.  If the situation is allowed to continue, further serious damage will be caused to forestry plantations all over Europe as well as in Ireland.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Energy and the Government must recognise that, while the levels of pollution from our industries may be so small as to be regarded as insignificant, nevertheless that does not absolve us from our responsibilities.  No matter how small these emissions are, we must minimise them further.  We must eliminate pollution as far as possible and get the full backing of the EC in that campaign.  Funds may be available from the EC to control pollution emissions here and I should like to ask the Minister if any evaluation has been done in regard to this country and where we stand in relation to the terms of the directives on air pollution at Community level.</P>
    <P>What efforts have been made here to cost our requirements and what applications, if any, have been made to the European Community for funds to enable us to do that?  Indeed, has this even been considered here?  The Minister will be aware that the general public are concerned about environmental issues, that concern will grow in the coming years and we have a responsibility, especially in relation to stations like Moneypoint, to ensure that every precaution is taken and that the Community fully support us in the installation of necessary equipment to control emisions.</P>
    <P>The enlargement of the Community gives us an opportunity to reawaken a consciousness and commitment to face <Col N="893" /> up to and tackle the major economic and social problems which exist throughout Europe at present.  I welcome the enlargement of the Community, even though I realise that there are disadvantages which I highlighted here in a previous speech.  There are ill effects in some areas and the Government should make a statement on the full implications for every sector of the economy and also, of course, mention the opportunities which will be available in the enlarged Community. Community enlargement is desirable and will benefit Europe generally. However, a commitment to enlarge the Community must be matched by a commitment to fund the enlarged Community to enable them to tackle and resolve the major problems.</P>
    <P>We cannot allow a situation to continue to develop where more and more people are unemployed and where there are regional disparities within the Community. We are all part of the Community and it must take care of every section, especially the regions.  We are not satisfied that that commitment is there and there is no evidence in practical terms to prove that it is.  I hope that the enlarged Community will bring prosperity and development throughout the Community and that the Government, even at this late stage, can make some effort to minimise the damage which will be done to the fishing industry through the enlarged Community.</P>

      <P>This Bill deals mainly with the accession of Spain and Portugal to the European Community.  We have a long and historic link with Spain and Portugal and we should help in the smooth accession of both these countries.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and his Department, together with other relevant Ministers, have negotiated for a long period about the terms of this accession.  It has been a long haul and the best reason for this expansion was given by the Minister when he said that negotiations opened with Portugal in October 1978 and with Spain in February 1979. He said that while there was awareness on all sides of the difficult and complex <Col N="894" /> issues that would have to be resolved, by opening negotiations the Community affirmed their political support for democratic Spain and Portugal and their wish to have them as partners in the European endeavour.</P>
      <P>We welcomed this initiative because we are part of the European Community. However, we deal with problems in regard to the Community in isolation and we look continuously for hand-outs.  If we are to be part of the Community we must earn our place and show our resolve by negotiating with countries like Spain and Portugal.  This has been done successfully by the Minister and one merely has to look at the long list of results from these accession negotiations to realise that they have been successful.</P>
      <P>Portugal will have representation similar to other medium size states such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Greece, while Spain will be in an intermediate position between medium and large sized member states such as West Germany, France, Italy and the UK.  The fact that Spain and Portugal are coming in on this basis will mean an increase in support for countries like Ireland.  In the long term this must be of tremendous benefit when negotiations are taking place in the various institutions.  In the European Parliament they will have an additional 60 seats for Spain and 24 for Portugal.  The Commission, the Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors and the social committees of the Community will be expanded.  In addition, the European Investment Bank and the Scientific and Technical Committee of EURATOM will be expanded.  All of these institutions are intended to bring some benefit to Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since we joined the Community we have benefited enormously but we do not always acknowledge that.  We come here and whinge and cry that we are not getting more hand-outs.  The Deputies on the other side make speeches that are full of clichés in connection with this matter. They are meant only for public consumption. I do not begrudge entry to Spain or Portugal.  I think it would be good for us. After all, we have the same kind of ethnic <Col N="895" /> background and we have the same religious background.</P>
    <P>As Deputy Daly pointed out, we should take advantage of all the opportunities that will be available.  Instead of complaining we should look forward and do something to improve the Community. Deputy Daly spoke about tourism. Perhaps there could be some joint ventures in this area.  In County Clare we are most anxious that this should happen. We have a short tourism season and perhaps there could be exchanges between Spain, Portugal and the west coast of Clare.  I have no doubt that some joint ventures could be arranged.  It is a matter of will and for entrepreneurs to seek out opportunities.</P>
    <P>In the negotiations the Minister and his team have looked after the main aspects of the Irish economy.  For instance, the accession period is seven years but in the agricultural sector there is an accession period of ten years for our very vulnerable products.  There has been an extension of the accession period to allow our economy to adjust.  The opportunities are there but we should seek them out and take advantage of them.</P>
    <P>For the products sector, including certain of the Community's northern products, such as dairy products, beef, veal and wheat, there will be an import monitoring system called the supplementary mechanism applicable to trade.  It is known in short as SMT.  In all sectors in which it applies the SMT will last for ten years.  The Minister and those who represented this country at negotiations have acted fairly.  One would get the impression from the Fianna Fáil spokesman for fisheries that all is lost in the fishing industry.  I recognise it is the Cinderella industry, that it is very small and has serious investment problems.  Deputy Daly did not suggest any way for further developments but he showed that there was a possibility because of the ageing Spanish fleet.  It may be that a joint venture would work in this case.  Perhaps the Irish and the Spanish could get together in regard to fisheries.</P>
    <P>I should like to recall for the benefit of <Col N="896" /> Members the negotiations on fisheries and the points made at that time.  The main aim of the Community was to integrate Spain and Portugal into the Common Fisheries Policy over the period between accession and the expiry of the policy in its present form in 2002.  While respecting the substance of the balance of arrangements between member states, this country was particularly concerned to ensure that the terms negotiated with Spain would not impede the further development of the Irish fishing industry. The final agreement on fisheries represented a positive outcome in terms of both objectives.</P>
    <P>The main elements were as follows: (1) for the period 1985 to 1995 no Spanish vessel will be allowed inside the Irish box, which is a 50-mile zone around our coast; (2) a basic list of 300 Spanish vessels will be authorised to fish in Community waters, excluding the Irish box, until 1996 of which only 150 vessels of standard 700 HP size on the periodic list will be allowed to fish simultaneously in Community waters; (3) of the 150 vessels on the periodic list, 93 will be allowed to fish in the Irish 50 to 200 mile zone as compared with 65 under the present EC-Spain framework agreement until 1995 &mdash; after that date these vessels will be allowed entry inside 50 miles, although in practice the vessels would be fishing in a much larger sea area; (4) the Spanish authorities are committed to negotiations to secure an orderly and phased access by Spanish boats to the Irish box after 1995; (5) the above provisions with regard to access to waters will be reinforced by very tight controls, including quota limitations, as well as a strict monitoring system whereby Spanish vessels entering the present Community waters will have to notify coastal member states on entry and exit and report their catches.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a reasonable effort in very difficult circumstances to provide for the future of the fishing industry. It is up to us to investigate what proposals are needed for further expansion of the industry in order to take advantage of the expanded market in <Col N="897" /> Spain and also to provide increased employment at home.</P>
    <P>A Spanish company came to rescue us in Clare in the case of the Chipboard Company in Scarriff, namely, Finsa Products.  This company have invested substantially in the Irish market.  Joint ventures have worked extraordinarily well between the Irish company and the Spanish company in the supplying of chipboard to Britain and the USA.  In recent times Finsa have exported large quantities of timber from Limerick docks to America.  That is opening up further markets.  It is up to us to be adventurous in our efforts to secure extra markets but if we are to judge from all the begrudging on the part of the other side in the past few days in relation to this Bill we will be left behind.  It is up to us to take advantage of the opportunities that exist.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the Minister for Finance have provided the means to help Irish enterpreneurs to become involved in industry, whether it is allied to agriculture, fishing or tourism.</P>
    <P>I support the sentiments expressed by Deputy Daly that there must be further development.  As regards the Regional Fund, my understanding is that we will get the same amount of money.  If it is increased for Ireland, it will be increased for everyone.  Listening to contributions from Deputies on the other side one would get the impression that the money we get from the Regional Fund will be reduced only for Ireland.  I would like the Minister to explain the Regional Fund because, as far as I can understand it, the volume of money accruing to Ireland from that fund will remain the same.  I do not believe we have lost anything because of the accession of Spain and Portugal and it is wrong for Deputies to give that impression.</P>
    <P>We have not been able to use the Regional Fund properly because we do not have the necessary resources.  Perhaps there is a need to expand the ways in which we can use the resources of the Regional Fund, but the State is not able to match the amount of money made <Col N="898" /> available to us.  For us the Regional Fund is a joint venture but we are not able to take advantage of it and that has been one of our weaknesses since we joined the EC.  Nevertheless, many national primary roads have been developed and there is a good national primary road in my constituency and in the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency.</P>
    <P>In my view the EC directive on pollution control is very specific.  When the planning permission application for the building of Moneypoint was discussed at a meeting of Clare County Council, a long debate took place on the building of the tall chimney stacks &mdash; 250 metres high.  We asked the engineering staff to investigate fully the need for the scrubbers which the environmentalists have been campaigning about in the last few days.  I am wondering at Deputy Daly's sudden conversion to scrubbers in Moneypoint, or does he want to further delay the commissioning of the Moneypoint station?  The Institute for Industrial Research and Standards examined the engineering proposals for that project and were satisfied that the level of sulphur dioxide which would be emitted into the atmosphere would not have any injurious effects.</P>
    <P>We already have monitoring stations in County Clare.  It is not helpful if anybody tries to throw a scare about pollution into the people at this time.  When the planning permission was being discussed that was the time to ask to have this matter investigated.  As I said, that matter was investigated long before the building of these stacks started.</P>
    <P>I commend the Minister for the very patient and detailed negotiations which took place on the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community.  I am confident that the accession of these two countries will provide new opportunities for this country of which we should be able to take advantage.  We should be debating now how we can get the best value for this economy in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am glad to have an opportunity to make a few comments on this legislations which <Col N="899" /> will enable the EC to agree to the accession of Spain and Portugal as full members of the Community.  We must look at this legislation in the context of its implementation so far as the EC is concerned, particularly as it affects the agricultural sector and its importance to our economy.</P>
      <P>Of course we welcome the enlargement of the Community, but we must look at its implications for our agricultural policy and the agricultural policy of the EC.  The Common Agricultural Policy is approximately 42 per cent of the total EC budget and the portion for Ireland must be of great relevance to this community.  We must look at these two countries, especially Spain with its fast growing population, as other outlets for our agricultural products.  We must also look at the accession of these countries from the point of view of third country agreements and how it has affected the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
      <P>It has become fashionable to knock the Common Agricultural Policy.  It has been said that it is a waste of Community resources, that it is over-expensive, that it discriminates in favour of farmers, that it pushes up food prices across the counter and that it creates obscene food surpluses. We have heard all these criticisms mainly from ill-informed sources and, perhaps, vested interests and I have no doubt that, since the Community are now being enlarged to include Spain and Portugal, we will hear even more about that in the future.</P>
      <P>In my opinion and in the opinion of this party, the reality is totally different. This has been one of the major successes of the Community.  It is the only truly integrated Community policy and in many ways it is a cornerstone of the Community. It has given us security of supply. It has given Europe valuable international trade.  It has given us price stability and spectacular gains in farm productivity and, above all, it has raised the standard of living of our farmers to a level comparable to that of other sectors.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Despite these successes we all know that the Common Agricultural Policy is <Col N="900" /> not perfect.  We in Fianna Fáil recognise the need for a review of the CAP.  It is both timely and necessary.  It is important that the review takes place now when the Community are being enlarged.  Such a review must take into account the basic principles upon which the CAP was formulated. It is appropriate to examine the origins and the development of the CAP, to examine the problems, to highlight the achievements, to spell out the real cost, to examine the future food needs of Europe and the world and to see how the CAP can contribute to the stability and development of this country and our European partners both old and new.</P>
    <P>The CAP which was negotiated in the late fifties was drawn up at a time when argriculture, forestry and fishing played a very significant role in the economies of the original six member states.  At that time these activities absorbed over 20 per cent of the workforce and contrubuted about 11 per cent of GNP.  By the mid-seventies their importance in the original six had diminished, accounting for about 10 per cent of total employment and about 5 per cent of GNP.  When we joined the Community in 1973 the importance of farming as a source of employment was already diminishing.</P>
    <P>In the fifties, however, agriculture was a very significant sector.  It was also a problem sector.  There was still a large population on the land although the flight of labour from the land was well under way.  Incomes were low and there was a wide disparity of farm structures. National Government policies were many and were sometimes restrictive of trade.  The widespread application of technology to food production in the early fifties effectively wiped out the problem of post-war shortages.  Government concern was now concentrated on supporting farmers' incomes and helping them to adapt to new economic structures. At that time Governments in western Europe agreed that the family farm should be preserved as the basis of production. This was the central theme of many reports published at that time which laid down a number of objectives for future agricultural policy which <Col N="901" /> eventually found expression in Article 39 of the Treaty of Rome.</P>
    <P>We should remind ourselves when discussing this Bill, of Article 39 of the Treaty and what it defines in so far as the CAP is concerned.  It was designed to increase agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, particularly labour, to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community by increasing the individual earnings of persons engaged in agriculture, to stabilise markets, to guarantee supplies, and to ensure the delivery of supplies to consumers at reasonable prices.</P>
    <P>In working out the CAP and the methods of its application, account should be taken of the distinctive nature of the agricultural industry which results from the social structure of agriculture and from natural disparities between various agricultural regions.  We should also look at the need to effect the appropriate adjustments gradually and the fact that in the member states agriculture constitutes a sector closely linked with the economy as a whole.  In the context of enlargement, the CAP will play a vital role.  To achieve the objectives the policy must be operated on the basis of three principles.  These should be pointed out to the incoming members of the Community. The principles are that there must be a single market, there must be Community preference, and there must be financial solidarity.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note in these early deliberations the relevance of farm policy, to our present day problems.  The Stresa Conference of July 1958 discussed many of the issues facing agriculture, issues which were to be taken into account in drawing up the CAP and many of which are still relevant today.  The resolution coming from that conference almost 30 years ago might be regarded as a manifesto by those concerned to preserve the family farm in Europe today.  The main points of the resolution <Col N="902" /> were that agriculture should be considered as an integral part of the economy and an essential factor in social life, and that efforts should be made to raise productivity to promote the application of a price policy which avoids over production while allowing farmers to remain or become competitive.</P>
    <P>The resolution also said that at the same time a policy of aid to disadvantaged regions or farms would make the necessary adaptations possible and that the elimination of aids contrary to the spirit of the Treaty of Rome should be considered to be essential.  An account should be found and we should look at the situation that arises between the production and market outlets taking possible trade into account so that specialisation will conform to the economic structure and national conditions of production within the Community. Given the importance of the family structure of European farming &mdash; and I hope that will remain &mdash; and the unanimous wish to safeguard this character every effort should be made to raise the economic and competitive capacity of such enterprises.  The founding fathers had a deep understanding that the creation of the CAP would be of far wider significance than the well-being of those who live on the land.  They recognised that it was essential to the Community ideal that hostile national policies be brought together into a coherent policy for agriculture to provide the required insurance for the social, economic and political stability of Europe's people.  Surely these principles have at least as much relevance today and maybe far more relevance.</P>
    <P>The CAP must be viewed in the same context of its vital role in the deeper fundamental objectives of European unity.  Within the enlargement of the Community we are moving closer and closer to European unity in the agricultural sphere.  The CAP was established at a time of great monetary and economic stability both within and beyond the Community.  This is no longer the case today and the situation has changed a great deal.  We have general economic recession which seems clearly beyond the <Col N="903" /> ability of any of our individual governments to resolve.  The Community too, has financial problems.  With Spain and Portugal joining, competition will become more intense for outlets in the world markets.  Regional disparities in income remain.  A painful medicine was administered to Europe's farmers in the form of a super-levy in 1984.  Perhaps to some extent this was forecast by certain experts within Europe.  Our productive capacity seemed unlimited and demand was stagnating with ever-increasing competition on world markets.  Now uses for agricultural products in the fields of biotechnology, industry and energy, though promising, are still at the initial stages of development.</P>
    <P>The public have now become preoccupied with the budgetary cost of agriculture. This is wrong for reasons I will outline later.  It must be said that perhaps we and many of Europe's farm leaders have failed to inform the consumer about the true nature of agricultural expenditure. We in this country and in this party welcome the opportunity of this debate. I welcome also the opportunity of discussing certain aspects of the Community which relate to its enlargement.  My colleague, Deputy Daly, has outlined the fishery aspects.  The debate on the agricultural policy in the context of the enlargement possibly could be twofold: (1) the cost of the CAP which many hold to be excessive and (2) the question of surpluses which the same critics often consider unacceptable.  One could say that the decisions on these issues are essentially matters for political choice.  In the context of the enlargement and in considering any alterations in such a complex subject as the CAP fundamental issues must be faced.</P>
    <P>What type of agriculture does Europe need in the future?  Must we distinguish two types of agriculture in Europe in the future, namely, one that is economically viable and perhaps one that is socially necessary?  In the context of the enlargement, economically viable agriculture includes farms with high productivity which are able to achieve such high yields <Col N="904" /> that they can be competitive with the most efficient in the world and those farms which by virtue of their size and capitalisation are closer to industrial undertakings than family holdings.  Socially necessary agriculture should not be understood solely as that part of agriculture which requires aid.  Rather it embraces the social role of agriculture with regard to protecting the environment, providing a rural interest, providing local supplies and checking the flight from the land, thus ensuring a balance in the nation's population.</P>
    <P>It is timely to reflect on the choice for future policy strategy.  Europe's farmers are faced already with different choices, the adaptation of farm enterprises to enforced limitations on output, shortage of capital and few alternative employment opportunities.  These are questions which must be faced.  I am aware that, during the negotiations leading to the accession of Spain and Portugal, some aspects of these questions were considered but I wonder if they were gone into in sufficient detail.  I ask the question because the destiny of farmers both here and in the Community generally depends on the choices that will be made in terms of Europe's policies mechanisms from the options open to them.</P>
    <P>Do we adopt the CAP to preserve our traditional producers on family farms while penalising the factory type production that has been responsible for creating the problems of surpluses and which represents a distortion of the original philosophy of the CAP, or should we slash farm aid and thereby accelerate the flight from the land, leaving the industry in the hands of relatively few but large scale and efficient operators?  These questions are at the very core of decisions on future policy.  They must govern mechanisms or instruments of policy implementation and not be governed by such mechanisms or instruments.  European security and the solidarity of its peoples are the interests that must take precedence over mere accounting or bookkeeping considerations.  The CAP has served Europe well.  While its operational instruments are complex, there is an <Col N="905" /> essential coherence in its major economic and social objectives.  Prudent political decisions on the future direction of the policy can stem only from an analysis of progress towards those objectives and of how they will be influenced by future trends.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I am glad of your guidance.  In the context of this Bill it is appropriate to examine the achievements of the CAP in the hope that future decisions in an enlarged Community will not represent a departure from the basic principles on which that policy is built.  We are all aware that agricultural production has increased substantially and to a greater extent than would have been the case at the level of separate national economies.  Based on growth value added at market price, the volume of agricultural output has increased on average by between 1.5 and <Col N="906" /> 2 per cent annually in the past 20 years. The growth in the related food industry in the same period has been between 3 and 4 per cent annually.</P>
      <P>When we talk of the enlargement of the Community it is important to ensure that the concept of the CAP is maintained. Security of supply has been attained for most products.  In contrast to a large part of the Globe, the Community have no difficulty in regard to the availability of food for their people.  It is no accident that the CAP covers more than 90 per cent of Europe's agricultural produce. However, in recent years that degree of self-sufficiency has been subject to variation which in some cases was significant. Therefore, we must not assume a continuous annual increase in the volume of output of any product. Europe's international trade has benefited and I trust that, in the enlarged Community, this trade will benefit further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Trade in food stuffs has been expanding for a number of years.  There has been an acceleration in this area recently and exports of food products have more than doubled since 1972.  The direct impact on employment by way of additional jobs in transport, marketing and services has been considerable.  Price stability has been achieved.  This is very relevant in the context of an enlarged Community. In particular there has been price stability in sectors in which proper organisation of the market was possible.  Thanks to the single market new barriers resulted from monetary disorders and there has been financial solidarity in market management. The effect has had a wider economic impact.  For many years the Common Agricultural Policy has helped to curb inflation and prices received by farmers in general have risen considerably, more slowly than consumer food prices and less still than those of certain services and manufacturers.  Productivity gains have been striking.  Over the past decade the value of the Community's agricultural output rose by 18 per cent in real terms, while at the same time the volume of labour was reduced by 31 per cent.  This gain in productivity was far <Col N="907" /> greater than in any other branch of Europe's economy.  The equivalent increase in industrial output was only about nine per cent in real terms, while the industrial labour force declined also by only nine per cent.</P>
    <P>In the context of the Common Agricultural Policy the standard of living of many farmers has risen but disparities in farm income still remain, both between and within member states.  In some cases these disparities have tended to increase. In the latest year for which we have records &mdash; 1980-81 &mdash; the range between the average income of the 25 per cent richest farmers and that of the 25 per cent poorer farmers in the Community is in the region of from 1 to 20, which is very significant. It is significant in the aspect of the enlargement of the Community and how an enlarged Community will affect the Common Agricultural Policy.  That policy has established and maintained an extraordinary balance between conflicting interests, both internally and externally. Let us not forget the important political achievements which that policy represents and I hope will continue to represent in the future.  It is the only full integrated Community policy and politically, economically and socially is a cornerstone of Europe and I hope will be a cornerstone in an enlarged Community. Its implications for European integration are enormous.  Despite many adverse circumstances down the years it has certainly retained its vitality.  We strongly support the view that it would not be possible to design a policy economically, socially and politically acceptable to all which was not fundamentally the same as the existing policy for agriculture.</P>
    <P>Surely in an enlarged Community it would be sheer folly, if not absolutely dangerous for the future of Europe, to depart from the basic principles of a policy which is so obviously beneficial to the very fabric of the Community.  There are many misconceptions with regard to the Community and the vital role which the CAP has to play in the future of Europe, in greater coherence within the Community.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="908" /> We realise, of course, that Community resources clearly must be allocated in the most effective manner possible.  Nevertheless, that should not involve calling into question the only policy in operation in the Community &mdash; the Common Agricultural Policy.  However desirable the implications of new policies within the enlarged Community to promote economic activity and employment, such steps to strengthen economic integration should not be taken at the expense of the Common Agricultural Policy.  We must also remember that the CAP as a means of organising the agricultural markets is the only integrated Community policy.  It is only to be expected, therefore, that it would take up a substantial part of Community finances.</P>
    <P>The amount of the Community budget devoted to CAP would decrease if the other common policies were implemented.  Regional policy represents only a small part of that budget, although there are so many regional disparities in the Community.  Energy policy represents only a tiny part, despite the fact that Europe depends on imported energy for more than half of its needs.  The Community's expenditure on its farmers under the CAP guarantees its independence in food supplies, keeps farmers on the land at a time of high unemployment and contributes to maintaining the development industries upstream.  The budget viewed as an accounting instrument therefore certainly has no meaning.  What really matters are the social and economic factors that lie beneath.  In no way should the budget be used to revise the CAP.  That budget is merely the implementation of the Community's regulations covering agriculture.  Any revision should be the result only of fundamental decisions about that policy.</P>
    <P>In this debate we should also refer to the value of the Community's farm output which grew by about 18 per cent in real terms between 1973 and 1982. This was double the productivity gains achieved in the industrial sector.  It was a tremendous achievement in many respects, a technological feat.  It is true to say that approximately 20 per cent of <Col N="909" /> Europe's farmers produce 80 per cent of farm throughput.  This is a very significant figure and must be emphasised in the context of the enlargement of the Community. If we are to have a policy within an enlarged Community at the expense of the family farm, the real aims and ideals of the Treaty of Rome would be totally lost.  Further, the production methods as envisaged already bear little relation to the natural conditions in which the Common Agricultural Policy would operate.  Intensive, large scale factory farming methods are used which have created some difficult surpluses threatening to nullify the original aim of the Common Agricultural Policy.  Therefore we must look to traditional producers and ensure that they will not be paying penalties for surpluses which are being produced in Europe by the type of factory operations I have described.  The Community are not limited to supplying only their own needs.  No agreement has been signed preventing the Community from exporting.  There must be an agreement to require fair competition.  Critics of the policy should not forget that the Community's agri-foodstuffs deficit is large and constantly increasing.</P>
    <P>In the context of the enlarged community we must also look at the demand for food in developing countries, a matter which I know is very close to the heart of the Minister of State.  It is estimated that developing countries will require 16.7 million tonnes of milk and dairy products. That is roughly equivalent to the Community surplus of milk per year, which was 11 million tonnes per year by 1980. The net import trade in 1990 is forecast by the FAO at 67.3 million tonnes of cereals.  That would be about the Community's maximum surplus for export, which is forecast at around 33 million tonnes a year by 1990.</P>
    <P>The stabilising of the Common Agricultural Policy has been fundamental within the Community.  It must play a vital role in an enlarged Community.  A strong and viable agricultural policy will benefit this country.  The Minister must ensure when the CAP is reviewed within the larger Community that the ideals of <Col N="910" /> those who laid the foundations of this policy are retained.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Community should play a more active part in the fight against hunger throughout the world by supplying developing countries at preferential rates and on a regular basis with the agricultural products available in the EC.  We must also consider extending food aid to include new products such as sugar and new milk-based products for direct use.  We could do this by helping developing countries to establish a diversified agricultural system designed to meet their needs.</P>
    <P>All these matters must be considered within the Community.  Distinction must be made between food aid and the distribution outside the market of foodstuffs solely for the benefit of victims of hunger. This latter aspect is becoming more important.  What should the Community's role be in the face of this tragedy? Should we establish a special Community fund solely for this purpose, or should we play a part in setting up an international foodbank?</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> The fabric of Europe's agriculture is complex, a finely balanced biological, economic and human network.  The basic principles of the Common Agriculture Policy are consistent with and in the best interest of that balance.  An essential component of the network is the family farm which, we <Col N="911" /> hold, must be maintained to safeguard the very future of European democracy.</P>
      <P>I was pleased to hear our EC Commissioner, Mr. Peter Sutherland, give an assurance last week in Cork that he would oppose any attempt to remove the support mechanisms inherent in the Common Agriculture Policy.  I totally support and applaud his statement but he may find himself out of step with his colleagues.  It might take all his persuasive powers and those of our Ministers to maintain the CAP in its present form within an enlarged Community.  The larger the Community become the greater the problems will be for the budget.</P>
      <P>There are many other matters affecting agriculture but I will not deal with them now.  I will have an opportunity at a later stage to discuss the Green Paper dealing with a review of the CAP.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that in the enlarged Community the ideals and the aims of the Treaty of Rome will be supported and sustained. Their relevance is as important now as then.  Let us hope that in the enlarged Community we will move towards greater European co-operation, bringing a better future for members.</P>

      <P>A debate here should be an exchange of views on the subject for discussion.  In the last hour I listened to a fine recital, the first half of which was very well read, about the CAP.  The Deputy's statement contained all the old myths and cliches as well as some evergreen truths about the CAP.  It drew many wrong conclusions which did not seem to be related in any way to what we <Col N="912" /> are discussing.  The hope was expressed that nothing would change as a result of the enlargement of the Community by 50 million people.  It is not sufficient to say that, because it would be wrong for us to assume that there will not be changes.</P>
      <P>According to the Minister's statement this Bill is a formality which is necessary because of our laws and Constitution.  Let us not delude ourselves that by this piece of legislation we are opening the door for Spain and Portugal, that it is within our power either to bring them in or keep them out.  We represent 3 million people in a community of 220 million.  Individually as a nation we are as important as any other State, and collectively we are just as important as any other group of 3 million people in the Community, and naturally we have to move along with the tide.</P>

      <P>Of course, and we must not sit whingeing and grumbling.  I listened this morning to two contributions from the opposite side, but neither made any reference to the EC enlargement in any constructive way.  Both speakers expressed fears that for some reason or another our position is being threatened, that we are extremely vulnerable and that we are afraid.  I do not see any reason why we should be afraid of the consequences of EC enlargement.</P>
      <P>It is not within our power to prevent this development.  From the moment of our accession we knew that this was a very likely development.  If the Opposition were in Government today they would be introducing the same piece of legislation as a result of the same negotiations. Of course, we will have adverse as well as favourable results from the EC enlargement.  It is the same in families.  If a family has another member born into it, the others can huff and puff and be jealous, as some children do when a family is enlarged, but they have to live with it, and they can eventually convert the advent of the new family member to the benefit of the rest.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="913" /> I am almost sickened by the negative approach of Opposition speakers who do not seem to be able to relate the problems of enlargement to the existing Community. All they can say is that the CAP must not be changed.  Making false claims will not make the CAP perfect.  We heard about increased productivity.  The CAP has brought us many benefits, but it has not kept our small farmers on the land and, in its present form, it will not succeed in keeping small farmers on the land.</P>
    <P>Even the Opposition, when they made their plans for agriculture, suggested that 3,000 people annually were leaving the land.  With 120,000 farmers left on the land that is a high proportion.  It means there has been a rapid reduction in the number of people on the land.  Deputies spoke of increased productivity.  The relative productivity of European agriculture in terms of labour units has declined in the past 20 years.  We must recognise, side by side with agriculture, that employment in manufacturing industry has declined.  Therefore, the relative productivity of the agricultural community has declined marginally in recent years in Europe.</P>
    <P>EC membership has been put forward as a magnificent international trading opportunity.  The truth is that our international trade in agriculture is the dumping of our surplus, because we do not produce any agricultural commodity which we can sell competitively in the world.  That is another serious problem which we must appreciate.  Enlargement or no enlargement this recital is false.</P>
    <P>Incomes have varied between States and in sectors in agriculture as widely as one to 27 &mdash; between smaller farmers in the southern region of the Community and the bigger dairy farmers in the north. Even in two countries with similar climates and similar agricultural products, Ireland and Holland, including value added per labour unit engaged, the comparison is 4,000 units in Ireland as against 17,000 in Holland.  They are the problems that the CAP has not resolved.  Anybody who says that Community preferences are a panacea for the future happiness <Col N="914" /> and stability and welfare of the rural community in Ireland is very foolish.</P>
    <P>Deputy Noonan said that 80 per cent of production was achieved by 20 per cent, but 80 per cent of the money is going to 20 per cent who need subsidisation. The subject of family farming could be a big debate.  For instance, many people in my constituency in Sligo Leitrim and in Connemara would regard the 100 cow farm in Limerick as a family farm which should be suppressed.</P>
    <P>All these handy cliches will now provide a reasonable solution.  We must accept that the CAP has not brought uniform benefits to those engaged on the land here, has not stabilised the numbers employed and has not given a secure standard of living to all engaged in farming. The suggestion in the Treaty that this could be done is nonsense without reference to all the various sectors and the differences in capability of individuals. Any policy that would guarantee reasonable incomes for everybody in an industry is foolish.</P>
    <P>I welcome sincerely the decision to let Spain and Portugal into the Community. I welcome that decision, first, for the very good reason that it has been advocated throughout Europe for many years past and they are countries that have developed their democratic systems fairly rapidly.  They have had their civil difficulties in the not so distant past.  They are not as economically developed as are some of their Northern neighbours.  We recognise that we cannot guarantee the stability of democracy anywhere, whether that be in the north or south of Europe, America, Asia or elsewhere.  It was generally recognised that new democracies require assistance, greater communication and trade links with their neighbours.  It is for such development that we want Spain and Portugal to join the EC.  My confidence in their democratic systems has increased in recent years.  I have watched them progress from the establishment of their structures of government, the holding of successive elections, which have been held peacefully and successfully, leading to changes of leadership and government.  One gets the impression <Col N="915" /> that those democracies are fairly safe and secure.  They will be more so within a united Europe.  It is true to maintain that Europe will be safer, more secure with Spain and Portugal as members of the EC.  With 12 members we shall have half of the OECD countries, a tremendously influential economic bloc in the world, which will control something like 40 per cent of world trade, representing 40 per cent more people than in the USA.  It will be an economic bloc which can have a tremendous influence in the world.  There is to be considered the political power of the Council of Ministers sitting in political co-operation which will be significantly stronger and more influential when Spain and Portugal are admitted.</P>
    <P>There is the other problem, that we proceeded to finalise our negotiations before having developed the types of structures appropriate to a Community as long in existence as is this one.  That is one reservation I had.  Over the past year I was fairly seriously concerned that the day would arrive when Spain and Portugal would be admitted, when the member states of the Community would increase from ten to 12 before we had arrived at clear understandings of how we should pursue the whole process of future decision-making.  In this respect it appears we are not making much progress at present.  Indeed, in the eyes of ordinary people the question seems to be whether the European Parliament should be given more power, whether the veto should remain as an instrument for protecting the rights and needs of individual member states.  I regret very much that progress has not been made in that area. It would appear that our people, through their elected representatives on both sides of this House, do not seem to have developed a realisation of the importance of creating, within the EC, structures of government that will work.  We do not have those at present.  We have a European Parliament, somewhat like our local authorities, comprised of people who sit there and talk about many things over which they have no control or influence. <Col N="916" /> The one way in which to make that Parliament more responsible would be to give it authority to make effective decisions or to participate therein.</P>
    <P>On the other hand there is the problem of the European Council which is not a democratic institution; nobody could deny that Ministers are elected or selected in the normal way in which governments operate.  That is all right at national level.  But, when, say, our Minister for Finance or for Agriculture is transplanted into a European situation, sitting with the representatives of ten other countries wheeling and dealing, bargaining and vetoing, behind closed doors, not open to public scrutiny by way of participation in the taking of important decisions and negotiations &mdash; it must be said that is not the way in which to develop a Community of states which we hope will become eventually a Federal Europe in which we can hand over to Europe institutions the decisions that can most appropriately be taken at that level.  For example, we do not want any decision that can be taken in, say, Carrick-on-Shannon or Castlebar, to taken away from there.  Neither do we want any decisions that can most effectively be taken in, say, London or Dublin, to be taken from them.  On the other hand, there are decisions to be taken which will affect us.  We can decide to pursue participation in or the taking of such decisions through democratic means, or through the more ineffective, slow and cumbersome means obtaining at present.</P>
    <P>Regardless of the occasional stateman-like utterances of various leaders and Ministers this country seems to have chosen the more murky or obscure path. We do not appear to have come to appreciate the importance of effective decision-making instruments at European level.  It appears we are so jealous of our national position, our imagined national autonomy, we are afraid to concede any of it to larger, international institutions.  We seem to think we can be masters of our own destiny.  Anybody who had any illusions about that should have taken note a few Sundays ago when the Americans gave the wink to the heads <Col N="917" /> of other states, invited them to Washington, sat down behind closed doors, took decisions which immediately affected our house mortgage payments, the value of our savings, the price of our lifestock and cereals on world markets, our inflationary problems.  All of these things were affected by decisions of heads of five states sitting behind closed doors &mdash; without the attendance of the press &mdash; after which they said what they wanted us to believe.  But we cannot deny that they took decisions which affected us.  The EC was not represented there.  Therefore we did not have a say.  Individual European states attended.  I believe they should not have attended.  We should have been loud in our protest to our colleagues.  At least we should have sent the President of the EC Commission&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not contending that we should have delayed the accession of Spain and Portugal until such matters were straightened out.  We should have straightened out such matter before those two countries were due for admission.  I am accusing our leadership of failing to recognise the opportunities open to them, of failing to see beyond our small boundaries, failing to recognise where the real, long term interests of our people lie.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole process of decision-taking will be enormously complicated by the accession of two other states.  For example, if ten member states found it so hard it is only natural that 12 will find it that much more difficult.  There is no conceivable important decision we could propose taking that will not affect the vital interest of one or other of those states, or a large portion of one or other of them.  This will be seen by shortsighted politicians &mdash; who temporarily occupy the ministerial offices of Finance or Agriculture &mdash; as political threats to themselves, Ministers who may well impose their veto in an effort to win favour in a region, constituency or in a <Col N="918" /> state of the Community.  We should have got rid of the idea of one state being able to hold up decisions.  We who can least afford to do so, support the idea of our Government being able to veto decisions.</P>
    <P>There was a very sensible point in the draft Treaty which proposed that the Commission would submit proposals for decisions already decided on by Parliament to the Council but that if any country has a vital national interest it should be put in writing and the decision delayed.  That is fair enough.  Just imagine if this country had the Dáil representatives of the Twenty-six Counties and that the agreement of all was required to get decisions.  If that was the case we would never get decisions on anything and we will not get decisions in Europe while this foolish idea exists that a veto can facilitate the interests of member states. As long as we believe that, no progress will be made in Europe.  It is a fallacy; it is as if ten people were driving a car, all of them having a brake at their feet and none being able to go forward because everyone could stop the car and not even nine could make it go.  We are assuming that three million people can stop the whole decision-making process of 300 million people.  If we extend that, we are assuming that 3.5 million people can tell 320 million people that they cannot go one step further without the agreement of the minority.  That is nonsense.  If we put the short term interests of three million people before the development plans of 300 million people it is bound to be a recipe for stagnation.  We who have most to gain have also most to lose.</P>
    <P>There is one point in the accession of Spain and Portugal which is not generally recognised, the vulnerability of individual states in Europe as far as unemployment and economic problems are concerned.  The economic problems of the Community are serious and are highlighted by the fact that there are so many unemployed.  The question always is if we can have a reflationary programme and if we can create employment.  When Spain and Portugal join the Community we will increase the number of people on the land of Europe by something like 35 per <Col N="919" /> cent.  The idea that a Common Agricultural Policy can be designed to retain those people on the land and to give them acceptable standards of living is nonsense.  We will not solve the agricultural problem or unemployment by insisting that all the people on the land in Spain and Portugal, as well as many in Greece and Italy and some in this country who cannot make a living should not stay on the land.  We must accept that they will have lower standards of living, low productivity and subsidisation from the State.  However, that is not the answer to unemployment.  If that were applied to steel, textiles and other industries what sort of chaos would there be?  Our economic development would be retarded by 20 years and we would have the standard of living which we had 30 years ago.  The solution must be a single market with freedom of access by every manufacturer and provider of services to every part of the Community.</P>
    <P>The United States are not really affected by what goes on in the rest of the world.  They only trade something like 10 per cent of all that they produce.  In Japan the figure is a little higher but even in the Federal Republic of Germany it is 25 per cent or so.  In France it is higher still; in Ireland it is 60 per cent and in Belgium it is even higher.  We have more to gain by genuine open markets than anybody else and we cannot have genuine open markets if we do not have common economic policies.  We will not have those policies as long as our present decision making process exists.  The biggest concern I have in regard to the enlargement of the Community is the accession of two more members before we have streamlined our own system of Government.</P>
    <P>I spoke before about the negative approach.  We heard one long speech this morning about fisheries which is attached by a very fine thread to the accession of Spain and Portugal.  The whole question of fishing was discussed in depth with the advent of Spain to the Community.  There could not have been more consternation in the court of Queen Elizabeth when the Armada set sail than there seems to be <Col N="920" /> among the members of Fianna Fáil when they heard that Spain proposes to take her fleet into the waters of the European Community.  Of course there is obvious competition but we sell fish to Spain at the moment and the balance is in their favour.  The same applies to Portugal.  We can set about putting that right but where is our plan for the development of our own fisheries?</P>
    <P>When we joined the Community the waters around our coast were richer in fish than they are now but we were not able to conserve them, catch them, protect or process them.  Neither did we have a development plan on the drawing board or before this House for development of those fisheries.  When we joined the Community we got considerable assistance. In 1983 we got two-thirds of all the money spent on fisheries.  I do not have up-to-date figures but we have got tremendous assistance from the Community for the protection of our fisheries. We have also the strength of the Community behind us in regard to conservation as well as generous grants from FEOGA.  We also receive export aids and we have doubled our catch.  While I know there is a greater potential in this industry, no other industry can claim to have increased production by 100 per cent over the last ten years, although I am subject to correction on that figure.  I accept that there are risks and that we should have made more progress but we should acknowledge the progress which we have made and if our obligation as a member of the Community forces us to concede a little more than we are happy to concede, the privilege of being a member has also given us immense advantages which we would not otherwise have made.  We should stress the positive elements and not give the impression that there is no gain as far as our membership is concerned.</P>
    <P>The political power of the European Community will increase as a result of the accession of Spain and Portugal.  This is welcome because those who have political, economic and military clout are listened to and the Community of 12 will have immense economic and political <Col N="921" /> clout.  If we get our decision-making structures in order we can develop our currency and contribute immensely to peace in the world by taking initiatives. We will have closer relationships with Latin-America and some of the North African countries and if we develop our resources we can help to solve the problems of fledgling democracies through our food aid programmes.  Twelve countries working together can achieve the results which 12 individual countries in Europe could never hope to achieve.  We can sit on the fence and whinge or participate and I do not accept that we have any reason to be nervous of the enlargement of the Community as Opposition Members would have us believe.  They have moaned and groaned throughout this debate without even the courtesy of a welcoming word to 50 million new inhabitants of the Community.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of crying about the Regional and the Social Funds. Ireland has done reasonably well out of those policies.  While all the emphasis is on the Common Agricultural Policy &mdash; the truth is it is a much bigger proportion of European spending than the 40 per cent mentioned by Deputy Noonan; it is nearer 65 per cent &mdash; if some of that money were transferred from agriculture to the regional fund and if the same rules operated with regard to spending that money, our gain would be considerably greater than what it is at present.  We enjoy something like 6 per cent of the Regional Fund and over 10 per cent of the Social Fund.  We get only about 3 per cent of guaranteed spending but we get a considerably higher proportion, around 11 per cent, in respect of the structural side of agricultural spending.  This leads me to conclude that the remote and disadvantaged regions of the Community such as the west of Ireland have nothing to lose if more money is spent on the structural side of agriculture as well as in the regional and social funds.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to demand continual and increased expenditure, but the prospect of an increased budget for the EC in the short term is very remote.  We will have to get the institutional question <Col N="922" /> settled.  We will have to see how the new Community of 12 progresses and we will have to start negotiations all over again. In my opinion, that will take a number of years and if anyone in a remote and disadvantaged area of Ireland expects that there will be an increase in the short term in spending by the EC they will be disappointed.  We are doing about as well as we can expect.  What we have to do is to get the money to the places and the people who are entitled to it under the regulations.  We will have to use the money in such a way so as to reduce our need.</P>
    <P>In the past many of the transfers of cash that came to us because of our membership of the community were used to fuel inflation.  That money did not solve our agricultural problems.  By fuelling inflation the agricultural margins were reduced.  The money was not invested to make us more competitive or to improve our infrastructure.  We wasted the opportunity at that time.  However, the money is still coming in and it will continue to come at the present rate.  We cannot expect great increases but we can expect a readjustment of policies.</P>
    <P>Half of the farmers of Ireland live in the west and they get about 25 per cent of all of the aid given to agriculture.  On behalf of those whom I represent I would welcome some changes in this area.  It could only be to their advantage.  We got a fairly clear guarantee in a statement made by the Council of Ministers on 30 March 1985 that there will be no reduction in the amount of regional aid to Ireland as a result of the entry of Spain and Portugal.  While in nominal percentage terms we will get a smaller percentage, in actual volume terms we have a fairly firm guarantee that we will not be any worse off.</P>
    <P>Of course, there will be other effects. We should say to the young people of this country that the possibilities for them within a Europe of 12 are considerably greater than in a Europe of Ten.  All the time we are widening the markets in which we can compete; all the time we are creating a wider area within a most civilised and affluent part of the world <Col N="923" /> within which they may travel, offer their services or engage in work and manufacturing; all the time we are enlarging a Community whose citizens will want to see other parts of the Community.</P>
    <P>Under improved European legislation we can more easily enjoy the benefits of joint ventures.  Perhaps we could join with a Spanish company that has too many ships and involve them in processing facilities.  We can enjoy the benefit of their market for cereals and dairy products. We should be sending the message to that part of Europe that we produce the highest quality dairy and livestock products.  There are immense opportunities waiting for us.  Our area of operations has been extended and this is something that should be welcomed by every civilised citizen here.</P>
    <P>Naturally we will have to face competition in some areas.  We cannot expect to be treated as the pet child of the European Community any longer.  We recognised when Greece became a member that that privileged position was lost to us.  We will have to share with areas such as Portugal and parts of Spain whatever regional funds and assistance are available from the richer countries.  We have developed economically to about the same stage as Spain.  In the years ahead we should watch and see if we can make greater economic progress than they make.  It is the only other country in the EC whose gross domestic product <i>per capita</i> is about equal to ours.  This is an area in which we can compete as the years go on.</P>
    <P>With all my heart I welcome the accession of Spain and Portugal into the Community.  In the 15th century and the 16th century the citizens of Ireland were the only people who could go into the kingdom of Spain and enjoy equal rights as citizens of that country.  From 1 January next they will be able to do so again.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The previous speaker said we were not very enthusiastic about this matter.  It is not a matter of enthusiasm but of examining the facts closely to see how the accession of the new <Col N="924" /> members will affect us.  It is only natural that we should do that.  It has always been the ambition to enlarge the Community and thus increase the purchasing power of our products.  We must examine the effects upon us so far as fisheries, agriculture and tourism are concerned.  Our spokesman on fisheries and agriculture outlined some of the problems as they saw them and also some of the defects in the negotiations on fisheries.</P>
      <P>The most commonly used word in the EC at the moment is &ldquo;surpluses&rdquo;.  There is talk about a surplus of milk, milk products and of grain and there is also talk that in future there will be a surplus of meat.  The accession of Spain will increase the utilised agricultural area of the present Community by 40 per cent and it will increase the agricultural labour force by 25 per cent.  The number of holdings will increase by 32 per cent and there will be a 14 per cent increase in the number of consumers.  We must realise that countries such as Spain and Portugal have low purchasing power.</P>
      <P>I attended meetings of the Council of Europe for many years and the Spanish delegations made very good contributions. They were a very fine group of politicians, very intelligent and articulate. As politicians they have a great deal to contribute to the Community.</P>
      <P>In my view, the problem in the Community is that we do not have policies like the Common Agricultural Policy.  We do not have a common fisheries policy or a common forestry policy.  The party in the EC with which Fianna Fáil are associated are pressing for a common forestry policy.  When the Common Agricultural Policy was negotiated in the late fifties agriculture and fisheries played a more important part in the economy than they do at present.  When there were only six in the EC 20 per cent of the workforce contributed 10 per cent of the GDP in the CAP alone.  By the mid seventies that figure had droped by 50 per cent in total employment in agriculture and by 5 per cent in the GDP contribution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This brings us to the effect the superlevies and the present restrictions leave on us.  Deputy Noonan spoke very <Col N="925" /> strongly about that.  Most of the food surpluses in the EC are caused by the importation of food from non-Community countries.  Increasing the size of the Community will not affect that.  In 1981 to 1982, 18 per cent of livestock products were produced from food purchased outside the Community.  West Germany bought 13 milion tonnes of non-Community food to produce 56 million tonnes of livestock produce.  Holland imported 13.4 million tonnes to produce 26 million tonnes of produce, while in Ireland we produced 9 million tonnes but only imported .9 million tonnes of non-Community food.</P>
    <P>This is where the problem lies.  As long as we continue to import such a large volume of food into the Community we will have a very serious problem.  Remedying this problem should be a priority for the Community.  This year we will have a grain surplus, yet massive amounts of food are being imported into the Community for factory farms and we cannot compete.  It is time to take a close look at the Common Agricultural Policy. Countries like Ireland should not have to suffer because other EC countries import from non-Community countries.</P>
    <P>We must examine the Regional Fund and how it works.  This fund was set up with the prime purpose of helping the most seriously disadvantaged areas. Spain and Portugal will expect to gain much from this fund, as we did when we joined.  We believed that certain areas, especially the Border regions and the West, would benefit greatly and would get a new lease of life.  We have to admit that we have done well out of this fund, the Common Agricultural Policy and the Social Fund.  The European Social Fund has made a great impact on this country, as any member of a health board can verify.  We got money for our regional colleges and various institutions from the Community, but we are still disappointed about the quota and non-quota sections of the Regional Fund.  More practical work should have been done.</P>
    <P>A number of EC-aided studies have been carried out but there was poor follow-up in many cases and many of those <Col N="926" /> studies involved a great deal of duplication. In my region, there was an Erne catchment EC study funded by the two sovereign Governments and the EC at a cost in excess of £100,000.  There was a study by the EC and the North-Eastern Development Organisation, also costing in the region of £100,000, and a third study carried out by the Social and Economic Committee of the EC.  We were glad of the opportunity to bring these representatives around the area to see the black spots which needed attention, especially in the Border region.  Those three studies cost approximately £300,000, and if one were to read the three reports one would think that a great part of them was written by the same person because most of the phraseology and the wording of certain passages were identical.  Such studies should make a strong impact if they are to develop confidence in the areas.</P>
    <P>A number of things have happened recently which make one wonder how the EC are operating.  I heard that one of our largest co-operatives were linking with an American concern.  They wanted to pool their knowledge in advanced dairy technology, product innovation, and so on. The American company had 250 production lines &mdash; 50 different brands of butter, 180 different types of cheeses with turkey and other mixtures, and so on. This meant the company were by passing the EC.  I wonder if some of these large concerns see a greater opportunity to sell their products outside the EC rather than within.</P>
    <P>I do not know how Spain and Portugal will be affected by this but at present there is pressure in the Community to formulate a common forestry policy. 1985 was to be the year to concentrate on the development of forestry.  We have belatedly realised the potential of forestry. A positive approach is needed urgently.  There has been grant aid to the extent of 80 per cent of the cost of planting plus guidance from the foresters in the Department of Forestry.  Timber production in the EC before the accession of Spain and Portugal was 82 million cubic meters per year.  We imported timber and <Col N="927" /> timber-based products at a rate of 126 million cubic metres per year.  That gives an indication of the potential market in Europe for a product that we can supply, when so many other products are in surplus. There should be a real examination of the marginal land with a view to utilising its potential for timber production having regard to the fact that we are importing so much.  About 5½ per cent of all industrial workers are involved in wood using industries.  That is on a par with those engaged in the car and textile industries.  We could use all this marginal land to produce timber.  It is estimated that there will be an 8 per cent shortfall in world supply by the year 2000 and a 32 per cent shortfall by the year 2025.  We could produce this product.  At present we are only self-sufficient by 50 per cent of our timber needs.  The EC by the end of the century will have imported 100 million cubic metres of saw log and wood pulp, costing approximately £10,000 million per year.  In the UK alone 90 per cent of their requirements costs £4.5 billion and they will supply only a tenth of their needs by the end of the century. We should examine what we can do to fulfil that need fairly quickly.</P>
    <P>Since our entry to the EC there has been so much change that there should be a close examination at national level in regard to how we have fared so far and as to our future prospects.  The EC must be restructured in the light of recent problems which occurred as a result of the milk levy.  We in Connacht and Ulster were deeply concerned at the approach of the EC and at the national approach to the quota system.  The small producer geared mainly to milk production should have been recognised.  The quota system should have operated proportionately. That was one of the weaknesses in it.</P>
    <P>I appreciate the benefits of our participation in the EC although many structures need to be changed and we hope there will be continuing benefits for this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to be involved in this debate.  It is important <Col N="928" /> that the EC are giving an opportunity to Spain and Portugal to become members. We have strong historical connections with the Iberian Peninsula, particularly with Spain, and now there is an opportunity for us to acknowledge those.  We must also use this opportunity to ensure that Ireland is guaranteed preservation within the full meaning of the EC.  Since we became members in 1973 we have not made full use of our membership. Recently I had the privilege of spending a week in Europe with the European Democratic Alliance, visiting European institutions and meeting various people from Commissioner Sutherland to other people in the Commission, members of the European Parliament and members of the European Investment Bank and I have no fears for the future of Europe. Europe is so powerful as a political grouping and as a financial organisation that the future of Europe is guaranteed.  A small financial decision at any time by the Council of Ministers to change the VAT rates one way or the other can guarantee a large amount of money for use of the members, particularly the less well off states.</P>
      <P>Spain and Portugal are coming into the Community to benefit as we all did.  We have not garnered all the financial opportunities available in Europe.  There has been pressure on the world economy over the last few years and it is obvious that financial pressure will be put on the financial resources of Europe.  If we had moved sooner after joining the EEC we could have stabilised our economic position and got more from the Community. There were many programmes for development when the first Coalition Government concluded the negotiations in 1973 which could have been enshrined in the European mechanism and which would have been available for financial support over the years so that now when there is need for them to boost our economy they could be brought forward.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My main worry in relation to the entry of Spain and Portugal is the possible major threat to our national resources, particularly our maritime resources.  We <Col N="929" /> know that Spain has a tremendous professional fleet and we know the number of times they entered our waters.  They are constantly fishing close to the Irish coast.  We know the number of times our naval vessels and the Department of Communications and the Department of Defence have had to encounter and report those people within Europe.  It seems that it is not possible to take very severe action against them.  This could be a threat to our fishing resources.  Before Ireland accepts the entry of Spain and Portugal we should ensure that the Irish fishing industry and fishing fleet will be protected in the years ahead.  The entry of two nations into Europe gives a major opportunity to our Government and to various Government Departments to renegotiate various programmes and assistance that has been available and which could be available to us.</P>
    <P>There is also an opportunity for our Government and the various Departments to negotiate the quota system whether it is in beet, milk, intervention beef or whatever else.  As we agree to new membership, the fact that we are a full member very committed to Europeanisation and the development of the EC presents a major opportunity for our Government to renegotiate our position and ensure that the maximum advantage is available to the people of this island as we make our contribution in Europe and as we try to survive in our difficult economic climate.</P>
    <P>In the dairy industry we have now a quota system and we have seen only this week that we are in a serious situation. We have gone over the quota already with two months left in the year.  What does this mean for Irish dairy farmers? What does it mean for the small dairy farmer in the west who has not reached full development potential?  Due to the situation and the location that he finds himself in, the quality of his land, the small, fragmented farms, the need for more land to be made available to him and the need for finance at a low rate, what future is there for him?  We know that the EC are having second thoughts <Col N="930" /> about a programme for compulsorily getting people to give up milk production. That has been changed to a more voluntary situation and shortly a system will be offered to dairy farmers, particularly the smaller ones, whereby they can voluntarily make their exit from the dairy industry here and throughout Europe at some short term financial reward for them.  What does that mean for their families and their future?  What does it mean for a small, developing country like Ireland?</P>
    <P>Europe has acknowledged since the early seventies the disadvantaged situation that our country is in.  We have been treated for regional aid as a full entity, a full island, a full nation.  No other country or member state has been treated in that fashion.  That is solid recognition of the situation we are in here as a disadvantaged nation.  I do not think that over the years, particularly in the early years since we became a full member of the Community, we have made full use of that situation.  If money being borrowed from the European Investment Bank reaches something in the region of £250 million, there is a direct grant into the Exchequer in the region of £15 million to £16 million.  That was well utilised by our Government in the early eighties when various projects under semi-State bodies and local authorities were put forward, for example Bord Telecom Éireann, Irish Steel and the Moneypoint electrification plant in Limerick.</P>
    <P>All of those were put forward and we got a great deal of money out of them which heped to generate economic activity locally and throughout the country. However, we have seen over the past year or two that these programmes for development have not been put forward and international European money that could be available here at a low rate has not been utilised to the maximum.  That is sad.  We saw in October 1982 the Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Lenihan, negotiating a loan from the European Investment Bank of £100 million at 5 per cent <Col N="931" /> to Irish farmers when the Government, the farmers and the commentators recognised a need for capital input into Irish agriculture to give it a boost, to stabilise the problems it had, to help it come out of its difficulties and to help to preserve economic growth.  With the change of Government in November 1982, and particularly as a result of the budget in 1983, the opportunity was lost to Irish farming.</P>
    <P>What has happened over the past two years?  We see farms going into receivership. For the first time ever the ACC are appointing receivers to farms.  That is totally new and ridiculous as regards financial management of firm assets.  Had that loan been available at that time when the only risk was that the international monetary transfer had to be guaranteed by the State which was a total risk of maybe 1, 2 or 3 per cent on the total borrowing, we could have got a total capital grant into the State of something in the region of £10 million or £12 million which would offset that risk.  That was good economics and good financial management and we failed to utilise that important opportunity.  We have failed consistently over the years to utilise the major programmes for development that are available to this country.</P>
    <P>Let me go back to when we joined the EC.  We have been acknowledged over the years as being primarily an agricultural country.  We have built up an industrial base over the past 30 years.  We have been dependent on the high technology industries over the past ten or 12 years. Now, due to the world recession, the high technology industries are not guaranteeing the income or giving the jobs that we expected.  When you get over-saturation of the marketplace, world competition and development of technology on a world status, then Ireland, a small, open economy with a small consumer number and small consumer demand, is put in an invidious and difficult position.  We failed to acknowledge that major programmes for development and financial assistance were available from Europe in the early days after joining the Community.</P>

      <P>I am disappointed at the Minister's interruption, but I hope he is not in a European <i>cul-de-sac</i> representing this country or that we have to look straight down a narrow tunnel and not visualise the opportunities that are available within the Community.  This entry of two nations into an enlarged Community provides this country, an existing member state, with an opportunity to (1) reaffirm our position and (2) renegotiate certain situations.  I am trying to illustrate that as a result of these two countries coming before us for full membership of the Community, these are opportunities we should utilise.  It is incumbent on me as a member of this House representing a section of this country, a deprived section of this island, the western section, the disadvantaged section, to pinpoint on behalf of the people I represent and of the country to this Government and to the Minister, who is very much involved in Europe &mdash; let me say that we commend him for his efforts &mdash; that we do not want him to operate in a <i>cul-de-sac</i> that would not guarantee opportunities in as far as they are not being made available to us because we are not putting forward the programmes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have been recognised over the years as basically an agricultural country.  We joined Europe to make our contribution to agriculture and particularly to utilise the CAP which has been the bedrock of the success of the EC.  Agriculture, its resources and its products as a contribution to world and European food has ensured that the finances generated can be diverted and utilised to improve industry and infrastructure and to create regional and social aid.  On going into Europe in 1973 we did not utilise at that time, and still have not done so, the amount of aid that was available under the marketing sector of the CAP particularly under Council Regulation No. 355/77.</P>
      <P>There is major aid for livestock marketing and for the processing sector, and we have never in our 12 years membership of the EC put forward any programme to avail of aid under that regulation.  This is an opportunity now, as we accept and are prepared to accept the expansion of Europe, to put forward a programme for aid under this Council regulation.  Over the years, particularly over the past 30 years, agriculture has had a major transformation and a leap forward.  We can go back to the early sixties, to the days of the old livestock fairs and the difficulty they created in the market place, in the urban areas and for farmers.  In the sixties and early seventies we had the starting up of the livestock marts and major aid was available under that regulation for expansion and the development of livestock marts and livestock marketing.  Government Departments, in particular the Department of Agriculture, had been insisting constantly that livestock marts be up to European standards.  In many instances those operating the marts were prosecuted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department has been insisting constantly that our livestock marketing units be brought into line with European standards but neither the Department nor successive Governments made application under Regulation 355/77 for the aid that is available readily. There is an amount of money available to increase marketing potential and marketing ability by way of the livestock marketing sector, a sector that has been developed without any Government aid. As we accept the accession of Spain and Portugal to the Community we must utilise the CAP and the regulation to which I have referred.  We have now an outstanding opportunity to put a major programme before the Commission and the Council of Ministers.  The Minister must ensure that aid is made available to expand our marketing ability and to improve our economic development. Many jobs could be created in the construction industry by way of a major spin-off of our utilising the CAP to the maximum advantage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I trust also that this opportunity will be availed of by the Government to ensure that more regional aid will be made available to Ireland.  In the west, which is a disadvantaged area, we have been the victims of many difficulties down through the years.  Infrastructure, the topography of the area and so on have created many difficulties for the farmers and for the people of the west generally.  This summer the Shannon rose to astronomical proportions and destroyed much of the fodder, grazing and forage that was available for livestock.  The Government must utilise the enlargement of the Community as a means of obtaining special aid to provide immediate assistance for the west and in particular they must put to the Community a programme for regional development which would ensure that financial assistance is availabe on at least a 50-50 basis.  Special aid to the extent of between 75 and 85 per cent is available for the west but it should be possible to obtain a 90 per cent grant <Col N="935" /> aid by way of a special programme for regional development for the west.  This would ensure the draining of the Shannon and the bringing into productivity of thousands of acres of land.</P>

      <P>This opportunity must not be lost.  Europe is becoming a very large development area and it looks as if there will not be much opportunity for further expansion of the European territory. Therefore, an opportunity of the kind being offered to us now will not be available again for many years.  That is why I am pressing the Government to <Col N="936" /> utilise that opportunity to the maximum. The difficulties we have encountered can be renegotiated to ensure that as a member state contributing to the development of Europe we in turn can extract the maximum benefits from Europe.  So far we have not exploited the potential of Europe to the full.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I should begin by disqualifying myself to speak to this Bill in so far as Portugal is concerned.  I know a certain amount about Spain, going back over many years from the time when I was a student in that country, but I know nothing about Portugal.  Consequently, most of my remarks will be addressed to the accession of Spain.</P>
      <P>I join with our spokesman on Foreign Affairs in welcoming the Bill and in welcoming also the attitude of Members on all sides to the accession of Spain and Portugal.  The national character in Spain is Don Quixote de La Mancha.  We speak of a friendship with Spain, a <i>rapport</i> with that country, which very often arises from common values and so on but it is important to keep in mind that wherever Don Quixote went Sancho Panza went also to bring Don Quixote back to earth and to the practicalities.  I might say that my colleague from East Galway was playing the role of Sancho Panza when he came under criticism a few moments ago when relating the accession of Spain and Portugal to the reality of the social and regional scene in Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is well to realise that the motivation for joining from the Spanish point of view was as much political as economic.  In our case, apart from the political effect of making some dent on our insularity, our motivation was mainly economic when in the early seventies we conducted a very successful campaign in which we were backed by Fine Gael.  The result was an overwhelming vote for joining the Community. However, we must bear in mind that Senior Gonzales is only the second leader of a democratic Government in Spain since the demise of General Franco.  Democracy in Spain has its problems. The rest of Europe has been busily studying Spain for many decades but it is <Col N="937" /> a country that the rest of Europe has not understood fully.  We should think of that country as being very closely linked with Africa, as well as of its strong cultural and ethnic links with the rest of Europe.</P>
    <P>I am not now dealing with the question of NATO, although a passing reference to that problem as far as we are concerned should also be made, but Spain's joining of the European Community is, from the Spanish point of view, a help towards firming down the new democratic regime in that country.  We know that a couple of attempts have been made to subvert that democracy and should advert to the fact that the King, Juan Carlos, deserves the support and appreciation of all democrats in Europe because of his action on those occasions when the new democracy was in danger.  The passing from the regime of the UCD to the socialist regime was a difficult and dangerous transition.  That Felipe Gonzales and his Government have succeeded in making that transition and in attempting to firm democracy in a place where people tend to see black and white and find it very difficult to see grey or any shading in between deserves the support of the democratic countries which constitute the EC.  I am sure that in that climate and atmosphere Spain will prosper politically.</P>
    <P>The economics, of course, are also important.  I would support fully the inputs of the various speakers in the House who called attention to the areas in economic development in this country which may come under pressure as a result of the joining by Spain and Portugal. We know that the wine problem is a great one.  I had evidence of that from my own eyes in areas of Spain which I knew many years ago, where a huge effort was made to increase the production of olive oil.  That, too, is an area which will make demands on the Common Agricultural Policy.  I know that certain lines have been laid down with regard to those developments.</P>
    <P>The wine industry will probably affect France, Italy and to a certain extent Germany and Greece to a small extent, of the countries already in the Community. <Col N="938" /> The Spanish wine business will impact heavily on Europe and deservedly so, let me say, because of the quality of the Spanish wines which have never been fully appreciated in the wine industry throughout the world, particularly in the Rioja region of Spain, the wines coming from there being of a higher quality than many of the brands that are household names throughout the world.</P>
    <P>The first point that I wanted to make was the political importance of Spain becoming a member and how important it is that the existing members of the Community be seen to sustain that democracy.  Many Spaniards regard that really as the prime motivation, the prime objective of their joining the European Community.  It is well to remember that anarchism, which died out at the end of the 19th century in most of the regions in which it had taken root, right up to comparativley recently &mdash; and I am sure even still &mdash; has a very great number of adherents in Spain.  That will give you an idea of the difficulties that Felipe Gonzales has in ruling a country where such strong and positive political views are held, even on the extreme left, which is characterised by anarchism.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for Education, I made several attempts to address the problems of ignorance in the European Community.  It would be interesting if a television camera were taken into our streets for a <i>vox pop</i> of Spain and Portugal. Due to the development of the tourism industry in Spain, many more people now know something about Spain than used to.  However, it would be interesting to find out how many know the name of the Prime Minister of Spain, or the names of any members of its government; Spain's GNP; the <i>per-capita</i> earnings of the ordinary Spanish citizen.  I give these not as of the most important but as a few examples off the top of my head.  I got general agreement from the Ministers of Education in the Community that there was a need for education in our schools about the Community itself, the individual countries comprising it.  The then Minister for Education in France was very much in support of my proposals <Col N="939" /> with regard to a <i>libro de Europa</i>&mdash; a book of Europe in which each country would be described &mdash; inhabitants, physical characteristisc, gross national product, main industries, cultural and historical background, etc.  Most of the Ministers at that time agreed with me that there was a very frightening ignorance of such details in the Community generally.</P>
    <P>We remember, when the EC began originally with the Six, that the drive for cohesion and expansion was conducted at the educational and cultural levels. However, once the Community got underway, all those things were cast aside and there has been a heavy concentration only on the economics of the Community. As a result, in my opinion the Community has been faltering because the roots of that identification have not been nourished as they should by education in our schools.  We now have 12 countries in the Community.  There should be a book, perhaps loose-leaved, and as the statistics changed from year to year our students could have those changes inserted.  That is still something to which we could address ourselves.</P>
    <P>The Spanish language is being taught in some of our schools but in my view not in enough.  The same is quite true of other European Community languages.  There is a need to push ahead with a scheme which I began in the Department of Education to have a strong oral content, in our education and in our examinations for modern languages.</P>

      <P>I propose to pass to Deputy Taylor copies of two documents, one on Community Energy Objectives to 1990, the other on New Community Energy Objectives for the year 1995, which set out the Community's strategy in this area.</P>
      <P>During the Irish Presidency, at an Energy Council meeting on 13 November 1984, Ministers took stock of the progress which had been made by the Community towards reducing dependence on imported oil and achieving the 1990 objectives.  The Council recognised the need for progress to be sustained despite the current relaxed energy market situation, given the major uncertainties about the long-term outlook for supply and demand.  It also became clear during discussions that the existing 1990 objective were losing their relevance.  As a result the Commission brought forward in June of this year a new proposal for objectives and guidelines to the year 1995 which are at present being discussed in preparatory meetings of the Council.</P>
      <P>At an Energy Council meeting in Luxembourg last June, Ministers discussed this document briefly.  Ireland believes that it is correct to use 1995 as the new target date and to establish both horizontal and sectoral objectives.  The implications of these policy proposals do not present much difficulty for Ireland because they are flexible enough and allow variations between member states and are, in general, in accord with the way in which we would like to see energy policy evolving.</P>
      <P>This matter has been placed on the agenda for discussion at the Energy Council to be held in Brussels on 11 November 1985.</P>

      <P>The main energy policy objectives considered before the Commission were defined in 1980.  Five main guidelines for the Community were laid down to 1990: first, reducing to 0.7, that is the average ratio between the rate of growth and gross primary energy demand and the rate of growth for gross domestic product; secondly, reducing oil consumption to a level of about 40 per cent of primary energy consumption; thirdly, covering 70 to 75 per cent of primary energy requirements for electricity production by means of solid fuels and nuclear energy; increasing the use of renewable energy sources so as to increase their contribution to the Community's energy supplies; and the pursuit of energy pricing policies geared to attain the Community energy objectives.</P>
      <P>We have been trying to get a favourable hearing from the Commission in relation to the further development of peat and there is also concern for the development and exploitation of lignite. In conjunction with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, there is close monitoring of our pollution problems. I would like to feel that energy policy will at all times take cognisance of difficulties in that area.</P>

      <P>There are no proposals before my Department for a development of any discovery in the Celtic Sea or elsewhere, nor are any negotiations on such a possibility taking place.  In so far as block 49/9 is concerned, the necessary full delineation of the hydrocarbon discovery made there has not yet been carried out, and consequently no proposal for development of the find, whether by way of an early production system or otherwise, has been made by the operator on behalf of the consortium concerned or by any member of the consortium.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Further steps towards that delineation have been undertaken by the group this year by way of an agreed 3-D seismic survey over the area.  When the data arising from that survey have been considered, my Department and the group <Col N="943" /> involved will be in a better position to evaluate what further appraisal drilling will be necessary in order to establish if the deposit can be commercially developed.

    <P>
      <Col N="945" /> It is the responsibility of Bord Gáis Éireann to evaluate proposals for the supply of natural gas to particular consumers or areas.</P>
    <P>The extension to areas such as those mentioned by the Deputies which do not have an existing supply of town gas will be considered in due course, but it would not be realistic to assume a likelihood of supply for some considerable time.  I must emphasise that commercially viable markets as well as proximity to the main trunk pipelines are major factors in determining whether or not it would be economic to supply natural gas to a particular area.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the obvious need for the provision of industrial jobs in County Kildare, and keeping in mind the vastly expanding population and the proximity of the pipeline to a number of towns in the county, particularly Athy and Naas, would the Minister consider using his influence with Board Gáis to bring forward the time at which it might be regarded as economical to extend a spur from the pipeline to most of the towns which will have industrial requirements during the next four or five years, rather than wait until it becomes an absolute requirement of immediate priority?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Deputy's concern and he has been in contact on previous occasions in regard to a supply for the Kildare area.  I certainly will give any assistance possible to have the evaluations take place and to have discussions on the proposals that come forward.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the responsibility of Bord Gáis Éireann to deal with proposals as they come forward.  The proper procedure for the people in the midlands is to put forward proposals.  Costings can then be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>As a general policy matter arising from these questions which are being taken together, would the Minister accept that the probability is that there is much more gas still to be discovered in the Celtic Sea?  I understand that recent exploration efforts have been successful.  Therefore, as a general principle would the Minister not consider the desirability to plan for the maximum possible use of the new supplies of gas in addition to Kinsale?  I am talking about a countrywide utilisation of natural gas and the enormous economic benefits that would accrue from the use of this natural resource.  Deputy Kirk referred to its use in Drogheda and Dundalk and suggested that on the way to Drogheda the gas could be made available to all the horticultural producers of north Dublin and up along the coast.  Would the Minister not accept as a principle that arrangements should be made in advance, now, so that we will be in a position to absorb this gas when it becomes available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is aware from his experience in dealing with my Department that advance planning is always taking place, particularly in regard to the supply of gas to Waterford and Limerick.  The time will be very short.  It is early to make an assessment in regard to the likelihood of other gas finds or what the potential of these finds in the Celtic Sea will be.  It is reasonable to think that in the long term there will be more natural gas, but one cannot go further than that.  There is continuous planning, and detailed examination has been done in relation to costings and economic viability of extending natural gas supplies throughout the country.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the general nature of the Minister's reply, but does not the fact that these questions have been tabled from all over the country indicate the need to proceed immediately with at least the planning for a nationwide gas grid?  Does he accept that the provision of this natural resource on a nationwide basis very quickly, perhaps more expeditiously than normally would be prudent, would be totally justified in our present economic circumstances?  Does the Minister appreciate that, in many of those centres of commerce and industry, the greatest single boost that could be given now would be the provision of natural gas?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view of all that, would the Minister be prepared to initiate a policy &mdash; Bord Gáis are there to implement policies laid down by the Minister &mdash; in regard to the immediate urgent use of our natural gas resources for economic development and recovery, particularly in view of the fact that present supplies are most likely to <Col N="949" /> be supplemented by additional resources in the near future?  I am endeavouring to secure from the Minister some acknowledgement of the urgency to make plans for an extension of natural gas supplies.</P>

On the basis of information now available to us the national grid is being extended and we shall continue to do so.  Evaluation has to take place of any proposal coming either to An Bord Gáis or my Department in relation to the commerciality of the project.  But it should be stated quite clearly that there will be projects in relation to the extension of the grid which <Col N="950" /> will not make commercial sense and, on that basis, there will be areas which will not have natural gas.

      <P>As planned, the data for this study is being provided by both the Meterological Service and from my Department's wind demonstration programme.

      <P>I am sorry to persist with this but at one time the ESB were designated by the Government to be the primary agency of research and development in this area.  I accept that the Minister's Department have overall responsibility for surveys, the collection of information, even deciding policy.  In an area of this type, of alternative energy generally as well as wind power, there is a need to have some one agency or institution physically responsible for research and development.  Is the ESB still that organisation or not?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>No, my Department is the Department charged with overall responsibility for the wind power programme. We have installed five wind turbines in co-operation with other bodies. They help us when we need some technical assistance.  The Meteorological Service, under contract to my Department, are carrying out this report with assistance of EC funds.  They are also being assisted by my Department's wind demonstration programme.  Therefore, it is centred in my Department.</P>

To be absolutely clear on it, the entire alternative energy programme, including research and development, is now centred in the Minister's Department &mdash; of course, necessarily involving and deploying other agencies and instruments from time to time.  But the responsibility for research and development for alternative energy is now in the Minister's Department?</P>

Solar energy may be feasible but I do not think there will be considerable substitution of the existing sources of energy for some time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions No. 8 and No. 13 together.</P>
      <P>Bord na Mona decided last May that the Ballyforan briquette factory project which was suspended in May 1984 for a period of one year should continue to be deferred while still being kept under review.  The basis for the board's decision was that the reasons which gave rise to the deferral of the project last year, namely, the inability of the market to absorb the output of Ballyforan at an economic price and the serious burden which further borrowing would place on all of Bord na Móna's operations, still exist.  The effect of the very bad weather during 1985 on Bord na Móna's finances must also be taken into account.  The question of discussions with Bord na Móna concerning the review of the project does not, therefore, arise at the present time but I will, of course, continue to have regular contact with the board concerning all of their operations.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I have explained to the Deputy that the project is under ongoing review.  Because of the inability of the market to absorb the output at an economic price and because of the overall question of the finances of Bord na Móna at present they are not going ahead with the project.  I have asked the board for an ongoing review.  If certain economic factors change in the future there may be a possibility of the factory being built but at present Bord na Móna do not consider it is in their best interest to build the factory in Derryfadda.</P>

      <P>It was delayed after this Government got into office.  The unions could tell him that this delay has cost an additional £3.7 million.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Exploration for gas in west Cavan is being carried out under an exclusive exploration licence, which covers part of the north west carboniferous basin and includes approximately 570 square kilometers in county Cavan. Under the terms of this licence, two exploration wells were drilled in 1984, one at McNean, County Cavan and the other at Drumkeeran, County Leitrim. Only minor indications of gas were encountred in each case.</P>
      <P>Apart from assessing the results of their recently completed drilling programme in the area, of which these two wells were a part, the licensees are now undertaking detailed analysis of additional remotely-sensed data to enable them to decide what future exploration work they will propose to carry out.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>Negotiations with prospective customers for bulk allocation of natural gas are primarily a matter for Bord Gáis Éireann.  Guidelines on pricing policy for BGE which have been agreed by me with the Minister for Finance for large allocations of gas are currently in force.</P>
      <P>Aughinish Alumina Limited have recently experienced considerable difficulties in the alumina market and have requested a very large allocation of gas below the market price by way of assistance.</P>
      <P>It has been the established policy of successive Governments that natural gas should be sold at market prices.  This produces the most favourable allocation of the gas both for the purpose of displacing more expensive oil product imports and of providing an income to the Exchequer which benefits the community at large.</P>
      <P>A working group under the aegis of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism have been appointed to examine the difficulties facing the company and to report on any steps which might be considered to alleviate them.

The Minister <Col N="971" /> should be aware of the major impact that will have not alone in the mid-west but on the economy generally.  If as the Minister says An Bord Gáis can only sell gas to Aughinish Alumina at market price is it not likely that there may be little or no concession to Aughinish Alumina to help them to keep going?  Would the Minister not think, having regard to the economy, that direct negotiations should be opened between the Minister and the management of Aughinish Alumina to deal with the problem having regard to the fact that this company may close?  Would the Minister not also agree that it is best to deal with this at ministerial level rather than at arm's length from An Bord Gáis? Is the Minister further aware that there are four plants, one in Jamaica, one in Quebec, one in Australia and one in Ireland and that one of the four must go? Is the Minister not aware that it looks to us now that the dearest energy is at the plant in Aughinish Island and would the Minister not agree that in an effort to maintain the 800 jobs something positive should be done immediately rather than waiting for the report of some board, which may be too late, which he says is under the auspices of the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern for the future survival of this project. I am aware of the difficulties they are experiencing for various reasons, not all energy related, in their four plants.  I am aware that they have had discussions with the Government in Jamaica where the raw material is.  The Deputy is probably aware of what happened.  The Government's concern in this matter can be seen from the fact that meetings have been held between the Taoiseach and myself and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism with Aughinish Alumina's board of management.  We felt that the best assessment of the difficulties should be made before further discussions would take place.  I assure the Deputy that we are treating this matter as a matter of urgency because of its <Col N="972" /> implications, not just in west Limerick and north Kerry, but because of the national impact.  I do not agree with the Deputy when he says that the report of the committee which has been set up will be too late, because we will have that report in a matter of days and then we will be in a better position to act on it in all our interests and resolve this matter to the benefit of the economy generally and to ensure that the plants stays in production.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that Aughinish Alumina would represent a £20 million a year customer for natural gas and that that gas would replace oil imports and that this would be of tremendous value to the State?  Would the Minister have a very serious look at the approach of An Bord Gáis?  The Minister says that they want to sell the gas to Aughinish Alumina at commercial rates which I understand is somewhere between the region of 40p to 45p per therm.  If my information is correct it appears that Aughnish Alumina suggest that for the purpose of survival they would need that gas at 25p to 30p per therm.  There is quite a gap between what An Bord Gáis and what Aughinish Alumina can pay if the company are to keep in operation.  Will the Minister assure the House that both he and the Government will give the matter serious consideration having regard to the fact that 800 people work there?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the House of that. Our actions to date will bear that out. The Deputy should be aware that when we are talking about energy costs, natural gas may not be the only option and we may find other methods of reducing energy costs to that plant.  All the possibilities are being examined.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Energy (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 25 together.</P>
      <P>The sequence of events which gave rise to the collapse of the arrangements for the take-over of Bula Ltd. by Tara Mines Ltd. was as follows.  On 11 September 1985 Bula Holdings, the principal private shareholder in Bula Ltd., rejected the Tara offer and on 26 September Bula Holdings demanded further substantial consideration for their shareholding and for certain substantial advances they had made to Bula Ltd.  On 4 October Tara Mines Ltd. rejected the further Bula demands and withdrew their offer entirely but my Department had good reason to understand that the Tara withdrawal was a tactical move and that the offer would be reinstated if Bula Holdings decided to accept it.  On 8 October a receiver was appointed over Bula Ltd. and on 9 October Bula Holdings accepted the Tara offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After a series of Tara board meetings, the board decided not to reinstate the offer, stating that the board did not believe that it would be in the best interests of Tara Mines Ltd. to do so.  In a press statement issued by the board, it was stated that Tara had suffered a significant deterioration in their trading position due to a fall in the price of zinc and <Col N="974" /> a less favourable dollar-punt relationship and that the company were incurring heavy losses on their operations.</P>
    <P>In the context of these trading changes I would like to point out these were not overnight happenings but had been gradually developing over the period of the negotiations during the past year. Nevertheless Tara had not only stayed with the negotiations but they had in fact improved their offer on 16 August, they had expressed satisfaction at the settlement of all outstanding issues on 23 August and they had been in correspondence with my Department about aspects of the contract documentation up to the end of September.  I was greatly surprised and disappointed therefore at the totally unexpected about-turn in Tara's attitude very shortly after.  I would also remark that whilst undoubtedly there has been a significant downturn in Tara's trading position, cyclical ups and downs have always been a feature of trade in lead and zinc and it is not the practice for lead and zinc mining interests to take investment decisions on the basis of prevailing market conditions.  It would have been more appropriate to base a decision in this case on expectations of future trading conditions in the circumstances that if the takeover had gone ahead Bula ore would not have come on stream for about two years after conclusion of the deal.  It is noteworthy in this regard that it was stated in the Tara Exploration and Development Company Ltd., 1984 Annual Report that, whilst prospects were that zinc metal prices would decline in the short term, the company anticipated that with increased zinc demand, metal prices will increase.</P>
    <P>In summary, collapse of the deal was due in the first instance to the new demands put forward on 27 September by Bula Holdings which were greatly in excess of terms which that company had accepted in principle in December 1984 and, secondly, it was due to the fact that Tara most unexpectedly pulled out of a deal finally agreed in the terms they had offered and to which they were fully committed up to a very short time before they retracted it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="975" /> I most strongly reject the suggestion of disastrous handling of the negotiations by my Department who had acted as intermediary between the companies in the deal at the request of Tara Mines Ltd.  The Minister for Energy, myself and officials of my Department had spent long hours over the past ten months in the task and had eventually brought the deal to a point that there were agreed terms for a settlement.  I continue to be of the view that the national interest, the interests of the people in the Navan area and the longer-term interests of Tara Mines Ltd., would best have been served by integrated development of the Tara and Bula portions of the Navan orebody.</P>
    <P>The development of the Bula ore reserves depends at this juncture on action by the receiver over the company in regard to the company's assets.  In the meantime certain contracts involving the possibility of development of the ore reserves by other interests will be pursued. At this stage it would not be appropriate for me to furnish details on these contacts or to anticipate what the outcome will be.  Any arrangements which may emerge would be subject to the receiver's approval, of course.</P>
    <P>Loans totalling almost £900,000 were advanced by the Department to Bula Ltd. at certain stages to avert action by the banks when serious negotiations were in progress that held out the prospect of development of the Bula orebody.</P>
    <P>The payment of royalty to the State by Tara Mines Ltd. is based in the first instance on a calculation of the company's profits by the Revenue Commissioners. The profit of the company for tax purposes have not yet been settled by the Revenue Commissioners who are in correspondence with the company on a number of outstanding issues.  Apart from those issues a number of complex questions relating to the calculation of profits for royalty purposes are being actively addressed, but it may be some time before they are resolved as arbitration proceedings may prove necessary. I can assure the Deputy that the State's rights in the matter will be fully enforced. <Col N="976" /> No basic changes in mining policies relating to royalties are contemplated but, depending on the legal advices my Department receive and the outcome of discussions with Tara on the points at issue, which may not be resolved without arbitration hearings, some clearer definition as to the calculation of profits for royalty purposes my be called for in the future mining leases.</P>
    <P>From time to time there are calls for the levying of royalties on a per ton of ore raised basis rather than on profits. Such a basis could have a seriously damaging impact on a company such as Tara in their early years of operation when capital expenditures were very high and when the company were in a substantial loss situation; the royalty would be an &ldquo;off the top&rdquo; cut off cashflow, irrespective of the company's ability to pay.  A further drawback of a tonnage royalty is that it would be too low in boom years when a percentage of profits basis would yield a better return to the State.  It has been the practice in the case of large mining undertakings in this country, and elsewhere to the best of my knowledge, to levy royalty as a percentage of profits.</P>

It was the duty of his Government, his Minister and himself to say: &ldquo;The deal is done; come in and sign.&rdquo; That is where he slipped up.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I was dealing with the problem of information in the various member states of the Community.  I indicated that there was a certain faltering of commitment to the Community throughout all the member states.  I indicated also that I thought this was due to the fact that the original campaign to unite and to develop a regional and social policy was based on a certain philosophy of idealism.  I expressed the opinion that as economics took over, that movement in idealism faltered and that that was the basis for the stagnation which everyone admits now obtains in the EC.  I indicated that as <Col N="1038" /> Minister for Education I had endeavoured to have the European Ministers of Education agree to what in this context I chose to call <i>uno libro de Europa</i> which would have sections covering each member state and covering all aspects, historical, cultural and economic, of the individual countries.</P>
      <P>Denmark has a problem always in that it insists on strict adherence to the letter of the Treaty of Rome and has claimed always that since education was not mentioned in the Treaty no educational initiatives can be taken.  This is arguable to say the least since freedom of movement was guaranteed in the Treaty and since one of the most important necessities for freedom of movement is mastery of the major EC languages.  However, France, which also has certain reservations, was very anxious that that should happen at that time but nothing has happened since in that regard.</P>
      <P>Britain always said they would agree in principle with the necessity for a wider knowledge of the Community, its institutions and the individual countries but claimed that in respect of education &mdash; and this is true of the education system in Britain &mdash; local authorities defined the content of their curricula.  On the occasion of the accession of Spain and Portugal our Departments of Foreign Affairs and Education as well as Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, should publish facts and statistics about the two new countries at least.  They should give information that may be useful to exporters since economics, as it must, raises its ugly head in all areas.  I merely want to make that point so far as the philosophic sustenance of the EC idea is concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to note that the Spaniards are not as euphoric about the economic advantages of joining the Community as, say, Ireland was in 1973. In the October 14 issue of <i>El Pais</i> in the <i>Economia Trabajo</i> section there is a report that the Government calculate that membership of the Community will cause the Spanish economy to grow by only 0.1 per cent during 1986.  This is a <Col N="1039" /> far cry from the kind of calculations we were making about our economy in 1973. When considering the Spanish position it is well to have that kind of information. We are &mdash; and here Sancho Panza speaks &mdash; concerned rightly with the impact of membership of the two new countries on the Social and Regional Funds but we should not run away with the idea that somehow or other Spain is coming in with a begging bowl.  There is a report in this paper that the minimal increase in growth contrasts with the result of the studies undertaken in the EC and which envisaged <i>un impacto fuertemente negativo</i>, a strongly negative impact on the Spanish economy of entry.  In other words, the studies indicated that Spain would be an economic loser.  We should keep that in mind when considering the Spanish entrance.</P>
    <P>We should also note that in the edition of 21 October 1985 of <i>El Pais</i>, in the <i>Economía</i> section again there is an interview given by Felipe Gonzalez &mdash; Presidente del Gobierno, as he is called &mdash; in which he says that Spain will comply with all its undertakings but will demand the exact same from the CE &mdash; the EC as we call it.  In other words, the President was going on record that when Spain was signing the Treaty it intended to live fully up to the implications.  In particular, there was a question of the postponement of the application of our old friend, VAT, which comes out in Spanish as IVA.  He said that in no way was he going to ask for a postponement of the introduction of VAT in Spain.  Those strong commitments given by him after a long session with Jacques Delors who is the President, as we know, of the European Commission, were an indication of the policy of the Spaniards on the eve of their becoming members of the European Community.</P>
    <P>I do not intend to deal with the fish problem because it has been dealt with already by our spokesman, Deputy Daly, and I see here the distinguished representative from south-west Donegal who knows a thing or two about fish and no doubt, will have insights into that which I <Col N="1040" /> could not match.  Of my own experience, both in the internal market and the operation of fishing, the Spaniards deserve a study, to be looked at in this context. Many years ago as a student, I saw fresh fish on the market in the heartland of the <i>Meseta</i>.  There was always an excuse given that one could not get fresh fish in the midland towns in Ireland because they were too far from the sea.  We are a very small country compared with Spain and do not have the road or access difficulties that the huge and, in places, mountainous country of Spain has but even as long ago as the early fifties they were able to market fresh fish daily in small towns.  There is a lesson there somewhere.</P>
    <P>To get an idea of how industrious the Spanish are &mdash; and this is where they come in conflict with us on occasion &mdash; I remember reading in one of their newspapers perhaps three years ago that their fishermen were in port in three countries in the same week.  Ireland was one of them, Algeria another and South-West Africa, somewhere around Namibia, was the third.  That will give an idea of the range of their fishing fleet.  We have and &mdash; Sancho Panza is important here &mdash; an obligation to defend our fishing industry, to learn from the Spaniards what we can learn from them but to indicate that we want to defend our own and to develop the industry in the way in which they have developed it, which must command our admiration.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the question of tourism.  When I was a student in Spain, 600,000 visitors visited Spain that year &mdash; I looked up the statistics.  Something between 30 million and 40 million visited Spain last year.  At the time about which I am speaking the <i>per capita</i> income here was higher than it was in Spain but Spain has outstripped us in that regard.  That is something which people have not realised.  Tourism has played a major role in that increase in the standard of living of the ordinary Spaniard.  The economists tell us that tourism, money from the United States bases and something with which we are familiar in Ireland, or were and unfortunately are becoming familiar <Col N="1041" /> with again, emigrants' remittances, provided a very large income for the Spanish Ministry of Finance.</P>
    <P>The fourth point I wish to mention is that the strides which have been made in Spain with industrialisation are hardly realised.  They are a heavily industrialised country and very few realise that.  Of course, Spain was used as a centre for export by many United States companies, as they used Ireland.  There will be something to be watched there with regard to competition.  Only a few years ago this country imported a gas heater which Members of this House will know &mdash; the Super Ser.  That sold all over Europe and was one of the great industrial successes in Spain.  There are many others.  It is important also to realise that apart from tourism and the emigrant's remittances, there has been a huge increase in industrialisation and consequently, as an ingredient in the political life of the country, a big development of a middle class.  It has been argued and admitted, even by Felipe Gonzales and his party, that it is an important factor in the political stabilisation of Spain.</P>
    <P>We cannot develop our tourism like that because we have not <i>el sol</i>, which is their big asset.  I am not saying that I would like our tourism to be developed as they developed theirs, particularly with the <i>apartamentos</i> and high rise buildings along the Mediterranean.  People who knew some of those area, as I knew one, before this happened, are dissatisfied with the result.  A taxi driver, to me when I said that to him, made the comment &ldquo;A view does not put bread on my table&rdquo;.  It was regarded as an economic necessity that that type of development should and did take place.  It may have impoverished the environment in certain areas, but it has certainly improved the economy, made more money available to people who needed it and had to start from a very low base.</P>
    <P>That particular development in tourism may provide an opportunity for some of our industrialists, in particular those who can process food.  The type of tourism which provides <i>apartamentos</i> where <Col N="1042" /> tourists purchase food in their local <i>supermercados</i> leads to the purchase of much processed food.  I remember searching in shops in the Costa del Sol for Irish goods &mdash; Irish processed meat, etc. &mdash; but I could not find any.  It was there from West Germany, Denmark and Norway. There was only one food item available for sale from Ireland, Kerrygold butter salted and unsalted.  We should get information sheets out to our industrialists. There must be a new opportunity now, when Spain and Portugal are joining the EC, for the sale of processed food in that area.  It is not chauvinistic to say that we cannot be surpassed in the quality of our meat which is of a very fine quality.  I hope the Minister and the Minister for Agriculture keep the artificial stimulants of one kind or another out of our food production because we have an opportunity of providing people with something that they cannot get to the same quality in other European countries.  This links in with what I have been talking about.  Information right down the line is very important.  Information on the industrial and commercial end is very important while not excluding the cultural and educational areas.</P>
    <P>Spain will become very important in that it is a solid link with a part of the world which is becoming more and more important ideologically and politically, South America.  President Felipe Gonzalez is addresssing himself to forging strong links between Spain and the Central American and South American countries. Spain will prove useful in the councils of the EC in that regard.  There always has been a certain <i>rapport</i> between the Spaniards and the Arabs. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs in Spain attaches importance to that link and that Ministry has also been working in that field for some time.  These disjointed remarks on the accession of Spain to the Community may be of some help to the Minister.  As I have already said, Spain will comply with its obligations in Europe and will demand the same from the EC. There are other items of economic interest like the huge amounts of money which have been paid out to banks in trouble in <Col N="1043" /> Spain since the early eighties.  That type of thing will be important to know so that we will know with what kind of economy we are dealing.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I know nothing at all about Portugal and consequently I am not in a position to make any comment on their joining.  It would not be appropriate for this House to look at the negative side in relation to the entry of Spain and Portugal.  Our links to Spain are important and it is important to emphasise them rather than where we clash.  The link with Salamanca University which was a very strong one lasting over hundreds of years could be revived if we want some of our officials to train themselves in the language and in the economics of Spain.  Many people have studied at Simancas, a great source of the history of Hispano-Irish relations.  We should welcome the Spaniards and the Portuguese, advise them that we will have to fight our own corner when our interests clash but hope for a good relationship which will give an opportunity across the whole spectrum of our life when they become the eleventh and twelfth members of the EC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Like other speakers in a general context I welcome the forthcoming accession of Spain and Portugal to the EC.  While the Community as a whole has a lot to derive from the accession of Spain and Portugal our fishing industry will be badly affected by this.  Numerous times over the last number of years we made clear to the Government the serious effect the Spanish accession into the Community would have for the fishing industry and particularly for the poor regions which depend entirely on fishing as a source of income. From the article referred to by Deputy Wilson, I note that Spain will comply with all its undertakings and obligations. If Spain do this they will need to change their attitude in relation to fishing.  Over the last number of years they have not once complied with the undertakings and obligations with which they should have complied.  In 1983, 50 to 60 vessels were caught by the Irish Naval Service fishing <Col N="1044" /> inside our legal limits and a similar number were caught in 1982 and 1984 and they are only a small percentage of those fishing illegally inside our waters. If that is indicative of the Spaniards, so much for their compliance with undertakings and obligations.  The Portuguese will not greatly affect the fishing industry. They have no historic fishing presence in Irish waters except in relation to sardine fishing which does not pose any great problems for us.</P>
      <P>Prior to the finalisation of most of the issues involved, the main issues in question were Spanish fruit and vegetables, the dismantling of the Spanish tariffs including high industrial tariffs on olive oil, the social affairs and the Portuguese problem in relation to sugar, wine and fisheries.</P>
      <P>I would like to dwell on fisheries for some time.  When this Community is enlarged on 1 January 1986 it will be detrimental to our fishing industry.  The steps taken by the Government were not in favour of the industry and the country at large did not take the fears very seriously. While we held the Presidency they cobbled together agreements, and took the various Heads of State to this country, not to discuss the fishing industry and the effects enlargement would have, but to ensure that the wine problem was resolved.  When problems in relation to the fishing industry were being discussed in Europe the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Fisheries were on their way home and left the final negotiations to a Junior Minister.  That is a fair indication of the seriousness of the Government in regard to the industry and to the effects on it of the enlargement of the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Our fishing industry may appear small in relation to Europe but it is of vital importance, particularly to those in coastal regions.  It affects the social and economic life of rural areas near the coast who are solely dependent on fishing.  I fear that in coming years the industry will deteriorate so badly that those engaged in it will lose confidence and their numbers will be reduced because those in the catching and processing sections will not <Col N="1045" /> be prepared to invest their slender profits.</P>
    <P>An indication of the importance of our sea fishing is that in 1983 it contributed £61 million to our GNP.  It made a significant contribution to the balance of payments.  Many Members on the Government side feel that too much money is being invested in our sea fisheries, despite its significant contribution to our GNP.  It provides employment and generates income in regions with no alternative resources.  About two thirds of fish landings are in the south west, the west and the northwest where 13,000 people are employed.  However, as a result of negotiations in Europe many jobs will be in jeopardy</P>
    <P>When we joined the Community the annex to the Treaty which we signed stated:</P>
    <P>It is recalled that the fundamental objective of the EEC includes the steady improvement of the living standards and working conditions of the people of member states and the harmonious development of their economies by reducing the differences existing between the various regions and backward and less favoured regions.  It is in the common interest that these objectives be attained by the Irish.</P>
    <P>Though this may be true for many other industries I fear that, as a result of our poor negotiating position, when our Ministers were not interested and when they were being pressurised by the Government, we are now in a position when the gap will be widening between the various regions and the fishing industry will take a retrograde step.  At the time we were told that the industry would not be affected seriously by the enlargement of the Community, but already the morale of fishermen is at an extremely low level. This had occurred even before the Spaniards were given access to Irish waters.</P>
    <P>The entry of Spain to the EC and the facilities they will enjoy will not leave us with much freedom.  We cannot trust the Spaniards.  We are not able to control our fishing grounds.  The Spaniards are being <Col N="1046" /> fined miserly sums of between £16,000 and £40,000 which they are able to recoup from a central pool contributed to by the entire fleet.  I understand this system is supported by the Spanish authorities. Indeed, while our naval vessels are apprehending Spanish boats and bringing them to shore, the other boats have an opportunity to fish unrestricted.  Quite often when the boats are sighted by our naval authorities the Spanish fishermen cut the nets and leave them there and flee giving directions of the location of the nets to other boats so that they can be picked up.</P>
    <P>One can only admire the negotiating tactics of the Spaniards and of the Spanish President who took a strong stand in defence of the fishermen.  Our Ministers, by contrast, did not take a stand because they did not give our fishing industry similar priority.  I understand that the Spaniards used their NATO membership as a lever to gain admission.  The stronger nations in the EC believed that if they did not accede to the Spaniards' demands Spain would withdraw from NATO.</P>
    <P>The Spaniards were offered assistance to improve their fishing fleet but owners of Irish vessels who have found themselves in serious difficulties cannot expect any such assistance because of the feeble case made by our negotiators.  I understand the Spaniards will receive £21 million to readapt their fleet but there was no offer of any kind made to the Irish.</P>
    <P>When negotiations were taking place there was no point made about our rights in the North Sea.  While our large mackerel boats are lying off the Shetlands because they cannot go into these waters to fish, the Norwegians and Dutch are fishing there.  The Irish and British boats were not allowed to fish there.  We had rights in the North Sea when our boats were not big enough to go there, but during the negotiations with Spain we failed to get even a small quota there. Our boats obtained licences on 14 October and I am sure that the Department of Fisheries are delighted that there is no fish there for us.  There are only 20,000 tonnes left and early in October <Col N="1047" /> this year when fish were available for the Irish boats we were not allowed to fish while Scottish boats were busy off our coasts getting fish ready for processing. Those licences will expire on 17 November and if the 20,000 tonnes available have been caught by then we will not be allowed to go after further supplies.</P>
    <P>At the time those of us who were foolish enough to accept it were led to believe that the Spanish markets would be of tremendous benefit to our fishing industry. I cannot accept that.  The Spanish boats will enter our waters to catch fish for themselves and can well supply their own markets.  The types of fish being caught by our boats at present are not readily saleable within Spain.  Despite the fact that the <i>per capita</i> consumption in Spain is vastly in excess of ours, it does not improve our marketing position there.  The Spaniards have a fishing fleet of some 17,500 vessels, representing 750,000 gross registered tonnes.  The equivalent Irish figures are 1,600 vessels and 36,000 registered tonnes respectively. We must remember that the Spanish fleet represent some 70 per cent of the overall Community fleet at present, Spain having the largest <i>per capita</i> fish consumption in Europe &mdash; we are told 40 lbs. annually as against 12 lbs. here.  We understand that total landings of fish in Spain for 1983 amounted to 1.1 million tonnes as against our figure of 200,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>Spain imports some 270,000 tonnes of fish per annum.  I do not believe we will be able to take up very much of that market.  Certainly it will not amount to anything significant by way of assisting our ailing fishing industry.  In addition, the Spaniards have in train approximately 106 joint ventures under which they import up to 200,000 tonnes of white fish, the equivalent of our total catch.  The Spaniards who fought hard for fishing rights inside European limits had to do so in order to satisfy the needs of their enormous fleet, which amounts to almost two-thirds to 70 per cent of the total EC fleet.  There is, and will continue to be felt, intense concern throughout the <Col N="1048" /> whole fishing industry about the threat posed by these vessels.</P>
    <P>One might contend that the transitional period would afford us sufficient time to build up our fleet.  I do not believe that is so.  Even were we to build up our fleet, there is not sufficient grant aid available.  There are grants available for a specific size of boat but those comprising the necessary fleet to compete with the Spaniards do not qualify for any grant assistance whatsoever from An Bord Iascaigh Mhara, the Department or the Community.  Therefore, the question of our building up our fleet does not arise unless grant aid can be made available for the larger boats.</P>
    <P>In recent years it has been proven that our large vessels now fishing off the coast of Scotland &mdash; when the fish move beyond four degrees where we are legally entitled to fish, hopefully they will move westwards rather than eastwards and we will have a reasonable catch before the end of this year &mdash; can compete with the best of the other fleets.  No aid has been made available from Dublin or Brussels to assist these people, or others, who invest in larger boats.</P>
    <P>At present even the restricted Spanish fleet &mdash; with no legal right to fish near our coast &mdash; apart from a few licensed boats &mdash; pose a very serious threat to our fishing industry.  All of us will remember the incident involving the Spanish fishing vessel, the <i>Sonia</i> which illustrated the contempt with which Spanish fishermen are prepared to flout fishing regulations. The record proves that this incident was far from being an isolated one.  This was amply illustrated also in reply to a question of mine in this House last year which contained the information that the Irish Government gained some £1.4 million in revenue from fines imposed on Spanish vessels fishing illegally in our waters.  The number of arrests in 1983 was somewhat similar to that of 1982 but increased dramatically in 1984.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the serious situation obtaining in which we have absolutely no fishing rights whatsoever within the North Sea.  This is something that must be investigated.  It should be <Col N="1049" /> done at the forthcoming Council of Ministers meeting on 4 November next when a case should be made to have Irish boats granted a licence to fish within the North Sea where the fish are at present.  While other countries can fish there, our boats have to remain off the four degrees line and are unable to fish in those waters.  In addition, before the end of this year, the Minister should seriously consider obtaining increased quotas for mackerel. Scientists are recommending that the total allowable catch next year should be reduced by 50 per cent, which would leave our quota somewhere in the region of 40,000 tonnes, of the order of our catch for the months of January and February this year.  Therefore, it is absolutely essential that we obtain an increased quota.</P>
    <P>There was no genuine effort made by the relevant Ministers negotiating prior to the finalisation of agreements in relation to the Spanish and Portuguese accession.  While all of us may welcome their admission, the fishing industry had to pay an expensive price, much too expensive.  The industry has now been placed in peril as have many of the 13,000 jobs created within the industry over the past ten to 15 years, jobs of many people emanating from our poorer regions where there is no substitute industry.  The case made by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Fisheries ignored that situation completely.</P>
    <P>While welcoming the accession of Spain and Portugal in principle I must be extremely critical of the stance taken by our negotiators at that table.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RaymondMacSharry" hpid="Mr. MacSharry Mr. MacSharry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>Like Deputy P. Gallagher, I welcome the expansion of the EC by the inclusion of Spain and Portugal. Notwithstanding the fact that it took some years to negotiate seemingly what has been achieved is for political purposes only rather than confronting the economic realities of enlargement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I might avail of this opportunity to go through some points of an economic nature.  I will comment on the situation in the Community in recent years, how its decisions have affected our membership <Col N="1050" /> and the attitude adopted to many of the problems facing our economy.  It is important for everybody contributing to this debate to refer to the most fundamental issue affecting this country and a sector of our economy on the accession of Spain and Portugal, which is mainly fisheries.  I know it has been pointed out by previous speakers, particularly by Deputy Gallagher, that there is no doubt that the conclusion of these negotiations will have a very serious impact on our fishing industry.  While we have been given all sorts of assurances and guarantees from Europe and the Government, the fact is that even before Spain and Portugal join, Spanish boats are plundering the seas around our coast to the detriment of our fishermen and the fishing industry.</P>
    <P>Over the past 12 months something in the region of 130 boats were detected fishing illegally and 56 of them were Spanish. Some of them were detected three or four times and were fined huge sums. An individual fisherman could not possibly have paid such fines and stayed in business.  There is some organisation in Spain, I do not know if it is supported by the Spanish Government, which is helping the fishermen to pay the fines and to continue illegal fishing.  We have tried to point this out in the European Parliament although I have not seen any public references to it by members of the Government.</P>
    <P>The assurances we have been given in relation to the entry of Spain and Portugal on 1 January are to the effect that there will be adequate surveillance and definite approaches made by the Spanish Government to prevent illegal fishing. However, the facts prove that the contrary is the case.  The Spanish Government obviously condone what their fishing fleet are doing at present.  Our Government must fight between now and 1 January to secure a firm commitment from the Spanish Government that they will use all their powers and influence with their own fisheries sector to abide by the rules.</P>
    <P>I could speak for hours on this subject but I know it has been adequately <Col N="1051" /> covered.  However, it is necessary to highlight it because it is one of the fundamental issues in so far as the accession of Spain and Portugal is concerned.  I am not satisfied with the assurances given by the Commission or by the Irish and Spanish Governments.  There will be no point in complaining about it in two or three years' time when our fisheries industry grinds to a halt.  I urge the Minister and the Government to highlight this again, to stress that they will not tolerate the illegality of the Spanish fishermen after 1 January and that they will take effective action to eliminate this activity.</P>
    <P>Another area which must be of major concern to the Government if they are to play their role in the EC is regional development.  After 12 years we know the impact which the Regional Fund has had on us.  It is very disappointing and not at all what we were told it would be prior to our entry.  The Regional Fund has not made any contribution to the elimination of the disparities between the richer and poorer regions of the existing ten countries.  Statistics will show that the disparities between the rich and poor regions of the Community when we joined were something in the ratio of seven to one.  Now, 12 years later, they are in the region of ten to one.  They are getting worse.  This will be compounded by the entry of Spain and Portugal who have very grave regional problems.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that our Government in the negotiations regarding the accession of Spain and Portugal did not take a firmer stand.  The Mediterranean countries, Southern France and Italy, did take a firm stand because they knew the difficulties which faced their regions when Spain and Portugal joined.  That is why the Mediterranean programme was set up but the dangers are that while advantages have been given to Southern France and Italy, they will be at the expense of the Regional Fund, thereby reducing further the contribution that countries like Ireland should be getting.</P>
    <P>Neither the Commission nor the Council of Europe have made it clear as to whether the inter-aided Mediterranean <Col N="1052" /> programme will be financed as a unit on its own or taken from the Regional Development Fund.  I believe it will be taken from the Regional Fund and we know that there are not sufficient moneys in that fund at present.  We also know that the contribution we get on the periphery of Europe &mdash; the only country which has two seas to cross to get to its major market &mdash; is 5 per cent to 6 per cent of the overall fund while the major country beside us get in the region of 25 per cent.  We have been falling down in what is our right as a member of the European Community and during the negotiations regarding the accession of Spain and Portugal we have fallen even further back.  Apart from the impact on the fisheries sector we are now faced with further curtailment under the Regional Fund, small as it is.</P>
    <P>Spain and Portugal have already prepared their programme of schemes for consideration and grant assistance when they join the EC.  It is interesting to pick out one aspect of regional development and infrastructure.  Portugal are submitting proposals to the Community under the Regional Fund for the development of several harbours and ports and for the development of three new airports and the improvement of existing airports. However, at the same time, the Irish Government ignored the fact that there is £6 million available to complete the international airport in Connacht.  This was because the project became a political football.  Because of the action of our Government this country is being laughed at but, at the same time, countries that have not yet joined the Community are submitting proposals similar to the application in respect of the Connacht Regional Airport.</P>
    <P>That application was made by me in August 1982 and it is still a live issue.  The Commission told us this six weeks ago. All they are waiting for is for the Irish Government to answer some questions, as questions are raised in respect of every application.  However, the Irish Government have failed to respond.  Our Government are quite satisfied to have spent £9 million of our taxpayers' money <Col N="1053" /> while ignoring the fact that up to £3 million of that could be saved while completing the project to international standards. It is time for us to wake up and to cut out the political nonsense in relation to some regional developments but particularly in respect of Connacht Regional Airport.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is our main industry.  While there are some advantages to us in having Spain and Portugal as members of the Community, some of them have been overplayed.  Until 1 January we will not be in a position to compete on those markets with our agricultural products without the assistance of export refunds but these will not exist when Spain and Portugal join the Community.  The advantages of membership of these countries so far as our agricultural sector is concerned have been overplayed.</P>
    <P>The assistance that we got for our major industry under the Common Agricultural Policy has been seriously curtailed in recent years.  Decisions taken by our Government have eliminated or curtailed many of the schemes approved by the EC.  In this connection I refer to the most recent difficulties due to the bad weather.  Without the necessity of going to the Commission or to the Council, our Government could have put £34 million into the agricultural industry.  This would benefit not only Irish farmers and agriculture but would benefit the economy as a whole.  However, our Government were not capable of making their case properly. When they spoke on the matter they were told by the Commission, and Ministers were told by their colleagues on the Council, that this Government had already eliminated schemes that were there to help agriculture.  They were told that they should have used the schemes already in place.</P>
    <P>The general attitude of the Government seems to be that unless everything comes from Europe nothing will happen. The Government say they do not have money they can put up to match EC expenditure.  That is very serious because it affects all headings, whether it be regional, social, agriculture or energy. The Government will have to change <Col N="1054" /> their stance in their EC negotiations. When Fianna Fáil were last in Government we were able to show under any heading, whether it be regional, social and particularly agriculture, that we had done all we could with our resources, including borrowed money.  We were able to go to the EC and ask them for our rights as an equal partner in the Community. It was not a question of being there looking for a hand-out or having a begging bowl.  We were seeking our rights, having done all that we could from our own resources.</P>
    <P>I could spend hours talking about the stance of this Government on many issues, quite apart from the accession of Spain and Portugal.  This Government voted against the 1986 budget for Europe but the budget is now before the Parliament by a majority decision.  However, it does not include £1 expenditure to cater for the accession of Spain and Portugal. We tried to find our from the Commission or the Council the cost of enlargement, but nobody could put a figure on it.  When Spain and Portugal join, the strains that have bedevilled European budgets in the past six years will be even greater.  The difficulties for our country and for our economy will become even more pronounced.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied to hear any Irish Minister talk about the advantages of the entry of Spain or Portugal to the Community &mdash; when I recall the decisions they allowed to be taken in respect of fisheries.  Apparently the advantages are for political reasons.  No account has been taken by our Government in their contributions to the negotiations of the economic disadvantages for us.</P>
    <P>A matter that has not been highlighted sufficiently is the regional policy.  I am convinced that the attitude of our Government will have long term adverse effects on our economy.  We were the area most in need of assistance until the entry of Greece.  Now the Community will include Spain and Portugal and, thus, we are fourth in the queue.  This is at a time when our Government have not used hundreds of millions of pounds that were available under various headings, <Col N="1055" /> particularly agriculture.  They have left this money in the EC, to the determent of Irish farmers, the agricultural industry and our economy.  Yesterday I was in Madrid meeting some agriculturalists. They know the problems they are facing. They have taken many steps to ensure that they will be able to compete with the best in Europe, and we are anything but the best in Europe, under the agricultural heading and within the context of the Common Agricultural Policy.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, because of the actions of our Government on many fronts in EC negotiations over the past two or three years the climate in the Community in relation to Ireland has changed.  We are seen as a country which does not need further assistance, which is not prepared to back its proposals with its own resources and, therefore, we are losing out heavily under the regional, social and agricultural expenditures of the EC.  I encourage our Government representative on the Budget Council of the European Pariament to take immediate action to ensure that sufficient funds are provided.</P>
    <P>We are something like £3,000 million short to cater for the expenditure needed in 1986 with the accession of Spain and Portugal.  If that problem is not resolved between now and 1 January, further strain will be put on every item of expenditure and that includes EC finances in this economy.  It is up to the Government of a country like Ireland to highlight this and not, as Ministers have in this debate, to talk about the advantages which will accrue to Ireland with the accession of Spain and Portugal.  We have given away a fundamental asset under the fisheries section.</P>
    <P>I would like to say much more about this but the attitude adopted by the Government over the past three years, particularly on the accession of Spain and Portugal, shows that they have apparently overlooked completely the economic aspects of accession and are prepared to go along with their richer <Col N="1056" /> colleagues in Europe for political purposes and allow Spain and Portugal to join.</P>

      <P>At dtús, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leat as ucht an t-am seo a thabhairt dúinn le díospóireacht a bheith againn ar gnó a gcreidimid i bhFianna Fáil go bhfuil fíorthábhacht ag baint leis sa tír.</P>
      <P>It is important for everybody that we set the background to the President's Award scheme.  This scheme was initiated by the leader of my party, Deputy Charles J. Haughey, when he was Taoiseach some years ago.  At that time the Minister for Youth and Sport, Deputy Tunney, met an American who was involved in the part financing of the Congressional Youth Awards in the United States.  In 1982, when I was Minister for Youth an invitation issued from the Congressional Youth Award Committee in America to the then Taoiseach, Deputy Haughey, inviting him to attend the official first prize giving of the Congressional Youth Awards in the State of Minnesota.  He declined the invitation and asked me to represent the Government, which I did.  In the United States the Congressional Youth Award is looked on as being totally non-political in order to command the greatest possible public and political support.  There are similar awards elsewhere &mdash; the President's Award here, the Duke of Edinburgh Award in the United Kingdom and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>After the inaugural awards in America the then Taoiseach and I set about setting up a committee to run the award here. We talked in terms of the chairman of the committee being somebody like a <Col N="1057" /> High Court Judge who would be totally non-political, and seen as such which I think is very important.  As the Government are aware, no committee was appointed at that time.  It was also felt that it was important for any committee to have the total support of all political parties.  Thus, it was proposed that the holder of the Office of Ceann Comhairle, in this House, the holder of the Office of the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad, the Taoiseach and the Leader of the Opposition of the day would be trustees of the committee and the President would be the overall director of any award.  In that way if would be seen to have total support, not just political but in every other way as well.</P>
    <P>The setting up of the present committee has caused a lot of pain, not just within the confines of this House, but among concerned citizens outside.  We feel the committee have been totally politicised to the detriment not of the committee but of the award, first by the appointment of Dr. O'Reilly as management committee chairman, a person very prominently involved with Fine Gael, being a Fine Gael political activist and official fund raiser of the party.  I do not think there is any necessity for as much pay off as has been given to this individual for his political personal patronage to Fine Gael.  It was not enough to have Dr. O'Reilly as chairman, but the Government continued to appoint several members of the committee who were actively supportive or had membership of one or other of the parties in Government. It is necessary to mention only two of them &mdash; Mr. Niall Green, who is prominently associated with the Labour Party, and Dr. Fergus O'Farrell, who was appointed as Government Special Adviser to the Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham.</P>
    <P>Now let us deal with the issuing of invitation to the awards and the ceremony. The invitation was issued to Áras an Uachtaráin which is the official residence of the President of Ireland.  In the past the protocol was that, when an invitation issued to Áras an Uachtaráin, it was issued by the person who holds the <Col N="1058" /> office of President, not by anybody else. On this occasion the invitation was issued by Dr. O'Reilly, and I have my invitation here.  My invitation was dated 25 October, which everybody will recall was last Friday, three days in advance of the launching of the award ceremony.  As it was a bank holiday weekend, I was at home in my constituency and I received my invitation Tuesday morning, the day after the launching of the awards.</P>

      <P>Let us come now to the behaviour in Áras an Uachtaráin last Monday.  The speech made by the management committee chairman, Dr. O'Reilly, was, to say the least, cynical, belittling and very flippant.  He issued a gross insult not just to the holder of the Office of President of Ireland, Dr. Hillery, but, worse, than that, to the Office of the President, when he said he was delighted to welcome all those present to the creamery manager's house.</P>

      <P>That has shades of a previous Fine Gael Minister making comments in relation to the President and the Office of the President of this country, which led to the very sad situation of the resignation of a President. I cannot, and I am sure nobody in this House could, condone that kind of flippant remark made by somebody who was supposedly in authority and who was going to be the management committee chairman of the President's award. Young people were present and have read in the newspapers about the whole President's Award scheme and the mishandling of its launching.  When they receive an award, will they see it as being won by their personal achievement or will it be seen by them, as is conceived in the national media, as a reward for their political affiliation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is in circulation an information document on Gaisce, the President's Award.  I wish to ask the Taoiseach or <Col N="1059" /> the Minister of State what portion, if any, of that document is written in the first official language of our State.  If no portion of it is written in the Irish language, I would ask why.</P>
    <P>We have watched the total mishandling of the award scheme.  Being very concerned on this side of the House to giving our fullest commitment and support to an award as important to young people as Gaisce, the President's Award, we feel the only possible way of salvaging the award and making it into something decent that all of us can be proud of is the voluntary standing down of the present committee, or a request by the Government that they stand down, and their replacement by a totally non-political, non-partisan committee which will command universal support through the length and breadth of this country and outside.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I merely wish to add that I am in full agreement with everything that Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn has said about this unfortunate and unhappy development.  When we were in Government we approached this matter from a point of view of high principle.  We were desperately anxious that it should be something special to young people, totally above board, non-political, non-partisan in every way.  We were very conscious at that time that everything we did was subject to the most virulent political attack from the then Opposition and for that reason we were very careful and scrupulous to ensure that this scheme could not be assailed or attacked by anybody. We had hoped that if successful it would lead to the solution of another problem, namely, the problem of some honours system in this State which has so far lamentably failed to get off the ground under any Government.  We thought that if this award scheme for young people could be launched and got under way in a totally constructive, non-partisan, non-political atmosphere, it would serve as a headline to be followed on a broader scene.  Unfortunately it was not to be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am surprised and appalled at what has <Col N="1060" /> happened.  The selection of Dr. O'Reilly, with all his well-known, well-publicised connections, was a lamentable mistake. I have since learned through the courtesy of my friend, the Minister of State, that the membership of the committee was Dr. O'Reilly's personal selection.  This is equally mystifying.  Apart from the political associations of some of the people concerned, there is also the fact that there is a preponderence of people who adhere to the rugby tradition.  There is absolutely nothing wrong with that.  There are rugby afficionados on this side of the House, as there are on every side, but when setting up a scheme which is supposed to cover all aspects of national life, and in particular all aspects of sport, to select a committee of that kind is to my mind so patently stupid that it is difficult to visualise how it could have happened.  I wonder where is the limit to reward to Dr. O'Reilly for his support and that of his newspapers for Fine Gael in particular and for the Coalition Government in general.  For good measure, the chairman or deputy chairman of Independent Newspapers was put on the committee.  If we are to have media representation, are the other national newspapers not worthy of some representation?</P>
    <P>Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn has dealt with the unbelievable events that took place in Áras an Uachtaráin last Monday and the manner in which the invitations were issued.  I believe a firm of public relations consultants were involved.  At least they were making statements in the newspapers about who was invited and who was not invited, as if they had decided who should be invited to Áras an Uachtaráin.  The invitations which we received bore a telephone number and we were asked to RSVP.  It turned out to be a telephone number in the IDA where another person was involved at that level.  Now I believe an executive director has been appointed. How was he appointed?  Who appointed him?  What are his qualifications?</P>
    <P>The whole situation is totally unsatisfactory and I have to say that it appears to us to be a piece of naked, political opportunism by the Government and by <Col N="1061" /> the Taoiseach, a reward to friends for support.  It is absolutely humiliating that a scheme which was intended to be of such a high calibre and to be above reproach has been dealt with in this way and in particular that the President and Áras an Uachtaráin should have been dragged into it.  I did not hear the speech made by the chairman but the Taoiseach was there and he heard it.  I understand it was totally unseemly and unbefitting to such an occasion.</P>
    <P>In view of all that has happened I want to support Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn's suggestion that the only decent thing now is for Dr. O'Reilly and the committee to resign and for the Government to appoint a new committee which would be appropriate and in accordance with the principles which we set out for the committee.  I do not know if this scheme can be retrieved at this stage but I hope it can.  We on this side of the House are prepared to make any contribution which is called for from us to help to retrieve it.  We insist if we are to be involved and if our support is to be sought that the first step is for the present chairman and his committee to resign because they have demonstrated themselves to be totally unsuitable to be in charge of this scheme.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>First of all I should like to refer to Deputy Haughey's statement this morning that a question from him to me, apparently in relation to this matter, has been transferred by me to the Minister for Labour.  I presume that Deputy Haughey was referring to a question from Deputy Máire Geoghegan-Quinn asking me to make a statement on the arrangements for the operation of an award scheme to be known as Gaisce, the President's Award.  I want to say that the transfer of this question was affected in good faith but without my knowledge and that, in view of the fact that the matter in question relates to the President, it is my view &mdash; and I would have so acted if the matter had been brought to my attention at the time &mdash; that this is a question to which I should reply and that <Col N="1062" /> is why I am taking this matter on the Adjournment.</P>
      <P>Deputy Haughey, by way of a supplementary question to a parliamentary question from Deputy Durkan regarding the introduction of a New Year's honours list, asked in the Dáil on 23 October if I was prepared to make a statement to the House on what was involved in the Gaisce scheme.  In response I gave some brief information on the scheme and mentioned that it would be launched by the President at Áras An Uachtaráin on 28 October.</P>
      <P>Subsequently at my request the Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham, wrote to Deputy Haughey forwarding details of the President's Award scheme.  In his letter the Minister of State said in regard to the issue of invitations for the launch that the Secretary to the President had advised the Secretariat of the Award that invitations should not issue in the name of the President and that in these circumstances the invitations were issued in the name of the chairman of Gaisce.  He also affirmed that it was the intention to have political balance in the Award Committee and that when this was being established that I would have full consultations with Deputy Haughey.</P>
      <P>I do not want to pursue that matter further, but allegations have been made and Dr. O'Reilly has been described as a Fine Gael activist and fund raiser.  Let me say that that description is not correct.</P>
      <P>The point was raised by Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn that somebody like a High Court judge should have been approached.  I understand that when the scheme was mooted originally a number of people, at least three, were approached by the previous Government, none of whom was a High Court judge and that the list drawn up of people for the committee included people who certainly are very actively associated with the party then in power.  I do not want to press that point, but I do not think the matter is quite as one-sided as was suggested from the other side of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been informed by the Secretary to the President that he informed the <i>ad</i><Col N="1063" /><i>hoc</i> committee that a suggestion that the invitations to the ceremony would be issued on behalf of the President was inappropriate.  His view was that preparations leading up to the launching of the scheme were the responsibility of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee, and that while the President was patron and had consented to give the facility of the Aras for the launching of the scheme, in addition to performing the official launching, the invitations should be sent out on behalf of the <i>ad hoc</i> committee.  The <i>ad hoc</i> committee, although disappointed by this advice &mdash; they made considerable attempts to have it altered &mdash; felt obliged ultimately to act on it and were, in fact given the time constraints, left with no alternative but to do so.  I understand that the President was not directly involved in the arrangements for the issue of the invitations and that any change from normal procedures was made without the President being aware of it.  I would add that I share the view that the invitations should have been issued in the President's name.</P>
    <P>Neither my Department nor the Department of Labour had any involvement in the issue of the invitations. Indeed, I knew nothing about it until the matter was raised in this House by Deputy Haughey.  As I have said, the arrangements were made direct between the committee of Gaisce and Áras an Uachtaráin.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the President has been treated casually in relation to the Gaisce scheme.  I must reject that criticism.  I had a discussion with the President on this matter earlier this month and at my request the Minister of State, Deputy George Birmingham, together with representatives of the <i>ad</i><Col N="1064" /><i>hoc</i> committee for the scheme discussed the matter fully with the President on 3 October last.  The detailed arrangements for the launching ceremony were, as I have already indicated, agreed between the Secretary to the President and the <i>ad hoc</i> committee.  Accordingly, there is no basis in fact for any suggestion that the Office of the President has been slighted or treated casually and I would be determined that that would not happen under any circumstances.</P>
    <P>When the award scheme is established it is the intention, in accordance with the original decision, that a permanent award authority be appointed.  I can confirm, as indicated by the Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, in his letter to the leader of the Opposition of 25 October, that it is our intention to have political balance in the Gaisce committee and that when it is established I will, as promised, arrange to have full consultations with Deputy Haughey and ensure that the membership of the committee is balanced and that there will be no question of it being capable of being represented as being in any way political or politicised.</P>
    <P>Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn raised the question about the use of the Irish language. The literature for the scheme is available in both languages and I have copies here.  I think that matter is covered adequately and I will be happy to give to Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn a copy of the Irish and English versions afterwards.</P>
    <P>Finally, I regret that a remark by Dr. O'Reilly, intended in a good humoured way, has been seen as flippant and I accept that it was not appropriate to an occasion of this kind.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5.25 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 5 November 1985.</P>

    <P>A detailed investigation of the prospects for establishment of an Irish zinc smelter was carried out by the Industrial Development Authority in 1976 and 1977.  An <Col N="982" /> American company indicated positive interest in the project but due to a serious downturn in the international zinc market they did not maintain their interest and withdrew from the project.</P>
    <P>The IDA has reviewed the project periodically since then.  A review carried out recently, involving up-dating of capital costs, revenues, electricity, transport, wages and salaries, reagents and other variables, concluded that the project is still not viable.  Continuing over-capacity in the industry, high energy costs and inadequate metal prices continue to be serious adverse factors militating against successful establishment and operation of a zinc smelter in Ireland.</P>
    <P>I have been informed by the ESB that any excess capacity in the system, even following the commissioning of Money-point, is likely to be of comparatively short duration.  The construction of a zinc smelter based on such a capacity situation would not <i>per se</i>, be a practical proposition.</P>
    <P>A decision on the question of establishment of lead smelting capacity cannot be taken until firm decisions in favour of a zinc smelter and on the smelting process to be used, are taken.  If a process involving joint production of zinc and lead was decided on there would be no necessity for a separate lead smelting facility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Energy in order to allay public disquiet if he will explain the reason he awarded four exploration blocks in the third round of licensing to consortia which included a company who hold substantial stakes in those licences, but who failed to meet their financial obligations on other licences, and had to surrender their interest in very recent times; and if he will make a statement on the failure of the third round to attract applications for only 15 out of the 76 blocks on offer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring) Dick Spring">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Energy (Mr. Spring)</NameTxt>
      <P>From his own experience as the Minister who announced the results of the second licensing round in June 1982 when out of a toal of 108 blocks on offer 24 were allocated under the licences then awarded, I am sure that the Deputy is aware that the success or otherwise of the third round, for that matter, should not be measured simply by the proportion of blocks on offer that are licensed.  This falls into the error of assuming that every square or block on the map has the same hydrocarbon potential and the same prospectivity, which is not the case.  It was recognised by my Department when the 77 blocks were offered that many could <Col N="984" /> well be of limited interest to the oil exploration industry.</P>
      <P>The success of a round depends essentially on whether it leads to a continuing, satisfactory level and quality of exploration over the blocks on offer, with the degree of satisfaction to be measured in terms of what is considered to be appropriate and necessary in order to have an area fully explored.  Far from being the failure claimed by Deputy Reynolds, the third round was a success because, first it resulted in a large amount (6,500 km) of new seismic data being made available to the industry and to my Department.  Prior to the round there was only a superficial knowledge of many of the 77 blocks, but, by virtue of the fact that these blocks were put into the round, my Department was enabled to reach agreements with seismic contractors, which resulted in this very large volume of seismic data becoming available at no cost to my Department. This data enabled the acreage to be properly assessed for the first time in the case of many of the blocks.</P>
      <P>Secondly, of the blocks on offer in the round which were considered by my Department to be of significant prospectivity and, therefore, worthy of licensing with drilling commitments well over half have been licensed.  Only when the seismic which I referred to had been acquired was it possible to determine which blocks were significantly prospective.  There were less than 30 blocks in that category and of these there are six which, for good technical reasons, are not attractive to exploration companies at this time.  Of the remaining blocks, 15 are licensed and as I mentioned in my statement on 21 October, the grant of exploration rights in respect of further blocks is under consideration.</P>
      <P>Thirdly, the level of work commitments for the 15 licensed blocks is the maximum that could be achieved at this time.  About 6,000 kms of seismic is committed and there is provision for the drilling of at least 15 wells within the first four years of the licences.  My contention that the third round was successful therefore is clearly substantiated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="985" /> I consider that it would be inappropriate for me to discuss matters of a confidential-commercial nature in relation to any specific company.  However, I must point out to the Deputy that I must be cautious about assuming that any particular company will not at some future date meet its commitments when these become due, especially in cases where obligations may not mature for some time.</P>
    <P>The licence groups concerned were obviously satisfied to have the company in question as a partner in their consortia, and in so far as the State is concerned, it is the overall capability of a group as a whole to carry out its obligations under the licences in question which is important. This criterion is clearly met in all of these cases.  I might add that it is not unusual for a partner in a licence to opt out of a particular obligation either by diluting or surrendering its interest.</P>
    <P>I understand that in the case of at least one of the other licences referred to by Deputy Reynolds, the company in question has proposed a certain course of action to its partners with a view to resolving the difficulties which have arisen.</P>
    <P>It should not be overlooked that the company through its subsidiaries has participated in some 18 wells offshore Ireland.  The company has, therefore, been in a position to trade data from many other wells.  It has also purchased data from many Irish and UK wells; consequently, the company has a substantial data base, and it is seen as being very well placed to make detailed technical assessment of the Irish offshore.  Its technical presentations in the third licensing round ranked among the best.</P>

      <P>It <Col N="986" /> can of course be accepted that a number of major United States oil companies did not participate in the third round.  Equally it must be accepted that a number of the major United States oil companies did participate in the third round as did a number of other large international companies.  Among those participating were BP, Britoil, Total, Texas Gas, Arco and Conoco.  As regards Irish companies, all those hitherto involved in the Irish offshore applied for participation in licences under the round.</P>
      <P>As regards the licensing terms taking into account my recent statement clarifying the position in relation to marginal fields, the terms now in place, combined with the new taxation arrangements have in general been well received by the industry.  At least ten wells are expected to be drilled in 1986, the highest number to be drilled in any single year since 1978. It is not possible at this stage to be precise on the numbers of wells to be drilled in 1987 as to some extent this will depend on decisions still to be taken.  I would expect, however, to see the momentum of drilling maintained in that year.</P>

      <P>Article 56 of the Treaty establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) provides for the granting of various types of readaptation aid to coal and steel workers made redundant.  This article applies to redundancies which are a direct consequence of structural economic difficulties within the coal and steel industries or where the redundancies arise from major technological changes leading to a reduction in labour requirements in either industry.  Community aid to redundant ECSC workers is granted on condition that the member state concerned makes a special contribution of at least 50 per cent of the total special aid to be provided to the redundant workers. The amount of Community aid available may not exceed the amount of special aid provided by the national authorities over and above what would normally be granted under the social welfare code.</P>
      <P>The types of aid which are eligible for Community assistance include the following:</P>
      <P>&mdash;redundancy lump sum allowances;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;tideover allowances, which are paid <Col N="988" /> as a supplement to unemployment benefit;</P>
    <P>&mdash;early retirement allowances which take the form of a bridging pension or a supplement to unemployment benefit;</P>
    <P>&mdash;wage support allowances, which are payable to redundant ECSC workers who are re-employed in a lower paid job;</P>
    <P>&mdash;allowances for short time working;</P>
    <P>&mdash;retraining allowances; and</P>
    <P>&mdash;resettlement allowances.</P>
    <P>The Government have made an application to the EC Commission for Community aid to assist the workers who are being made redundant as a result of the recent rationalisation measures at Irish Steel Limited.  The Government have applied for over £800,000 in Community funding in respect of a package of social measures which include redundancy lump sum payments, tideover allowances (i.e. supplement to unemployment benefit) as well as allowances for early retirement, wage support, retraining and resettlement.  A Commission decision on the application is expected before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>The decision to revoke the Consumer Information (Miscellaneous Goods) (Marking) Order, 1984, was taken following receipt of formal notification by the EC Commission of its intention to commence infringement proceedings under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome in respect of the order.  This notice from the Commission followed a judgment delivered by the European Court of Justice in April 1985 which held that a similar legislative provision in the United Kingdom was contrary to Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome.  Legal advice was obtained to the effect that the 1984 consumer information order could probably not be upheld in relation to</P>
      <P>(i)  products originating in EC member states,</P>
      <P>(ii)  products originating in countries with which the Community has trade agreements prohibiting of quantitative restrictions or measures of equivalent effect, and</P>
      <P>(iii)  products originating in third countries, which are already in free circulation in the Community.</P>
      <P>It was considered that revocation of part only of the order would have resulted in a system which would be confusing for the consumer, may have adversely affected our international trade generally and, furthermore, would have been extremely difficult to administer and enforce.

      <P>The decline in private sector investment, particularly in the areas of industrial and commercial development, has been the major factor in the overall decline in the output of the industry in recent years.  The Government's response to the industry's problems has been twofold &mdash; to keep public investment in the industry at the highest sustainable levels, including the retention and expansion of existing incentives, and to create the conditions that will be conducive to increased private investment.</P>
      <P>The national plan provides for an increase of 9½ per cent in public investment in the industry between 1984 and 1987.  Over the period of the plan, construction will account for an increased share of public capital programme expenditure and overall public investment in the major works programmes of my own Department &mdash; roads, sanitary services and housing &mdash; will increase by 15 per cent by 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also refer the Deputy to the package of employment, taxation and financial incentives which was announced on the 23 October.  A number of the measures, provided for in this package are of particular relevance to the construction industry.  They have been welcomed by both sides of the industry and I have no doubt that they will have a major impact on output and employment, both within the industry and in the industries associated with it.  The package <Col N="993" /> includes major incentives for the development of the Custom House dock site and of designated inner city areas in Dublin, Cork and Limerick, a generous new scheme of house improvement grants, and grants for the provision of community, leisure and other facilities in areas of social need.</P>

      <P>A major scheme such as that approved for Greencastle, requires the preparation of a detailed work programme and agreement on financial arrangements with the county council in relation to the cost of the scheme.  It is also important to ensure that the disruption of fishing activity is kept to a minimum. These matters inevitably cause some delay but I can assure the Deputy that I am equally anxious to see this scheme commence.</P>

      <P>An application for assistance from the European Regional Development Fund for Connacht Regional Airport was submitted to the Commission of the European Communities on 30 July 1982.  Additional information was requested by the Commission services on one occasion only, on 19 August 1982, and this was supplied by my Department on 3 September 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to subsequent inquiries from my Department as to the status of the application, the Commission services set out on 26 September 1983 the difficulties which they had with the application. Apart from the fact that the airport did not fall within the framework of Ireland's regional development programme, they pointed out that a feasibility study carried out by international consultants had apparently rejected the case for an international airport and that the estimated <Col N="999" /> traffic would not appear to justify the project.</P>
    <P>I should point out that, notwithstanding the fact that the Commission did not approve our application in respect of Connacht Regional Airport, we were able to take up all the aid available to Ireland from the European Regional Development Fund in 1982 and in subsequent years.  Thus, the impression being created in certain quarters that there is extra money available in respect of this project if only the Irish Government would press for it is quite inaccurate.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Council of Economics and Finance Ministers, following the adoption earlier this year of a package of measures designed to increase the use of the official ECU, has turned its attention to the medium and long term prospects for the EMS and in particular for the ECU.  The council has already held discussions of a preliminary nature and it has asked the two specialised committees, the Monetary Committee and the Committee of Governors, to pursue their work in this area.  As yet it is too early to speculate on what action, if any, might eventually be taken on foot of these discussions.  The use of the ECU in Community trade is part of this whole question, though one which is not readily amenable to official action, since traders are free to choose the currency in which they transact business.</P>

      <P>It would not be practicable to allow tax relief for school and university fees because, if a special concession were given by reference to educational expenses at any level, one could expect many cognate claims from taxpayers arising out of their varied personal and domestic circumstances.  The resultant loss to the Exchequer would mean that considerable revenue would have to be found elsewhere.</P>

The authorities of all hospitals and homes are obliged to comply with any requirements specified by the fire prevention authorities.  In the case of private nursing homes, there is provision in the Homes for Incapacitated Persons Regulations, 1985, requiring that materials contained in bedding and internal furnishings have adequate fire retardant properties and where possible have low levels of toxicity when on fire.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be available for and genuinely seeking work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 25 June 1985 and following inquiries her claim was disallowed on the grounds that she was not available for employment. She did not appeal against the disallowance although she was advised of her right to do so.  She has not been in touch with her local office since 20 September 1985 when she last signed as unemployed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">

      <P>The person concerned is in receipt of a social assistance allowance at the weekly rate of £54.40 in addition to disability benefit at the weekly rate of £19.75 &mdash; total £74.15.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regulations provide that an invalidity pension cannot be paid in addition to a social assistance allowance.  If the person concerned were transferred to invalidity pension it would be paid to her at the weekly rate of £55.75 and both her social assistance allowance and disability benefit would cease to be paid to her.  She would therefore have a cash reduction of <Col N="1009" /> £18.40 per week in her income from the Department if she were transferred to the pension.  Invalidity pensioners are entitled to a free travel pass.  Some such pensioners are also entitled to a free electricity allowance, free (black and white) television licence and free telephone rental allowance.  The position has been explained to the person concerned and she has been requested to say whether, in the circumstances, she wishes to be transferred to invalidity pension.</P>

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 19 March 1984 following examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance and was examined by a different medical referee who also expressed the opinion that he was capable of work.  His case was then referred to an appeals officer who upheld the decision to disallow payment of disability benefit from 19 March 1984 to 11 February 1985, the date of the latest medical certificate before him.  The decision of the appeals officer is final and can only be altered in the light of new facts or fresh evidence.

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  In order that a person may be considered permanently incapable of work, it is necessary for him to, <i>inter alia</i>, have been continuously incapable of work for a period of one year.  Therefore the earliest date on which the claimant can qualify for invalidity pension is 18 February 1986.  In addition it will be necessary to have him examined by a medical referee for an opinion as to his future capacity for work.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned applied for unemployment assistance on 12 June 1985 and his claim was put into payment on the basis of a qualification certificate issued to him on 1984 which recorded him as having means of £20.75 weekly, derived from board and lodging in his mother's home and from the maintenance portion of a student grant.</P>
      <P>He was therefore entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £9.20 being the appropriate rate in his case of £29.95 less means of £20.75 increased to £11 from 3 July 1985 being the appropriate rate of £31.75 less means of £20.75.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was assessed with means of £38.45, effective from 5 July 1984, derived from self employment.  He was advised of his right to appeal against the means assessment, if dissatisfied, but he did not appeal.

A form for this purpose may be obtained at his local office.

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 13 June 1983. He was not entitled to benefit at the commencement of his claim as he had no contributions registered in 1981-82, the contribution year governing his claim.  He had 52 paid contributions in the 1982-83 contribution year which governed his claim from 2 January 1984 and accordingly he requalified for payment of benefit from that date.  Payment has been issued to 28 December 1984 the date on which he submitted a final medical certificate.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he considers it appropriate, given the need to improve the marketing of Irish farm produce, to strengthen our marketing capacity, both at the level of the promotional body and in the individual enterprise; and if he agrees that the Government should urgently concentrate its energies in this sector.</P>

      <P>The strengthening of marketing capacity generally, including the expansion of promotional activity, is an integral part of my Department's policy designed to improve the marketing of Irish farm produce by encouraging the food industry to move <Col N="1027" /> more into added value consumer-type products and away from commodity trading. Grant-aiding agencies have, as part of Government policy, been asked to satisfy themselves that the marketing arrangments of individual firms seeking aid are adequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacSharry</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if, given the recent July study by the Agricultural Institute which shows that the proportion of the EC milk target prices achieved by dairy farmers in the Republic remained at 88.9 per cent in 1983, the second lowest level in the Community, he considers that it is vital that the Government take the initiative to generate diversification and a market-led approach in the dairy industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>Irish dairy farmers receive a lower percentage of the EC target price for milk than farmers in most other member states because of a number of factors, including the climatic and seasonal conditions, under which the milk industry here has to operate, distance from major markets, milk composition, product range etc.</P>
      <P>The issues of product diversification and the further development of a market-led approach are primarily issues for the industry itself to resolve.  It is, however, being encouraged and assisted to overcome these and other restricting factors wherever possible.  That is in line with the Government's commitment in the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> to the development of the food industry as a whole and in particular to increased emphasis on the production of added value consumer-type products.</P>

      <P>The existing controls in this area are based on old and complicated enactments and involve a number of Government Departments as well as other interests.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Significant changes are in fact already taking place at processing and marketing levels.  A programme of rationalisation of slaughtering capacity is under way and emphasis is being placed on plants which will have a throughput of about 6,000 <Col N="1029" /> pigs per week, thereby achieving economies of scale that will enable them to be more competitive.  Investment aid is available from the IDA and FEOGA in support of this rationalisation programme. In addition, the services of CTT are available to help the industry's marketing arrangements either on an individual or co-ordinated basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>Job-sharing is one of a number of elements embodied in the more general concept of work-sharing.  Government policy as outlined in <i>Building on Reality 1985-87</i> is that, while it is clear that work-sharing measures can represent only a limited element in the resolution of the unemployment problem, it is committed to the promotion of work-sharing in the market sector of the economy.  The Government's view is that developments in this area should be conducted within the framework of the voluntary collective bargaining system and that a case-by-case approach should be adopted which would take account of local circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government has introduced certain measures to promote work-sharing in the public service.  A job sharing scheme was introduced in the Civil Service in February 1984.  The scheme involves two people equally sharing the duties and responsibilities of a particular post in return for half the usual pay and benefits. Up to the end of July 1985, 191 had commenced job-sharing.  The Government has also made a commitment to recruit a further 180 staff on a job-sharing basis to the grades of clerical assistant, clerical officer and executive officer during 1985.  By the end of July 1985, 109 of these had been recruited and assigned. A career break scheme has also been introduced in the Civil Service, health and local authority sectors.  The most recent figures available show that 1,930 persons have taken advantage of the opportunity <Col N="1037" /> provided by the scheme.  All state agencies have been asked to consider the feasibility of introducing similar schemes in their own area of responsibility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The employees concerned have been paid their statutory redundancy entitlements from the Redundancy and Employers' Insolvency Fund.  However, the liquidator of the company has recently submitted applications to my Department under the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, for funds to pay the former employees their outstanding entitlements in respect of wages, holiday pay and minimum notice awards.  These applications are being processed by my Department and I would hope that the funds necessary to pay the employees concerned will be issued to the liquidator within about a fortnight.</P>
