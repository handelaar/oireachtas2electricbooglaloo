      <P>It is proposed to take No. 8.  By agreement the proceedings on the Fourth and Fifth Stages of the Finance Bill, 1985, shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 5 p.m. today by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall in relation to amendments include only amendments set down by the Minister for Finance.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask the Taoiseach, in the very special circumstances that prevail, if he would like to inform the House as to the steps the Government are taking in relation to the Irish citizen, Mr. Walsh, who was abducted in Beirut.  Will the Taoiseach inform the House, in the special circumstances, of his knowledge of the position and what action is being taken?  I know that strictly this is not in order but it relates to the very special circumstances of an Irish citizen abducted abroad while doing humanitarian work on behalf of the United Nations.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to allow the question for the simple reason that if the Chair was put in the position of having to measure special circumstances he would be in an impossible position.  There is another method by <Col N="1264" /> which the Deputy can try to raise this, and that is all I will say about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Amendment No. a.1 and amendment No. b.1, in the name of Deputy O'Kennedy, are related and, by agreement, they may be discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. a.1:</P>
      <P>In page 8, in the Table, Part I, between lines 12 and 13, column (1), to delete &ldquo;£4,500&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;£5,000&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My amendment seeks to increase the allowance in respect of all taxable incomes from the first £4,500 to the first £5,000 to be taxed at the standard rate of 35 per cent.  Amendment No. a.1 is in respect of the single income and No. b.1 <Col N="1265" /> is in respect of the consequential adjustment required for a double income.  I am proposing that the first £5,000 of taxable income be taxed at 35 per cent in respect of single persons and the first £10,000 in respect of married persons.  The existing provision is that for single people the first £4,500 is taxable at 35 per cent and the first £9,000 in the case of married people. I am proposing this for a number of cogent and important reasons.</P>
    <P>It is accepted by all commentators on our tax system that the burden of tax is hitting particularly hard at those on the lower level of income.  The introduction into the highest level of income tax after the first £4,500 means that the highest rates of tax apply too soon on the income tax scales.  People have talked about everything from the poverty trap to what I regard as the tax trap.  As soon as a person earns £4,500 of taxable income he becomes liable for tax at the higher rate. Our levels of income tax are intolerably high.  They are much higher than anything that exists in the European Community countries.  A whole range of expert reports and objective analyses has shown that this level of taxation is having serious disincentive effects on our economy generally.  OECD comments on our economy, ESRI comments, NESC comments and Commission on Taxation comments all verify this fact.</P>
    <P>The consequences of this policy include unemployment, emigration and borrowing. Each time we try to find the main source of our problems the one thing that emerges about our current economic situation is that the Government have deliberately, mistakenly, but not maliciously, decided that the way to bridge our current budget deficit is to load on taxation at a level which was unprecedented here and which is not comparable with any other European country.  The Minister may instance OECD comments about Finland, Japan, Switzerland, Austria and so on, but in those countries the highest rates of taxation do not apply to low level income and he will also find that the standard of income in those countries is higher than it is here.</P>
    <P>Having failed to persuade the Minister <Col N="1266" /> to adopt any of our amendments in respect of exemptions and increased allowances there is only one sensible alternative and that is to remove many people from the tax trap of the highest tax levels because they do not belong there in the first place.  However, I know that one single action will not solve this whole problem.  To come into the highest tax levels in Britain, a single man or woman would be earning something equivalent to £40,000 but to come to the top level of 60 per cent here one would only have to earn about £12,000. We wonder what is happening to this economy.  Everyone knows that the disincentive element of our high tax levels is having a major impact on all sections of the community.  Each section feels they are being singled out.  Yesterday I talked to a number of married ladies from some Dublin constituency who had been in the Public Gallery.  They were convinced that the biggest problem is that there is no regard at all for the ordinary working wife at home.  I reminded them of the provisions I made in 1980 in the Finance Act when I multiplied the allowances.</P>

      <P>After the court case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I noticed yesterday that the Minister was not familiar with the amendments he introduced and he is now obviously unfamiliar with the effect of the Murphy court case.  It is time that the Minister was educated as to the development of the tax law.  The Murphy decision ruled that working wives outside of the home&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We discussed it on the day you were in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;were entitled to the benefit, if they opted for it, of a single person's allowance so that where a wife worked outside of the home and a husband worked outside of the home they were entitled to be assessed as two single people.  That was the Murphy decision. The decision I took as Minister for Finance, <Col N="1267" /> in case the Minister is not aware of it&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not see the relevance of this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am conducting a much needed education programme.  The decision I took as Minister for Finance in the same year was to introduce the double allowances for all wives even those not covered by the Murphy decision.  I introduced the provision that the working wife at home would be reckonable for the same entitlement as the working wife outside of the home.  That was the significance of my decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not related to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It all relates to the tax issue but the Minister apparently was not aware that my decision was not required by the Murphy decision.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The married ladies I talked to yesterday were convinced, despite my decision in 1980, that the only people who got unfair treatment under the income tax code or in the provisions made by Government in social or other expenditures were ordinary married women. They had a case.  The irony of it is that if one turns to the people at the other end of the scale, the people on the top income levels, they are convinced that the people on high incomes are singled out to ensure that they will be discouraged from further successes leading to greater income.  The people on the middle income scale, who I am most concerned with now, are driven from the standard rate, which is a fairly high standard rate of 35 per cent, by the Minister, who abolished the lower rate of 25 per cent.  Those who jump from the standard rate to the higher rate are convinced that they are the ones singled out to bear the burden of this tax regime. No matter whom you consult who is paying tax they are all convinced that they are specially singled out by this Minister and this Government, and they are all correct.  They are all being singled <Col N="1268" /> out and being used as a target by this Government because of the unreasonable levels of tax that this Government have introduced.</P>
    <P>It is all very fine to ask if Deputy O'Kennedy will tell us where he is to find the money to make up the shortfall.  If the Minister is not already aware of the money that he has lost because of the level of tax that he has imposed in the last two years, then no words of mine will convince him this morning, whether it is the black hole, the leakages or the multinational executives living here who after three years send signals back to Ohio or Mississippi or Silicon Valley that things are not going too well in this Irish plant because the impact of our tax on their salaries is such as to discourage them from staying here.  Wherever you look all of the consequences derive from the level and burden of income tax that this Government have chosen to put on the shoulders of every section of the community. I do not know exactly how much this amendment will cost.  We finished Committee Stage only last night and I had to spend late last night and early this morning working on amendments to get them through in time for today.  I have not the benefit of the facilities that the Minister has but I do not claim any special concern for that.  He could have gone home to bed in any event&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Jealousy will get the Deputy nowhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I was up late drafting these things.  Whatever it will cost I know the standard reply the Minister will make.  I can deliver the lines before he responds, although he may surprise us and decide not to use this argument this morning.  I appreciate that he will have to give me the cost but he must take into account the fact that this will be a signal to all that he is really at last conscious of the burden of taxation and its disincentive element and perhaps he will give a belated lift to the economy.  In a sense our problems begin if not end with the levels of taxation.  It is necessary to be disciplined in relation to the <Col N="1269" /> national finances and the Government will have my support and that of my party in respect of that.  I acknowledge the difficulty the Government have but they have chosen the wrong path, that of increasing taxation instead of the path of reduced current expenditure.  We have many examples of that.  That is why I have always said they are not Thatcherite because Mrs. Thatcher, whatever anyone says about her, is reducing expenditure, not increasing taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is a Thatcherite since yesterday.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have to follow her policies, but if to be Thatcherite is to be accused, then to be Dukesite is to be condemned out of hand.  The difference is that, all right, we are talking about fiscal rectitude but in this instance this Government are talking about bridging deficits by heaping on levels of taxation in every direction, income tax, indirect tax, levies, PRSI, wherever you look, if it moves, hit it.  As Burke said some time back, any fool can contrive a new tax.  I was one such fool at one time, though I have not the imagination to contrive as much as the Minister at present in the House, but I plead to him to give us some signal of his readiness to create a new climate and give a new direction through reducing the tax burden.</P>
      <P>This obviously is the most important matter of this Finance Bill.  We can address it only once and I hope that what I have said is sufficient to bring across to the Minister, if not to persuade him of, the importance of this amendment.  I hope he can accept it.  If not I would like him at least to give us some indication that he accepts that the burden of taxation is the main problem.  I think he does at this point because yesterday he acknowledged that the main cause of the growth of the black economy, perhaps the sole cause, is the level of taxation that we have.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister did no such thing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be found on the record of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said it would be idle to pretend there was not a link.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The two growth areas are taxation and the black economy, and they grow together at great speed.  If the Minister is not prepared to respond to this he will have laid claim to the unenviable distinction of being the one who by the time he left office had heaped on penal level of taxation and had given a stimulus to the black economy that is unprecedented here or elsewhere.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the amendment being put forward by Deputy O'Kennedy.  I do not know why he should be so contentious about these things and why he should wander so far from the Bill.  He knows perfectly well that his amendment is not designed <i>simpliciter</i> to bring about an increase in the allowances.  His amendment is designed to bring about a further increase in the allowances on top of the increases already provided for in the Bill. Therefore, Deputy O'Kennedy is not the only person in the House this morning who is proposing an increase in allowances. I got there before him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to be able to go as far as Deputy O'Kennedy would wish to go in increasing the allowances.  Let me recall for the House, since I think it would be useful in this context, just what is in the Bill.  Sections 2 and 3 of the Bill, as I pointed out on Committee Stage, provide for a restructuring of the rate bands and an increase in general allowances.  The cost in terms of revenue foregone to the Exchequer is £54.25 million in 1985 and £90.6 million in a full year with some 818,600 taxpayers benefiting from it.  If we add on to that the total of the budget proposals as reflected in this Bill and look at those allowances, retention of PRSI allowances, changes in the exemption limits and the change in rent relief which is also in the Bill, the total cost of the package is £113.8 million in 1985 and £189.8 million in a full year.  I want to <Col N="1271" /> establish very clearly for the benefit of the House that in this amendment we are talking about an increase on the increases in the allowances already provided for in the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.  The amount involved is changing what is in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy will have the right of reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>To the extent that Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks could be interpreted as saying that he is the only one who is proposing increases they are, to say the least, rather disingenuous.  This is not a courtroom although I know Deputy O'Kennedy spent some of Committee Stage in a courtroom.  We must be more directly concerned with the content of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I devote more of my time personally to my responsibilities than the Minister is doing.  I hope he has somebody to help him.  Does he want any assistance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy may be getting into an area&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy, you may make political charges when you have the floor but not across the floor when somebody else is speaking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to follow that hare.  That is a hare which, as the Limerick man once said, I will let sit.  The extra cost of making the further changes Deputy O'Kennedy is proposing would be £23 million in 1985 and £38.4 million in a full year.  Therefore there would be very serious budgetary obstacles to accepting those amendments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The pre-budget situation for a single person, a PAYE taxpayer paying the full PRSI rate, PAYE and PRSI allowances moved into the higher rate bands, then 45 per cent, with a total income of £6,686. After the budget that figure increased <Col N="1272" /> to £7,286.  Before the budget a married person with a working spouse, with the same PAYE and PRSI allowances, but not including any other allowances, moved into the higher rate band at £12,486 income.  That has now become £13,686.  Before the budget a single person with the same allowances reached the 60 per cent rate after an income of £10,086 and that has increased to £10,586.  A married person under the same conditions pre-budget reached the 60 per cent band at £19,206 and that figure has been increased to £20,206. That is the effect of the provisions we have already made that are comprehended for the total cost for the tax package.  As I said, on Committee Stage, after the budget provisions have been implemented, 40.3 per cent of taxpayers will be in the higher tax bracket, which is down from the 47.1 per cent which would have been the case had we not made these changes.</P>
    <P>While I have a great deal of sympathy with the direction of this amendment, and have proposed in the budget and in this Bill to move substantially in that direction, the total amount of leeway available to us this year for the relief of the tax burden &mdash; and we are talking about relief &mdash; is limited to the amount I have given as the total cost of making budget changes.  It is with regret that I cannot accept this amendment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I will dispose of one preliminary point which can be made in respect of every amendment.  Of course, my amendments involve a change in what is in the Bill.  The Minister need not trouble to make the case on every amendment that what I am proposing is additional to what is in the Bill.  An amendment, by definition, is a change in what is in the Bill.  If I were to fall in with what the Minister is suggesting, the only reaction appropriate to me would be to say nothing, do nothing and propose nothing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's tone this morning, if not his response, is more reasonable, but I must ask myself if it might have been <Col N="1273" /> better if I had not put down any amendments at any stage, or if we need not have troubled to debate this Bill in this Chamber because so far the Minister has not responded to even one amendment. Therefore, the Bill is exactly as when it was introduced.</P>
    <P>The Minister has acknowledged that my amendment would cost £23 million this year, which in net terms represents about £15 million.  I invite the House and the Minister to consider what that represents in terms of the total tax revenue the Minister is collecting this year &mdash; £5,622 million.  The adjustment I am asking for would cost only £15 million&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not been able to work out the actual percentage but it will be around .002 per cent or .003 per cent.  This is the kind of amendment the Minister should adopt.  He has given figures to explain where we stand in terms of the application of standard and higher rates of tax to income at various stages. The best way to judge this is to look at the top of the scale.  A married man with all allowances comes into the 60 per cent rate band at £20,206.  A person reaching the same tax band in Britain would not reach that point until he has at least IR£45,000 or even more.  That demonstrates more than anything else that our tax levels are heavier, bite earlier and are having the consequences which employers are complaining about so much.  They say employees are not interested in working towards the end of the financial year because this will bring them into the higher tax band.  I have heard of cases in the south-east where the health of some <Col N="1274" /> people is not so good as it might be towards the end of the financial year because this means they can claim their tax rebates and escape going into the higher tax net.  The black economy and the fact that top class skilled executives do not find it worth their while to work here are a natural consequence of our high tax levels.  For the sake of a miserable £15 million out of a total of £5,622 million this year, the Minister cannot see fit to make this adjustment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I knew when I put down this amendment that it would not cost much, but I thought it would cost around £30 million. I am reassured to find that it will cost as little as £23 million.  I believe this is an opportunity for the Minister to do something for these people.  He may ask me where we will get the money.  The Minister has sanctioned an extra £66 million for the agencies of the Department of Labour this year.  They have the biggest growth in the whole public expenditure programme.  However, they have gone for the wrong option.  If we want to generate employment, which is so badly needed, we can do so by lifting the crushing tax burden and not by developing countless new schemes.  Recently, in reply to a Dáil question, I was given a list of the schemes which operate to generate employment and, after I read it, I was more confused than ever.  There are about 17 schemes in operation and not one of them is having any effect because the only way to generate activity in the economy is by recognising that we have almost killed the incentive in the economy by tax levels.  The Minister would get a lot more value by allowing that £15 million than for the extra £60 million.  In fact, we are providing £160 million for the agencies of the Department of Labour this year.  Where are the jobs? Where is the new spirit?  Where is the &ldquo;up and at you&rdquo; message that came through in Lemass's time?  There is no indication that these agencies are providing a new dynamism, challenge and opportunity.  If the Minister accepted this amendment he would get much better value for much less money as it does not represent one-tenth <Col N="1275" /> of the amount of money he sanctioned for these agencies.  However, I rest my case.  I know there are sensible men, especially in Fine Gael, who share my views but unfortunately these things are decided beforehand.</P>

    <P>Amendment No. b.1 not moved.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>In page 9, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(3)  The dependent relative allowance shall be increased to £350.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>We have been discussing the burden on the economy of the high tax levels and in this amendment I will address myself to the very severe social consequence of this factor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In our social programme we can encourage people either to provide for their relatives at home or to pass on responsibility to the State in this respect. We have the choice of strengthening the family unit, in the broadest sense of that term, or of looking outside the family and to the State services in terms of providing for dependent relatives.  It is clear that at this point in the development of our social character, we must give a clear signal to all income earners that the State will encourage them to provide at home for their dependants as distinct from forcing <Col N="1279" /> wage earners to transfer that responsibility to, for instance, the Minister for Health and Social Welfare who I notice is still in the House and who in turn will tell us that unfortunately funds are not available to support the medical services. That is why I am proposing that the tax allowance of £112, the level that has been in the tax code for a considerable time in respect of a dependent relative allowance be increased to £350.  I am convinced that it we move in that direction we will save the State countless millions of pounds but I am convinced also that in that way we will provide much better care for the old and promote a much more caring community than is perhaps universally the case.</P>
    <P>A characteristic of Irish society in recent times has been a growing awareness of our obligation to the old but that awareness is not matched by the economic facilities necessary to provide for these old people.  In full recognition of the wonderful work being done in geriatric homes by the various personnel involved &mdash; nuns, nurses, doctors and so on &mdash; it must be acknowledged that these institutions are not equipped fully to deal with all the various physical and mental problems which confront people in old age.  It is time we all recognised that the best place for the old person is the home he created, with the family he reared and in the community in which he is secure.  For their sakes and for our sakes we must do everything possible to ensure that the old are looked after at home as distinct from being transferred to institutional care. Too often we hear from the Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare, who, incidentally, is tending to distract my concentration, that our resources are not adequate to provide for our old people in our various hospitals, institutions and day care centres.  If that is the case we should at least encourage families to look after their dependent relatives. No great expert economic analysis is required for one to realise the advantages involved in helping people economically to look after their relatives.  There are those who would suggest that in this respect <Col N="1280" /> the compensation is by way of payment. In that way the more burdensome cost of keeping people in institutions would be avoided.</P>
    <P>I trust the Minister will be able to produce a figure in this regard but whatever that figure might be it would be only a fraction of the cost of keeping an old person in a hospital or institution, where very often the old people are lonely and suffer a sense of separation despite the care they may be receiving from the nursing staff.  In many ways old people in those surroundings consider themselves neglected.  We are all glad that the term &ldquo;county home&rdquo; is used no longer.  These places were originally know as workhouses but both terms had a certain connotation, especially for old people.  We are grateful that these institutions are of a very high standard and are staffed by dedicated personnel but most of the people in care there would prefer to be looked after at home.</P>
    <P>The desirability of old people being looked after in their own homes is being acknowledged in most enlightened societies. One thinks of Switzerland, for instance, which was not always noted for its social programme as distinct from its economic success, but there great incentives are offered to income earners to provide for their parents or in some cases their grandparents or aunts or uncles in a family home environment, Anyone who has regard to the social programme will agree with what I am saying.  There is no better place in which old people can be provided for than in their own homes and that is what this amendment is all about.</P>
    <P>On the last occasion I referred to the cost of a bed in any Dublin hospital.  I was talking of a public bed occupied by an old person who, though he might be on a drip which would be costly, would not be receiving any other treatment. That sort of accommodation is not less than £1,000 per week or £52,000 per annum and the taxpayer is footing the bill.  At that stage the person concerned is in a different category.  He would be in the category of disabled in respect of which there is special provision in the finance legislation but my purpose is to <Col N="1281" /> ensure that as few as possible of our old people reach that stage.  Very often neglect is the cause of their being forced to go to hospital, sometimes as chronic patients.  It is the failure to provide for them at home that gives rise to the deterioration in their health.</P>
    <P>We have seen this in our own communities. A few in our home town are over 90 years of age and are being well looked after in their own home environment, but I am not going to personalise. It is so reassuring to find people like this, so happy, healthy and confident.  Age is immaterial.  They still have the same mind and enthusiasm as they had 50 years ago because they are being properly looked after by their own families and feel part of the family.  I attended a ninetieth birthday in our home town recently and I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who is nodding, knows the lady I am speaking about.  She was dressed in her Irish tweeds and looked as spritely as she did 40 years ago &mdash; a marvellous lady, all because she felt part of the family.  I have seen others, in our place and elsewhere, who are neglected by their families, for one reason or another, who could be forty years junior to that lady but looked very much older and deprived. They had no spirit for life.</P>
    <P>I am simply trying to encourage people, by reference to a reasonable increase in the dependent relative's allowance, to provide for these people in their own place.  I know that allowance is not confined exclusively to old people.  It is confined to people who are dependent, who have no income source of their own. It could even be a young unemployed person and if so, let it be.  It could be some other relative within the given category who has no adequate income.  I want all these included, because it is time that we demonstrated some imagination and concern.  I have no doubt that we would save the country countless millions of pounds.  If there is one area that has run amuck in recent times, it is the growth in the administration and otherwise of the health service.  I think the Minister acknowledges that &mdash; any Minister for <Col N="1282" /> Finance would have to.  There is no administration attached to looking after people in their own place.  I would love to see a new awareness in our community which would make life healthier and happier for all concerned.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the young people, particularly, would welcome this more than anybody.  Imagine the effect that it would have on them calling to their grandmothers or great-grandmothers, having a chat and helping them.  I have always been reassured by the great understanding which exists between the young and the old in our community.  I invite the Minister to adopt this proposal.  The consequences of it would be very far-reaching, indeed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment.  As he has so aptly put it, the family is of the utmost importance and our Constitution recognises that fact.  I am afraid our tax laws do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy has said, there is a social aspect to this amendment. As we all know, old people who are confined in homes funded under the social welfare scheme become depressed because they are not mixing with their own families.  Old people living in the family environment and dealing with younger people and children stay younger longer.  They have a better spirit for life.  They can advise and educate the young members in the history of the family and on many important aspects of life for which the parents may not have time.  Any family who have a grandparent, an old aunt or an old person living with them have a fuller life than in cases where the grandparent or relative is confined unnecessarily in an institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cost of keeping relatives is one of the reasons why many people put their relatives into these homes for the aged. It is time that the allowances were used to help people to take care of their relatives. As pointed out by Deputy O'Kennedy &mdash; and I am sure that the Minister <Col N="1283" /> will give a costing on this &mdash; the cost of keeping these relatives in their family environment is much smaller than having them cared for under the social welfare services.  A grandparent at home can help the family unit in time of trouble.  This leads to fewer breakdowns in the family which, unfortunately, is happening more frequently today.  I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to this amendment and I hope he will be able to find his way to accepting it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a few brief comments. At first sight, this appears quite a constructive amendment to which one would be sympathetic.  There are some points that need to be made, but there might be a better way of trying to solve this problem.  That a husband and wife keep or do not keep their old parent or aunt or any other person in their home is not connected with tax.  There can be friction, for instance, between two women in the one house who do not get on well together and there are many factors which are totally human.  To assume that any change in tax allowances would lead to a breakthrough in the rate of geriatric care and bed occupancy in State and county homes is somewhat unrealistic.  One should not overrate the significance of a change such as this.</P>
      <P>However, there are problems in this area.  I would specifically mention the prescribed relative's allowance, by which people can get an increase in their pension of £23.10 a week when being minded by someone who perhaps comes home from England or gives up a job to do this. It would be more appropriate for the Minister for Finance to take up that matter with the Minister for Health and Social Welfare.  There are very stringent conditions laid down for this prescribed relative's allowance scheme.  If it is a daughter-in-law or a wife who is maintaining the old person, this allowance is not given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other State scheme for helping elderly people is the home help scheme. One condition of this scheme as operated precludes most cases.  That is the condition <Col N="1284" /> that relatives cannot be paid the home help allowance.  I have one case in mind in which a couple in their fifties have a father or father-in-law who is 86 years of age and lives ten doors away in the same estate.  That man needs all his household work, cleaning and washing done and if the daughter or daughter-in-law provides that help she does not get any assistance.  If a black stranger did it, she would get it.  That seems a little unfair.  Elderly people do not like strangers coming into their houses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>This is not a matter for the Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that.  Before the Leas-Cheann Comhairle came into the Chair I was prevented from speaking at all, unfortunately, on a very important matter connected with income tax.  What I am saying is relevant because there are different ways to solve the problem.</P>
      <P>It is my view that the aspect of the dependent allowance needs to be looked at.  Let us take the case of a deserted wife who is on some form of social assistance and whose eldest child of 24 or 25 is working.  Are there any circumstances where the breadwinner, in this case the eldest child who is supporting the household, could get a tax allowance?</P>
      <P>All of the amendments tabled by Deputy O'Kennedy relate to income tax. Most of my constituents have now been issued with their amended tax-free allowances for the tax year April 1985 to April 1986.  Is it not the case that acceptance of these amendments would cause utter chaos in the calculation of individual tax-free allowances?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I am worried about the people who come to my clinics and who have enough trouble in trying to ascertain their own tax liability.  Because of administrative errors they may find there is a miscalculation in their tax-free allowance. My point is that most of my constituents have been issued with their amended tax-free allowances for this year <Col N="1285" /> which, I assume, have taken account of the budget changes.  My question is, should the Minister accept the amendments would that not cause chaos for my constituents who are PAYE taxpayers? In principle I have sympathy for community care as opposed to institutionalised care but I think the problem can be met in a better way by adjusting the home help and the prescribed relative allowances that are already in existence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget has been very severe on old people and on the widowed.  Unless we put together an attractive tax incentive scheme for people who are prepared to look after the old and the widowed, we will have waiting lists a mile long at all the homes for old people.  There is a long waiting list at St. Joseph's Hospital, Trim, in my constituency. Many on the list are seriously ill and need urgent attention but some of the beds in that hospital are occupied by patients who could be looked after at home if the Government were prepared to give the necessary incentive.</P>
      <P>The allowance of £110 has not been increased for the past three years.  There is also a regulation attached to it.  The allowance is reduced by one pound for each pound by which the income of the person exceeds the maximum rate of the old age pension payable to a single person.  That means that if a couple or a single person have a retirement pension after working for 30 or 40 years, the allowance of £110 will be reduced because of the extra income.  I know this does not relate specifically to the amendment now before the House but I should like the Minister to look into the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister may tell us that what we are seeking will cost a considerable amount of money and he may ask us where this money will come from.  The recent budget is taking more tax from the old people and widowed.  I do not know if the Minister has been badly advised on this point.  A single old age pensioner gets an increase of £100 in his tax-free allowance and the same applies to a widowed person and we know that the Minister has given an increase of 6 per <Col N="1286" /> cent in old age pensions.  The Revenue Commissioners set an average figure on these pensions that is deductible from the tax-free allowances.  In the past month I know of cases where the extra increase in the pension was greater than the increase in the tax-free allowance and the result has been that the person concerned must pay more tax.  The Minister could easily estimate how much money that extra taxation will yield in that area and that could be pooled to give a concession to the old people and those who will look after them.</P>
    <P>Many old age pensioners and widowed people have received tax-free allowances that should be at the maximum exemption rate and which had been on that maximum exemption rate for the past few years.  However, because of some computer error only the basic tax-free allowance was given to these people and, as a result they have already paid that extra money to the Revenue Commissioners. Now they will have to apply for the proper tax-free allowance and it may be a few months before they get their money back.  This should not happen to old people and I should like the Minister to investigate that matter.  It is obvious that old age pensioners and widowed people are being conned into paying extra tax.</P>

      <P>Old people are shoved out of their homes by families who cannot <Col N="1287" /> afford to keep them because they have not the income.  They have to look after their own families.  Surely the Minister could give some incentive, say, a tax-free allowance to a son or daughter to encourage them to keep old people in their own home.  This would avoid many old people having to go into homes. These people have a major role to play in family life.  They have been cut out of family life.  I understood that one of the priorities of the Constitution was to cherish family life.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of what Deputies Hilliard and Ahern have said, we are not suggesting that acceptance of our amendment would create a vast change in the situation whereby too many people were put into institutional care.  We are drawing to the Minister's attention the social effect of institutional care and its economic cost.  As Deputy Yates said, perhaps a better way to do it would be to adjust the prescribed relative allowance but that is not for discussion here.  We are discussing a specific amendment to the Finance Bill.  Whereas this amendment of itself would not rectify the situation it would constitute a significant step in the right direction.  If the Minister wants to make a change in this area of revenue law he does not have to confine himself to the limits set out in our amendment; he can grant much more generous allowances if he wishes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put on the record that I found Deputy Yates's argument one of the most spurious I have heard since coming into this House.  He suggested that it would be impractical, unreal or in some way wrong for this party to put forward amendments to the Finance Bill because the Revenue Commissioners have already issued certificates of tax-free allowances based on the Minister's budget speech.  Were we to push that argument to its logical conclusion we might as well not be here at all.  Those people who have received their tax-free allowance certificates would have no objection whatever to receiving another with an increased allowance <Col N="1288" /> within the next couple of weeks.  I would ask the Minister to give this amendment serious consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Before dealing with the detail of the amendment I should communicate to the House a number of facts about the operation of this allowance. For example, in 1981-82 there were 50,371 claims under PAYE for the dependent relative allowance.  The following year there were 46,667, in 1983-84 there were 41,344 and in 1984-85, 38,175. Therefore there has been a drop of almost a quarter in the number of claims under PAYE for this allowance from 1981-82 to 1984-85.  In addition, there have been fairly substantial increases in the income limit for the scheme over the years.  The income limit for 1985-86 is £2,985.  With the income limit increasing I suppose one might have expected that there would have tended to be an increase in the number of claims but that has not been the case.  That would appear to suggest that, because of the actual amounts of income available through social welfare payments and other schemes, including superannuation schemes for people who have been in such schemes, retirement benefit schemes and so on, numbers of people are in a better position now to make provision for their retirement than they had been in previous years.  I do not advance that as a conclusive argument about the scheme itself but nevertheless it is something we should bear in mind.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates did draw attention to a fairly important factor when he suggested that we should not overrate the capacity of the tax system to resolve the problem obtaining in regard to the relationship between elderly persons and their families. We all know there are cases where <Col N="1289" /> family members will go to almost any lengths to be able to care for an elderly relative at home.  They will do so because they feel that that is what they should do and indeed would do so without any financial assistance.  Equally we are aware &mdash; all of us meet these cases &mdash; that there are cases where it would be virtually impossible to conceive of a situation in which some people would wish to have an elderly relative living with them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>

      <P>I am endeavouring to deal with the points raised by the Opposition. I know Deputy Hilliard has a great enthusiasm in this area.  I am going through the points raised and shall come to his in a moment.</P>
      <P>I was supporting the point made by Deputy Yates to say that we should not overestimate the ability of the tax system to deal with the human and social problems met in the area about which we are now talking.  In relation to a number of other schemes &mdash; to which I will make a passing reference later &mdash; Deputy Yates asked if some of the conditions for access to them, whether it be the prescribed relative allowance or the home help scheme, were not too restrictive.  That is a fair question and should be taken up in another context.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Yates also asked what would be the situation in case of marital breakdown where a deserted wife had a child at work, whether the eldest child could get some allowance where he or she was the breadwinner.  One would have to examine each specific case.  For example, where there were younger children dependent on and being supported by an older son or daughter, in that case the <Col N="1290" /> older son or daughter could qualify for the child income tax allowance.  But it is something that would have to be examined in each specific case.  One could not make a general ruling about it because it would be dependent on a number of factors.</P>
    <P>The amendment proposes that the allowance be increased to £350.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What would it cost?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1985 the cost would be approximately £2.6 million and, in a full year, approximately £4.3 million.  There are approximately 38,000 taxpayers under PAYE claiming this allowance and approximately 4,000 other taxpayers claiming the allowance also.  I might point out that section 1 already provides for substantial increases in exemption limits in general for taxpayers, particularly applicable to those 65 years and upwards, and indeed automatically for an increase or a modification in the operation of marginal relief associated therewith.  Taking the total cost of the increases in the general and age exemption limits, that amounts to approximately £3.7 million this year and in a full year, £6.3 million, and it will take 10,500 taxpayers out of the income tax net.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also a wide range of substantial increases in social welfare payments of various kinds produced in the budget many of which are relevant to the dependent relatives about whom we are talking. We have also increased the allowance available to a taxpayer for a person looking after an incapacitated taxpayer or an incapacitated taxpayer's spouse.  That has gone up from £2,000 to £2,500.  There is a social welfare allowance for an incapacitated pensioner who is receiving full-time care and attention from a prescribed person and there are the other schemes mentioned by Deputy Hilliard and Deputy Yates which are operated through the health boards.  It is not as if no improved provision has been made during the course of this year to cover the categories of people concerned. There have been substantial improvements <Col N="1291" /> in provisions for elderly persons and I should like to rebut Deputy Hilliard's contention that this budget has been severe on old people and widows.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We have provided in this budget, as we have for the past two years, an improvement in the real value of social welfare allowances made to old people. The intermingling of the tax system and the social welfare system gives rise to difficulties for quite a number of old people, but we must ask why those difficulties arise.  They arise because we operate the system so as to make sure that social welfare pensions can be paid without deduction of tax, although the total income is liable for tax.  If there is any tax burden it falls on the other source of income, if any, which is available to the taxpayer.  It is there that the value of the increases in the exemption limits becomes clear.  Deputy Hilliard spoke in that connection about the restriction on this allowance where the income of the dependent relative is in excess of the prescribed limit.  That is a matter of principle. We can argue about the levels but the question he raises is one of principle, which has to do with the idea that we try to target those various social benefits in order to make sure that the biggest advantage goes to those who need it most.  I would not accept that Deputy Hilliard has a case on the point of principle. There is obviously a case to be made by the Opposition on the question of the levels.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Dea suggested that we increase the dependent relative allowance. Obviously he is supporting the case. Increases in tax allowances are of benefit only to people who have a tax liability and the more tax liability an individual has, the more the increase in the allowance is worth.  This is a point I will leave <Col N="1292" /> with the Opposition to reflect upon. Indeed, we could all usefully consider the line of thought which ran through the report of the Commission on Taxation that perhaps we could target schemes more effectively not through the tax system but by direct payments, which would of course require some assessment of means to make sure the payments would go to those who needed them.</P>

      <P>What has emerged from the Minister's reply strengthens considerably our case and underlines the need to adopt an amendment of this kind. The Minister has indicated that in 1981 50,301 people were claiming dependent relative allowances.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is the difference. We find that 12,000 fewer people are claiming the dependent relatives allowance than in 1981.  The number has been dropping on a continuous slide.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the precise demographic information but the number of old people over 65 is considerably more now than in 1981.  Despite that, the claims being made by income taxpayers have declined by 12,000 as against the figure four years ago.  Clearly it is not that people are not claiming in respect of relatives for whom they are providing.  The Minister has pointed out that there has been an increase in the income limit in respect of people who could claim.  Naturally they would be <Col N="1293" /> claiming for people if they were providing for them.  The Minister has said more to prove our case than we could ever do. The truth is that people are not being provided for at home in anything like the same numbers.  The reason is equally obvious.  This allowance has not been increased for a very considerable number of years.  We may say that people should be more responsible and concerned but when they find that in spite of their awareness and concern the amount they get by way of tax free allowance is only £110, then it is not surprising that they are actually pushing the old folk out of their homes.  If they were in their homes they would be claiming for them.  Never have I found figures so dramatically in support of our case as those which the Minister has given.  I am wondering why it does not occur to somebody in the Revenue Commissioners or in the Minister's Department to ask why there is such a dramatic decline in the numbers claiming this allowance.  There is only one answer. Old people are being shunted out of private homes into State homes.  As the Minister said, the Government are providing for them at much greater cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We were proposing an 8 per cent to 10 per cent increase in the age exemptions, just marginally ahead of inflation.  The Minister would not adopt it.  The Minister said that it would increase the limits but, of course, the limits have to be increased each year to take account of inflation.  The Minister told me that the figure involved in accepting one of those amendments would be of the order of a couple of hundred thousand pounds which in the context of a total tax bill of £6,000 million would not even register on the scale much less be an issue.  It would have applied to a few thousand pensioners.  They would no longer be burdened with the old problem of filling up forms which, in the final analysis, would probably yield 35p or 40p per week to the Revenue.  We must also take account of the worry and tension it causes such people and the cost of sending the forms out.</P>
      <P>I insist that the matter be looked at more seriously than it has been.  I should like to say to the Revenue Commissioners that when trends like that emerge they should not see themselves as operating in isolation and only being concerned with how much comes in and how much goes out.  If they see trends like that in dependent relative claims surely they should see it as an obligation to pass on to the Minister for Finance the view that something dramatic was happening, that claims were not being submitted and people were not being cared for at home.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures mentioned by the Minister are the most dramatic I have seen for a long time.  The Minister should be asking the Minister for Health and Social Welfare what the <Col N="1295" /> cause is.  The Minister told the House that our suggestion would cost £2.6 million in 1985 and it appears that that figure is overstated.  It is on the basis that everybody would make the full claim in every respect.  Let us assume that the Minister's figure is correct, that the cost of adopting the suggestion would be £4.3 million in a full year.  I should like to put the alternative cost.  In 1981, 50,000 people claimed this allowance but in 1984-85 that number dropped by 12,000 to 38,000.  If those people are not in their own homes they are elsewhere under the care of the State. If one multiplies 12,000 by a low figure for maintenance &mdash; I will estimate this as low as possible in the interest of the Minister; we will not say £50,000 per annum which is the regular cost of a bed in any hospital per year for old people but let us say £10,000 per annum which is the cheapest care available in any home or otherwise for an old person &mdash; by the low figure of £10,000, one comes up with £120 million per annum.  That calculation gives the Minister the benefit of the cheapest care and maintainance cost in any institution.</P>
      <P>Those who are not being provided for at home and who, according to the Minister, would cost £4.3 million per year, are costing him instead £120 million to be looked after in a place where they are not at all as happy or do not feel as secure as they would be if they were in their home.</P>
      <P>It must also be said that their contribution to society is not at all as meaningful as it might be.  The term &ldquo;dependent relative&rdquo; is a tax term but I would like to think that we could convey to old people the notion that we do not always see them as being just dependants, that we also see them as contributors in a real sense to a happier and better society.  Old people have, for one reason or another, a lot to contribute in the family home and in the community in rural Ireland.  If one listens to them telling stories of the past about hurling matches and great events, chatting to youngsters at the crossroads or to each other one will realise that their contribution to the well-being of society is great.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1296" /> However, if we insist that they are not to be provided for at home and are to be looked after elsewhere they will concede to themselves, though wrongly, that they are being left to mingle with their contemporaries, with people like themselves who are being minded in hospitals and institutions.  Those people would not be encouraged to think that they are other than dependants waiting for the final call. That is deplorable.  In view of the cost involved, it is time we woke up.  I am often asked where will I find the money but in this case the Minister's reply has indicated where I could find it.  By adopting our proposal the State could save a huge sum of money.  The truth is that the people we are referring to are not the type who would be represented.  What has happened is that people cannot afford to keep such people at home.  They are not being looked after at home any more and the State is being asked to look after them.  That is why the numbers given by the Minister this morning shows such a dramatic decline.</P>

      <P>The Minister was quoting Deputy Yates when he said that we should not overestimate the consequence of the tax system and how we could promote a social awareness through it.  I have taken account of that. I do not think we could underestimate the damaging effect of a tax system that as not given any consideration to the social consequences that derive from its limited tunnelled vision.  A proposal under which a miserable allowance has stayed the same for the last number of years is damaging.  It is not surprising that families who are under income pressures are saying: &ldquo;Wherever else gran or granda stay they are not going to stay in our house.  We have enough problems without having to look after either of them and change the bed clothes and so <Col N="1297" /> on.  They can do that somewhere else.

      <P>This amendment relates to PRSI.  We have been dealing with the social impact of short-sighted tax legislation.  I dealt with the economic impact of the levels of taxation in my first amendment.  I failed to get a response from the Minister on either proposition and I know I will not get a response on this.  That will not prevent me from making the case to restore the PRSI tax allowance to what it was in 1981.  The allowance originally was £312, but it was reduced by the Minister in his first budget to £286, and there it has stayed.  To restore the allowance to what it was four or give years ago in real terms would not be anywhere near the value it was then.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of the levels of taxation, levies and PRSI, employment is being penalised thus creating unemployment problems. As the Commission on Taxation pointed out and as the Government's advisers pointed out, our tax system discriminates against employment.  It discriminates in favour of costs of equipment against costs of employment.  The level of PRSI is a considerable factor in the growth of unemployment.  As unemployment grows more and more people are claiming pay-related benefits for as long as they can.  I was in Government in the early seventies so I have some little experience of the system when it was introduced. Into the late seventies the PRSI fund was in surplus.  I recall the late Deputy Joe Brennan saying to us in Government one <Col N="1299" /> day when we were wondering where we could get £1 million for a worthwhile project.

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>When we looked for a few million pounds I remember the late Deputy Joe Brennan saying that he had it in his fund.  This fund was in surplus and the late Deputy Joe Brennan invited us to consider making an application to him for the use of that fund.  That fund was in surplus because we had buoyant activity in the economy and very few claims on the fund.  In recent times we have a depressed economy and growing claims on the fund.</P>
      <P>I will give the trend of contributions which the taxpayer has to make to the social welfare fund.  In 1981 income to the fund was £470 million, expenditure was £650 million and the difference between income and expenditure was £180 million.  In 1982 income was £650 million, expenditure was £870 million and the difference on expenditure over income was £220 million, a growth of £140 million.  In 1983 that figure grew. The income was £760 million and expenditure was at £1,000 million, the difference being £240 million.  In 1984 the provisional figure for income is £800 million and expenditure is £1,1000 million the difference being £300 million.  The estimated figure for 1985 is income at £0.89 billion and the expenditure is estimated at £1.2 billion, the difference being £310 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The shortfall between income and expenditure in respect of this fund has grown from £180 million to £310 million <Col N="1300" /> through constant and ever-increasing stages over the last five years.  That demonstrates beyond doubt that we are witnessing the consequence of growing unemployment and the demand which that is making on this fund.  It is not surprising as we get into this vicious circle that PAYE workers are screaming about PRSI.  The PRSI worker does not and cannot realise that he is subsidising the fund only to the tune of £310 million this year.  What they do not know is that they are not paying enough to cover the expenditure from the fund and that the deficit is being made up by by extra contributions in tax.  If we confine ourselves to reacting by increasing PRSI contributions we will drive more and more people out of work and put more and more claims on to this fund so that we will be unable to extract ourselves from this vicious circle. We should restore the allowance to £312 as I propose in this amendment.  That would be no increase at all over the 1981 figure; it would be a decrease.</P>
    <P>There is not much more that I should say.  The facts speak for themselves in this case and no doubt some of my colleagues may want to make a contribution.  As long as we continue, as this Minister seems determined to continue, to work only on the basis that we will do it all by addition and subtraction: &ldquo;that all of you human-kind out there behave like the robots that I think you should be, not as human beings who will give up work if the level of tax is too much, who will be discouraged by levels of PRSI.  I look on you as pawns and when I move you from one place to the other you stay moved&rdquo; we will see even further consequences on this table and on tax next year.  We will have higher levels of tax, higher levels of PRSI and fewer people at work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the points made by Deputy O'Kennedy.  I pointed out yesterday and the day before since we started to debate this Finance Bill that one of the major disincentives to employment creation is the level of taxation generally, and PRSI is a significant factor in that.  We are talking here, in relation to PRSI and PAYE, about double taxation. <Col N="1301" /> Levies, PRSI, youth employment levy etc. are deducted from a person's gross income and then PAYE is levied on gross income; in other words he is paying tax on income which has already borne tax. He is paying tax on income which he does not have.  He is paying tax on a notional income.  God knows, the levels of taxation are high enough without a person having to pay tax on income which he did not receive.  Our amendment would not rectify that situation but it would go a small way to restore some equity to this area.</P>
      <P>The Minister has paid a great deal of lip service to equity in taxation and to the fact that the burden of taxation is too high.  Here is his chance to do something small to reduce it in such a way that he would move substantially in the direction of restoring equity to the tax system.  It would be a small step in the right direction and I urge the Minister to accept it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>We had a similar amendment on Committee Stage which went further than Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment goes.  Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment would cost £3.6 million this year and about £6 million in a full year.</P>
      <P>In relation to moving towards tax equity, I remind Deputy O'Dea that the first report of the Commission on Taxation, much quoted by Deputy O'Kennedy, takes the line that in order to bring about equity and an improvement in the tax system we should as far as possible do away with the various allowances that are in the system and apply, as they suggest, a single rate of taxation to all income.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the House on a number of occasions that that is broadly the direction in which we should go but first we must take action in relation to the overall level of taxation, which we have set about doing in the mational plan.  Permit me to wander <Col N="1302" /> briefly.  I would have thought that by now Deputy O'Kennedy would have become tired of his constant attempt &mdash; I do not know whether he believes it; if he does then I have no hope at all for him &mdash; to present the Minister for Finance as some kind of robot who plays with pawns.  The difficulty is that Deputy O'Kennedy has not managed to surmount the fact that he is not capable &mdash; I am not being personal about this &mdash; his party are not capable of making up their minds about priorities. Drawing up a budget or a plan requires making decisions on priorities.  Looking at these amendments requires making decisions on whether the change in priorities suggested by the amendment, this or any other, is justified in relation to the overall budgetary picture.  I do not find that this amendment would be justified in relation to the overall budgetary picture.</P>

Why did he not say again that the spokesman for the Opposition did not point out where the money could be got? For the record I will point out in this case where this amount of money could be got this year to great effect.  I have demonstrated every case I have made here this morning where the revenue could be saved.  The Minister might not like what I am going to say in this instance but he is going to hear it in any event.  This year the gross cost will be £3.6 million.  I accept <Col N="1303" /> the figure.

I do not think that bringing someone in from outside at enormous cost to the taxpayer was warranted to try to keep the Minister's personality up front in headlines every day, and the same is true of all of them.  The workers are entitled to say at least that if it is costing so little to restore PRSI to where it was, then give us half at least of what you are spending on spurious propaganda campaigns in every Department on those close &mdash; I do not want to use the term &mdash; to the Government who are doing rather well out of this new development in Government services.

      <P>In page 14, line 9, to delete &ldquo;seven&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;five&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the Committee Stage we had a <Col N="1305" /> discussion on section 10 about the length of the lease period in respect of which the exemption provided for in this section would apply.  In the Bill as originally proposed we provided for a lease period of seven years.  What I am now proposing, following the Committee Stage discussion, is instead of a period of seven years to provide a period of five years.  That would be by way of a modification of section 10 (1) (a) (ii).  Having regard to previous discussions it was agreed that a three year period would be too short. From the point of view of the person taking the land on a lease, I think seven years would be the appropriate period, but I am open to the thought that we need to provoke movement on both sides and from that point I am prepared to see how we get on with a period of five years.</P>

I am at a disadvantage, because it becomes a habit to be critical, but in this instance I want to express my appreciation for the Minister accepting this proposal.  I hope it will prove to be the right course.  The Minister has proved flexible in respect of the qualification for land leasing and the land leasing allowance under the Finance Bill, but if experience shows the Minister, or whichever of us fills this role very soon, that this is too generous and if the Minister or I find we want to come back, we will have open minds on it.

      <P>In page 16, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(2)  For the purposes of income levy, that all self-employed persons be levied on their net profit.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment deals with the levy on the self-employed.  This tax is levied on a PAYE worker's gross income before personal allowances, whereas the self-employed have this tax levied on their gross income before capital and personal allowances.  I believe this tax should be levied on net profits, because the gross profit is not a true reflection of a person's income.  As this was to be a temporary levy, but it is continued year in and year out to collect money in an easy way, I think it is time it was removed or, if not removed, then at least it should be levied on net profit rather than gross profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support this amendment. We are opposed to the principle of this levy because it was supposed to be a temporary levy and from the Minister's contribution the last day we have no idea when it will be removed.  It has all the characteristics of a permanent levy, and that is why we would welcome any adjustment in this area.  This levy falls into the category of the disincentive elements of taxation, because the Commission on Taxation pointed out that all the extra contributions, be they income tax levies or PRSI, should be treated as tax deductions from salary because once they are levied at source they become tax deductions.</P>
      <P>There are inequities in the tax system. Deputy Ahern is an accountant and has practical experience in this area.  It seems there is an inequity in this tax being levied on the gross profit as distinct from net profit of farmers.  Farmers have often said they should be treated the same as everybody else.  We are talking here about the self-employed because the PAYE workers have these deductions made at source.  I hope the Minister will accept this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1307" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment refers to the income levy only, but we have three levies which are collected on the same base.  It is difficult to decide what difference this would make because we do not know the Deputy's definition of &ldquo;net profit&rdquo;.  However, there are a number of considerations we have to bear in mind in approaching an amendment like this. First, it would probably have to be extended to the other two levies, and, secondly, PAYE taxpayers are assessed on their gross income, and were this approach to be adopted it could be expected that they would seek a similar concession.</P>
      <P>The self-employed are already allowed a number of deductions, such as business expenses and interest on loans for business purposes.  This is in keeping with the base on which we defined the income levies.  The same definition of income is used as a base for the income levy as is used for the other two levies.  The reckonable income is contained in regulation 6 of the Youth Employment Regulations, 1982.  I do not propose to go into all these regulations but I will quote from the most relevant parts:</P>
      <P>For the purposes of the Act, &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; means, in relation to an individual, for a contribution year, the aggregate of the individual's income from all sources, other than&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  non-pecuniary income, and</P>
      <P>(b)  payments under the Social Welfare Acts, 1981 and 1982,</P>
      <P>for the contribution year, as estimated in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Acts, ... after deducting from the income so much of any deduction allowed by virtue of Chapter II of Part I of the Finance Act, 1972...as is to be deducted from or set off against that income in charging it to income tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This &ldquo;reckonable income&rdquo; covers income from all sources, except benefits in kind and payments under the Social Welfare Acts less superannuation contributions. <Col N="1308" /> It includes all income from self-employment, dividends, rents and so on.  As I said at the beginning, the amendment does not define exactly what is meant by net profit.  The profit figure shown by a set of accounts cannot be the one that is meant because such a figure might be arrived at after a number of deductions which would not be acceptable for tax purposes, such as personal expenditure, interest on personal borrowings or capital expenditure.  In that case we would have a base which was not consistent with that for the other levies.  If the amendment was intended to refer to net profit for tax purposes, it comes back to the figure on the basis of which the levies are calculated at present anyway so, in effect, there would be no change.</P>
    <P>The basis of the complaints which I think I can reasonably infer has given rise to the amendment is that some self-employed people, particularly farmers, take the view that they are unfairly treated in that they do not get any allowance for capital expenditure and dispute the fact that they are treated in the same way as other people, since they maintain that PAYE workers do not have capital expenditure.  That is not true because a number of PAYE workers, as Deputy Ahern knows, are entitled to some special allowances in relation to protective clothing, wear and tear on tools and so on.  Expenditure of that kind is not allowable as a deduction against reckonable income for the purpose of calculating these levies.  As I said on Committee Stage, we have a reasonable concordance of treatment of the self-employed and employees in the calculation of their liability for these levies.  To arrive at reckonable income, for example, a farmer would deduct all his allowable expenses and stock relief before arriving at the reckonable income base for the purpose of these levies.  Business expenses are properly deducted for the purpose of these levies, so the treatment, in so far as we can make it, is the same for all categories of taxpayer.</P>

      <P>(i)  services consisting of the development of immovable goods, and the maintenance and repair of immovable goods including the installation of fixtures, where the value of movable goods (if any) provided in pursuance of an agreement in relation to such services does not exceed two-thirds of the total amount on which tax is chargeable in respect of the agreement;</P>

      <P>(iii)  blocks, of concrete, of a kind which comply with the specification contained in the Standard Specification (Concrete Building Blocks) Declaration, 1974 (Irish Standard 20: 1974);</P>
      <P>(iv)  articles of personal clothing and textile handkerchiefs excluding&mdash;</P>
      <P>(a)  articles of clothing made wholly or partly of fur skin, other than garments merely trimmed with fur skin unless the trimming has an area greater than one-fifth of the area of the outside material, and</P>
      <P>(b)  articles of personal clothing of a kind specified in paragraphs (xvii) and (xviii) of the Second Schedule;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(v)  (a) fabrics, yarn, thread and leather, of a kind normally used in <Col N="1310" /> the manufacture of clothing, including elastics, tapes and padding materials in the form supplied for the manufacture of clothing, and</P>
    <P>(b)  yarn of a kind normally used in the manufacture of clothing fabrics;</P>

    <P>(vii)  sole and upper leather of a kind normally used for the manufacture and repair of footwear, and also soles, heels and insoles of any material;&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>This would involve introducing a new VAT tax band of 5 per cent in respect of the goods covered by this amendment. The basis on which the amendment is introduced is that the Minister did not accede to any case we made on Committee Stage in respect of building, footwear and clothing.  It was not open to me to repeat the same proposals in an amendment for Report Stage.  Consequently, the only basis on which I could raise these issues again now &mdash; and they are matters of considerable importance &mdash; was to substitute a different amendment which was not covered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>I am as anxious as anyone to ensure that the complexities of the VAT system are reduced but, if reducing the number of bands means, particularly in respect of the building industry, that the level of VAT is increased by 100 per cent, then even our determination to simplify the system should not allow us to close our eyes to the consequences of the extra tax burden on a very important industry.</P>
    <P>The same argument applies to the rate of VAT on clothing.  Where we take the view that the VAT levels in respect of particularly sensitive and important areas are too high and the increases too severe, the proper course for us to adopt is to propose that the adjustments will be back to where they were or, in the case of clothing, slightly less than where they were.  Since we have been arguing the <Col N="1311" /> case here, the indications conveyed to us by the construction industry are that we did not put the case as fully as we should have done.  Obviously, they were influenced by the necessarily abbreviated newspaper reports and I am not criticising that even though, in some cases, the reports were non-existent.  I do not wish to repeat the comments which I made regarding the <i>Irish Press</i> last night and I did not see today's issue.  Some of our newspapers have endeavoured to cover this rather tedious debate fully and I wish to express my appreciation to them.</P>
    <P>We are told that legislators should legislate and their obligations in that regard can best be demonstrated on Committee Stage of a Bill.  At that point, details of every section are gone through before they apply in law to the citizens whom we are concerned to protect.  It is not very exciting or dramatic but it is, nonetheless, very important.  The provisions we are dealing with here have very serious consequences for various sectors, especially the building industry in which there are 50,000 people unemployed at present.  The number on the live register is 230,000 which puts into focus the dramatic decline in the building industry. When you think of the cost of social welfare payments to numbers like that &mdash; and the social welfare payments do not include the PRSI payments, the yawning gap which I pointed out this morning in an earlier proposal &mdash; you can see the pressure that brings to bear on the Exchequer.  Money which should be invested here is being invested elsewhere. That is the trend.  People in the building sector are being forced to move out instead of, as was the position, encouraging others to move in.  Six, seven or eight years ago some major construction companies were anxious to move in to this healthy climate.  That is not the case now. Some of our major construction companies have their poster, placards and signs decorating cities in Europe, the Middle East and the United States.  One has to welcome the fact that they have reached that stage of development, but <Col N="1312" /> the whole climate for investment in the construction industry needs to be drastically reappraised and given a significant shot in the arm.</P>
    <P>In contrast to many other industries, almost all the materials and components are produced at home for the building industry.  That should not be overlooked when we are trying to maximise the amount of employment that can be generated by our own activities in processing and manufacturing.  This industry should be singled out for special treatment.  The Minister should have included the building and construction industry in the venture capital scheme.  He cannot do it now because the Bill is about to pass, but I hope he will keep an open mind and if he wants to bring in an amendment I will respond favourably.  If a qualification for that scheme was that you could not get the money otherwise, every construction company here would be well qualified indeed.  They cannot get money.  They are being pressed by the banks and, in many cases, they are being put out of business.  I will not make judgment on whether the banks should do this, that or the other.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister to look at the files in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners without checking on individual names.  If he does that, he will see that construction companies feature very prominently in claims made by the Revenue Commissioners.  They are determined to claim interest payments as well as tax due from some of these companies.  Because they were not prepared to compromise on the interest three years ago, interest has accrued and some companies cannot pay even the original capital sum.  I appeal to the Minister to convey to the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners that if a commercial enterprise has a tax bill of £150,000 plus interest of £50,000 the Commissioners should accept the original sum and not insist on interest, as happens now.  I have seen many examples of this since the debate started.  If you refuse to accept the sum due without interest, in three years time there is nothing available to pay the capital <Col N="1313" /> or the interest.  That is happening in the case of contractors and sub-contractors who have run into difficulties.  As contractors fall, naturally sub-contractors fall with them.</P>
    <P>The Minister should check in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners on the number of agricultural contractors who were unable to discharge their obligations to the inspector of taxes over the past few years.  I know a number of them in my own constituency.  Three or four of them have gone out of business because of the depressed state of agriculture, because of the suspension of the farm modernisation scheme and because building programmes were declining.  I am sure the files of the Revenue Commissioners are full of the names of people like that.  People are getting letters and demands.  The powers of the Revenue Commissioners are being strengthened, because in this Bill the Minister has put interest payments on the same footing as other payments.  They cannot be statute barred.  That is a major step.  Between the Revenue and the citizen there should always be a balance between right and obligation.  That balance no longer exists.  The Revenue Commissioners can go back without any limitation on time.  That is wrong in principle. They can go back 30 years.  You never know when you have discharged your responsibility.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why those who sit in the offices of inspectors of taxes or Revenue Commissioners should be in a specially privileged position.  There is no reason why they should be able to say: &ldquo;On our terms or not at all&rdquo;.  I am not saying they should not have power and authority within the law to deal with people who evade or avoid their responsibilities. They should not be not only all powerful but almighty.  People with companies with real problems feel totally at the mercy, sometimes the rather tender mercy, of the Revenue Commissioners. They fear certain officers.  I am talking in particular about builders' providers, contractors and sub-contractors.  They are constantly preoccupied with this and they try to convey their fears to me by phoning me at all hours of the day and <Col N="1314" /> night asking me to do something about it or to get on to the Minister.  This is becoming very serious.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to ask the Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners &mdash; I know he cannot look at the files &mdash; how many claims are outstanding in respect of the business sector and how many proceedings are being threatened.  He will be appalled at the information he will get.  This is a consequence of the depressed state of the industry.  The revenue which could be generated by a buoyant construction industry is exemplified by the tax contributions made in the good years, in the sixties and the seventies. The industry is labour intensive.  If unemployment is our major problem I cannot understand why the industries providing employment opportunities are not singled out for special help as distinct from special punishment.</P>
    <P>The construction industry fits into this pattern.  In a television interview which was noted for other comments also, a former Minister for Local Government, Deputy Blaney, focussed on the construction industry as being the major avenue through which we can boost the economy.  Obviously, he was interested in dealing with economic issues as opposed to some of the other matters that were being discussed during the interview.  Of course the capital programme is not unlimited, but, as I indicted to the Minister at Committee Stage, some of what has been done by the Government should be undone.  For instance, such nonsense taxes as the residential property tax should be abolished, a tax that is not yielding any money.  The Government would bring in more by way of stamp duty.  Such steps on their part would give a signal not only to those who are here to begin again but to those who might wish to invest here that this is a healthy climate for investment.</P>
    <P>There was a time when we prided ourselves on the amount of investment we attracted.  That was a focal point of all our capital programme policy, but matters have gone the other way in the past few years.  Surely in the interest of the revenue alone the Minister ought to be <Col N="1315" /> concerned to ensure that the building industry be given a chance to breathe again and then perhaps to develop to the great potential it is capable of.</P>
    <P>If the areas of building and the clothing and footwear industries have anything in common, it is that each involves high employment potential.  Also, they are very much the traditional domestic activities in our economy.  Unfortunately some of the footwear industries and many of the clothing industries have gone to the wall, but those remaining should be maintained and strengthened to the point where we can use this native base from which to build something bigger in the future.  Those industries that have survived the famine of recent times must be fairly strong.</P>
    <P>The potential of Irish industry, particularly of domestic industry, has not begun to be tapped.  I regret that the Minister did not see fit to accept my amendment in relation to marketing.  By accepting it he would have been making a major impact on the clothing and footwear industries, for instance.  There is enormous potential for growth in our domestic industry but we must be prepared to research the market.  If, for example, we wish to sell clothes to the French or the Swiss we must ascertain what these markets demand.  The same applies to footwear.  Without going into any further detail I would ask the Minister to reconsider his position in respect of these three elements of the economy.  Our proposal is that VAT levels in all these aspects be reduced to a new tax band of 5 per cent. Obviously I would require the Minister to tell us what the cost involved in that change would be, either in net or in gross terms, but I consider the case in respect of the construction industry particularly to be almost unanswerable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>The decision of the Government to increase the VAT in this instance from 5 per cent to 10 per cent and to reduce the rate on materials and so on from 35 to 23 per cent while reducing the rate on blocks and other materials to 10 per cent will have a serious effect <Col N="1316" /> on the building trade.  I do not know how the Minister could think otherwise.  One assumes the Government's action is a means of squeezing more tax from the industry without taking into account the consequences of that action.</P>
      <P>There are a few facts and figures in this regard that I should like the Minister to explain.  Apart from ourselves, the builders and all those involved in the industry have difficulty in understanding the economic strategy behind this decision.  At the old rate of 5 per cent, the tax in respect of a house costing £30,000 would be £1,500 so far as the purchaser was concerned, but with the rate being increased to 10 per cent the cost to the purchaser in terms of tax will be £3,000.  Who does the Minister expect to pay that extra tax? Will the builder be expected to pay it or will it be the responsibility of the purchaser, or is the builder expected to add that amount to the price of the house so that the purchaser will pay for it anyway? These are very important questions, and I trust the Minister will give us a satisfactory explanation.  Housing provides us with our greatest potential to create employment.  That has been the case for many years.  At a time when the industry is on its knees, the Government decision can hardly be justified.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment relates to the increases in VAT on various sectors of the industry.  The Minister gave the deaf ear to arguments on a similar amendment yesterday.  Today's amendment is in slightly different form and I understand it would involve the creation of a new VAT band.  The reason for this is technical.  We have no wish to create new bands of VAT.  On the contrary, we favour a move towards a single rate, but the Minister will understand that we could not table for Report Stage an amendment that had been tabled for Committee Stage.  Therefore, we can only reiterate the arguments put forward yesterday in regard to the building, clothing and footwear industries.  Anyone coming here from outside and considering <Col N="1317" /> the reality of what is being done would be astonished.</P>
      <P>The Government put forward two proposals in regard to the construction industry &mdash; the doubling of the £1,000 new house grant and reduction in the rate of VAT on cement blocks to compensate for the doubling of VAT on houses.  In effect, it will not do this.  It takes more than cement blocks to build a house.  As I pointed out yesterday, the reduction in VAT on cement blocks will encourage the black economy.  I did not hear the Minister advance any convincing answer to these arguments.  Perhaps he did not grasp their meaning, and hearing them for a second time will appreciate them and respond to them.  The reduction in VAT on cement blocks reduces the price of this raw material for those who are not registered for VAT.  It enables these people to be more competitive in their price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>This is part of a conglomerate amendment.  The Minister will understand our technical difficulties.  We cannot put forward the same type of amendment as yesterday, because that was defeated at the Minister's insistence. What the Minister proposes in order to offset the main change of doubling the VAT on houses will not have that effect. There will be detrimental consequences which probably were not in the forefront of his mind when making the original changes.  The effects of these changes have been pointed out by us and by the CIF.  Other interested parties outside the House have at great length and with great publicity shown the detrimental consequences of the Minister's actions.  Our queries have not been answered by the Government, their representatives or their handlers.  If they have no answer to our arguments, they should accept, at least in part, our amendments.  The Minister does not say how the doubling of the VAT rate will help in the creation of employment in the construction industry, which is one of our most labour <Col N="1318" /> intensive industries.  The Minister said yesterday that the housing industry is a barometer for the economy and that you do not improve the economy by tinkering about with that barometer, but something must be done to stimulate the economy. A certain amount of sympathy and consideration on the Government's part towards the construction industry at this time of depression would provide a considerable stimulus to the economy.  This is not just our view on this side of the House, but that of many economic commentators.</P>
      <P>The net result of the changes in the VAT rate in the Finance Bill will be to take £75 million out of the building industry.  That is based on output figures for 1984-85.  The effect on the private sector, according to the figures issued by the CIF &mdash; that is, private housing, agriculture, industrial and commercial development &mdash; will be about £40.5 million. Something in excess of £30 million will be taken from public work in the private sector &mdash; houses, schools, hospitals and so forth.  Various spokesmen have advanced the argument that the reduction in VAT will create a cash flow advantage for the building industry, but that is not the case.  My experience is that the refunding of VAT charged on input is normally given within the credit period which operates in the building industry generally.</P>
      <P>These matters have been discussed at length in the budget debate and on Second, Committee and Report Stages. Could the Minister justify his reasons for doubling VAT on the building industry? I have not heard one word of justification, explanation or argument on that matter from the Government side.  Has he an economic justification for it, or is it just a revenue collection exercise?  Is there some good social or economic reason for it?</P>

      <P>The other labour intensive industries, namely clothing and footwear, and the motor trade have also suffered from taxation increases.  These are all areas where employment could be created and where employment has been lost due to the recession.  There is no economic or other logic which can be advanced to justify that.  It is incomprehensible, not just to me and my colleagues on this side of the House but to those outside the House. The Minister told us yesterday that the increase in VAT on footwear would not have any effect on employment in the footwear industry.</P>

      <P>If the Minister wants to tell that to those outside the House, on the doorsteps of County Kildare during the local election campaign, well and good.  If they accept that, fine.  I am not an economist and perhaps that is why I cannot understand it.  The Minister tells us that VAT on footwear is a revenue collecting exercise.  The logic of that is that the Minister could accept many more desirable amendments such as an increase in the dependent relatives' allowance advanced earlier here today. <Col N="1320" /> He could impose any rate of VAT, perhaps 90 per cent, on the footwear industry if it does not affect employment in that industry.  He would have solved the problem and that would fill the black hole. He could increase VAT on the footwear industry to his heart's content, if it is not going to have any effect whatever on the levels of employment in that industry.</P>

      <P>We are getting him ready for it.  We have a dreadful unemployment problem from which many of our social problems stem.  In that connection our law and order problem arises largely from unemployment.  Yet, the response of the Minister and the Government is to increase taxation on labour-intensive industries.  If somebody can explain to me the logic of that action I will accept it, and I will go home happy.  I have not been happy in my mind about what the Government have been doing and I am not just taking a partisan view of this.  I want the country and the economy to work.  I do not want the IMF or some other body moving in here to take control. It is not a question of political point scoring but I still want to know how unemployment can be attacked if the Government persist in heaping extra taxation on labour intensive industries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have regard to what has been said not just in this House but also outside it by commentators, some of them supporters of his own party. He should give serious consideration to our amendment.  It would be wrong to refuse to accept it just because it is coming from this side of the House.  He should consider the independent arguments that have been advanced by the CIF and by representatives of the industries affected by the tax increases.  If he is unwilling or unable to consider our <Col N="1322" /> amendment or to make any change of his own that would ease the situation, he should tell us the reason.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanCalleary" hpid="Mr. Calleary Mr. Calleary">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Calleary</NameTxt>
      <P>Because of the importance of the building industry it behoves us to express our deeply-felt fears about what will happen to that industry.  I have been connected with the building industry for longer than I care to remember but I have never seen it in such a state.  Both the small and the larger companies are now involved.  For instance, in Mayo County Council small contractors are not able to compete in the tendering for house construction.  I know of one instance where the 1984 house prices were £1,000 down on the 1983 prices. There is cut throat competition and it is not healthy.  There is no way that standards can be maintained when prices are being reduced continually.</P>
      <P>An indication of the way the industry is proceeding can be taken from the number of planning permissions granted, although I accept it is not the only indicator. According to statistics dated 14 May 1985 from the Central Statistics Office, in 1982 some 13,328 planning permissions were granted for new dwellings; in 1983 that was reduced to 11,221 and in 1984 the figure was 9,399.  That is an indication of the decline of the industry and anything that accelerates that decline is bad for the industry and the economy.</P>
      <P>Statistics released from the Central Statistics Office on 1 May 1985 in relation to employment in the building and construction industry show the decline that has occurred since last year.  In the first three months of this year there has been an average drop of 12.5 per cent as compared with the first three months of last year.  The index was at 60.6 for January 1985, it was 58.6 for February 1985 and it was 58 for March 1985.  This is a decrease over the same months in 1984 of 11.4 per cent, 12.3 per cent and 12.9 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Like Deputy O'Dea, I fail to see the logic of imposing an extra 5 per cent tax on an industry that is on its knees.  I appeal to the Minister, even at this late stage, to remove that extra 5 per cent tax. To my mind the tax should be removed <Col N="1323" /> completely.  It was imposed at a time when the industry was buoyant but that was a mistake.  To increase it at a time when the industry is in a disastrous state would be a very bad error.</P>
    <P>I accept that the extra £1,000 grant will go some way towards compensating new housebuyers.  However, it is not available to those purchasing secondhand houses. When one reads the various articles in the property section of newspapers and journals, one realises that the only thing saving the industry is the sale of houses in the £30,000 range.  However, what the Minister is proposing now will affect even those sales.  It is significant that up to 1 May there was a considerable increase in the number of houses sold when people were trying to buy before the new rates came into operation.</P>
    <P>Even in respect of a local authority loan, a purchaser will have to pay approximately £130 a year extra and when this is taken in conjunction with the original price of the house a considerable amount of money is involved.  For every house and school that is built and for the roadworks carried out this extra 5 per cent will be imposed and it will find itself eventually back in the Estimates of every Department.  The Minister should rethink the matter.  In the short term it may yield extra money but what the industry needs at the moment is encouragement, not the imposition of extra taxation.</P>
    <P>Last Monday a young man called to see me.  He had some problems.  In 1982 he had 37 men employed but now he has three employed.  The harsh reality in a constituency such as mine, so dependent on the building industry, is that one contractor has now lost that number of men. He was confronted with another problem in that the Revenue Commissioners refused to accept money from him, believe it or not, because he had not included the interest thereon.  There is much talk about tax and tax evasion.  In this connection the Revenue Commissioners should not stand on their rights but rather take whatever money they can get, which would alleviate the overall <Col N="1324" /> position.  Let them argue later as to whether interest should have been included in the sums being given them but let them take what is being offered. The position in this case is that the man is now unable to pay even the amount of money that the Revenue Commissioners allege he owes and the whole company will have gone to the wall very soon.</P>
    <P>I fail to see the logic of the increase.  If the Minister will not change his mind then I would ask that he monitor very closely the effect of the 5 per cent imposition on this industry, because all over the country there are now people collecting unemployment assistance and benefit and yet engaging in casual employment.  They are involved in the construction industry, while those companies that have gone to the trouble of registering, of paying income tax, PRSI and so on, acting responsibly, find themselves unable to compete.  I say that sincerely as one who has been associated with the industry for a long time.  Probably there are a number of ways in which that could be stopped. The actual situation at present is that any reduction in VAT on single items has worked to the detriment of registered contractors.  It means that people on unemployment benefit or assistance are doing jobs on the side at a rate with which registered builders are unable to compete.</P>
    <P>The latest statistics emanating from the Central Statistics Office of the number of planning permissions granted must make us all take a very hard look at the way the industry is going.  We must also be worried about the severe drop in the number of dwellings for the year 1984 which perhaps in some way is occasioned by charges; I do not know, but perhaps it is.  Certainly it is an indicator of what will happen in the building industry over the next couple of years.  Bearing in mind the very severe drop in the number of planning permissions granted and the extra imposition provided for in this budget the building industry, while already in rough waters, will find itself in the centre of a tornado over the next couple of years.  It has been correctly <Col N="1325" /> said that the construction industry is a barometer of how the economy is progressing. The fact that that industry is in such a poor state must fairly well reflect the state of our economy at present.</P>
    <P>I might say a few brief words about the footwear and clothing industries, two extremely labour-intensive industries under severe attack from imports.  I do not like to advocate protectionism but they should at least be encouraged.  Certainly this extra imposition on them will not help in any way.  I do not have to tell the Minister the number of firms that have been subjected to severe pressure in the last couple of years, many outstanding names in the footwear and clothing industries which have gone to the wall.  The imposition of duty on them can only accentuate that trend.  I must say I have sympathy for the Minister in his task, but it is a question of endeavouring to get the balance right.  I would have to say sincerely that in respect of the three industries about which I am talking the balance struck in this Bill has been wrong. I believe that the extra duty imposed on the footwear, clothing and construction industries will not yield the return the Minister had hoped or, if it does, what we shall gain on the swings we shall lose on the roundabouts.  By that I mean that the number of people who will be rendered unemployed will more than offset any gain to the State.  Rather than the State collecting money in this respect it will lose it in the payment of social welfare. If half only of the people at present unemployed in the building industry could be put back to work the gain to central Government would be enormous &mdash; rather than paying out unemployment assistance and benefit to many thousands of workers the Minister would be receiving income tax and PRSI from them.  It appears to me to be bad management to impose a tax that will cause unemployment, causing the Government to pay more in social welfare benefits, when probably it would have been better not to have imposed it in the first place, leaving a greater number of people at work.</P>
    <P>Even at this late stage I would appeal <Col N="1326" /> to the Minister to think seriously about the implications of what he is doing for the construction industry and indeed all Departments of Government.</P>

      <P>I might make a passing reference to the matter with which Deputy O'Kennedy started out, that is in relation to the collection of interest on arrears of taxation.  I might make the point to the House that interest on overdue income tax was first introduced in the Finance Act 1962 and has obtained ever since.  The collection of interest on outstanding tax is a statutory obligation on the Revenue.  I am somewhat surprised to hear Deputies on the other side of the House who are accountants and, in one case, a lawyer seriously suggest that one should do a deal on the amount of tax that is payable.  I can imagine there are quite a few people around the country who would love to be able to do a deal on the amount of tax they should pay, people who would be quite happy to operate on that basis.  One can be quite sure there would be very little equity left in the system if that became a widespread practice.</P>

      <P>The amendment proposes a reduction in VAT from 10 per cent to 5 per cent on building, readymix concrete and concrete blocks, adult clothing and adult footwear. The cost in 1985 of implementing such a proposal would be just under £54 million. Revenue would be reduced by just under £54 million compared to the system provided for in this Bill.  That would represent a very substantial change in tax revenue and would require very substantial changes in other items of tax revenue or of expenditure.  Deputies opposite have been asking rather insistently why we are having a 10 per cent VAT rate on building.  We are not specifically having a 10 per cent VAT rate on building. Deputies have homed in on this industry and I can understand why.  We have to look at the broader picture.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>This year.  We have a difficulty in the VAT system that for one reason or another &mdash; usually for very good reasons&mdash;cases have been accepted over the years that given products or groups of products should be treated differently from others, that there should be a lower rate than usual on this product, group of products or service.  It is not difficult to see the basis on which those cases are made, particularly since most people appreciate a point which tends to be overlooked in a discussion like this &mdash; that at the end of the day VAT is a tax which is paid by the consumer.  It is easy to see that cases can be made for treating different groups of products differently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the most notable features of our system is the fact that the zero rate applies to about 25 per cent of consumer expenditure.  It is inevitable if we have a zero rate applying over such a wide range <Col N="1329" /> of consumer expenditure that for a given revenue requirement the rate of tax on the rest of the products in the system must be much higher.  It is not today or yesterday that I pointed out that we could have VAT at 13.5 per cent on everything, a single rate.  If this rate were applied to all consumer expenditure it would raise roughly the same revenue.  Of course there are many groups who would not like to see that.  There are equally many areas in the economy where people would be very happy to see a VAT rate of 13.5 per cent, although they are fewer than they used to be, given the improvements we have made in the system.  Over a fairly wide range of the economy people would regard that as being a positive move.  The fact that we are not at that stage is a direct result of accepting over the years cases for differential treatment.  What we need to do &mdash; this is the advice of the Commission on Taxation also &mdash; is to bring as many things into the scope of the system as we can in order to spread the burden of the system in a way that will create less difficulty for various sections of the economy.  That is what we have done with this modification of the system this year.  We now have three rates and having taken out the standard rate of 35 per cent we now have the main rate at 23 per cent.  There is also a 10 per cent rate and a zero rate.  If we had rates of 23 per cent and 5 per cent it is obvious that we would have had to bring many more things from the zero rate or the 10 per cent rate would have had to be increased to a figure nearer to 23 per cent.  If we were to keep a 5 per cent rate in the system, as Deputies opposite are proposing, we would have to compensate for it somewhere else, either by getting rid of the zero rate or increasing the 23 per cent and 10 per cent rates.  There are no two ways about it.  That is the issue we have to face.</P>
    <P>In putting together the new system we were concerned to bring about the maximum possible beneficial effect on employment.  Taking out the 35 per cent rate was the most important part of that. Being the standard rate, the 35 per cent applied on a wide scale to inter-industry <Col N="1330" /> transfers and a lot of VAT paid at point of entry.  We know whom we have to thank for VAT at point of entry.  It was that rate which put most pressure on industry in terms of tax flow and their capacity to employ people.  One of the Deputies opposite indicated yesterday that he could not understand that argument. It is very straightforward and a few minutes chat with any industrialist involved &mdash; I have spoken to very many of them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

The question of the 35 per cent rate and the cash flow implications of it was one I considered, and the Government agreed, that we should tackle it as a matter of urgency when we had the leeway to do so.  Had we not taken the budgetary action we took in 1983-84 we would not have been in a position to make the kind of progress we are now making.

      <P>I must ask for the forgiveness of the Chair for going off on a bit of a generality like that but Deputies opposite wanted to know why we have a 10 per cent rate of VAT on building.  I <Col N="1332" /> am telling the House that having a 10 per cent VAT rate on building is an essential and integral part of the restructuring of the VAT system.  If we are to have a simpler system which Deputies opposite have been asking for for quite a long time, if we are to have a system that has lower rates then one of the very few combinations we can have, given the Revenue requirements now, is 23 per cent, 10 per cent and zero.  If we are to move more things into zero, as Deputies opposite were proposing yesterday, or have a 5 per cent instead of a 10 per cent rate, we must accept the consequences. We either increase the 23 per cent rate or move more things out of zero and into charge.  That is the basic logic of having the system as we have it now.</P>

      <P>I have answered the questions put by Deputies Hilliard and <Col N="1333" /> O'Dea.  If Deputies opposite do not like the idea of the 10 per cent rate I must point out to them that although they had since 30 January, when it was announced, they have not come forward with a different proposal about a structure of VAT that would achieve the objectives they want in relation to the building industry and also avoid a different set of problems in any other part of the economy.  They have not faced that.  They talk constantly about tax reform, about the burden of taxation but they do not take any opportunity of putting up an alternative.  I am serious in saying that I have considered quite a number of different proposals&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is generally frivolous and he is now telling us that he is going to be serious for a change.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If Deputy O'Kennedy wants to amuse himself with these puerile verbal gymnastics I suggest he do it somewhere else because it is not getting us anywhere in the Chamber.  The structure we have arrived at is only one of quite a number of structures that we examined. We decided on this structure after close consideration of all the effects, not just of this one, but of the effects of the other possible ways of going about a rationalisation of the VAT system.  Having considered all that we came to a conclusion that this was the best way of doing it. This structure is one which on balance would be supported by the generality of opinion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies opposite have been referring to the position in the clothing and footwear industries.  One Deputy mentioned the case of Clarks.  He seemed to have inferred from my remarks on that case an opinion which he thinks I hold that the rate of VAT makes no difference to the Irish footwear industry.  That is not true.  What I was saying was that in the case of that firm &mdash; this is my information and, perhaps, it is not 100 per cent accurate &mdash; they were selling most of their output, if not all of it, on the UK market. It was the UK rate of VAT and the competitive position of the UK market that <Col N="1334" /> was of direct relevance to that firm.  The Irish footwear manufacturing industry in general exports, as far as I am aware, about 90 per cent of its output.  As far as Irish footwear manufacturers are concerned the rate of VAT here does not have much direct impact on them except on the cash flow question.  It is not the rate of VAT that the consumers of their products have to pay because they charge no VAT on their exports.  For those who are selling here the rate of VAT, of course, is a difficulty.  If one is looking at a group who are affected by a change in the rate of VAT on footwear it is to the retail sector one should look rather than to the industrial sector because most of the footwear bought here is imported.  I do not have the figure but the proportion is fairly high.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a matter about which the Minister should be concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>VAT is a consumer tax and it is one of several ways of getting the population in general to contribute the funds that are required to provide a given level of public services.  It comes from the population in general.  It does not come from the industry; it comes from the consumer. I am fully aware that the building industry has been in some difficulty for some time.  Deputies opposite may make what they like of that.  One of the greatest difficulties from which the industry has suffered has been the virtual collapse over the last couple of years of private sector demand.  I mentioned yesterday the level of Exchequer commitment to the building industry and I now have the figures.  In the public capital programme affecting the building industry total expenditure in 1984 was £1,166 million. For 1985 we project a figure of £1,233 million, an increase of £67 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Has the Minister the 1983 figures?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not the 1983 figures. The Exchequer funding part in 1984 was £868 million and in 1985 it will be £984 million, an increase of £116 million.  In <Col N="1335" /> 1985 the Exchequer will make available £116 million more than it did in 1984 for activity in the building industry.  The non Exchequer part of it is down by £49 million between these two years which is what gives us the net change of £67 million. The increased VAT on buildings in 1985 will amount to £36 million.  There is more expenditure there than extra VAT. Some 70 per cent of total demand for building and construction is funded from the public capital programme through Exchequer or non-Exchequer sources and that level has been holding up fairly well in recent years.  The deficiency is coming on the private side.  Somebody on the other side of the House said yesterday that building was a barometer of the economy.  I agree with that.  There is no way one can artificially stimulate the economy by stimulating building.  If one stimulates the economy it will inevitably stimulate demand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I was asked earlier on in a slightly disorderly <Col N="1336" /> interruption how Deputies opposite were proposing a reduction in VAT and then telling me that a reduction in one of the VAT rates that I introduced is something that they did not want because it helps the unregistered contractor.  They have not worked out the full logic of that position. Even with the changes made in the VAT system most building operators will be in a net VAT reclaim position.  They will claim more VAT on inputs than they are collecting on their outputs.  If that is the case there is not an advantage in the VAT system for the unregistered builder. If he is paying VAT on his inputs and not collecting VAT on his outputs he cannot be getting an advantage.  I concede that to the extent that he is not accounting for income tax or PRSI there is an advantage, but it does not arise in the VAT system.</P>

      <P>I note that Deputy O'Kennedy's amendments seek to include a number of items which are currently at 10 per cent at 5 per cent.  Perhaps Fianna Fáil did not make the point which would be more pertinent in that regard, which is that a whole series of services where there is a labour content such as the motor industry, television repairs and electrical work and so on suffers from black economy activities.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Fianna Fáil tend to suggest that we take in less VAT, but my point is that we should look at the 23 per cent band with a view to increasing it to 25 per cent on the basis of introducing a 5 per cent labour rate band.  If a garage owner who is in the VAT net paying the tax is competing with a nixer guy, both pay VAT on their materials.  The higher the VAT rate on materials the greater the incentive to become registered because VAT will become a higher percentage of <Col N="1337" /> turnover.  On the other side, the VAT on labour rates should be reduced.  Seeing that we have had an ongoing debate about the rates of VAT, with the Commission on Taxation suggesting one rate at about 14½ per cent and the Minister finally settling for a three rate system of VAT, would the Minister consider in the longer term, instead of getting one single rate and instead of taking less VAT receipts as Deputy O'Kennedy would wish, going for a 25 or 26 per cent goods rate and a 5 per cent labour rate?  For instance, for agricultural contractors machinery is a very expensive item and there is an onus to get registered, and the higher the rate the greater is the onus. At the moment people who have one tractor, one combine and so on for their own use are allowing their sons to use it for hire work and they are undercutting legitimate operations.  The same goes for TV repairs and so on.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</P>
      <P>My Department, An Comhairle Oiliúna Talmhaíochta, An Foras Talúntais and the Industrial Development Authority provide a range of aids and services to promote the production, marketing and processing of fruit and vegetables.</P>
      <P>The Horticultural Development Group have examined the sector and have produced several reports with recommendations and guidelines for future development.  Some of these have already been adopted and others are under consideration.  Financial aids are now available from my Department for setting up producer groups for fruit and vegetables and also for the appointment of market co-ordinators for glasshouse crops.  Recently I announced aids for the conversion of glasshouse heating from oil to solid fuel as well as for greater co-ordination and co-operation in the production and marketing of horticultural crops.</P>
      <P>These measures provide a framework for progress but development and expansion must depend largely on the initiative and efforts of the horticultural sector itself.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The Horticultural Development Group, who were set up by us, have examined the sector and have produced several reports with recommendations and guidelines for future development of the industry.  Some of these have already been adopted and others are under consideration. <Col N="1339" /> Financial aids are now available from my Department for setting up producer groups for fruit and vegetables and also for market co-ordination for glasshouse crops.

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that aids have been and are available for the horticultural sector, but I am talking about the expansion of the horticultural sector, particularly with the new and very welcome emphasis on the development of the processing industry.  I presume that in that industry food processing means all foods, not just beef etc.  Therefore, I assume that there will be new emphasis on the processing of fruit in the horticultural sector.  Is there any new thinking regarding expansion to ensure that they will be able to avail of this, which is coming from the IDA interest in food processing?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The acreage under vegetables generally has been on the up and up and we have high degree of selfsufficiency in many products such as carrots, cabbage, lettuce, turnips and main crop tomatoes.  Marketing needs to be improved.  I have had talks with the IFA groups and others with a view to setting up a sort of national horticultural grouping for which grant aid will be provided, somewhat similar to the national potato co-operative.  The idea is that we co-ordinate all the various sides of the industry together and even try to tie in the supermarkets and shops generally, but first try to determine the size of the market and how we will go about supplying as much as we can of it with the sort of products we are capable of growing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the processing side of it.  We had a setback in the seventies with international competition.  The big black spot there is frozen french fries as in chips running up to £30 million.  We are looking at the possibility of that type <Col N="1340" /> of facility coming in here.  At the moment the process of assessing the market, not only here but in the UK and France also, is taking place.  The trouble about this type of industry is that it must be so big by its nature that the market here would be only a starting point.  It would have to be in the process of exporting very substantial quantities of their product. We have very successful mushroom processing in Monaghan and a frozen chips plant in Donegal, expansion at Batchelors and the revitalised takeover of the Erin Foods plant in Midleton which is going quite well.  They have created a pretty substantial outlet for Irish crops, and I can say that other processing projects are being explored.  Production of strawberries could hardly be called processing, but the Wexford people over the years have co-operated very successfully in strawberry growing with people in the jams business both here and abroad.  I suppose it is a form of processing.  The produce is put into barrels, SO2 is added and the product can be held indefinitely. About 1,200 acres are under strawberries and with Sunfresh they are doing quite well.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister of State agree that, despite what he has said, there is a need for a proper and co-ordinated approach towards the development of vegetable production?

      <P>I think I can resolve the Deputy's problem in one sentence.  The horticultural development group sat and produced a report which has been studied by the Department, and we are acting on it.  One of the main proposals was the setting up of some sort of co-ordinated approach to the industry.  We are now dealing with the industry itself in all its aspects in the hope of setting up a co-ordinated group that will take in all facets of the industry.  We are grant-aiding this type of proposal and we hope to have the results in the not too distant future.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West)</i> asked the Minister for Agriculture the amounts of food processing grants approved and the amounts taken up by Irish applicants under the FEOGA scheme of the EC since the fund was established; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Grants amounting to £87 million have been awarded to Irish firms under the FEOGA scheme of grants for projects related to the processing and marketing of agricultural products under Regulations 17/64 and 355/77 since 1973. <Col N="1343" /> Approximately £42 million has been taken up by Irish firms to date.  Grants amounting to £8 million have been either renounced or cancelled for various reasons and most of these have been reallocated to other Irish firms.  Claims for a further £7 million have been lodged recently with the IDA and the EC Commission and should be paid out shortly. This leaves £30 million to be claimed and a large proportion of this relates to grants awarded in 1983 and 1984.</P>
      <P>While the take-up of funds is not entirely satisfactory, it should be appreciated that many of the projects aided involve significant investment and take several years to complete.  Work has commenced on most of the projects and I expect that the grants will be claimed over the next few years.</P>
      <P>While the firms have five years in which to complete their projects it is the practice for my Department and the IDA to encourage them to submit their claims as rapidly as possible and the take-up of funds has improved significantly in recent years.  However, the final responsibility for claiming the grants awarded rests with the individual firms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe I could admonish them to get on with the job.  Some of these projects are very substantial and involve several stages of progress, depending on the expansion of the industry.  Obviously the firms will put in only what they need in a particular year. For instance, if a company get into economic difficulties they might cancel a project or, because of changing economic and agricultural conditions, if there was a reduction in cattle numbers they might not require the original amount.  Apart from admonishing them I cannot do anything.</P>

Among many other things, the regulation included measures to encourage the greater use of AI.  The subsidy amounted to £4.94 for the first insemination for beef breeds.  Reimbursement from FEOGA was at the rate of 50 per cent.</P>
      <P>The programme was subsequently extended to 30 April and it then terminated. Expenditure on the basis of the rate of £4.94 amounted to over £6 million per annum.  In June 1984 the Government authorised the continuation of the subsidy at a reduced rate of £2.50.

Every six months the EC are implementing new grading systems and new price systems.  If our farmers cannot produce the quality cattle needed for that market, they will be out of pocket.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 15 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>There is considerable scope for increased production in the sheep and wool sector.  The various schemes operated by my Department and by the advisory, training and research services take account of the economic importance of wool production.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>About 80 per cent of the Irish wool clip is exported and prices paid to producers are generally in line with, or above, <Col N="1360" /> guideline prices which are based on information from the main world wool markets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>What percentage of the home market needs is being supplied from Irish produced wool and approximately what quantity is imported?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to give off the cuff figures in that respect.  Broadly, about 80 per cent of our wool is exported in unscoured form.  It is bought by overseas wool people and because of its high quality is mixed with New Zealand wool in a scouring process.  The product then finds its way into various markets.  While it might appear that we are importing fairly substantial quantities of wool, the reality is that our wool, especially wool produced from Galway Cheviot and Suffolk fleeces, is at the top of the market and we are getting top prices for it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>My question relates to processing.  As a city Deputy I tabled the question merely to ascertain the thinking of the Minister and the Department in relation to wool production.  Am I to take it from the reply that at this stage in our development the Department continue to consider wool only as a by-product of the sheepmeat industry?  In other words, we produce mutton and we happen to produce wool also as a byproduct. Is there any policy in the Department in regard to producing wool for the sake of wool production as is the case in Australia and other countries?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>The wool industry is controlled by private enterprise.  The people concerned are commanding the best possible price for their product and in return are paying the farmer the highest price possible for his product.  Regarding making suggestions to people in the industry, our consumption of wool is small in terms of the world market.  Our biggest usage of wool is in the manufacture of carpets but the people involved in that industry do not seek the higher quality wools and consequently they import wool of a lesser quality than that produced here.  As I have pointed out, our wool is processed to a special blend which fetches a high price on the market.</P>

      <P>Obviously the Department have no policy in this area. Why can we not produce the type of wool <Col N="1362" /> that the carpet manufacturers require instead of merely producing another type of wool which is exported?  Is there any co-ordinated plan for the production of the type of wool required at home?  What is the position now that the Wool Board have been abolished?</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <P>The functions of the Board were taken over by ACOT, and these, basically, were to help people produce a better fleece as well as educating people about how sheep should be shorn, how the wool should be wrapped and so on.  Regarding the first part of the question, fortunately for the Irish farmer perhaps, the type of wool we are producing is too good to use in the manufacture of carpets.  Consequently, we export a high quality product and import a lesser quality one.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture, in view of the fact that the scheme providing for new farm plans and supplement rises for farmers in the development category of the farm modernisation scheme expired on 31 December in line with EC Directive 159, the reason that the farm advisory services were not instructed to this effect until after 27 January; and if he will confirm suggestions that in the case of farm plans or supplementaries to existing farm plans approved during the intervening period no grant will be paid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton) Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Connaughton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 to 21 inclusive together.</P>
      <P>When Directive 72/159/EEC, on which the farm modernisation scheme is based, expired on 31 December 1984, ACOT were allowed to continue approving new plans.  This was in line with the practice adopted on two previous occasions when the directive expired.  On each occasion the directive was subsequently extended with retroactive effect so that expenditure on plans approved in the interval between the expiry and the subsequent extension of the directive qualified for FEOGA reimbursement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Towards the end of January 1985, the EC Commission advised member states that, as the directive had expired, there was no guarantee that expenditure by <Col N="1364" /> national authorities on new development plans would qualify for FEOGA reimbursement.</P>
    <P>In the light of this unprecedented development, the position was reviewed and it was decided to suspend forthwith the approval by ACOT of new development plans, including supplementary plans.  ACOT were notified to that effect on 28 January.</P>
    <P>Grants under plans, including supplementaries, approved in the period from 1 January 1985 to the date of receipt by the local ACOT office of the notice of suspension may be approved and paid in the normal way, as may grant-aid to farmers whose development plans were approved before 1 January 1985. Investments by farmers in the &ldquo;Commercial&rdquo; and &ldquo;Other&rdquo; categories were not affected by the suspension.</P>
    <P>The Council of Ministers recently decided to extend Directive 72/159 until 30 September 1985.  ACOT were accordingly authorised to recommence, as from 1 April 1985, the approval of new development plans and of supplementary investment under existing plans.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JoeWalsh" hpid="Mr. J. Walsh Mr. J. Walsh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Walsh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister of State yet in a position to tell me when farmers who have been denied grant-aid for development under Directive 72/159, because of the prior written approval clause, will be paid?  The Minister said two weeks ago that he expected to make an announcement to that effect in a couple of weeks.</P>

      <P>As proposed in <i>Building on Reality,</i> a review is being carried out on the role and functions of ACOT and the Farm Development Service in the operation of farm investment programmes to achieve the most effective use of the manpower available.  This review is being carried out by officials of my Department who are in consultation with ACOT on some aspects.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> Could the Minister indicate the difference between the review as between ACOT and AFT on one hand and the FDS on the other?  In other words, one is an outside body and the other is an internal review. Why the difference?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as this review is concerned, every farmer would be aware, as has been stated in this House on more than one occasion over the years, that there was a cumbersome enough system of determining eligibility, on one hand by the advisory service and on the other the role of the FDS as being the agents for the financial involvement. That is something that I am deeply interested in and I am trying to get a system under the new national scheme, to be introduced later this year, to ensure that there will be less bureaucracy than was involved in the last scheme.  That is basically what this is for.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>Aid is available under the farm modernisation scheme for the construction of new farm buildings including pig housing.  Aid is also available for the conversion of existing buildings to certain other uses, such as pig housing, provided the structure is sound, warrants conversion and, with certain limited exceptions relating to cattle housing and silage storage, has not previously been aided under the scheme.  Similarly, aid is available for converting existing piggeries to other uses, subject to the same requirements.  Aid is not available for the improvement or maintenance of existing farm buildings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusKirk" hpid="Mr. Kirk Mr. Kirk">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kirk</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Minister did not appreciate the thinking behind my question.  He will appreciate that there is considerable maintenance cost on existing piggeries.  The replacement of insulation, and wear and tear are very expensive.  Having regard to the fact that the industry has gone through a very difficult period over the last 18 months, many in it feel that, with the change of design and improvement in production techniques and so forth, the cost involved in the internal renovation of many of these piggeries, built ten or 12 years ago, is too expensive.  To improve the efficiency, a grant scheme to assist and encourage would be more than welcome and certainly very useful to the people in the industry.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>While grant aid is not available generally for former &ldquo;Other Low&rdquo; farmers under the revised farm modernisation scheme, some farmers in the west of Ireland below the development level who follow an improvement plan designed to increase beef and sheep output, may be eligible for grant aid for buildings for livestock and fixed equipment. This aid is available under the orientation of production element of the Programme for Western Development. In view of the limited resources available it is not possible at this time to provide investment aid to &ldquo;Other Low&rdquo; farmers outside the west of Ireland.</P>
      <P>The position of &ldquo;Other Low&rdquo; farmers is being reviewed in the context of the implementation of the new agricultural structures policy agreed at the Council of Ministers meeting on the 11 and 12 March 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>I always appear to be at one with Deputy Noonan on that. I have a desire to see low cost housing being grant-aided, provided it stands up to certain specifications, for obvious reasons.  I intend under the new scheme to launch a policy that will result in more of this country's cattle being housed during the winter, something we would all like to see.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PaulConnaughton" hpid="Mr. Connaughton Mr. Connaughton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connaughton</NameTxt>
      <P>When an inspection visit was made on 15 January 1985 in <Col N="1368" /> response to an application received on 9 January, it was found that the cow byre for which application had been made had already been erected.  It is a condition of the farm modernisation scheme that grant-aid is not payable for items of work carried out without the prior written approval of the Farm Development Service. Consequently, the cow byre is not eligible for aid.</P>
      <P>Approval has been issued for the other items applied for, namely, a manure pit, cattle enclosure, including cattle crush, and concrete yard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JoeJMcCartin" hpid="Mr. McCartin Mr. McCartin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCartin</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the Minister's reply, but this is part of a very serious problem which has arisen in very recent years, particularly in the west. Would the Minister consider, where farm development is carried out in accordance with good farming practice, the work is properly done and is part of an overall farm development plan, for the sake of the completion of a small formality that the small farmer should not be denied grant assistance?  Would he agree that this is a little harsh?  I know that it has been happening in recent years, not just while the present Minister has been in office, but would it be too much that the Minister ask his civil servants to apply some discretion in this area and not enforce the letter of the law, with such serious consequences to small farmers?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputies will have heard with regret of the kidnapping in Beirut yesterday morning of Mr. Aidan Walsh, Deputy Director of UNRWA, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency which was established in 1949 to assist Palestinian refugees.  The Government are extremely concerned and appalled at this action against an Irishman working for an international organisation whose only role is the provision of humanitarian assistance to refugees in Lebanon and every effort is being made to secure Mr. Walsh's release.  For the information of the House, the following are the facts of the kidnapping as conveyed to me by our Ambassador in Beirut and by UNRWA.</P>
      <P>The kidnapping occurred at 7.15 a.m. local time, on the morning of 15 May while Mr. Walsh was being driven to work.  His car was stopped in Raouche in West Beirut close to where he was living by two other cars with eight armed men. They broke the windscreen of the car, pointed a gun at the head of the driver and took away Mr. Walsh.  The driver, a Palestinian, was not taken.  Up to the present time no group has claimed responsibility for the kidnapping.</P>
      <P>Every effort is being made by both UNRWA, which has primary responsibility for Mr. Walsh's safety, and by our embassy in Beirut to obtain Mr. Walsh's release.  Contact has been made by the embassy with the Lebanese Government and with as many as possible of the militia groups operating in West Beirut.  These efforts are continuing.  The groups contacted so far have denied any knowledge of Mr. Walsh's whereabouts.  In the situation that prevails in West Beirut at present, where renewed intercommunal fighting has been taking place for the last three weeks, it is not useful at this stage to speculate about which group is responsible for or the motivation for Mr. Walsh's kidnapping.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Prime Minister of Lebanon, Mr. Karami, telephoned our Ambassador in <Col N="1371" /> Beirut this morning to express his regret and sorrow at the kidnapping of Mr. Walsh and assured him that they were taking every step they could to have Mr. Walsh found and released.  Our Permanent Representative to the United Nations has been in touch with the Secretary General of the United Nations who himself has expressed his concern and outrage at Mr. Walsh's kidnapping.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, kidnappings of foreign nationals are a frequent occurrence in Beirut.  This, however, is the first occasion on which an Irish citizen has been kidnapped.  At this stage it is assumed that his kidnapping relates to his position as deputy director of UNRWA rather than to his nationality and there is no reason to believe that other Irish citizens in Lebanon are in greater danger than they have been in up to now.  No threats have been made against Irish citizens or embassy staff in Lebanon and there is general goodwiLl towards the Irish in that country, particularly because of our participation in UNIFIL.  Nevertheless, officers of our embassy in Beirut are taking precautions for their safety.</P>
    <P>Mr. Walsh is the second UNRWA official to be kidnapped in recent months. On 25 March, a British UNRWA official, Mr. Alec Collett, was kidnapped and is still being held.  A video of Mr. Collett has recently been sent to the UN which indicated that he was still alive and in good health.  We have, of course, been in contact with the authorities of the UK and of other countries whose nationals have been kidnapped in Beirut.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister say if there is any clear indication or even a suspicion as to which group may be involved in the kidnapping?  Does he consider there are any steps which the Government can take directly to secure the release of Mr. Walsh?  In addition, will he state if there are any steps being taken by the United Nations to protect their officials who are involved in aid work in Beirut and in Lebanon in general?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The answer to the first <Col N="1372" /> part of the question is no.  We have no indication or suspicion of who is involved. I understand that within the last hour the PLO issued a statement saying they had no responsibility for or any knowledge of what occurred yesterday morning.  I have not seen the statement.  I have just heard about it in the past few minutes.  Of course we have been in touch with the United Nations.  We have an extremely good embassy staff in Beirut who have many contacts in the city and these officials have been endeavouring to make contact with individual groups in Lebanon to find out if we can get any information regarding the whereabouts of Mr. Walsh.  So far we have been unsuccessful in that regard.  The United Nations take precautions.  They are extremely concerned for the safety of their employees in Lebanon and they have provided what protection they think necessary in the situation.  They have also provided advice regarding the various officials and their families who are stationed in Lebanon.</P>

      <P>I am glad this House has given an opportunity to the Minister to come here and inform us officially with regard to the situation.  I accept that he is bound to have only limited knowledge available to him now.  The fact that this matter is being discussed here highlights internationally the concern of all Irish people with regard to the kidnapping of Mr. Walsh and for his family in Ireland. I know that the Minister will continue with his efforts in this matter.  He can be assured of the full support of this side of the House in whatever efforts he has to make.  Perhaps through our embassy he would re-establish contact with the Lebanese Government and with the other militia in the area and inform them of the unanimous concern of the Members of this House, representing the Irish people, regarding the treatment of our citizen, Mr. Walsh.  I know the Minister will join with me in hoping that Mr. Walsh is in good health and will be released as soon as possible.</P>

I believe it was as a result of the strong representations we made to the Lebanese Government that the Prime Minister rang our Ambassador this morning to convey his abhorrence at what had occurred yesterday. As I said, we have extremely good officers in the embassy in Beirut and they have many local connections.  Through them we are trying to establish whatever contact is possible with the various groups in the city to get any information regarding the whereabouts of Mr. Walsh.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned our debate I was outlining the many options that can be considered in a restructure of the number of rates of VAT and I was saying that my personal preference would be that there would be a labour or service rate of VAT which would be somewhere around 5 per cent, that the materials rate would be increased from 23 per cent to 25 per cent, 26 per cent or whatever was necessary.  In that way one would be dealing in a dual way with nixers and the black economy by virtue of the differential in the labour rate being minimised, and because the materials would be more <Col N="1428" /> expensive, they would be obliged to be registered.</P>
      <P>I want to make three other points briefly.  First, Deputy O'Kennedy has lost sight of the fact that he has shifted the winning post in this debate.  I remember very clearly that on the Finance Bill last year he was berating the Minister about the need for the rationalisation of the rates and the cross-Border situation. When the Minister moved from those, the winning post is shifted to the other areas.</P>
      <P>In relation to the 2.2 per cent VAT refund for farmers, it is my personal view &mdash; I think one shared by a great number of farmers &mdash; that they would rather see that refund abolished than have a new imposition like the land tax with all its added administrative costs.</P>
      <P>The other point I wanted to make in relation to VAT <i>vis-à-vis</i> its effect on small businesses and retailers is that in Belgium they have a sales or equalisation tax under which the retailer's margin is not liable to VAT.  This means that the retailer is placed in the position that the consumer is now in, that when they buy from the manufacturer, the supplier or wholesales they pay the VAT and their margin is not liable to VAT.</P>
      <P>I might say that because there are such large quantities of footwear, including Clarks, and clothing imported, that is not necessarily all bad news for the indigenous footwear and clothing industries, because VAT was increased by 2 per cent.  It should be remembered that VAT is imposed at the point of entry and will affect the cash flow of importers and those agencies rather than the indigenous sector.</P>

      <P>I promised Deputy <Col N="1429" /> Yates &mdash; in as much as that I am responding to this debate &mdash; that when someone, like myself, with a more open mind than the Minister, assumes his responsibility I will certainly take full account of the points he has argued with such persuasion. The reality is that anything that penalises employment, anything that encourages the black economy &mdash; as he has been underlining &mdash; is something that we should not alone discourage but, where possible, avoid by way of incentives of the kind he has mentioned.  It is certainly something worth looking at. But I have to tell Deputy Yates that, until such time as I have had an opportunity of considering it in my Ministerial capacity, he has little prospect of having the amendment adopted at this point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Nonetheless I shall take a note of what the Deputy has said and will bear it in mind, promising action at the earliest possible date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I noted that the Minister's contribution on this issue steered clear of the major burden of the case we made, namely, the economic implications for the building industry and the economy generally.  He will recall that we referred to the numbers unemployed in the building sector at 50,000.  He will recall also that we referred to the cost of unemployment benefits for that number of the order of £110 million per annum.  We referred to all of these as being major implications, not just for that sector but for the economy generally.  For that reason I cannot say that the Minister's response was anything like adequate.  I might be permitted to say that the Minister's response was confined almost, as it inevitably tends to be, to pointing out, as he sees himself from his omniscience, the lack of comprehension, of understanding, of knowledge and expertise on this side of the House on the part of myself or my colleagues. <Col N="1430" /> Some time back there was a wise old philosopher called Socrates who said that the beginning of knowledge was to recognise the extent of one's ignorance. On the basis of the omniscience, or the subjective opinion, of the Minister as to his knowledge and our ignorance, I have to say that it will be a very considerable time before the Minister even begins on the road to knowledge.  Not until such time as he begins to reflect on the old Socratic concept of where real knowledge begins &mdash; namely, recognising the extent of one's own ignorance &mdash; will he spend less time pointing out the extent of ours.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>At least, if they are, it means we have begun to know but, for those who know it all already, there is a long road to travel before they begin to know.  I would commend to the Minister, in this and any other discussion, that he might not confine himself to pointing out from his heavenly pinnacle the inadequacies of those of us who make points on this side of the House, our lack of knowledge or comprehension as the case might be.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That being said I might comment on some of the points the Minister has made. The increase in the public capital programme affecting building this year is of the order of 5½ per cent in nominal terms over last year.  When one deducts the value-added charges from this, the actual increase represents less than 3 per cent, approximately 2.9 per cent over the public capital programme, affecting the building industry which had already been reduced last year.  That is clearly a reduction in real terms.  The Minister had to acknowledge that the real problem was in the private housebuilding sector.  In <Col N="1431" /> the course of his examination of this sector the Minister might also look at another implication&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said the problem was wider than that, not just private dwellings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not say &ldquo;not just&rdquo;.  I pointed out yesterday that it is clearly obvious in the commercial sector where the throughput this year is estimated to be approximately 8 per cent to 9 per cent less than last year.  Therefore it is not confined to the private housebuilding sector but it is particularly acute in that sector.  If the Minister thinks it is any consolation to the construction industry to have it established by him that it is not confined to the private house sector only, I am prepared to allow him that point.  Certainly the desert is very much more extensive than that as far as the construction industry is concerned. We are talking about an increase of 2.9 per cent over last year, already a year in which the public capital programme affecting the housing industry was very much reduced.</P>
      <P>The Minister talked in terms of the costs as he estimated them.  Those are merely slide rule figures calculated on the basis of bringing in the blackboard and getting a total at the end.  There is a little more to it than that.  I might suggest this basic consideration to the Minister, that a VAT charge will yield no revenue &mdash; no matter at what point it is fixed &mdash; on companies gone into liquidation.  Might I suggest to the Minister that, when he is bringing in the blackboard giving us lessons over here, he might consider that the calculations and the issues to which the professor addresses himself would be affected to a great extent by the simple fact that a number of those who would&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We will all be rushing to register.  The Minister suggested that the representatives of the building industry were much more sharp in their presentation than we were.  There is a very good reason for that.  They have been meeting the Minister over the past few months and they know of their own experience.  We can only speak on the basis of what they convey to us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any increase in VAT will yield no revenue from companies going out of business. I recommend the Minister to consult with the Revenue Commissioners after the passage of this legislation and ask them for a general picture of the returns for those engaged in the building sector &mdash; contractors, sub-contractors and agricultural contractors.  He will find that those who are not being prosecuted by the Revenue Commissioners are in a very serious state.  If that does not illustrate the case we are making, nothing will.  I do not have the information available to me but I know from the case made <Col N="1433" /> to Opposition Deputies and to me as spokesman that a very considerable number of these people are in great difficulty. VAT charges on people going out of business yield no revenue.</P>
    <P>The Minister said that the cost of adopting our amendment would be £54 million in a full year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the figure for 1985. Otherwise it would be over £100 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let us accept the figure of £54 million for 1985, although it is questionable since the Minister has indicated that the restoration of the 5 per cent rate on building would lose £36 million to the revenue.  That is not the case.  The Minister seems to be assuming that all of those who are now in business would be contributing through VAT this year.  I have some bad news for him.  They will not be doing so throughout the year and the figures should be revised downwards.</P>

      <P>The level will drop considerably during the year.  If it is the case that £36 million of the £54 million would be associated with a reduction in VAT on building, that leaves only £18 million for the reductions we propose on clothing and footwear.  It is very significant that a 2 per cent reduction on clothing and a 5 per cent reduction on footwear would cost only £18 million.  Since these are universal consumer goods, I would have thought that the amount would be somewhat more.</P>

Is é tuairim páirtí Fhianna Fáil agus mo thuairim féin go bhfuil áit faoi leith ag cursaí iománaíochta &mdash; ní amháin i gcúrsaí spóirt ach i gcúrsaí cúltúir.  Is é mo thuairim féin go bhfuil baint daingean ag an gcluiche seo le cúrsaí ar fud na tíre, ar fud na tuaithe, sna bailte móra agus i ngach aon áit san tír.  Ag caint mar dhuine a bhí in a iománaí uair amháin, tamaillín ó shin, sílim gurb é seo an spórt is aicillí ar domhan.  Einne a raibh baint aige leis an spórt seo agus a bhí seans aige bheith ag féachaint ar Thiobraid Árainn, Corcaigh, Loch Garmain, Cill Choinnigh, bhí gach éinne díobh ar aon mheas.  Fiú amháin is cuimhin liom uair amháin a tháinig Leas-Uachtarán Choimisiún na hEorpa anseo, Francois-Xavier Ortoli <Col N="1435" /> agus shocraigh mé go mbeadh suíochán aige i bPáirc an Chrócaigh don chluiche ceannais iománaíochta agus tar éis bheith ag brath ar an chluiche sin, dúirt sé gurb é an cluiche is fearr a chonaic sé riamh in aon áit sa domhan.</P>

Tá a fhios agam nach bhfuil costas mór ag baint leis seo.  Tá a fhios agam go mbeadh costas mór ag baint leis dá mba rud é go mbeadh ar an Aire an rud céanna a dhéanamh do gach aon spórt eile: tennis, cricket agus mar sin de. Ceapaim féin go bhfuil an ceart ag an Aire anois agus an ceart ag gach Aire Airgeadais an rún seo a ghlacadh, agus roimh chríochnú, más rud é go bhfuil an tAire chun a chur in iúl domsa anois nár dhein mé féin aon rud, ba mhaith liom a rá roimh ré go ndearna mé rud antábhachtach i dtaobh an rúin seo nuair a bhí mé i mo Aire Airgeadais.  Ní raibh mé in ann, leis an moladh a cuireadh ós mo chomhair, an VAT a aistriú ach fuair mé amach ó na Coimisinéirí Iomcaim an costas a bheadh ann dá nglacfaí leis an rún.  Séard a rinne mé ná gur thug mé deontas den mhéid céanna do Chumann Lúthchleas Gael chun an cluiche seo a chur chun cinn ar fud na tíre.  Sin an fáth go bhfuil mé ag moladh an rúin seo arís i mbliana.  Tá súil agam, os rud é nach bhfuil an tAire sásta glacadh leis, go mbeidh seans agam sar i bhfad é a dhéanamh agus beidh mé ag déanamh rud éigin fónta ar son cúrsaí spóirt agus cúrsaí cúltúrtha na hÉireann.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has made the case most eloquently for reducing VAT on hurleys.  Hurling, our national game, is artistic and is a part of the Irish culture.  It should be treated as exceptional.  The cost of an adult's hurley is £10 which includes about £2 VAT. Taking into consideration that five or six hurleys may be broken in one game one can see that the cost to any club is enormous. The danger is that with increased costs hurling will become a dying art.  I should like to request the Minister, whose father got some of his earlier education in Dongourney, where I am sure he heard people talk about hurling because they won some All-Irelands in the early days&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am sure the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, who comes from the Premier County whose teams have won many All-Ireland championships, will <Col N="1437" /> appreciate what we are trying to do in having VAT removed from hurleys.  We hear a lot of talk about our national games and the protection of our heritage and culture but the imposition of a 23 per cent VAT rate on hurleys is a penal charge.  It is affecting the running cost of clubs throughout the country.  It is possible that the Minister never played hurling and does not appreciate how hurling clubs operate but I can tell him that most clubs spend between £5,000 and £6,000 annually on hurleys.  They cost £10 each and £2 or £2.50 of that is VAT. That is ridiculous.  Our national game of hurling is accepted as being the greatest field game in the world and many countries would give a lot to have their own field game.  However, in Ireland we penalise our national field game.</P>
      <P>The Minister should give serious consideration to our proposal.  Clubs are operating on a shoestring.  There appears to be an opinion abroad that the GAA are a wealthy organisation.  There may be wealth in Croke Park but in the half-parishes and urban areas they are not wealthy.  Those clubs are barely surviving. They are trying to buy hurleys and pay other expenses from limited resources. I do not make any apology to anybody for saying that the greatest social workers we have are the officials who run the GAA clubs.  Those involved spend many hours on a voluntary basis catering for the under 14s, under 16s and under 18s.  They train those children and transport them in their own vehicles to games, paying for the petrol themselves.  However, at the end of the day the Minister, and the Government, ask those clubs to pay 23 per cent VAT on hurleys.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister is being very unfair to those voluntary workers.  He should give serious consideration to removing VAT on hurleys and give clubs a decent chance to provide hurleys.  Unemployment is rampant and we are encouraging people to join clubs and organisations but we are not doing anything to help the one organisation we should be encouraging people to join, the GAA.  Parents cannot afford to purchase hurleys and clubs are finding it difficult to do so.  The Minister <Col N="1438" /> should give clubs a decent chance to protect our greatest national game, hurling.</P>

      <P>Bhí saghas ionaidh orm gur thosaigh an Teachta O'Kennedy ag labhairt as Gaeilge.  Tar éis na díospóireachta a bhí againn an bhliain seo caite bhí mé ag súil go mbeadh sé ag labhairt as Iodailís no Fraincís mar a rinne sé ar feadh cúpla noiméad an bhliain seo caite. Caithfidh mé a rá i dtosach báire nach bhfuil pionós ar bith á chur agam ar iomaníocht, chamáin no chlubanna de shaghas ar bith ar fud na tíre.  Cosúil le gach earra a cheannaíonn muintir na tíre seo tá cáin bhreisluacha ar chamáin.  Is mar sin atá. Dá mhéad rudaí a fhágaimid as an gcóras is mó a bheadh an ráta cánach ar na rudaí atá istigh sa chóras.  Baineann an prionsabal sin le gach cuid den chóras. Baineann sé le camáin, lasáin agus gach aon rud eile.</P>
      <P>Níl pionós ar bith á chur agam ar chámáin.  Is é a mhalairt de scéal atá againn an bhliain seo mar go bhfuil an cháin ar na camáin á laghdú agam ó 35 faoin gcéad go dtí 23 faoin gcéad.  Is leor sin chun laghdú 9 faoin gcéad a dhéanamh ar na praghsanna.  Níl a fhios agam an bhfuil laghdú tagtha ar na praghsanna ó thosach mhí Márta go dtí seo.  B'fhéidir go bhfuil eolas ar leith ag an Teachta O'Kennedy nó ag duine éigin den bheirt chara no heavies atá aige don díospóireacht seo.  Níor chuala mé go raibh laghdú ar bith ar na praghsanna ach tá laghdú ar an gcáin.</P>
      <P>Faoi mar a dúirt mé inné bheadh deacrachtaí áirithe ann ó thaobh an Chomhphobail Eorpaigh de ráta zero a chur ar chamáin.  Tá sé raite go fírinneach ag an Teachta O'Kennedy agus ag an Teachta Ahern gur féidir cúpla camán a bhriseadh i rith cluiche ach is mar sin atá d'earraí spóirt go forleathan.  Tá rudaí eile a chailltear nó a bhristear i rith cluichí mar shampla, liathróidí gailf.  Níl a fhios agam cé mhéad liathróidí gailf a chaill an Teachta Ahern nó an Teachta O'Kennedy le deanaí ach tá siadsan daor go leor de réir mar a deirtear liom.  Níl an t-am agam bheith ag gabháil de ghalf.  B'fhearr liom rudaí eile a dhéanamh.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 45, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(c) magazines;&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment is to apply the same rate of VAT to magazines as to newspapers. The House welcomed the decision of the Minister to reduce the level of VAT on newspapers.  The producers of magazines now find themselves at a severe disadvantage <i>vis-à-vis</i> newspapers.  Most people employed in the magazine industry do similar work and have similar qualifications to those employed in the newspaper industry.  The same level of VAT should apply to both industries because the industries are similar.  Whether people read the old philosophers, biographies or autobiographies, I hope they will read them with an inquiring mind and will not always take as a fact everything that is written in a magazine or a newspaper. Sometimes one can learn a lot from an old man or woman down the country who will never be quoted in a newspaper or a magazine.  However, the general contribution of newspapers and magazines is towards the dissemination of information and knowledge.  I do not see why there is any distinction to be made between the newspaper industry and the magazine industry.  The revenue implications of equalising the VAT would not be considerable so I would press the Minister to respond positively to our amendment.</P>

Mar is eol don Teachta, tá an ráta cháin bhreisluacha ar nuachtáin íslithe ó 23 faoin gcéad go dtí 10 faoin gcéad agus rinneamar é sin chun teacht i gcabhair ar na nuachtáin laethúla <Col N="1440" /> agus seachtainiúla mar go raibh deacrachtaí faoi leith á bhfulaingt ag na nuachtáin sin.  Ní mar an gcéanna an cás ag na tréimhseacháin agus ceapaim gurb í aidhm an leasaithe seo ná an ráta céanna a chur ar fáil do na tréimhseacháin uile. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil aon deighilt á déanamh ag an Teachta O'Kennedy idir tréimhseacháin de shaghasanna éagsúla.

Níl sé sásta glacadh leis sin.  I am sorry he is not, but it comes as no <Col N="1441" /> great surprise and I hope that he will be able to convey to the people who wrote from the magazines to me as Béarla, as they did, the reasons for his refusal. When Cumann Lúthchleas Gael were in contact with me they were in contact with me as Gaeilge.  I trust they will understand the burden of what the Minister said here today.  I welcome the fact that at last I have stimulated the Minister to use his own language, which he uses rather well, rather than the reaction I got from him last year when he accused me of shamrockery when I used it.  Tá mé buíoch den Aire as sin ach níl aon bhuíochas eile agam dó.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:</P>
      <P>In page 52, to delete lines 31 to 40.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is vital that in the best interest of the future development of Bord Telecom Éireann this section be removed because <Col N="1442" /> it gives legal authority to proposals in the Government plan <i>Building on Reality</i> to extract £180 million from BTÉ.  I quote from <i>Building on Reality,</i> page 148, paragraph 7.80:</P>
    <P>The service will be required to pay its way on a commercial basis, including remunerating both the debt and equity capital.  In the short term, this will involve BTÉ being required to make contributions to the Exchequer of £50 million in 1985, £60 million in 1986 and £70 million in 1987.</P>
    <P>I am proposing to delete section 68 of the Finance Bill.  The inclusion of the section gives the Minister for Finance an open cheque to extract any amount of money from BTÉ, not just over the next three years as in <i>Building on Reality</i> but for all time.  Is the Minister aware that his policy has led to the proposed resignation of Mr. Tom Byrnes, Chief Executive of BTÉ from the end of May?  Indeed, there is much speculation that it will lead to further resignations from BTÉ in the very near future.  It should be noted that BTÉ were prepared to offer Mr. Byrnes a new seven year contract with effect from 1 June 1985.  Mr. Byrnes indicated that his acceptance of this further term as chief executive was contingent upon approval of the BTÉ corporate plan as formulated by the board and submitted to the Government in September 1984.  I call on the Government to accept this corporate plan because failure to do so will lead to failure of this young fledgling company. Fianna Fáil's position has always been that BTÉ will be expected to repay their investment to the Exchequer when they are in a position to do so &mdash; in other words, when the company are in a viable and satisfactory state of health.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister for Finance aware of the crisis in BTÉ in relation to the proposed levy of £180 million?  Is he aware that the company borrowed £180 million in 1984 for their capital programme and would be borrowing £160 million in 1985 and £130 million in 1986 at an interest rate of 14 per cent per annum to complete their capital investment programme?  It should also be noted that over £30 million <Col N="1443" /> allocated by the EC for telecommunications purposes in 1984 was retained by the Exchequer.  Surely the Minister for Finance is aware that BTÉ borrowed £250 million in 1984 and will have a trading loss estimated at £50 million in that year, 1984.  The Government received a total contribution of £94 million from BTÉ in 1984 and this already has resulted in increased telephone and telex charges.</P>
    <P>I take this opportunity of requesting members of the Labour Party to support this amendment as failure to do so will result in the following policy decisions for BTÉ: (1) massive redundancies among the 70,000 staff of BTÉ; (2) increased borrowing to provide levy for the Government; (3) an increase of approximately 25 per cent on telephone and telex charges.  All these options are totally unacceptable to Fianna Fáil and we will be voting against this section of the Finance Bill.  I remind the Minister also that Mr. Seamus de Paor, General Secretary of the Irish Post Office Engineering Union, speaking at their annual delegate conference in Killarney, as reported in the <i>Evening Press</i> of Wednesday, 15 May 1985, accused the Government of ripping off BTÉ and said that the union have pledged a campaign against the charges being imposed by the Minister for Finance at the rate of £180 million.  I quote the report:</P>
    <P>Mr. de Paor added a warning, that he intends to take legal action, &ldquo;if necessary, to restrain the board if they should decide to meet the Government's demands.&rdquo;  And he also warned that his union &mdash; the largest in Telecom Éireann &mdash; may eventually have to consider industrial action in a campaign of opposition to the Government's proposals.</P>
    <P>He said that under the 1983 Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, there is provision for repayment of certain advances to the Minister for Finance &mdash; the amount due was calculated in the region of £305 millions.</P>
    <P>Telecom Éireann will be in a very difficult position if the Minister persists in his <Col N="1444" /> present policy because the company are going through a very difficult time.  Under section 22 of the 1982 Postal and Telecommunications Services Act the Minister has powers to impose certain conditions but those powers would be discretionary in consultation with the board and the Minister for Communications who should be involved in this area. Section 68 of this Bill gives the Minister major powers to impose charges and there is no limit mentioned.  I would like the Minister to spell out exactly what his policy objectives are in relation to Telecom Éireann.  Is he aware of the widespread anxiety expressed by union representatives, by Mr. Tom Byrnes, Chief Executive of Telecom Éireann, who is resigning from the board of Telecom Éireann at the end of May and will be emigrating to America as a result of this Government's policies?  Is the Minister aware of the feeling among board members who are considering resigning from the board also as a result of this Government's policies?</P>
    <P>This is the first Finance Bill which contains provisions for raking off money from a semi-State body.  I cannot see any justification for including section 68 in this Bill, because under the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act there was provision for the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Communications, the sole shareholder, to take any steps necessary.  I think the Minister's next step will be the privatisation of Telecom Éireann. I would like him to confirm or deny that the Government are considering the privatisation of Telecom Éireann and endangering the future of 17,000 staff.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Those people were assured of continuity of secure employment on 1 January 1984, but that commitment has been broken because the company are being destroyed by this Government. There will be a collapse of the telephone and telex services as a result of the withdrawal of £180 million over the next three years from a service which should receive that type of investment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1445" /> Telecom Éireann are a fledgling company who are going in the right direction to make a tremendous success of the telecommunications area.  If the Minister has patience Telecom Éireann will return to the Exchequer the investment made over the last five or six years.  That is our view.  We are not going to force a levy on Telecom Éireann because this levy is a form of taxation by the backdoor on telephone and telex subscribers.  Instead of taking this money directly from the PAYE taxpayers, the Minister is imposing a tax on telephone and telex subscribers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy saying that we should put this tax on the PAYE taxpayers?  If that is what he is saying, he should put it on the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what I am saying.  The Minister is imposing a tax of £180 million on telephone and telex subscribers over the next three years. This is a dishonest way of imposing taxation. I am not in favour of further taxation; Fianna Fáil are in favour of reduced taxation.  The Minister is trying to destroy a young company and putting the jobs of 17,000 at risk.  Surely a man of Mr. Byrnes integrity, ability and commitment would not lightly give up his job and emigrate?  He is making this move because the Minister is making it impossible for Telecom Éireann to fulfil their commitment to provide telephones on demand.  The Minister is imposing a tax on subscribers which will make it impossible for Telecom Éireann to carry out their mandate to provide a modern and good telephone service.  Before the last general election the Coalition Government said they were against borrowing but were for fiscal management.  The Minister must be aware that the imposition of this levy will require Telecom Éireann to borrow money, to lay off staff or to increase charges.</P>

    <Col N="1446" />
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister wish Telecom Éireann to increase charges? Does he want them to borrow money or to lay off staff?  Will he please give a policy directive to the board of Telecom Eireann explaining how they are to raise this levy of £180 million over the next three years?  Will he say if there will be an increase in telephone charges, in voluntary redundancies or will he instruct the company to borrow this money?  Those policies would be against the best interests of the country and the Government. The Minister should study the submission made by the board of Telecom Éireann. They put forward a very comprehensive and corporate plan.  Did the Minister read that plan?  Did he study what they put forward in support of their case in relation to the removal of this levy?  I would like him to explain the situation to the House.</P>
      <P>I would like to mention one of the major statements made by Mr. Tom Byrnes at the opening of the Dun Laoghaire new digital E-10B exchange on Wednesday, 24 April 1985.  He said:</P>
      <P>In preparing Telecom Éireann's first Corporate Plan, which looks forward for the next five years, our aim was to take up where the previous programme left off and provide an average connection rate of over 60,000 lines per annum, equivalent to the average connection rate achieved during the past five years.</P>
      <P>Those connections were achieved under Fianna Fáil.</P>
      <P>Our goal was to do this with a real level of capital investment 60 per cent of that required in the preceding five years, representing a significant decrease in the borrowing requirement, which we expected to achieve through better management of our operations and finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We considered this goal realistic because we still have overall a very low level of telephone penetration in comparison with other OECD countries. Yet despite the fact that the Board of Telecom Éireann had decided <Col N="1447" /> on a substantially reduced investment programme, the overall capital investment allowed for the next three years for Telecom Éireann in the National Plan <i>Building on Reality</i> is only four fifths of what we, after careful consideration, proposed in our Corporate Plan.  This arbitrary reduction flies in the face of Ireland's obvious growth potential, the experience in other already well developed countries and the fact that the new technology incorporated in the exchange we formally open here today has a shorter working life, necessitating more frequent renewal, albeit at reducing cost per line, at an earlier time than was the case with previous telephone exchange equipment.</P>
    <P>He went on to explain why the levy is totally unacceptable.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to accept this amendment to delete the section which refers to the levy of £180 million and spell out his long term demands for Telecom Éireann.  I appeal to him to allow this company to succeed.  When they are in a position to refund the money to the Exchequer, it will be a very viable company. We are opposing the arbitrary charges being imposed without consultation because they would place the company in jeopardy.  The Minister will turn Telecom Éireann into a white elephant.  I hope he will have second thoughts and will withdraw this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to put on record my opposition to section 66 and to strongly support our spokesman on Finance. What is proposed is to help the Minister to cut down his deficit.  I had occasion to mention in the House that the <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> figures issued for May indicated that there was a deficit between receipts and expenditure of nearly £900 million.  This seems to be a dodge to get Telecom Éireann to borrow money to pay into the Exchequer to cut down the deficit with which the Minister is faced.  He has denied that he will introduce a second budget but the thrust of this amendment seems to be in that direction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1448" /> I got a great deal of job satisfaction prior to the setting up of Telecom Éireann. I had dealings with the chairman and the chief executive when settling the financial structures for the new organisation. I have never been so impressed by two people before in regard to their knowledge of what had to be done and their dedication to doing it.  The very fact that they were two people who had made such an impact in a free enterprise economy was highly consoling.  They were dedicating themselves to a semi-State company and laying down the guidelines for success in that regard.  I know that certain members of the Government, especially in Fine Gael, have developed an antipathy to semi-State bodies.  There is no question or doubt about that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson is the only person who believes that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have thought that the fact that these two men, Mr. Smurfit, as chairman, and Mr. Byrnes, as chief executive, who proved themselves in the marketplace and had an objective which they could achieve, was very consoling. The Minister's actions should be taken very seriously.  The fact that Mr. Byrnes is going is, as stated by Deputy Leyden, due directly to what the Minister has inserted in the Bill.  We never envisaged that Board Telecom Éireann would be cut loose from their responsibilities to the taxpayer and the whole scheme was sanctioned by the Fianna Fáil Government, as were the financial structures, with the intention of gaining from Telecom Éireann when it came into profit. The potential was and is great but, if a number of millstones are tied around their necks, we will be back to where we were before.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even at this late stage, we would appreciate the Minister yielding on this. We established the whole financial structure, debt equity ratio, etc. and I had the privilege of bringing the Bill through its Second Reading in the House.  It was launched by my successor, Deputy Mitchell, with the same understanding, as far as I could make out, with regard to <Col N="1449" /> the work that we had done when he took over for Committee and subsequent Stages.  At that time, we knew through dealing with the trade unions, specifically one major technical trade union, that they had great hopes for the new company. Morale is now very low.  They know they are losing the chief executive and although they will tell you he was a tough man, they felt that he knew what he was doing and would make a success of it. By withdrawing this section, the Minister could restore morale to the workforce, allow the board of Telecom Éireann to develop the plan which they outlined to the Minister for Communications and, indirectly, to the Minister for Finance, and bring us into an era in which we could hold up our heads proudly in the OECD and eleswhere as a country with a developed communications system.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the two previous speakers on this side of the House with regard to the Government's handling of Telecom Éireann.  When I mentioned this matter to the Minister on Tuesday he said he would comment on it but, unfortunately, we do not have much time left.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Posts and Telegraphs was split up during my period of office and it was agreed that that was the right thing to do because these two areas should be run on a commercial basis and taken out of the arm of State.  Two excellent boards were set up with very good executives and we were very lucky to find executives of such a calibre.  There is a great deal of talk at present about people in semi-State bodies not being fit for their jobs but that accusation cannot be levelled at either of those two boards.  It saddens me that the Government have now changed course.  Perhaps the Minister could explain how he can make a levy a dividend.  Dividends are paid out of profits.  In this case, the Minister and the Government are trying to label it a dividend to pay back for the investment which has been put into it.  If you want to get dividends from an investment, you must wait until the company show a <Col N="1450" /> profit.  This organisation, which has been doing a very good job, will now become demoralised.  To get the amount of money required &mdash; about £180 million &mdash; Telecom Éireann must borrow.  This, in effect, means that you are strangling them before they start and, eventually, they will end up like CIE.  Has the Minister any idea of the enormous job that had to be done in motivating that organisation, after a very long strike, to bring us into the telecommunications age of the eighties and nineties?  Lack of good telecommunications was one of the major elements holding back industrial development. The Minister is now undermining all that work because he needed the sum of £180 million for the national plan. As Deputy Tunney said, the Minister is like Houdini.  If charges are raised it will not solve the problem because people are not installing telephones now to the extent they used to because of the huge charges already in operation.  The secret of making money in telecommunications is to have a fully operational and profitable network and to use it to the maximum. Any company in the United States or anywhere else will tell you that.  We were on course to do that, and now the Minister is going to strangle the company and create such an enormous price barrier that many people who would have got telephones will not get them.  The Government are pricing them out of the market.</P>
    <P>That is a typical State approach to a commercial enterprise.  The company were taken away from the State and put into a commercial environment and the Government are now reversing that decision. Tom Byrnes was honest and spoke his mind, which more people should do. I know he annoyed the Government.  He also annoyed us.  He may not have annoyed the Minister personally, but he annoyed the people who are advising the Minister on his approach to Telecom Éireann.  The Minister should not deny that.  I know it for a fact.  I would clap Tom Byrnes on the back for telling people from this House that he would not let them into his office.  When they went out there and had to come back here, I <Col N="1451" /> said fair play to him.  He was running a commercial organisation and they did not think it worth their while to ring up and make an appointment with him, as if he should be there when every Tom, Dick or Harry came to the door.  He is entitled to close the door to the Minister, to me, or to anybody else.</P>
    <P>After that he started to attack the institutions of the State in relation to the levy and the dividend.  People in the Minister's Department, whom we all know are all powerful, kept telling the Minister they had the money and were cooking the books.  They told the Minister he should stick by his decision.  That was a terrible indictment of the chairman of the board and of every member of the board.  If the Minister persists, I will not be surprised if the chairman and many members of the board resign.  If they are worth their salt that is what they will do.  They were charged with a responsibility to develop telecommunications.  They were given a programme.</P>
    <P>The Minister changes the goal posts as he goes along.  He has changed his target so often since he became Minister that it is easy for him to say he reached his target.  He shifted the goal posts every time.  He is doing that to Telecom Éireann. He will strangle and demoralise that organisation and set back the attainment of a proper telecommunications network for a number of years.  Trouble will blow up in his face.  There will be industrial unrest.  The trade union movement were very progressive in that area, but they will now say: &ldquo;If they do not want us to do the job, and if they want to have the organisation back in a State stranglehold, we will play that game too.&rdquo;  The Minister should change his course before it is too late.  His epitaph will be that he set back the development of a telecommunications network with a loss of good people to the State sector who were prepared to take part in the development of that network.</P>

      <P>I support the call for the withdrawal of this section.  The <Col N="1452" /> start of this was the levy put on the ESB a few years ago which brought the company from the black into the red and damaged the morale of people in the ESB.  Telecom Éireann were established recently.  The workforce were developing a clear understanding of their task and their standing in the community and developing into a team of workers.  To hit them on the head at this stage is an enormous blow.  The word from the staff in Bord Telecom is that it is an irretrievable blow to their morale.  They were tied up in red tape and traditions in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. Now they were moving into a new era and developing a new approach.  That has been destroyed by this hammer blow from the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>This is an underhand method of taxation. The Government are trying to maintain the statement in <i>Building on Reality</i> that there will be no further increase in taxation and they are hauling in £50 million or £60 million in this way. This is taxing the consumers of the product in a discriminatory manner.  The word in State companies is: who will be levied next?  If the Government put a levy on a State company they must get it from the consumers of their product.  A number of Ministers have said they recognise the importance of the State companies and their intention is to promote them and make them more efficient.  This is not a method of making them more efficient.  I support all the points made and I appeal to the Minister to look again at the section.</P>

      <P>We have been treated by Deputy Leyden to what I called bogeyman politics.  He is a fair old man to put up a kite to frighten people.  I want to nail immediately two specific things he said.  The provision in the section we are discussing is not open ended as he claimed.  He may not have read it with great care.  It relates only to the Exchequer debt and a vesting date and is confined to that.  It is not an open ended provision.  Deputy Leyden and Deputy Mac Giolla used the word privatisation without any justification.  Deputy Leyden <Col N="1453" /> should have taken the trouble to find out, and Deputy Wilson could probably have told him from his own compendious memory, that section 21 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act, 1983 precludes privatisation.  Having got rid of those myths we can turn to the facts.</P>

      <P>If Deputies opposite spent a little more time listening than they do shouting, they might hear what I said in the first place.  In the middle of 1983 it was projected that the company would have a surplus in the calendar year 1984. Now it appears that the company are projecting, on the basis of new accounting policies which have the effect of <Col N="1454" /> worsening the profit and loss account, a loss of about £60 million in the year to the end of March next.  This has resulted from a lower volume increase in the use of the service than had been anticipated. At the time Deputy Wilson was involved in bringing the Bill through the House, we had projections prepared by the board in good faith of a surplus of £19 million in 1983, £52 million in 1984 and £116.7 million in 1985.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That has not come about. Nevertheless there has been an upturn in business in the company in the past year which will be reflected in the turnover of the company.  That improvement, taken together with the reduced VAT rate on telecommunications equipment, which in itself will produce a positive cashflow to BT of about £5 million a year, and the increase in charges from 1 April last should have a significant and positive effect on the company's cash flow position. After 1987 the company will have no interest to pay on Exchequer debt capital.  In addition, the Exchequer may purchase equity capital in the company up to the maximum specified in subsection (2) of the section we are talking about, that is, £170 million.  At that stage the company are projecting a comfortable surplus even on the basis of the new and more stringent accounting provisions which the company have now decided to use.  On the basis of the company's corporate plan, in interest it will cost the service in the period 1985-86 to 1987-88 about £120 million per year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he will make a statement on the successive rises in the price of coal outlining the amount of permitted increase in each case over the last two years and the reasons for each of such increase; and whether or not he has any observations to make as to the adverse effects which such increases are having particularly on the ability of elderly <Col N="1382" /> people to adequately heat their own dwellings.</P>

      <P>The statement following details the retail price increases approved for coal importers over the past two years indicating also the reasons for the increases.</P>
      <P>All the major coal importers are subject to detailed price control and any price increase approved was first the subject of detailed examination by the National Prices Commission.  Most of our coal imports are priced in dollar terms and the strengthening of the US dollar over the two years has led to a substantial increase in the cost in Irish pound terms of imports.  A further factor was the UK miners' strike which not only curtailed supplies to the Irish market, but by creating a supply shortage in western Europe, enabled an increase in the dollar cost of Polish coal.  This latter element is now removed and as a result a significant reduction in certain prices, as shown in the statement, has been effected in recent weeks.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the price increases approved in the past two years, which were based on recommendations of the National Prices Commission, were justified on the basis of increased costs and were necessary to ensure continued supplies to the Irish market.</P>

      <P>The answers to the Deputy's questions are as follows:</P>
      <P>1.  Under the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, 1957, the Voluntary Health Insurance Board was established in 1957 as a body corporate with perpetual succession and power to sue and be sued in its corporate name and to acquire, hold and dispose of land.  Under the terms of the Act, the board is required to set subscriptions as such a level as will be sufficient, but only sufficient, to meet charges to revenue, having made allowance for reserves and depreciation.  Upon establishment the board received a loan from the Exchequer of £13,200.  This has been repaid in full by 1959.</P>
      <P>2.  None.</P>
      <P>3.  None.</P>

      <P>5.  None.</P>
      <P>6.  The VHI Board's operating surplus for the financial year ended 28 February 1982, was £338,000.  The equivalent figures for 1983 and 1984 were £1,820,000 and £167,000 respectively.  These amounts were applied to the Board's reserve funds.</P>

      <P>Women from the Dublin 12 postal district claiming unemployment benefit or assistance were hitherto among those who were catered for in the employment exchange at Victoria Street, Dublin 8.  Because of severe overcrowding at that office and at other offices in the city it was decided to open a new employment exchange at premises which became available in Tara Street.  It is accepted that moving any claimants to the new exchange causes a certain amount of inconvenience, at least in the initial stages.  However, the transfer of the approximately 1,850 women claimants in the Dublin 12 area in this way was the only viable solution to the problems of congestion at the Victoria Street exchange.  The opening of the new exchange in Tara Street has afforded considerable relief to other city exchanges. It represents however essentially a short term solution and plans for the provision of employment exchanges in outlying city areas where they are required are being pursued as a matter of priority.</P>

He was in receipt of invalidity pension and this continued in payment up to week-ended 24 April 1985.  A retirement pension book containing orders payable from 25 April <Col N="1418" /> 1985 was issued to the designated post office on 22 April 1985 for collection by him and he was notified accordingly.

      <P>Payment of disability benefit to the person concerned was disallowed from 18 October 1984, following an examination by a medical referee who expressed the opinion that she was capable of work.  She appealed against the disallowance and she was examined on 13 December 1984 by a different medical referee who also considered her to be capable of work.  Her case has been referred to an appeals officer who proposes to hold an oral hearing of the case. The delay in hearing the appeal has been caused by an increase in the number of appeals and everything possible is being done to relieve the situation.</P>

      <P>Following an oral hearing of the appeal of the person concerned on 16 April 1985 an appeals officer decided that she satisfied the condition of being available for work and allowed her unemployment benefit claim with effect from 9 October 1984.  Credited contributions were allowed during the period 9 October 1984 to 5 January 1985 as she did not satisfy the contribution condition for payment of unemployment benefit during the governing contribution period 6 April 1982 to 5 April 1983.

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 4 May 1983 to 24 May 1983 after which she ceased to sign as unemployed.  Her claim <Col N="1420" /> was disallowed on the grounds that she did not satisfy the contribution condition of having at least 26 weeks of insurable employment or credited contributions during the relevant governing contribution period 6 April 1981 to 5 April 1982. She then claimed unemployment assistance in respect of that period but following an investigation by a social welfare officer her unemployment assistance claim was disallowed on the grounds that by failing to furnish details of her means she failed to show that her means did not exceed the statutory limit.</P>
      <P>If she is at present unemployed she would not satisfy the contribution conditions for unemployment benefit as according to the records of the Department she has nil weeks of insurable employment or credited contributions during the contribution period 6 April 1983 to 5 April 1984 which governs entitlement to benefit in the current benefit year.  However if she is willing to cooperate in the investigation of her means it is open to her to sign as unemployed and to claim unemployment assistance after which her case would be referred to a social welfare officer for reinvestigation. Her means would be assessed in the light of the outcome of inquiries and her entitlement to unemployment assistance would be determined accordingly.</P>

      <P>(1)  The company was established on 21 September 1933, and the initial equity subscribed by the Exchequer was £0.5 million.</P>
