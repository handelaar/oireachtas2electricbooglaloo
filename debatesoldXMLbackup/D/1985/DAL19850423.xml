      <P>asked the Minister for Health the numbers, so far as can be ascertained, of persons who have been living alone and who were found dead in 1984 and the comparable figure for 1980; and (a) if he will commission an investigation into the numbers of elderly people living alone, with particular emphasis on those with low incomes; the difficulties facing such people and specific proposals to deal with these problems, (b) if he will lay the results of the investigation before both Houses of the Oireachtas; and (c) if he will undertake to make the necessary funds available to implement such proposals.</P>

      <P>I regret that statistics are not compiled by the Department of Health, the Department of Justice or any other State agency giving the number of persons who had been living alone and were found dead in 1980 and 1984.</P>
      <P>However, we do know that in 1981, 16,393 persons over the age of 65 who died were single or widowed.  The majority of such persons died in hospitals, nursing homes or with relatives.  Census figures indicate that there has been a significant increase in the numbers of elderly people living alone in the last decade. Projections indicate that this trend will continue.  In many cases this is a reflection of increased prosperity and a wish for independence among the elderly population. Several bodies, including the National Council for the Aged, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Economic and Social Research Institute have published studies of the situation of the elderly and have highlighted the problems faced by those elderly persons on low incomes who live alone.  The National Council for the Aged have made recommendations on income maintenance of the elderly which are being examined by the Commission on Social Welfare.  Health boards maintain registers of old people at risk who live alone to enable the public health nurses to give them priority.</P>

      <Col N="1272" /> In view of the information which is already available, I do not intend to establish a commission as suggested by the Deputy.  My Department however, will be undertaking a review of services for the elderly which will examine, amongst other things, the adequacy of support services for old people living alone.  The results of this review will be made widely available.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will appreciate that I am not in a position to make any financial commitments until the recommendations of this review are available.</P>

      <P>One cannot draw any particular conclusions from the number of persons, single or widowed over the age of 65, who died, because the vast majority of them died in hospitals, nursing homes or while being cared for separately by relatives.  One is not in a position to collate the data in the manner the Deputy seeks.  The Deputy seeks to know the number of persons living alone who were found dead.  The vast bulk of such persons die in hospital care.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not agree that this is an area of increased concern, that some attempt will have to be made to ascertain the precise facts in regard to the elderly living alone who are at risk?  That is what I am endeavouring to get at in this question.  Some information as to what has happened in the last few years in that regard should be available to the House.  Would the Minister consider again &mdash; not necessarily a commission as suggested &mdash; asking his Department to investigate this area as to the number of people living alone who have been found dead?

      <P>I would not think there is any element of neglect in this regard.  The statistical work has been undertaken comprehensively, for example, in the Economic and Social Circumstances of the Elderly in Ireland, a publication issued by the ESRI.  There was a publication called <i>Old and Alone</i> by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul; there was a publication called <i>Incomes of the Elderly in Ireland and The World of the Elderly &mdash; a Rural Experience</i> published by the National Council for the Aged.  These are recent publications.  We have considerable data on the 60,000 single person households and the health boards at local level have a great deal of data on such persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Arrangements for staff cover in geriatric homes and hospitals are a matter for local management in each health board.  There is no evidence in my Department to suggest that limitations on staff recruitment and on funding of the health boards have resulted in any reduction in night time cover in these institutions.  Health boards are, of course, responsible for ensuring that fire precaution arrangements in hospitals and other health institutions are reviewed periodically and that all staff are aware of fire prevention measures and are familiar with proper fire drill and procedures, should it become necessary at any stage to evacuate patients.</P>

Is there any set ratio of the number of staff to patients in geriatric hospitals?  Is the ratio adhered to in all hospitals?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We are dealing with the question of fire risk.  I do not have any reports to the effect that staffing ratios impinge in any way on the fire regulations. If I had I would take immediate action.  I have invested some money in improving the position in regard to fire precautions.  More than £600,000 was spent on fire precaution works in 1984 <Col N="1278" /> in all institutions.  Undoubtedly, there is room for further improvement but I have not received any specific complaints.  If Deputy Leonard, who tabled the question, or any Deputy, has any complaints about specific geriatric institutions he should bring them to my notice and I will have them examined and considered by the health boards concerned.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware that ratio varies from institution to institution.  It depends on the age of the institution, the structures and ward sizes and they vary considerably from area to area.  I do not have a specific ratio but where health boards feel that the ratio is not adequate they are not slow in coming forward and making that point to the Department.  The Department are not slow in responding and discussing such matters with the health boards.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In April 1984, there were 5,638 nurses, excluding chief and assistant chief nursing officers, caring for some 11,250 patients in our district psychiatric hospitals.  This gives a ratio of one nurse to two patients which, by international standards, represents a very high ratio of nurses to patients.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allocation of nurses between wards in any particular hospital is a matter in the first instance for the chief nursing officer, having regard to the needs of the patients in the wards concerned. <Col N="1279" /> Arrangements are now being made in individual hospitals to implement integration of nursing staff and of wards following agreement at national level.

      <P>It will deal also with the role of review boards.  It is essential that we have new legislation in that area. Soon after the 1981 regulations were drafted it was apparent that they were inoperable.

      <P>Undoubtedly there is a need for a new review board procedure. The procedure dealt with in the 1981 Act was regarded as cumbersome and inoperable.

    <P>On average, therefore, there were about 16 deaths per year from causes other than natural causes.  This number should be seen in the context of some 40,000 patients treated annually in our district psychiatric hospitals.</P>
    <P>An examination in detail of deaths in the last two years shows that the majority of the patients involved were voluntary patients.  In accordance with modern concepts of treatment they had freedom to leave the hospital to visit their homes or <Col N="1282" /> do shopping, etc.  Three out of four deaths occurred outside the hospital grounds among patients who had regularly enjoyed considerable freedom of movement in this way.  About half of the deaths which occurred in the hospitals resulted from accidents, such as falls by elderly people.</P>
    <P>Following each death the circumstances are examined by the hospital authorities and over the years the more obvious risk factors have been eliminated as far as possible.  Nevertheless some non-natural deaths occur.  It would be difficult, if not impossible, to eliminate all risk situations, especially in a modern liberal therapeutic approach which has contributed greatly to the discharge of so many patients in recent years.</P>

      <P>If my sums are correct, 178 people died from other than natural causes in mental institutions in the past ten years.  The Minister stated that three out of every four of these deaths happened outside hospital.  This means that 44 deaths occurred within the hospitals.  Is the Minister happy that deaths from non-natural causes among such people are properly accounted for and that the parents, next-of-kin and the Minister for Health are given an account each time there is a death from non-natural causes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I might explain it best in this way.  The up-to-date information relates to the past two years, in which there were 40 deaths, 26 male and 14 female.  Eleven of the patients were between the ages of 65 and 74 and three were over 75.  Of the 40 deaths, ten occurred within the hospital structure, one occurred in the hospital grounds and 29 occurred outside the hospital grounds. The most common cause of death was drowning and this accounted for 26 of the deaths.  There were four persons hanged; three died from chocking and suffocation; two were hit by a car; one arose from the taking of poison; one from an overdose; one as a result of a fall.  Another death also involved a fall and in one case there <Col N="1283" /> was a combination of causes, including pneumonia.  That is a detailed analysis.</P>
      <P>It must be pointed out that 70 per cent of the deaths during 1983 and 1984 were as a result of drowning and many of these deaths occurred while patients absconded from hospitals.  Some of them occurred when patients were on weekend leave and day passes.  In most hospitals patients are now encouraged to leave the hospital grounds and it reflects the general trend during the past ten or 20 years of allowing patients much more freedom and placing far less emphasis on locked wards.  In most of the reports received on those deaths the staff state that there were no indications that any of the patients were contemplating suicide.  That is the broad profile over the past two years.</P>
      <P>I would stress that this data must be taken in the framework of 11,500 residential patients and 40,000 patients who are treated annually in our psychiatric hospitals. It must also be considered in the framework of the settled community where a large number of non-natural deaths also occur &mdash; suicides and so on &mdash; among those who are not in a psychiatric setting.</P>

      <P>Are there any indications of the reasons for the fairly significant increase in the rate of non-natural deaths during the past three years or so? On the figures given it appears that the average was between 12 and 14 up to three or four years ago; then the figure rose to 19 or 22 per year.  Are there any indications as to the reason?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is basically because we have been practising as a matter of deliberate treatment procedure the opening up of psychiatric hospitals and encouraging patients to go and live with their families if at all possible, to live in hostels, to go outside the psychiatric hospitals and work in training workshops or in conventional employment.  We are generally giving a great deal of freedom. The parallel implication of that policy is a growth in the prospect of accident or <Col N="1284" /> the prospect of suicide occurring in the case of patients who have suicidal tendencies. That is inevitably a development which we must take on board if we want to have a different regime in operation.</P>

      <P>The Minister indicated that following the death of a person who is a patient in a psychiatric hospital the circumstances of the death are examined by the hospital authorities.  In the particular circumstances of the death due to non-natural causes of a patient confined to a psychiatric hospital, would the Minister not agree that it would be more appropriate that the circumstances surrounding such a death should be examined by an authority outside the hospital authorities rather than by the hospital authority themselves?  I would ask him to bear in mind when replying that much concern has been expressed recently in the media that following the deaths of a number of persons who were patients in psychiatric hospitals the next-of-kin and relatives were unable to get information which they required in order to satisfy themselves as to the cause of the death.</P>

      <P>In all such non-natural deaths a report must be made not only to the coroner but to the inspector of mental hospitals.  So far as the Department are concerned, there is no question of patients not being cared for fully in that setting and neither is there any question <Col N="1285" /> of relatives being kept in the dark about precisely what happened to patients. I would not accept any other procedure in any hospital.</P>

      <P>The Minister has not answered my question.  He has not said whether he is satisfied that the parents concerned are given due account in those cases.  In the past ten years 178 patients died in these hospitals and in three out of every four cases the incident happened outside of the hospitals.  Therefore, one in every four, or approximately 45, occurred within the hospitals.  That represents about five per year but there has been a significant increase in the trend in the recent past with the numbers increasing from 14 in 1974 to 23 in each of the years 1981 and 1982.  The figure in respect of 1983 was 21, while for 1984 the number of incidents was 19.  In other words, there is an increase of about six patients per year dying from non-natural causes in mental hospitals.</P>

That is <Col N="1286" /> what has been happening.  Any such complaint should be referred either to the Department or to the acting inspector of mental hospitals.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 22 district psychiatric hospitals and they are monitored in a number of ways: (a) Each hospital has a visiting committee comprised of members of the health board.  They visit on a monthly basis and usually so organise their visits that they cover the whole hospital in a number of months; (b) The inspector of mental hospitals carries out statutory visits once a year to each hospital and in addition he visits the hospitals from time to time to deal with specific problems; (c) Administrative and technical officers of the Department in recent years have inspected and continue to inspect hospitals in great detail in connection with the programme of up-grading conditions at the hospitals.</P>
      <P>In recent months I have visited a number of psychiatric hospitals and have seen for myself the improvements which have been brought about.  These improvements have been very significant and in many instances quite remarkable. I am satisfied, therefore, that the present arrangements for monitoring standards and practices in the psychiatric hospitals are adequate.</P>
      <P>I have read the newspaper report referred to and also the document on which that report is based.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A report on St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane, was sought by the Eastern Health Board in July 1980.  The request for the <Col N="1288" /> report related mainly to a need for guidance on such general questions as nursing staff requirements and nurse training.</P>
    <P>The document which was produced contained a number of allegations relating to certain actions by staff in the treatment of patients.  It did not deal with the main purpose for which it was commissioned and in view of the unsubstantiated allegations which it contained it was not released to the health board.  No evidence was produced to support the allegations contained in the document and the available evidence did not support them.</P>
    <P>The document did, in fact, contain criticism of the condition of certain parts of the hospital.  However, the action which was being taken before the document was produced, and has since continued, has led to considerable improvement in conditions in the hospital, particularly in relation to areas occupied by patients. Almost £1.2 million was spent on up-grading the male and female long stay blocks since 1977.  In addition, £1.3 million has been spent on other improvements in the hospital and in the current year about £0.5 million will be spent on up-grading wards and corridors.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am surprised to hear what the Minister has to say about this report.  Whatever about some complaints which he says were not substantiated, can he confirm that the report contained recommendations and that while its author acknowledged that improvements had taken place he considered himself obliged to report on certain matters he observed in the hospital?  In respect of one ward he said,&ldquo;Ward 4, female, is in our opinion a national scandal&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister confirm that the author of the report pointed out that the dirty appearance of some of the patients and the smell from their clothing was such as to constitute a major scandal and that apart from renovations that had <Col N="1289" /> taken place in recent times at the hospital, the condition in some wards, particularly female wards, were appalling and that these wards were unfit for human habitation?  In these circumstances would the Minister not accept that the author of the report was very concerned in regard to his findings at the hospital and concluded his report by making certain recommendations and by making the appeal that some of the complaints he had made be dealt with immediately?  He pointed out that the ward referred to remained open.</P>

      <P>In 1980 a document was completed by a former staff member of the Department of Health which contained very serious allegations of physical and psychological violence towards patients and the absence of hygiene to which the Deputy referred.  There were seven pages devoted to these alleged incidents and they were regarded so seriously by the Department that the officer in the Department was questioned at great length by members of the division in the Department.  However, the more the officer was asked about the allegations, the more he withdrew his remarks and his alleged double checked assertions turned out to be unsubstantiated.  There was not even one allegation on which action could be taken.  I have examined the document in question and, to say the least of it, it was badly prepared, badly presented and did not address itself to the terms of reference.  Its calibre was such that neither my predecessors nor I considered that we could release it as a document of consequence to the health board in question.</P>

      <P>When history is written as to the priorities of different Ministers for Health it will be seen that St. Ita's suffered from a general lack of maintenance which affected nearly all psychiatric institutions.  However, since 1977 a sum of £2½ million has been spent in upgrading patient accommodation in St. Ita's.  Since I came to office, a very substantial amount of money has been spent &mdash; a sum of £500,000 has been spent this year &mdash; and the dormitories, day rooms and sanitary facilities are greatly improved, some to a very good standard. I know the hospital well as I have been connected with it as a trade union official since 1957.  The long corridors badly need to be upgarded and work on these has begun.  There has been a considerable improvement in the general physical standards of the hospital and any Deputy is welcome to visit it.  I am very concerned that a former officer of the Department of Health with professional competence should have made allegations of this nature and seen fit to release them to a national newspaper.  I can only speculate on the reasons for doing so.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of what the Minister said about the author of the report, would he indicate if he considers that the report was based on malicious intentions or whether, as the Minister suggested, it was misguided for some other reason?  I should also like the Minister to let us know if the Eastern Health Board were informed at any stage over the three years when the report was a secret why the Department of Health refused to publish the report?  Would he also indicate if he is aware that there is concern regarding the fact that the report was not published and that reasons were not given?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is clear that documents of this nature can have a profound effect on the morale of hospital staff.  I will never tolerate neglect or failure on the part of any officer in the Department, in health boards or staff in any hospital and I am ruthless in that regard.  However, the staff of St. Ita's deserve the best from us in terms of maintaining their <Col N="1291" /> morale and protecting their fundamental rights as staff officers.  In relation to the 1980 report, the staff were questioned in considerable detail regarding the allegations contained in it and they categorically denied those allegations.  They recently met officers of the Department and again refuted the allegations made. Indeed, this document does not deserve the status of a report; it was a series of strung together observations.  It was an internal document of so little consequence that, departmentally, it did not have the status of a report.  Normally, a report is kept on file having been processed rigorously by officers in the Department. Unfortunately, that kind of press publicity discourages potentially outstanding staff from applying for posts in hospitals and has a disastrous impact on the morale of staff.  Reporters, members of RTE and Deputies are welcome to visit any part of any hospital and I will facilitate them in that regard on condition that the privacy of patients is protected. Their rights as residents in the hospitals must also be protected and given due respect.  I never cease to be amazed at the number of people who make allegations and write reports although they have never been in a psychiatric ward in their life.</P>

      <P>The main thrust of the report is to transfer much of the service out of the institutions into the community and I should like to ask the Minister if he intends to allocate special funding to the health boards in order that they may build up their community services in psychiatry?</P>

      <P>I do not think any special funding is required.  We are currently spending a sum of £160 million per year on psychiatric hospital services. Plenty of money is available and that money can be redirected and we should now be thinking not just of selectively closing down psychiatric hospitals.  If we were really prepared to grasp the nettle we would close them all down, and, of course, Deputies can use that is any political frame work they want to in the local elections.</P>

      <P>What the Minister is saying is a fallacy if one looks at the experience in the US and in Italy where they did what the Minister is suggesting. They did not fund the community services properly and now they are left with patients who left the psychiatric hospitals and are living rough, so to speak, in not having any suitable service available to them.  Indeed, recently the House of Commons committee on the social services reported in an exactly similar way.</P>

      <P>Let me point out with respect to the Deputy that the psychiatric services in the Republic of Ireland are light years ahead of what the UK have, thanks to successive Ministers and the change that has occurred, particularly in the past ten years.  Therefore, when we open up the hostels, the workshops, the day care centres and the out-patient services the only way to fund them is to close permanently the beds from which those patients will come.  We have £160 million to do this work and if we keep all the psychiatric hospitals open with about 40 per cent occupancy in them we will never be able to do it.  Therefore I urge that the local communities and the health boards face up to the implications of that new strategy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No. Let me put the strategy before the Deputy.  On behalf of 11,500 patients with 6,500 nursing staff and several thousand more ancilliary staff we are spending £160 million a year.  We could comfortably take about a third of those patients out of the residential institutions they are in, put them out into the community and take about £40 million of the £160 million and use it outside the hospitals, but there is no way that we can keep all our psychiatric hospitals open with a 40 per cent bed occupancy with no staff being taken out into the community.  My ambition is that we open up residential hostels, residential outpatient services, residential treatment workshops and do all that can be done.  We are now working on this to great effect with no increase in costs, but the concomitant of it is that as we do it we close our beds for ever.  That is my ambition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>This Bill is intended to give statutory effect to the tax measures introduced in the budget and it also incorporates a number of other tax changes which are considered to be necessary or desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The new tax structures announced in the budget are, for the most part, already in operation.  The VAT changes generally came into effect on 1 March and the income tax changes on 6 April.  As a concession, to allow for transitional difficulties, the VAT change in respect of new private house building does not take effect until 1 May.  It is much too early to assess in any detail the impact of these major tax adjustments.  They have been well received generally and I am satisfied <Col N="1451" /> that they will have a substantial, positive effect on the economy.</P>
    <P>There has been a widespread recognition for some time of the need for reform of our tax structure.  Because of the budget constraints, there is no prospect of significant tax reductions in the short term but this does not rule out the possibility of restructuring.  On the contrary, high levels of taxation simply highlight the imbalances in the structure and the need for reform.  We could have decided to approach the problem by minor selective adjustments &mdash; a little increase here and a little reduction there &mdash; but this would be no more than tinkering with the system on the margin without tackling the basic problem.  This is why the Government decided that some fundamental changes were required now without further delay.  They decided that the income tax and VAT structures &mdash; the two principal sources of irritation &mdash; should be considerably simplified.  This is the more rational course, it achieves a fairer distribution and, as I have already said, it will have beneficial effects on the economy.  There has been an improvement in take home pay for all income taxpayers.  This improvement may in some cases be fairly modest &mdash; this is an inevitable consequence of the progressive character of our income tax code &mdash; but it is nonetheless a step in the right direction. In line with the commitment in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> we look forward to maintaining this trend over the next few years.</P>
    <P>Our future policies on taxation will be determined in accordance with the criteria of the national plan.  In the first instance, there will be no increase in the overall real level of taxation.  It is the Government's belief that further increases in taxation as a percentage of our GNP at this time would have a detrimental effect on the economy and on employment.  Consequently, in lowering the budget deficit to meet the target in the plan, the emphasis must be on reducing public expenditure rather than increasing taxation.  We are committed to adjusting income tax bands and allowances so that <Col N="1452" /> the overall tax burden on income taxpayers will not increase.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic, however, to anticipate substantial tax reductions in the short term.  These will not be possible while we have to face a large budget deficit.  If we are to maintain and strengthen confidence in the economy, this deficit must be gradually reduced and then phased out.  We have set a target of 5 per cent of GNP by 1987, down from this year's figure of 7.9 per cent.  This may seem a rather modest target, given the increasing burden of debt, and some would regard it as insufficient progress.  It will require, however, that we continue to exercise stringent controls on expenditure while maintaining a relatively high tax yield.  Specific reductions in taxation will have to be balanced by increases elsewhere and by higher yields from improved collection procedures.</P>
    <P>While the budget changes are quite substantial by any standards, they are only one phase in the process of tax reform. We still have much to do before we can be satisfied with the structure of our tax system.  We have to widen the tax base further by limiting concessions and bringing more areas of activity into the tax net.  We are making headway against the problems ot tax evasion.  We are planning the introduction of a child benefit scheme which will unify in a single payment State support towards the cost of rearing children and tax this payment as appropriate. This will achieve a more equitable distribution of the benefits of the very significant level of support for children which is funded by the taxpayer.  We must bring about substantial improvements in collection arrangements because inadequate collection procedures reduce the benefits of achieving an equitable system of taxation. The Commission on Taxation are at present preparing a report on tax administration and I am awaiting their findings with great interest.</P>
    <P>While the Finance Bill is essentially a taxation measure, it necessarily reflects the policies of the budget.  This affords an opportunity for discussion on overall strategies for the economy and the public finances in particular.  From the very <Col N="1453" /> beginning, it has been the policy of this Government that a responsible approach to the public finances will pay worthwhile dividends in the longer term by strengthening the capacity of the economy.  We have been under pressure to take short term initiatives at the expense of our longer term interests and we have resisted this.  The result is that there is a growing confidence in the economy.  We have come through the worst phases of recession and we have preserved the capability to take proper advantage of new opportunities.  We have achieved our budget targets and, while some critics might dismiss this as book-keeping, the reality is that it is a critical factor in the overall economic situation and we should never lose sight of this.  I dread to think what the consequences would be if the spendthrift policies of some years ago were continued.  We will continue the policy of adopting a prudent approach to the public finances because any other policy would be irresponsible and damaging to the economy.</P>
    <P>The recent publication of the end-quarter figures for March led to some wild speculation that a second budget was planned for 1985.  There was no basis for this kind of comment.  While some receipts fell short of expectations, it is much too early to draw conclusions about trends for the year as a whole.  We have seen from previous experience that trends can vary quite significantly in the course of the year and that it would be wrong to arrive at conclusions for the year as a whole from the results for the first three months.  I have no reason at this stage to be other than confident about the likely outcome but, should it happen that a significant overrun begins to emerge during the course of the year then the Government will take whatever steps are required to keep the budget in line with targets.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should resist the temptation to go off on a flight of fancy about what that might mean.  I have no hesitation in repeating that at this <Col N="1454" /> point I have no reason to be other than confident that the outturn will be as projected.</P>
      <P>Since the beginning of the year we have seen some encouraging economic developments. The end-March live register figures showed a significant improvement over the trend in the previous few months.  Interest rates have also fallen significantly.  These trends should have a positive impact on the budget figures in the months ahead.</P>
      <P>I would like now to outline the main provisions incorporated in the Bill.  Several of these provisions are purely of a technical nature and, rather than deal with each item individually, I will concentrate on the more significant among them.</P>
      <P>Provision is made in the early sections for the increased income tax exemption limits, for the restructured rate bands and for the revised personal allowances which I announced in my Budget Statement on 30 January.  Taken together these changes will reduce tax liability right through the income scale for both single and married taxpayers.  The elimination of the previous top rate of 65 per cent should reduce the disincentive effects of high marginal rates of tax.  These amendments are consistent with the policy outlined in the national plan in which we undertook that the overall income tax burden on taxpayers will not increase over the period of the plan.  The net cost of the adjustments actually exceeds the estimated net cost of indexation of the previous tax bands in line with inflation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 4, in addition to providing for the single-parent allowance increase announced in the budget, also removes an anomaly which previously deprived a single parent of the benefits of this allowance if a child had an income in his or her own right of over £180 per annum. The fact that in some instances this resulted in harsh treatment was brought to the attention of the Revenue Commissioners by the Ombudsman.  Hitherto the single parent allowance has been available only to parents who qualified for the £100 child tax allowance.  The section removes this direct connection and, while <Col N="1455" /> setting out similar basic eligibility requirements, provides for a much more generous limit on the child's own income than that applied to eligibility by the child tax allowance.</P>
    <P>In section 6, the rules are being clarified to ensure that tax is payable under PAYE in respect of all salaries and wages except where it would be impracticable to do so.  This clarification is necessary in response to increasing pressures from professional people that, where they operate a private practice and also hold a public appointment, they have a right to be taxed on a Schedule D basis on all their income.</P>
    <P>Two sections will specifically benefit older people in our society.  Section 7 reduces the age qualification for entitlement to rent relief on private tenancies and increases the upper limit on such relief.  Section 8 allows double levels of relief on deposit interest for taxpayers aged 65 or over and will encourage them to put their savings into financial institutions, thereby helping to reduce the risk to old people from attacks on their home and persons.</P>
    <P>Section 10 provides that the first £2,000 of income from the leasing of agricultural land will be exempt from income tax liability, where the period of the lease is seven years or more and the lessor is 55 years of age or over or is incapacitated. The £2,000 ceiling will apply separately to each spouse where both spouses engage in leasing.  This new relief offers a considerable incentive to leasing of farms which will, in turn, bring about improved utilisation of land.</P>
    <P>The venture capital scheme implemented under the provisions of last year's Finance Act is now beginning to make an impact.  One of the constraints still to be overcome before the scheme comes fully into operation is the restriction on advertising imposed on designated funds by the requirements of existing unit trust legislation.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is introducing legislation to remove this restriction. Section 13 of the Bill makes a concession to allow companies which face <Col N="1456" /> start-up delays, because of a substantial research and development commitment connected with their business, to commence trading within three years and still qualify for the benefits of the scheme.  I announced when the Bill was published that two further amendments to the scheme would be introduced on Committee Stage.  One will provide that close relatives, who are now excluded, may avail of the benefits of the scheme.  The second will provide that there will be no statutory ceiling on fees which may be charged by fund managers to investors. The promoters of a fund will be expected, however, to publish their charges in the prospectus.  In addition, the scheme will be broadened by allowing companies with &ldquo;51 per cent&rdquo; subsidiaries, or with certain foreign subsidiaries, to qualify for benefit under the scheme.</P>
    <P>There has been a certain amount of comment about the alleged lack of success of the venture capital scheme.  The comments have often been linked with proposals to amend the scheme, some of which would considerably extend the scope for tax avoidance or reduce the effectiveness of the scheme in channelling investment funds into productive activity.  The position is that it is much too early to make an informed assessment of the progress of the scheme.  Claims for relief became allowable only on 1 January this year.  The fact that two designated funds were successfully launched, despite the existing constraints of the unit trust legislation, is indicative of the scheme's potential.  One of the amendments most frequently proposed, for example, is that tax relief should become available once moneys are placed in a designated fund. In my view, this would simply have the effect of delaying investment in productive activity, since there would be no pressure on the funds to select suitable projects.  It would be impossible to avoid this without adding an administrative complexity to the scheme.</P>
    <P>In section 14, a restriction is imposed on the tax exemption of stallion fees.  In future, this exemption will be confined to income earned from stallions at stud within the State.  It will continue to apply <Col N="1457" /> also, however, where a breeder resident here acquires a share in a foreign-based stallion for the purpose of obtaining new breeding lines.</P>
    <P>At present, tax relief is allowed in certain circumstances where a person carrying on a trade or profession makes a donation to an Irish university for research in or the teaching of approved subjects.  In response to a number of requests, this concession is being extended to other third level institutions which provide training for jobs in trade and industry.</P>
    <P>The composite tax rate arrangements for the building societies are incorporated in section 18.  For this tax year the composite rate will be 28 per cent and the ceiling for accounts to which the composite rate applies will be fixed at £25,000 instead of £15,000.  This section also makes permanent the new instalment dates for payment of tax by the societies.</P>
    <P>As announced in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> and in the Budget Statement, provision is being made in section 20 to extend the tax incentive which is available to lessors of residential accommodation to encourage the refurbishment of buildings now or previously in multiple residential occupation.  Up to now, incentives have applied only in respect of the construction of a new building or the conversion of a building into two or more dwellings.  A further new incentive in section 21 permits a wider interpretation of conversion to include structural repair work generally.  In addition, relief will apply where a building, which is not a dwelling, is converted into a single dwelling.  Expenditure on these new categories of work in the two years commencing on 1 April 1985 will be allowed for tax purposes against future rental income receivable by the lessor of residential units to which the expenditure relates subject to the requirements as regards size and standards which already apply in relation to apartments.  This is a generous extension of the present incentives and it should be very welcome to the building industry.</P>
    <P>Section 22 provides for the payment of <Col N="1458" /> corporation tax by all companies in a single instalment six months from the end of their accounting periods.  At present, all companies pay a first instalment of tax six months after the end of an accounting period but the due date for payment of the second instalment varies as between companies from one day to almost nine months after the due date for the first instalment.  It is important in the interests of equity to have a uniform payment date.  Provision is made to ease the transition to the new system by limiting the advancement of the due date for the second instalment to three months in any one year.</P>
    <P>As announced in the budget, section 24 of the Bill extends to 31 December 1985 the transitional arrangements under which advance corporation tax &mdash; ACT &mdash; in respect of distributions made by companies is payable at 50 per cent of the full rate.  My purpose in doing this is to reduce the difficulties which the introduction of ACT creates for some companies still enjoying the benefits of capital allowances in respect of investment which was decided upon on the basis of projections of returns from that investment which did not take account of liability for ACT.  The effect will be that Irish companies will have had the benefit of the reduced rate for a period of almost three years.</P>
    <P>I turn now to indirect taxation.  Part II of the Bill which concerns customs and excise deals for the most part with changes already announced in the budget.  Some additional measures of a minor nature are included; these deal with management of the table waters duty and betting duty, the time limit on taking proceedings for excise duty cases in the District Court and the penalty for having unlicensed gaming machines on a registered premises.</P>
    <P>I would draw special attention to section 32 which provides that horsepower will be replaced by engine cubic capacity, expressed in cubic centimetres, as the road tax chargeable unit.  This change is being made in order to bring our law into conformity with EC requirements.  It will not result in any change in the amount <Col N="1459" /> of tax payable in respect of any motor vehicle.</P>
    <P>Part III of the Bill gives effect to the rationalisation of the VAT system introduced by the budget.  The system now comprises, under section 42 of the Bill, just three main rates, namely, zero, 10 and 23 per cent.  This new system will have a number of important positive effects.  The abolition of the 35 per cent rate provides a significant stimulus across a wide range of economic activity.  A number of individual sectors &mdash; especially the tourism and newspaper industries &mdash; will benefit from special reductions in taxation.  The changes will bring about a considerable reduction in the cash flow burden of the VAT at import system, both by reducing the overall impact of that system and by spreading the burden over a wider range of importers.  Finally, the reduction in the complexity of the rate structure should have a big impact on the administrative and compliance costs of the tax for traders and facilitate better administration of the system.</P>
    <P>Given the need to maintain Exchequer revenue from VAT, these advantages cannot be gained without some costs. However, it should be noted that the effect of the increases in the VAT rates on most footwear, clothing and fuel on domestic productive activity in the areas concerned will be limited because of the relatively high proportions of such goods which are imported.  The increased rate on construction activity must be seen against the background of the continuing support for this important sector in the Public Capital Programme, the doubling to £2,000 of the housing grant for first time house buyers and the deferment to 1 May of the increased VAT rate for new private housing, as provided for in section 53.</P>
    <P>Section 54 of the Bill imposes the levy on the banks which was announced in the budget.  The base period is being extended from three to 12 months to give a more representative base and to counteract any tendency to manipulate deposit holdings so as to reduce and individual bank's liability in respect of the <Col N="1460" /> levy.  Deposits held in foreign currencies will be excluded from the base in order to make the holding of such deposits in domestic branches more attractive.</P>
    <P>The budget proposal to exempt from capital acquisitions tax inheritances taken between spouses is confirmed in section 58.  There is evidence that the imposition of a tax on the surviving spouse in such circumstances creates some hardship.  The rationale of an inheritance tax is that it should be a tax on property moving between generations and thus it is not appropriate that it should apply on inheritance when a spouse is the beneficiary.</P>
    <P>Section 59 provides for the exemption of the proceeds of insurance policies from capital acquisitions tax where these policies have been executed solely for the purpose of meeting the tax liability.  This is intended as a protection for people who may face a large inheritance tax liability and who may be obliged to dispose of assets, which are not liquid, to meet this liability.  The exemption is confined to policies which are issued exclusively for payment of capital acquisitions tax.  I do not envisage that this will involve any significant tax loss: on the contrary, it should have the beneficial effect of a speedier collection of capital acquisitions tax in some instances.</P>
    <P>Sections 60 and 61 provide for reliefs where a double capital tax arises on the same events.  Section 63 provides relief from discretionary trust tax in cases where a property, which is the subject of a discretionary trust, ultimately comes into the possession of the State.  Because of an unusual combination of circumstances, it is possible that an unreasonable double charge to capital acquisitions tax may arise and it is only fair that there should be relief in such a situation.  There is no merit in imposing a charge on a property that is to come into State ownership.</P>
    <P>In section 66, statutory provision is made in respect of the requirement announced in the national plan that contributions be made by Bord Telecom to the Exchequer over the next three years. <Col N="1461" /> The section also provides that full compensation will be given to Bord Telecom over a period in respect of these payments.</P>
    <P>The section in the Bill that has received most attention since publication is section 67.  This provides that tax free Government securities may be issued to wholly owned subsidiaries of foreign companies which are carrying on a trade here.  The intention behind this is to reduce outflows of profits and to retain a source of funding for the Exchequer that would otherwise be lost.  The securities may be denominated in Irish or in foreign currency.  The latest information on repatriations of profits and dividends relates to the year 1983, when the figure amounted to £660 million.  I have no estimate as to what impact a new investment facility on special terms may have on this outflow. There have been indications, however, of significant interest in a facility of this nature and it is only sensible that we should make special arrangements to tap whatever resources might be available.</P>
    <P>These arrangements will complement existing Government policy in this area which is to encourage reinvestment in Ireland of the profits of Irish subsidiaries of foreign-owned firms by creating an attractive investment environment here. I cannot specify at this point what the precise terms of a security issued under this section might be.  The purpose of the section is simply to provide the enabling authority for the issue of securities of this nature, and the precise details of such securities will be determined at a later date.</P>
    <P>I am continuing with a detailed examination of the scope of this measure and of some technical aspects.  It is possible that I may introduce some amendments to this section at the Committee Stage of the Bill.  As I have said, the purpose of the section is to encourage the retention of profits here and for this reason the new facility must be available to foreign-owned enterprises generally which are engaged in bona fide trading activities here.</P>
    <P>The Bill incorporates substantial changes in our taxation system.  There <Col N="1462" /> has been general agreement on the need for rationalisation of the system, which has grown increasingly complex, and this thinking is reflected in the Bill.  A simpler tax system is not alone more efficient but it tends to have beneficial economic effects.  It is also compatible with the aim of achieving greater tax equity and a fairer distribution of taxation.  As we cut down on the multiplicity of rates and exercise tighter control on exemptions and reliefs, we establish a better basis for the achievement of a fairer system.  One of the central points repeatedly made by the Commission on Taxation in their reports to date is that we must simplify our tax structure.  I entirely agree with this and the changes in income tax and VAT which are incorporated in the Finance Bill are a big step forward towards a much more rationial system of taxation.</P>
    <P>Within the constraints imposed upon me by the requirements of the budget, I will be trying to push this trend further over the next few years and I am confident that there is room for further significant progress.  I commend the Finance Bill to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The content and style of the Minister's speech today might be appropriate if the economy were on a secure basis with some central direction, and if we did not have the level of economic depression which apparently is visible to all except the Minister and also a general depression in morale and a leakage in investment and employment opportunities which have become all too common and characteristic in the past two years.</P>
      <P>The Minister said:</P>
      <P>Consequently, in lowering the budget deficit to meet the target in the plan, the emphasis must be on reducing public expenditure rather than increasing taxation.  We are committed to adjusting income tax bands and allowances so that the overall tax burden on income tax payers will not increase.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Any Minister who is capable of presenting that as a statement of the present <Col N="1463" /> position and the policies of the Government over the past two years is capable of misrepresenting anything.  An Opposition spokesman has a very thin line to follow.  Unfortunately there is widespread depression.  Our role is to be sharply critical of Government failure. The Government's failure is so obvious in every direction that one is slightly reluctant to further undermine morale by giving more evidence of that failure in any public debate.</P>
    <P>Everyone but the Minister, who seems to live in splendid isolation, recognises that unemployment is still a horrible reality.  Emigration is rampant as any Deputy in this House can tell.  Parents are concerned about their children's future. Wives are concerned about their husbands' employment opportunities. Despite that awful reality, in a very calm and apparently self-satisfied manner the Minister said:</P>
    <P>Since the beginning of the year we have seen some encouraging economic developments.  The end-March live register figures showed a significant improvement over the trend in the previous few months.</P>
    <P>If it is to be claimed as an achievement that we will not witness a continuing spiral of growth in unemployment from 234,000 to 250,000 or 300,000, then this Government have set themselves a very limited and miserable target, indeed. There must be a point at which the ceiling has been reached, with some slight reduction in unemployment.  How can any Minister, particularly on the basis of seasonal adjustments, speak of evidence of significant improvement?  That suggests that the Government, and the Minister in particular, either lack experience of commercial reality or have isolated themselves from attempting to cope with that awful reality and are living in a totally detached world, presenting as achievements what the facts clearly demonstrate as disasters.</P>
    <P>I shall give some examples of that crushing reality which faces us all and I should have thought that even at this <Col N="1464" /> stage they would have activated the Minister.  That is the only reference to unemployment in this very calm, detached statement from the Minister.  He said that this debate offers the opportunity for discussion on overall strategies for the economy, and the public finances in particular, because if reflects the policies of the budget and the rest of us are now invited, which invitation we propose to accept, to comment on these overall strategies.  However, the Minister primarily responsible confines himself to what could have been adequately done by means of an explanatory memorandum from the civil servants of his Department. A memo which could have been introduced here and put on a tape recorder would have done the job as effectively as the Minister has done today.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>I was all too correct last year, I regret to say.  I shall give the Minister facts and figures from last year's debate and what has ensued in the meantime, to prove just how right I was.  I do not want to have the opportunity of coming back next year and saying the same thing.  It is time that the man who occupies the position of Minister for Finance, with particular responsibility for setting a direction for national economic renewal, found some degree of stimulation, inspiration or capacity to present a challenge to the people outside this House who will eventually determine whether we are to pull ourselves out of this terrible depression.  The Government's role is no more and no less than to create a climate in which those who have the energy, capacity and ability to do something will be encouraged to do it.  This Government have taken the other role.  They have ensured, by confining themselves to regulating and controlling tax revenue and tinkering at the edges with the little things presented today&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

Those who will at some time &mdash; I do not know how long the delay will be &mdash; have the means of renewing this economy again &mdash; the business people, farmers, workers, young people, will be given a clear signal, which certainly is not evident from this introduction this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I imagine that the representative presence of the Labour Party which has been a characteristic of any economic debate in this House since I came in as Opposition spokesman will remain as representative as it is at this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a fairly similar representation to that of the Deputy's own party here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be enough of my party here by the time Deputy Molony has heard from all of us.  I invite any one member of the Labour Party to come in during the course of this debate and tell us clearly and directly that he or she welcomes the provisions of this Bill in respect of income tax, PRSI and levies, welcomes and supports what this Bill is doing to cope with unemployment and welcomes the adjustments in relation to capital acquisitions tax and the other little tinkering adjustments that the Minister is introducing with regard to the inheritance tax.  Through the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I am asking any one member of the Labour Party to say that the Minister of the Government with which he or she is involved represents his or her view, that the Bill the Minister is asking us to accept is the Bill that he or she is supporting as the answer to the problems that are so obvious to us all and is consistent with the policies that the Labour Party sometimes present themselves as representing.  We did not have one Labour Party member present last year, or the previous year, but perhaps this year one will say that this Bill has his or her full-blooded support, or will have the honesty to say that this is exactly opposed <Col N="1466" /> to all that the Labour Party ever stood for and that the Labour Party representatives propose to demonstrate their opposition by the manner in which they respond to it.</P>
      <P>Let us turn to what is in the Bill in relation to income tax.  This year the biggest single increase will be again in the whole tax revenue area, in income tax, in which the PAYE sector will now contribute £1,860 million &mdash; £178 million more than last year.  They are being asked to believe &mdash; a smaller number of them, incidentally, still fortunate enough to be at work &mdash; that this Bill is a move towards tax equity and relieving the burden on the PAYE sector.  Let me put it further in context, that when an increase or burden can be presented by a Minister as a lightening of burden, then facts fly out the window.  One can then say anything in the face of those facts, make bland statements like the Minister's this afternoon.</P>
      <P>Let me place some facts on the record. Since this Minister took office, income tax has increased from £1,459 million at the end of 1982 to £2,191 million this year, an increase projected in the budget table in front of me here of about 40 per cent in less than three years.  We are being told by this Minister that that represents a major step towards tax reform and towards lightening the load on the PAYE sector.  If that can be said in the face of those facts, let the public recognise that whatever this Government say is very different from what they do.  Those who get the message of the Government's point of view across are not here in the House to could the issue and when they are not, the facts speak for themselves. Those facts totally repudiate what the Minister says in introducing this legislation. In the course of the statement which he issued when this Bill was published he said:</P>
      <P>The provisions incorporated in the Bill are a big step forward towards a demonstrably fairer and more efficient system of taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at that big step forward and <Col N="1467" /> see precisely how big it is, how demonstrably fairer and more efficient the system will be as a consequence.  When the Minister came into office, total tax revenue was just over £4,000 million.  As a consequence of this Bill, total tax revenue will now be £5,704 million, that is, an increase in just over two years of £1,700 million or almost a 42 per cent increase in the total taxation levied since the Minister came to office.  Even allowing for inflation, the total level of taxation here has reached crisis proportions and this Bill is adding to that burden.  Yet, this Minister can tell us it is evidence of the policies of the Government to move towards greater equity in tax.  I could quote not one but 20 examples from the address of the Minister last year and the previous year where he said precisely the same thing as he said today but at the end of the day the achievements of this Government are very different.</P>
    <P>It is not surprising that we have the highest direct and indirect taxes in Europe, and that is a matter of record for some time.  It is not surprising those high tax levels are undermining every positive element in the economy, from the incentive to work of the employee to the incentive to invest of the entrepreneur. People when asked questions on this subject give the same response. Deputy Molony will be aware of an example of what I am saying that obtains in our constituency and this is representative of what is happening elsewhere.  I will take the example of a meat processing industry in my constituency and in that of Deputy Molony.  I have figures &mdash; and I will give them on Committee Stage &mdash; to demonstrate to the Minister that as a consequence of going on a three day week in a meat processing industry workers receive only £2 less in take home pay than they would if they worked a five day week with considerable overtime.  The workers have approached me and have asked me what this means.  I may as well say that the industry is in Roscrea, although it could have been in Thurles or Nenagh. When workers reach the point where they receive only an extra £2 for working a <Col N="1468" /> five day week plus overtime than for working a three day week, it is obvious that something is drastically wrong.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>It was worse before the Government passed the Social Welfare Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the figures I have given it is not surprising that in the returns for the first quarter of this year there has been a significant decrease in income tax.  This shows the effects of the high levels of taxation and the reactions of those who are on marginal rates or of business people who find that the game is not worth the candle.  The Minister must accept that a reducing pool of employed people have to meet an increasing taxation bill and, consequently, the burden must increase, not lessen.  That is the dilemma of the Minister and, more important, of the economy.  I have pointed out that there has been an increase of over 40 per cent in the total taxation levied since this Minister came to office.  We have to remember that until he came to office we did not have an income levy, special levies and so on.  All of these are new but they are deductions from the take-home pay, as the Commission on Taxation have pointed out, and they should be included in the general approach to income tax reform which this Bill does not deal with.</P>
      <P>It is obvious that the Government have a problem.  They had a problem when they started in office and it is much worse now.  Although it seems hardly fair to quote it now, the Minister has told us we are making progress towards reducing the current budget deficit.  We are told we will have nice adjustments so that at the end of the plan the deficit will be about 5 per cent.  We have been told this by the same Minister who said he would eliminate the deficit over four years but the result has been an increase.  Words can mean what this Minister tells us they mean.  Therefore, if he tells us today we will have a nice, gradual, phased and sensitive reduction in the budget deficit to about 5 per cent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;I think we can take that to mean a nice, sensitive, gradual increase of about 10 per cent at the end of the plan, if the words uttered by this Minister in the past few years are any guide.  If we were seeing some correction in the fiscal aggregates of the economy, if we were seeing some balance introduced or some progress being made on the books, we could be reasonably happy and say that at least they are getting the book records right.  However, it must be stated that the book records are anything but right.  We are getting the worst of all worlds.  Even with the huge increase in taxation, the current budget deficit will increase from £1,039 million last year to £1,234 million this year.  Last year it was 7.2 per cent of GNP and this year it will be 7.9 per cent of GNP.</P>
      <P>Today I had written questions to the Minister asking him how he was going to ensure he achieved the savings mentioned after the budget of £30 million in pay and £28.6 million in general savings. All I got from him was the bland assertion that the Government are monitoring the trends to ensure that the savings will be achieved.  One can reasonably ask if that is a real answer to the question.  There is a committee under the chairmanship of a most unlikely person, namely, the Minister for Defence, whom I thought had a rather different responsibility in Government than that of monitoring and controlling Government expenditure.  The Government have said they are monitoring, observing and regulating and we are supposed to accept that the aims and achievements have been realised.  I ask the Minister, when he is replying to this debate, to give us a list identifying where they are incorporated in the revised Estimates which I have not seen in detail yet.  Otherwise it will be very difficult for anyone to track down and to test the reality of the proposed savings that have been mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was the budget deficit.  Let us examine now another area where we are supposed to be making progress, an area <Col N="1470" /> in which this Government gave firm commitments before entering office, an area they said they would regulate and control. I am talking about the Exchequer borrowing requirement.  As part of Government policy, of which this Bill is an instrument, this year our borrowing requirement will increase from £1,825 million in 1984, 12½ per cent of gross national product, to £2,019 million, or 13 per cent of gross national product.  That is some progress in correcting the fiscal area of the economy.</P>
    <P>I want to relate all of these problems to the income tax question.  We have reached the stage now at which Central Fund charges and public sector pay generally equal, wait for it &mdash; and this is some progress &mdash; 83 per cent of total tax revenue.  The figure in 1984 was 80.5 per cent.  Therefore between 1984 and the current year we are making further progress by swallowing up an extra 2½p, bringing the figure to 83 pence in the £ of all tax collected to meet debt service charges and public sector pay.  Yet the Minister tells us they are making progress on their targets.  If those are their targets they are welcome to them because nobody else would regard that as progress.</P>
    <P>The one area in which we have seen an adjustment effected by this Government has been on the capital expenditure side as distinct from the current expenditure side.  There has been a significant adjustment there because that must bear the burden of the fiscal rectitude policies of this Government.  There are many places in which such adjustments can be made &mdash; for example, stopping certain capital programmes.  In money terms they have fallen back this year by 3.4 per cent over 1984, which in real terms will amount to approximately a 10 per cent reduction.  I might give one example of where this Government and Minister have achieved a significant reduction on the capital side, but at great cost to the whole social fabric of this nation, to the whole penal and legal reform systems.  I refer to their determination to cancel the prison development programme under way when they assumed office.  Instead we have had <Col N="1471" /> the <i>ad hoc</i> reactions of the past couple of weeks.  When £12 million had already been spent on site development, professional fees and so on this Government of fiscal rectitude came into office and cancelled that enlightened programme.</P>
    <P>I know no Minister for Finance wants to have to spend money unless it is proven to be necessary, not just by way of penal reform in the harsh sense of the word but rather by way of an enlightened penal programme.  When that proposal was put to me as Minister for Finance, like the present Minister I would not have been an enthusiast any more than he about spending money in any such direction. But because the need was proven to me in 1980 I went along with the proposal and that programme had been developed in detail by the time this Minister assumed office.  His first act was to axe it, with the present consequences.  Our courts are a laughing stock, our Garda are frustrated, our prison officers watch fellows knocking on the door, going home again, and we open Spike Island. That is the type of fiscal rectitude being meted out by this Government, cutting back on capital programmes in every area where current expenditure is growing with no attempt whatever to gain any degree of control.</P>
    <P>Let us examine another general economic area in which we were to make progress, that is if one were to believe the statements of this Government before assuming office and almost daily and monthly since assuming office that, according to them, they are tackling our foreign debt and the level of our foreign borrowing.  Their major commitment is to reduce the level of State indebtedness. They have a fine way of reducing it.  It would appear now that at year end the national debt will be as close to £21 billion as makes no difference.  That is seen to be under way already from the latest figures issued by the Minister.  That figure increased from £12.8 billion since they came into office to approximately £21 billion at the end of the current year. That is some progress.  I suppose that is something that will also be presented as <Col N="1472" /> constituting a sensitive, balanced approach to the economy, a correction of the mistakes of their predecessors, a level of discipline and control which they contend has been long overdue.</P>
    <P>I asked the Minister a question on 27 February last in the House seeking the figures for the total national debt and also the foreign debt component of that figure, when he gave the figures I have just quoted.  In view of those figures I asked the Minister then if he would make a statement in view of that huge increase, which is a matter of major national concern. But he blandly stated that he had no further statement to make on the matter. Any Minister capable of dismissing that kind of disastrous growth in our national debt, of saying simply that he had no further statement to make on the matter, should begin to reflect a little on whether he should begin to take some action. While he may have no further statement to make lots of other people are making statements about it which, unfortunately, are undermining confidence in our economy. To that extent at least the Minister should feel obliged to make a statement on the matter&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We find the reality to be very different. Our foreign debt at the end of 1984 was £8 billion and the total State foreign debt at the year end was £10 billion.  We are making no progress towards reducing either our national or foreign debt, which foreign debt has almost doubled since this Minister assumed office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the kinds of facts one is almost reluctant to place on the table again but they must be in an endeavour somehow to rouse the Minister or the Government to the reality of which everybody else is aware but themselves. Did not somebody last Sunday appear to <Col N="1473" /> express the reality in a different way? Former Deputy Richie Ryan spoke publicly last Sunday and the publicity surrounding his statement was significant. One wonders whether the ploy was: Oh, very much in tune with Government, now that we see the message coming through that the public have lost confidence in this Government the one message to be got across now is that things are so bad that the one thing one cannot look to is a change of Government.

      <P>By the time I have finished I will have gone into much more detail on what this Bill contains and what it does not contain than the Minister did in his bland statement.  The Minister said we were enabled here to discuss the overall trends of the economy and the progress being made towards achieving Government targets.</P>
      <P>Another major factor affecting all sectors is interest rates.  The Minister, in an effort to meet the borrowing target to fund his deficit last year and to bridge the gap between what he raised in taxation and what was required for public expenditure, took a rigid decision, despite our arguments against it and our belief that a Minister should not put himself into a straitjacket, to raise £1 billion domestically for the Government programme.  We all know the consequences.  At a time when international interest rates were coming down and when all the signs were favourable for falling interest rates, our interest rates were rising as a consequence of this blind decision which seems to have been taken so that we could assert that we would limit foreign borrowing and raise the money domestically.  The Government soaked up all the funds in the domestic money market.  They brought unnecessary artificial pressures to bear on the banking sector so that last December our interest rates went up by 2 per cent when every development sector in this economy was already struggling under the burden of interest rates. If the Minister had listened to the people he would have known that the consequences of that decision would be damaging to the economy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We now find that, when all the trends internationally are still downwards and when we should have a greater reduction in interest rates, instead of coming back to where we were last December, the best that can be achieved for the hard-pressed borrower, investor or house owner is a 1¼ per cent reduction.  How can we expect to generate tax revenue from sectors that are so depressed that they are not investing? This should be part of an overall strategy. But the Minister does not see it that way with the consequence that we are still way above the level of interest rates which obtained before last December, when interest rates should have been coming down, and it is affecting every productive sector.  Market conditions are such that if we hope for any renewal in the economy we must have a further major reduction in interest rates.  Otherwise this game in which we are engaged, in tinkering and adjusting, will be seen by people as being even more irrelevant than it is.</P>
      <P>I noticed that the Minister in his speech did not seem to be aware of the impact of the 5 per cent increase in VAT on the construction industry.  Did nobody tell him?  Did the Minister not meet the crowds of builders who came to this city some time ago, has he not met them in his constituency and has he not been told day in day out of the disastrous effects of the 5 per cent increase?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>At the same time I proposed a different structure of VAT.  The Deputy belongs to the party who gave us VAT.  You have not a clue about what we are supposed to be doing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the 5 per cent increase in VAT the Minister said in his speech that as a concession to allow for transitional difficulties the VAT change in respect of new private house building would not take effect until 1 May.  That is some concession &mdash; they are cut out there cheering for you.</P>
      <P>In relation to what direction a Bill of this kind might take, taxation does not always have to be a penal disincentive. It can sometimes be an instrument of Government policy to meet the most challenging needs of the economy.  The youngest boy in a class would tell us that unemployment is our biggest problem. For what should we look in a Finance Bill or a budget which might somehow encourage some incentive in that direction? The Commission on Taxation pointed out, as did the Government's &ldquo;wise men&rdquo; in their plan for a plan, that our current tax system discriminates against employment costs in favour of capital costs.  That is all too obvious to everybody except, apparently, the Minister. Labour intensive activities are being crucified as a consequence of the increases in the PRSI, levies and taxation generally.  Later I will give examples to illustrate.  On the other hand those who chose to invest in capital equipment as distinct from the labour intensive industry got lots of tax breaks to encourage them to do more.  One would imagine that we had full employment although we are trying to export labour as distinct from trying to encourage employment creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill &mdash; I mentioned this last year and the year before &mdash; does not do anything to adjust that imbalance.  The Commission on Taxation said that our taxation system should at least be neutral as between employment costs and capital investment, but it is quite the other way. I should like to give an example in relation to the level of corporation tax, the company's tax contribution which is devoted to pay-roll costs.  In 1964 &mdash; I accept that I am going back some but it is important that we should consider the matter &mdash; one quarter of contributions from companies to tax revenue derived <Col N="1477" /> from pay-roll costs.  In 1984 three-quarters of company's contribution to tax revenue derived from pay-roll costs.  Surely that is telling us something that must be corrected.  In 1964 things were fairly buoyant and we did not discourage employment through all the various levies such as PRSI and the other contributions heaped upon employers.  The Minister did not make any reference to that today or last year; I do not suppose he will ever make reference to it.  Apparently, he cannot begin to address the glaring anomaly that has been pointed out by his own advisers, by the Commission on Taxation and, most of all, by those in the field, between the system of taxation that penalises employment and encourages investment instead in capital equipment.  Sometimes that equipment is not necessarily very productive.  It can be anything from wallpaper to partitions or equipment in some of the big accountancy firms in Dublin.</P>
    <P>The Government have introduced all types of schemes, what they call social incentive schemes, but those of us who meet the children who are being given the advantage of those schemes know the reality: they amount to tinkering, they do not mean anything.  An industrialist I met recently told me bluntly that he has not time to be helped by those in the State service who apparently are paid to help him.  He was talking about the agencies in the Department of Labour where there has been the biggest single growth of any sector under the Government.  At a time when we are cutting back in productive areas such as agriculture, education and in other aspects of productive activity such as the construction industry, the Government, who tell us they are controlling public expenditure, have &ldquo;cut back&rdquo; on the administration of the Department of Labour to such an extent that there has been an increase of more than 44 per cent over last year's figure. The cost now represents £160 million. That money has been provided for the agencies of the Department of Labour and our children are being sent here and there for training and interviews daily. At the same time the Government have <Col N="1478" /> provided for our most important productive sector, agriculture, a total of £250 million, which in real terms represents a cut-back.  What Government can claim that this amounts to maximising our resources, using our potential to advantage?</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Because we are using other people's money for agriculture.  The Deputy is forgetting the Common Agricultural Policy.  I have never heard such a tissue of fabrication.  It is terrible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am referring to such things as the farm development programme which is included in the Book of Estimates.  That publication also tells the story about the allocation for agencies of the Department of Labour, £160 million, or an increase of 44 per cent over the previous year.  Is that control of current expenditure?  That allocation is being made at a time when we are cutting back on education, agriculture and anything productive.  The Minister does not seem to want to accept those facts which are contained in the Book of Estimates.</P>
      <P>In terms of PRSI the Minister has increased it to 12.2 per cent or 2 per cent more than last year.  Is that the best way to encourage employers to employ extra people?  That, as the Commission on Taxation pointed out, should be included in terms of overall taxation.  As far as workers and employers are concerned everything in the form of a deduction from profits or take home pay represents taxation.  It is time we faced up to that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have been saying that for some considerable time.  In case the Minister has forgotten, I should like to remind him that I set up the Commission on Taxation in 1980.  They carried out a very professional, comprehensive and practical job.  The Minister told us that he made some moves towards meeting the recommendations of the commission. Is the Minister telling the House that his moves towards adopting the recommendations of the commission amount to dropping some of the provisions he introduced?  I am referring to the levels of VAT.  The Minister inherited three levels of VAT and he increased that number to six.  The Minister increased the level of top income tax to 65 per cent and this year he reduced it to 60 per cent. Does he regard that as progress towards adopting the recommendations of the commission?</P>
      <P>The Minister has gone a lot further in every direction than what I have outlined, and he is aware of it.  The point I have been making in regard to discrimination against employment creation were referred to in the commission's report.  I should like to deal with the impact of the income tax changes on employees.  They know that the great promise that they would be paying less tax this year than last year somehow is not reflected in their take home pay.  When people call to my clinics and question me about this I cannot explain to them how one reconciles the two things.  In the case of single people the tax levels were reduced from 65 per cent to 60 per cent.  Last year a single person reached the maximum level at £10,686 but this year, due to the concessions of the Minister, he reaches the same level at £600 less, £10,086.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The constituent who called to me may have been conscious of the fact that by raising the employee's health contribution ceiling the highest marginal tax rate now operates at 68.5 per cent compared to 70 per cent.  Is the Minister telling us that that represents significant progress towards equity and tax reduction for the PAYE sector?  I accept that the lower end of the scale is very important but there is a big problem in regard to skilled workers.  We cannot have semi-skilled workers unless there are skilled personnel.  We will not have further employment for semi-skilled or non-skilled workers unless we have the skilled worker or the specialist directing and pioneering the way.  If he is not there to open up new avenues or create new opportunities the semi-skilled or the unskilled worker has no hope of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We will be debating this in further detail this evening and tomorrow.  The Minister should take a look at some of the countries which are doing somewhat better than we are.  He will find that in countries such as Japan, Switzerland and even Norway a huge proportion of those going into first-time employment have third level qualifications.  The proportion is as high as 45 per cent in Japan.  We wonder why they can generate added value through new technology and generate employment in spin-off industries.  It <Col N="1481" /> is because they invest in the real wealth &mdash; education.  They have the capacity to add value but we do not.  We tinker and make adjustments here and there and wonder why we have an unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>In relation to PRSI I would make a formal plea to the Minister not to discriminate against labour-intensive industries or enterprises in favour of capital-intensive enterprises.  Secondly I would ask him to introduce a selective reduction of employers' PRSI contributions for new permanent employment.  There should be some grade of reduction for new employees and it should not be beyond the wit or imagination of the Minister and his advisers to devise it.  At a time when we want to encourage people to generate sustainable employment as distinct from short-term schemes and passing notions of one form or another, the Minister must see that the burden of PRSI contributions is a barrier.  I made that appeal last year as well.  Neither of these measures would have any major effect on tax revenue; in time they would generate considerable revenue through buoyancy.</P>
    <P>Ours is by definition an open economy dependent on our capacity to exploit export markets.  Within the past couple of weeks an official report from within the Government service pointed out that our marketing strategy and capacity is deplorably weak.  It confirms what most of us already know.  It has emerged from a number of studies that the level of our penetration in EC countries is on a par with that of Malta.  That says a lot.  If one looks on the shelves of supermarkets all over Europe one will see the products of Irish Distillers and Bailey's Irish Cream and, I hope Ballygowan.  There will be no others.  I do not blame Córas Tráchtála since there have been cutbacks and we cannot just rely on a semi-State organisation.</P>
    <P>The report pointed out that the weakness in many of our exporting companies was clearly their lack of awareness of market trends abroad and their lack of capacity to exploit those trends and feed back the information to the production line at home.  The only way to become <Col N="1482" /> familiar with the trends in any market is to live in that market.  One has to know the market, its habits, style and consumer trends.  One must know how people dress, how they play, how they eat &mdash; everything about them.  Nonetheless the Government refuse to give any incentive to marketing personnel who will spend perhaps 100 days of 300 working days abroad.  They are to be taxed on exactly the same basis as if they were working exclusively at home.  That is ignoring the need to send people out into the market place and to encourage them with the incentive of tax adjustment.  People at home would accept that marketing personnel should be encouraged to research markets abroad and feed back information to their own companies or to a conglomeration of companies.</P>
    <P>We must accept that as an island we have a linguistic and geographical disadvantage as compared with the French, the Dutch, Germans, Danes and Belgians in supplying the European market.  We do not even begin to offer incentives by way of tax adjustments for marketing personnel abroad.  Two weeks ago the official Government report stated that our marketing performance was deplorably weak.  In the course of the debate on the Finance Bill in both 1983 and 1984 I appealed to the Minister to offer those adjustments, which would cost little or nothing to the Revenue but the impact of which on our economy would be enormous. The Minister did not listen and clearly has not asked what can be done to boost our marketing personnel and give them an incentive to get out into the market.  Such an incentive is not offered this year and will not be offered next year if this Minister is still in office.  That is the third element which could have been introduced into this Finance Bill to make it in some way sensitive to the needs of the economy.</P>
    <P>Where is the incentive to encourage and promote product development?  We are told that the IDA are to concentrate on it.  It is time they did so, although I do not see much evidence of any results to date.  Where is the incentive in our tax system?  Companies get more tax breaks in respect of investment in physical <Col N="1483" /> assets, such as buildings which are lying idle, than in respect of research and development or marketing programmes. We must wake up to the reality and try to incorporate some of those matters in this finance legislation.</P>
    <P>I now refer to the special venture capital scheme which was introduced last year. The Minister has indicated that he proposes on Committee Stage to bring in amendments to the Bill to extend the scheme to relatives, to extend the start-up period for qualification and to raise the ceiling to encourage fund managers to get these schemes under way.  I will have to point out on Committee Stage that each of these proposals was made last year by me on Committee Stage of last year's Finance Bill.  They are all on the record of the Dáil.  The Minister fobbed me off each time with some response such as that it would give rise to tax evasion or open the flood gates or that it was not feasible, reasonable or necessary.  I was calmly put down on those specific proposals.  Twelve months later the Minister tells us blandly that this is to be extended without giving any explanation for the failure of last year's scheme.  Such extension does not meet the potential.  We asked specifically that relatives be not excluded.  Deputy Molony must recall this.  So far as I remember, he supported that proposal at the time.  However, the Minister did not accept those proposals.  We gave the reasons for extending the start-up period. An investor should not be penalised if, after investing in a fund, the enterprise concerned is not proceeded with.  However, we were wasting our time last year in putting forward that case just as we were wasting our time in proposing that there be a limit on the earnings of the fund managers.</P>
    <P>The record shows that in the past 12 months that scheme which was so widely discussed and in which many of us placed much hope succeeded only in launching two funds.  Is that not a total condemnation of the inadequacy of what was introduced by the Minister last year?  Perhaps that failure has had some effect in so <Col N="1484" /> far as the Minister's action this year is concerned but he is not going far enough in this proposal.  We asked especially last year that the service sector be not excluded from the benefit of the new scheme.  Is there any rule which provides that a job in the service sector is not as sustainable or as important as a job in the manufacturing sector?  Has the evidence not been the other way for some time?  If there is growth in any sector, that growth is in the service sector.</P>
    <P>The same applies elsewhere.  Internationally growth in employment is in the service sector, whether in tourism or in other area or even in the construction industry.  In America, for instance, growth in employment has been exclusively in the service sector.  In that country numbers employed in manufacturing industry are more or less the same as they were 20 years ago.  There has been at least a 2 per cent growth per annum there.  The same position obtains in Japan and in Switzerland and in any other country whose example and success we would like to emulate.</P>
    <P>However, despite all our appeals last year, the Government's proposals were far too restrictive and complex.  Some 22 pages in last year's Act related to this scheme.  It was so complex that no one but the most sophisticated accountant would have had either the time or the ability to determine who would qualify for inclusion in the scheme.  We are trying to encourage ordinary investors, employees or anyone else who has a little to invest to participate in the scheme.  We warned the Minister last year that the very purpose of the introduction of the scheme would be defeated by the restrictiveness and complexity of it.  Unfortunately, we were proved right.  Any legislation that is the subject of the amount of time and discussion involved in this case must be worth dealing with properly.</P>
    <P>The relatively minor amendments being made now to the venture capital scheme will not meet the potential.  I do not understand why the amendments have not been incorporated in the Bill.  It is ridiculous that when a Bill is published, <Col N="1485" /> all the relevant proposals are not published also.  I have no wish to criticise unfairly any official of the Minister's Department or any of the advisers in the Revenue Commissioners but one must ask if all their time is being spent in sealing possible loopholes and by ensuring that when the scheme comes into operation it will be accompanied by another lengthy complex document.  We must not have amendments that are so complex and restrictive as to be incapable of being understood.  Could we not have learned from the mistakes of the British in relation to similar legislation?  Could we not have adopted most of that part of their similar legislation that has been successful?</P>

      <P>That is what we said last year.  Are the people in Merrion Square intending to spend all their time treating the people outside as pawns and ensuring that there is not even a tiny loophole in the scheme?  If so, we will be encased in the same sort of negative game that has apparently occupied the mind of the Minister in the past two years.  That is not the business of a Minister for Finance. If he has an idea he should bring it forward instead of trying to kill it before it is even presented.</P>
      <P>All businesses but small businesses particularly are crying out for a signal for the creation of a business climate that will encourage investment, employment creation and business development.  The Minister should clarify whether he wishes that sort of environment to be created because in the event of such a climate not being created, there will continue an outflow of funds from the country, an outflow of the kind witnessed this year particularly.  I know of many people who have deliberately invested their funds outside Ireland.  Isle of Man Investors have held a conference here to encourage investment from Ireland and they have had major success.  The result for us has been a disaster.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The investing of Irish money abroad is <Col N="1486" /> one of the major problems in our economy. It is part of the black hole to which I will refer later and with which the Minister is not dealing in this Bill.  Another aspect of revenue yield is the yield from excise duty.  The Government, some commentators and perhaps some members of the public, too, laughed at us when we talked of the levels of excise duty introduced by this Government bringing about lower tax revenue from higher tax levels.  It was clear to anyone who was in contact with the commercial sector, the drinks industry generally, the electrical or any other trades affected by the high levels of excise duty and VAT that this was happening.  Let me claim some credit for getting this across to the Minister, because for the last two years during the course of these debates and in public statements which I have been making for a considerable time I stressed the fact that the levels of excise duty and VAT were not only killing enterprise but were driving revenue out of the country. If we say it, apparently it is not accepted as responsible or informed comment; but now it is proved true.  We repeated it so of ten that eventually the Minister reacted and the facts speak for themselves.</P>
    <P>I propose to give figures to show how the level of duty on beer has affected the revenue yield from that drink.  The excise duty increased to 29.5p on 12 March 1982; it increased to 33p per pint on 13 March 1982; it increased to 38.1p on 8 January 1983, to 34p on 21 February and eventually to 36p on 26 January 1984.  We warned the Minister about the effects which these increases would have but he did not listen.  Incidentally, the figures I gave came from the Minister in reply to a question which I put down on 27 February 1985.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the excise yield from beer was £227 million; in 1983, when the price had increased considerably, the yield was £232 million, an increase of £5 million, which clearly is a reduction in real terms allowing for inflation.  In 1984 it was still less than £239 million.  In other words, in those three years there had been an increase of only £13 million because of the level of increase.  In percentage terms <Col N="1487" /> it is not much more than a 5 per cent increase in money terms over the two year period, which in real terms was a dramatic decline, as anybody at any level in the trade &mdash; the publican, supplier or the brewing industry &mdash; could have told the Minister.  If he was not prepared to accept their word he could have consulted the customs officers who would have told him the same thing.  He could even have made a visit, as I did, to Carrickarnon to see for himself that every motorist coming across the Border was bringing back packets and packets of beer, among other things.  They were taking every opportunity to avoid the level of tax here. I hope the fact that we are not increasing it this year will benefit the trade.  Despite the level of general fall-off in consumption, we will not see the same level of depression in the excise duty from beer at the end of this year as has been the case in other years despite the general depression and the lack of consumer spending capacity.  There is a point of diminishing returns for higher tax levels. The hole we spoke of was very black, as is obvious from submissions I received from customs officers and others over the past 12 months.</P>
    <P>I now wish to refer to excise duty on petrol, and the fall here is even more dramatic.  It is unbelievable that the Minister did not face up to this reality. Early in 1983 the excise duty content per gallon was 85.7p.  On 31 March it went to 98.4p; on 1 April it increased to 103.2p, and in 1984 it went up to 108. 1p &mdash; an increase from 86.7p per gallon to 108.1p per gallon from early January 1983 to January 1984.  What did we get for these increases in terms of excise yield?  The excise yield in 1983 was £275 million, which, incidentally, had increased from £244 million in the previous year &mdash; the kind of jump one would expect.  In 1984 the yield was £282 million, a total increase of £7 million, which in percentage terms is a little over 2 per cent and a drop in real terms.  There is a huge drop in revenue yield for an increase from 85.7 pence to 108 pence, an increase of 23p per gallon.  We pointed this out to <Col N="1488" /> the Minister last year and that the levels of excise duty would have the opposite effect, especially in Border regions. When a motorist crosses the Border to fill the petrol tank, he or she will naturally spend money on other articles, even on things that might be cheaper this side of the Border.  We argued all this last year, but the Minister ignored us and I was told I was being facetious and irresponsible.  I was told that it was typical of Fianna Fáil to make the popular proposals, but in this instance the proposal was based on the interest of increasing revenue.</P>
    <P>I promised the Minister that I would deal with the Finance Bill in detail.  I assume he will acknowledge that the comments I am making now, and will continue to make, are on the detail of the Bill after my general introduction which I felt free to make in terms of the depressed state of the economy at present.  There was another effect of the high levels of income tax and VAT.  Deputy Leonard is very concerned about this, as are his Border colleagues.  Apart from the impact it had on the traders and on the economy of those regions generally, it was promoting the black economy in a very special way and undermining the whole basis of bona fide trading throughout the country.</P>
    <P>We will have enough problems in the course of this debate without going into the problems of the Minister for Justice and without my taking on the role and responsibility of the spokesman for Justice of our party.  Suffice it to say that many of the problems that that Minister must cope with, as must also particularly the Garda Síochána and prison staffs, derive from the general breakdown of the normal system and control in these areas. If people can cock a snook at customs officials and can engage in free smuggling, as they did &mdash; a Cheann Comhairle, I regret that the Minister is not able to wait to listen to my contribution.  He might have expected that it would not be brief.  I am glad that the Minister with responsibility for sport is deputising for him.  I do not say that in any way in criticism of the Minister with responsibility <Col N="1489" /> for sport.  It is rather a precedent that the Minister for Finance cannot wait to listen to the points being made on the Bill by the spokesman for Finance, particularly when the Minister's introduction was so pitifully inadequate, terse and smug.</P>
    <P>In any event, I am sure the Minister will have heard from the customs staff.  I have had many representations from them during the last year complaining about the impossibility of doing their job having regard to the flood of cross-Border activity and the cutback in the services. For the record of the House I will refer to the statement which they made in March 1985 in relation to Government directed cutbacks in the customs and excise service. They go in great detail into the impossibility of discharging their responsibility.  I have had that and many other statements from them and they have also submitted statements to the Minister, but they underline their case by reference to the fact that the flood of stuff across the Border and the growth of smuggling due to the high level of VAT and excise duty made it quite impossible for them to discharge their responsibility. Smugglers and habitual lawbreakers were the only ones who were gaining and that too was undermining the whole social and legal order at a time when it is all too obvious that that is a major problem indeed.</P>
    <P>Let me welcome &mdash; if that is the word &mdash; the adjustments, belated though they are, on VAT.  If one should welcome the fact that the Minister who imposed the levels of VAT and increased the levels to 6 per cent, belatedly but nonetheless effectively reduces those levels back to 3 per cent, then we welcome it.  Táimíd anbhuíoch. We are really very happy.  We feel that it is marvellous, and he claims that that is progress towards the adoption of the report of the Commission on Taxation. If that is a measure of his approach towards that reports, that is quite cynical. He did this originally against the advice of the Commission on Taxation.  Now he claims that by belatedly coming back to where he was before he started he is moving in line with the commission's <Col N="1490" /> recommendations.  They deserve a better response than that.  The only single area where the Minister can claim that he is in any way paying any attention to that commission's report is the fact that he has repented of his own mistake even 12 months later.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister is not here for this but he will be hearing a great deal about it from this side of the House.  I hope that he will be able to listen to most of this debate, if not from me then from my colleagues, because we have a fair amount to say.  I am hitting only the main areas.  I regret that he is not here to listen to my comments in relation to the impact of VAT on the building industry.  Today our newspapers report confirmation from an independent Rome-based economic expert group that our construction industry is in a very depressed condition. It is the most depressed of all the construction industries of Europe.  I have not been able to read those experts' report in detail but I hope to do so.  I do not know if those experts are aware of the significance in our country of that industry.  Most of the raw components &mdash; about 90 per cent &mdash; are home produced and of course the labour input is domestic; and for a country that is trying to generate employment that is the significance for our economy of the building industry.</P>
    <P>Now we are advised that, no matter how depressing 1984 was for that industry, unfortunately the next year will be worse.  That is from an independent group of economic experts.  We will find a 5.5 per cent decline in investment and activity in the building industry here. That must signal to many who are still surviving in the construction industry a message that must test their very sanity, whether they are small builders or fairly well established construction companies. It is now predicted confidently that that industry in 1985 will have a decline of 5.5 per cent over the level of activity of 1984, which was the year of the lowest levels of activity we have experienced.  Those experts go further &mdash; this is quite significant &mdash; and attribute the decline directly to the extra 5 per cent VAT imposition in the Minister's budget which is now <Col N="1491" /> being incorporated in this Finance Bill. All the Minister can say to the construction industry is the reference I have made: that he has made a concession to them by not charging VAT in respect of new private houses until 1 May.  That is an offence to them at this stage.  To people who are finding it next to impossible to survive in business it is an offence to present that as a concession.  It is an offence in the face of the unemployment growth in that industry.</P>
    <P>Let me mention to the Minister in this connection, in case he is not aware of it, that I am sure these people talk to Government as well as to Opposition spokesmen. Last year I mentioned that a major construction company had advised me personally, for the sake of making me aware, that 85 per cent of their investment would be outside Ireland last year, and sure as heaven it was.  It was closer to 90 per cent.  In the last 12 months I have had those who were big enough to go abroad confirming the same and the smaller ones who cannot do that are telling every Deputy in this House every day that the only option for them is to shed labour or go into liquidation.  It is happening all over the place and the Minister has chosen to ignore it.  I do not understand why.  We will not have a construction industry capable of meeting even our most minimal demands in a year or two if this trend continues.</P>
    <P>On another matter I mentioned last year, having regard to the decline in the private house building sector, let me appeal again to the Government to drop that nonsense tax, the income related property tax, which was one of the prices of this unique Government getting together a few years ago.  If a tax has any meaning it is to yield revenue.  But a tax that two years in succession yielded gross revenue of something over £1 million, probably at a net loss, having regard to the sheer physical burden on the already overburdened Revenue staff and the annoyance for people who are filling up these awful forms is a nonsense.  If it were bringing in revenue &mdash; we told the Government that it would not &mdash; it would <Col N="1492" /> mean something.  If we get a gross revenue of £1 million, then it is very clear that it is a nonsense.  I hope the Minister with responsibility for sport will convey this to his colleague, the Minister for Finance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCreed" hpid="Mr. Creed Mr. Creed">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Creed</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that any of his remarks will be conveyed to the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure they will.  I must take it as a measure of the importance which the Government attach to this debate that the Minister with responsibility for sport is here to listen to it.  I do not say that in any way as intending offences to the Minister of State, for whom I have a very high regard.  He does his job within the limits available to him.</P>
      <P>Deputy Molony is a solicitor and he will bear our what I am about to say.  The enhanced activity in the private house building sector would more than make up in stamp duty for the miserable pittance coming in under this nonsense tax.  All over this city and our towns there have been for sale signs up for a very long time because no one is prepared to buy.  I thought the Government were familiar with Dublin 4, but do they ever look at all the for sale signs in that area?  They should give the people a sign that it is all right to move to a bigger or better house, and that it is all right to improve one's house provided one pays stamp duty because one will have to pay tax in other directions in any event.  The Government would get much more by way of tax revenue if they did not have this nonsense tax, which was the price of this Coalition. I appeal to them to get rid of that tax and, among other things, to give a boost to the private house building sector.  The construction industry have been spearheading the call for the abolition of this nonsense tax.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The effect of the VAT increase on the construction industry will be to increase the VAT take by £75 million, based on the output figures for 1984-85.  This is like squeezing a duck's neck until it chokes. I am talking about private housing, agriculture, <Col N="1493" /> industrial and commercial development and the effects of this tax on them will be about £40.5 million, and £30 million will be taken from public work done by the private sector, mainly local authority housing, schools, hospitals, roads, sanitary services and public buildings, thereby reducing the capital programme in these areas by £30 million. We must recognise that fact.</P>
    <P>The output from new private housing in 1984 is estimated to have been £633 million and the VAT increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent will result in an increase of £30 million.  There is no point telling us that the extra £1,000 new house grant will go anywhere towards meeting that extra cost because it does no such thing, and people on the ground know this grant will have no impact on the already depressed private house-building sector.  The reduction in VAT on materials used in house construction has no effect on house prices because building companies registered for VAT have their VAT refunded.  I am sure this point has been made to the Minister more than once.  There is not even a cash flow advantage to these people accuring from these VAT reductions as the refunding of the VAT charged is normally effected within the credit period which operates in the building industry.  There is no incentive for the bona fide building sector in the refund to which the Minister referred.</P>
    <P>Now, new houses will be taxed at 10 per cent.  We want to encourage the private housing sector to take the burden off the public housing sector.  Secondhand houses will be taxed at between 4 per cent and 6 per cent, depending on the value of the house&mdash; 4 per cent on houses up to £50,000 and 6 per cent thereafter. This shows there is a clear bias towards secondhand houses.  This will give a further impetus to the black economy because non-registered builders will obtain their materials at the reduced cost resulting from the reduction in the VAT rates, while at the same time obtaining a 10 per cent advantage by not paying the 10 per cent VAT at point of sale.  This will give rise to further activity in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to <Col N="1494" /> try to seal of the loopholes which are the direct consequence of the imposition of this extra 5 per cent tax.  If house purchasers cannot afford to pay the increase and builders cannot afford to absorb it, inevitably this will lead to a reduction in throughput and a major reduction in the employment sector and tax receipts from employers and from the ever-diminishing pool of those employed.</P>
    <P>In the last few years we have seen a major decline in the level of private house building.  Are the Government seriously telling us that they propose to balance that decline with an increase in public house building, which is heavily funded by the taxpayers?  Will that be their way of reducing and controlling current expenditure?  Statistics published by the Department of the Environment show that the level of house completions has fallen dramatically from 23,167 in 1981 to 18,000 in 1984, a drop of over 5,000 in three years.  That decline has been primarily, and understandably, concentrated in urban areas.  The level of private house completions declined from 10,763 in 1981 to 6,550 last year.  My colleagues will deal in greater detail with the impact this is having on employment in the construction industry.  Having regard to the major problem of unemployment, I cannot understand how a Government would impose such a crushing burden on one of our most productive sectors as far as employment is concerned, a sector which uses many native products and will not affect our imports bill.</P>
    <P>I want to turn now to the announcement that the black hole has been officially acknowledged.  Last year and the previous year the Minister accused me of trying to misrepresent reality.  He accused me of being irresponsible and said that that kind of talk would damage the economy and confidence in the economy and that it was shameful for an Opposition spokesman to repeat these misrepresentations. There is a pathetic attempt in this Bill to seal off the black hole.  First, if the problem is that the multinationals, through their pricing policies, exaggerate their profits here, then this kind of adjustment <Col N="1495" /> will not in any way meet that problem. Secondly, and this is a bigger problem, we have seen many of these multinationals in recent times, funded by the taxpayers, set up here but depart in a short time to richer pastures.</P>
    <P>There is one rule about multinationals; their investment, by definition, is mobile. They move to wherever the profits will accrue.  If there is a second rule it is that their executives will move to wherever the tax climate is reasonably benign, and the third rule, which has been demonstrated here all too clearly, is that their executives will get to hell out of the place if the tax climate is hostile.  The level of taxation on income here is so far ahead of anything in other European countries, with the exception of Denmark, that any executive who would opt for domicile in Ireland would want to have a very sentimental attachment to shamrockery and the green isle of Ireland.</P>
    <P>We are satisfied that some of the decisions that were taken with such traumatic effect by multinationals in recent times would have been avoided if the hostile tax climate was not such as to discourage the personnel who were based here from settling here.  Can we imagine the reports they sent back to their head offices when they found their pay decimated by our high levels of taxation?  Can we imagine the tendency there would be to recommend a move to Spain or Portugal?  Given our levels of taxation there is no possibility of encouraging specialist personnel to base themselves permanently here.  I am talking about personnel who would be engaged in research and development, product development and marketing.  We have become almost the lego centre of the high technology industry.  We are putting the pieces together in most cases.  It has been demonstrated that if multinationals get a better deal elsewhere they leave as quickly as they came.  They take their profits and the taxpayer pays the price.  To cope with that problem the Minister introduced this typical technician approach of trying to encourage multinationals to invest in tax-free Government securities.  They are experts <Col N="1496" /> in the profit-making business and they do not have to confine themselves to tax-free Government securities.</P>
    <P>This proposal may have some limited effect but the limitations on it are similar to those which were placed on the venture capital scheme.  To qualify the subsidiary must be a company which is resident in the State and not resident elsewhere. What happens if there is a resident subsidiary somewhere else?  Secondly, it must carry on its trade in the State and the entire issue of share capital must be beneficially held by a foreign company resident in a treaty country and not under the control of Irish persons.  There may be some amendments to the Bill but, as it is drafted, it would not appear to be available to foreign companies operating here through a branch office, nor does it appear to be available to Irish resident subsidiaries which have an executive share scheme in existence or Irish resident subsidiaries availing of preference share financing or joint venture companies where any of the participants are resident in Ireland or in a non-treaty country; nor would it appear to be available to Irish resident subsidiaries which are held through tax haven holding companies. I notice we have a change of Minister &mdash; we are getting into the agricultural sector but at least we are coming nearer to the economy.  Companies carrying on a banking or insurance business are specifically included.</P>
    <P>Who has the Minister in mind as potential investors in these Government securities? The real multinational animal can spread his net as wide as he likes and catch such fish as are swimming in the best pools.  The limitations I mentioned will put this beyond the scope of many Irish companies.  It may have some effect and I would be glad to think it would but we will go into it in greater detail on Committee Stage.  However, at this stage, the verdict on it has to be the same as that on the venture capital scheme.  If the idea was worthwhile it has been so surrounded by complications that I do not believe that those the Minister wants to attract into it will have any special <Col N="1497" /> interest in it.</P>
    <P>What we have been talking about relates to the economy, the impact of Government policies or the lack of them, the level of taxation, adjustments to encourage employment, the diminished yield from high levels of tax, the hostile tax climate, the major burden on productive sectors such as the building sector and the ineffective attempts to encourage investment through the scheme introduced last year and the attempt to block off the leak from the black hole this year. That is all covered within the scope of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The indiscriminate cutbacks across the board in the public service are not doing anything to make our already overloaded tax system work.  The public and those working in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners are conscious of that.  It is frustrating for the staff who are trying to cope but who cannot cope.  They are late in sending out forms, in repaying rebates to people who are unemployed, in repaying VAT and perhaps they are late in issuing assessments and demands. When a system is in place there should be enough staff provided to make it work. This system is a basic element in our economic structure and should be allowed to operate.  Customs officers are screaming about the impossibility of doing their job at the airports, ports and cross-Border points.  Tax officials who cannot get out the forms have been screaming as well.</P>
    <P>There is talk about the low of revenue from farmers.  There are two reasons for that.  One is the low level of economic activity in agriculture.  Farmers recognise that they should be able to contribute more than £30 million.  That figure is nugatory in comparison with what the yield should be.  When the yield was beginning to pick up and farmers were becoming accustomed to the income tax forms, the Government introduced the land tax and there were more rows and dissension between town and country.  It is time we had an end to that.</P>
    <P>I know that level of tax from the farming <Col N="1498" /> community is not acceptable.  They know that.  The Government have failed to give agriculture its proper economic priority.  They are killing agriculture instead of promoting it.  The second point is: are the farmers to be blamed if the assessment forms were not sent out, if the system is so overburdened that they were not sent out?  Who ever responded before they were requested?  That was the reality last year.  If the Minister wants the system to work, he must provide adequate personnel.  County registrars will tell you that, even when the judgments have issued, they cannot execute them because they have not got the staff.</P>
    <P>The Government introduced legislation making complex additions to the tax system in the past few years and at the end of the day we have not got personnel to implement them.  I can make no sense of what the Government are doing on the question of tax.  I said jocosely some time ago that I dissociated myself from my colleagues who accused the Government of having Thatcherite policies.  The Government do not engage in Thatcherite policies.  As I understand the Thatcherite policy, it was to reduce current public expenditure and to reduce the level of taxation.  That is how they coped with their deficit.  While proclaiming their determination to cope with the problems of the deficits, borrowings and fiscal aggregates, this Government decided deliberately to heap on the highest levels of taxation which any Government in any European economy ever contemplated. That is where we are now, and that is why this economy is in the condition it is in.  That is why our money is flying out and that is why our people are flying out. That is why our system cannot cope.  I find no sense in anything the Government are doing.  I do not think anyone else does either.  If there are people on the opposite benches who do, and particularly in the Labour Party, I should love to hear from them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>One decision I have come to in the past couple of hours is that I will be brief.  Listening to my constituency colleague for the past two hours I had <Col N="1499" /> considerable difficulty in understanding-what precisely he was proposing as the Fianna Fáil spokesman on Finance.  The only thing I could pick out of the various views he offered us on so many different subjects over the past two hours was that Fianna Fáil are in favour of increasing employment and reducing taxation.  How this Utopia was to be reached, we have no knowledge.  How the deficits he referred to were to be tackled, we have no knowledge.  I can only remind him of the reality of where this awful spiral we are on started.  It seems extraordinary that he could have forgotten the fact that he was a Minister in the Government that caused the debacle we live with today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is incorrect.  The Deputy should check the record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>The record speaks for itself.  If it were permitted on an occasion like this I should love to have a direct debate with Deputy O'Kennedy.  I could take notice from his speech today which would indicate to me the approach Fianna Fáil suggest the Government should adopt, or that they would adopt if they were in power.  Fianna Fáil published the document <i>The Way Forward</i> at the end of several years in office.  For the greater part of that time Deputy O'Kennedy was Minister for Finance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put it on record that I am sorry Deputy O'Kennedy is leaving the House.  We listened to nonsense from him criticising the Minister for Finance for leaving the House having listened to Deputy O'Kennedy for an hour and a half.  That is typical of the Fianna Fáil approach to economic matters.  Deputy O'Kennedy knows well that he never sat through a full finance debate when he was Minister for Finance.  He knows that is standard procedure.  He also knows that, until the rules of this House are changed and contributions of two hours in Second Stage debates are ended, that will continue.  I do not believe the Minister for Finance would have gained anything or that anybody would have gained anything by spending two hours here <Col N="1500" /> listening to what Deputy O'Kennedy was saying.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy O'Kennedy is not here because Fianna Fáil must be brought back to their last cogent statement.  I appeal to Members of the House to look at this document <i>The Way Forward.</i> It is mind-boggling stuff coming from the party who are making some of the proposals they are making.  I said I will be brief and I will also be selective.  Fianna Fáil said:</P>
    <P>Public services cannot be provided on the basis of what is desirable.  They must be based on what can be paid for by taxation.</P>
    <P>We listened to Deputy O'Kennedy suggesting that this and that tax should be reduced and that the awful burden of taxation should be lifted.  Nobody is quicker than I to agree that the burden of taxation is intolerable.  Did we have one suggestion from him in the past two hours about what services he would abolish in order to facilitate a reduction in taxation?</P>
    <P>He complained about the lack of public servants in Departments and about the embargo introduced by this Government. In <i>The Way Forward</i> Fianna Fáil said:</P>
    <P>We must decide that the numbers employed in the public service, their pay bill and public expenditure generally cannot continue to grow on the basis of ever-greater taxation and borrowing in an economy at our present level of output.</P>
    <P>I will say no more than that about their last cogent statement on the economy.  If we want to find a cogent statement after that we need only go to the Official Report and pick out specific points made by Fianna Fáil from time to time and identify them.  I found it difficult to identify anything cogent in what Deputy O'Kennedy said this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I want to mention public service pay. I could not agree more with what Fianna Fáil said in <i>The Way Forward</i> in this regard.  I would love to see everybody with a good deal more money after they <Col N="1501" /> have paid their tax than they have at present.  I recognise that people in the PAYE sector, farmers, housewives and others are crippled and scourged by the restraints on their resources.  When the Government published their views on public service pay in the national plan, Fianna Fáil took the extraordinary step of going to meet the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  They agreed to congress's proposals on public pay at that time.  Had the Government taken Fianna Fáil's advice, the additional cost would have been £322 million.  That is the extra amount Deputy O'Kennedy was suggesting we should spend on public service pay in this year alone.</P>
    <P>Specific motions were brought into the House by Fianna Fáil.  A couple of companies went into liquidation because of their financial positions and I mention the Verolme operation in Cork, Irish Shipping and Clover Meats as three examples. Had we taken Fianna Fáil's advice on that, it would have cost us an additional £2 million.  Other tax concessions sought by Fianna Fáil were abolition of agricultural land tax and water rates, which items were proposed by Fianna Fáil when in office themselves and the introduction of which was promised when they got back into Government.  They are running far from that now.  They made proposals for greater resources towards eradicating bovine TB and wanted to introduce mortgage subsidies.  The House will recall that they were going to increase by about £200 million the public capital programme. Deputy O'Kennedy said that they were going to eliminate the current budget deficit by 1987.  The total cost of all of this would have amounted to about an additional £700 million or £800 million. The figures are on the record and the Deputies can add them up.</P>
    <P>In order to facilitate that sort of spending, if they do not believe in borrowing money for current expenditure, as mentioned by Deputy O'Kennedy, in order to finance the Fianna Fáil Party's proposals, over the past 12 to 18 months taxation across the board would have had to be increased by 22 per cent.  These proposals are on the record of the House and in <Col N="1502" /> public statements.  Why did Deputy O'Kennedy not look at the reality today, as he was so fond of telling this side of the House to do?  Why did he not tell us how they proposed to raise taxes by 22 per cent?  Why was he not realistic and sensible in his approach to this debate, instead of giving us two hours of utter hogwash, in which he painted himself and his party as pure Holy Marys whose only interest was to reduce the burden of taxation and increase employment?  They must imagine that Santa Claus would deliver the goods.</P>
    <P>We have very definite fundamental and economic problems, some of which have been addressed very successfully by this Government, but some of which have not, in my view, been addressed with sufficient enthusiasm.  I shall return to those later.  I am anxious to refer to some specific points in the Finance Bill which are important.  Deputy O'Kennedy referred to the black hole in the economy but that is not something which happened last year.  He seems completely unaware of the fact that the black hole was always there and that what happened was that our system of maintaining returns, of statistical control, in effect was inadequate. It had not accounted for or allowed for this.  For as long as Deputy O'Kennedy has been a Member of this House and during every year in which he was a member of the Government, the money has been going out through the black hole.  He suggests that somehow he discovered the black hole last year and that this Government were responsible for its creation, but that is arrant nonsense that would not be attributed to a two year old.  I express the hope that the proposal by the Minister for Finance in the Finance Bill will help to solve that problem, but I am not convinced of that. I find it hard to believe that an international company with all sorts of investment programmes would be happy to leave money lying around in Government securities here.  Perhaps I am wrong. There are certain tax advantages in doing so, but I should imagine that companies with spare cash like that would be more interested in using it to carry out development <Col N="1503" /> work and increase their activities.</P>
    <P>Ultimately, the only way in which we can encourage foreign companies to invest in this country and keep their profits here is by having an economic climate which is attractive to them.  That is what we must strive to attain, but it is not going to be easy to do.  I hope that the proposals in this Finance Bill will assist in some way, but it would be naive to believe that they would solve the problem that quickly.  This is a problem which goes to the core of our present economic situation and it can only be addressed if we adhere to targets which we set to bring public finances under control, to increase the cost competitiveness of Irish industry and so ensure that those who are going to invest here in industry, the service sector or whatever will have the opportunity of making money.  That is the one way of getting foreign companies who make profits in existing companies to reinvest and keep their money here.</P>
    <P>I welcome the VAT and income tax changes in the budget, confirmed by the Finance Bill.  It has been, without question, an extraordinarily difficult time for business over the past few years.  The increase in VAT rate has made it very difficult for companies to survive.  From contacts which I have and indicators since the budget, there is increased business activity.  I hope it continues to the extent that the loss of revenue will not be significant and that, as Deputy O'Kennedy has said, the law of diminishing returns will pay up.  It is not certain yet that that will happen, but we can hope that it will.</P>
    <P>There is another welcome aspect to the changes in income tax and VAT.  That is that those systems are being simplified. We constantly underestimate the administrative and bureaucratic burden which we throw on business, particularly small businesses, by our awful taxation system.  The number of rates of VAT alone caused headaches to business people, particularly those operating in a small way.  When one considers VAT, PRSI, income tax controls, stamp duties which must be paid, records which must be kept, VAT at point of entry and <Col N="1504" /> reclaiming VAT elsewhere, it must be extraordinarily expensive, not only on the business sector trying to maintain that system but also on the Revenue Commissioners. We must go further in attempts to simplify our tax system.  The Commission on Taxation have made recommendations which I believe the Government will follow through in the course of the next two or three budgets and Finance Bills.  I urge the Government to do that. Even if it is not possible continually to reduce the level of taxation, it is critically important, in order to help businesses, that the administrative burden of managing the present system of taxation be relieved.</P>
    <P>I welcome also the provisions in the Finance Bill relating to the inheritance tax.  I never saw any justification for charging inheritance tax for inheritances between spouses.  I cannot believe that there is justification for charging tax on any significant basis on transfers of property between husband and wife, whether in the lifetime of one spouse or, as in the case of relief in this Bill, on death. Obviously, with our present economic difficulties it is not possible to do everything, but I urge the Minister, if possible next year, to abolish any form of gift tax on any transactions between husband and wife.  I put in this caution that where transfers of property between husband and wife are being used to avoid or evade other legitimate taxes, transfers between them should not be so facilitated; but from a social point of view taxation on property transfers between husband and wife should come to an end.</P>
    <P>I also specifically welcome the proposal in the Finance Bill to allow people to insure against large inheritance tax bills which can arise.  I was astonished to read &mdash; I think in last Sunday's <i>Tribune</i>&mdash; a very strong criticism of this proposal.  A suggestion was made there that the rich were getting away with it again.  It seems that any capital tax can only have two main purposes &mdash; first, to raise revenue and, secondly, to redistribute wealth.  In their own right these are laudable.  I wonder how anybody could complain if somebody insures against a tax liability <Col N="1505" /> and will be able to pay that liability off through a policy of insurance.  All this Bill does is ensure that the yield from the insurance policy will not be caught by inheritance tax.  The payment on premia by the policy-holder throughout the years will not in any way be relieved of income tax.  It will be a very expensive payment for people.  Effectively what it amounts to is payment of a heavy capital tax by instalments throughout a person's life and I can see absolutely nothing wrong with that.  The same wealth will be redistributed. As the Minister pointed out, it will mean that inheritance tax will be paid more quickly.  It will also mean that businesses&mdash; we are talking of operations of a moderate size&mdash; may not have to be broken up because of a liability to pay inheritance tax.  A business worth £500,000 might yield very little profit today, depending on how it is structured and its area of activity.  A lot of money can be tied up in a small amount of machinery.  There is a considerable liability for inheritance tax arising in respect of a business valued at £500,000.  It would be quite impossible for the inheritor of such assets to discharge any inheritance tax bill without selling or disposing of part of the equipment or diluting his shareholding in the company.  It might make it impossible for the company to continue or to yield a reasonable income for a family.  The proposal of the Minister is sensible and reasonable.  It will ensure that wealth will be redistributed and it will also give an opportunity particularly to those who run small to medium sized businesses to ensure that after their death the undertaking concerned can remain in operation.</P>
    <P>I am amazed at the attitude of many who still have the view that there are many people here with massive wealth.  I am sure there are some but they are very few.  When one considers the changes that have taken place in the fortunes of businesses in the past number of years, one can easily accept that what might have appeared a considerable amount of money a few years ago appears like little money today and what was on paper quite substantial wealth is now anything but <Col N="1506" /> substantial wealth.</P>
    <P>We have to make a decision here as to whether we recognise the country for what it is.  After all, we are a capitalist society.  In so far as we have an engine of activity to generate wealth and output which we need so badly to pay our bills, we must rely on the business and industrial sector.  If we are constantly complaining that these people want profits or have wealth of some kind, it is time we reviewed the kind of country we want.  If we want a different kind of country, one that is entirely socialist or communist or anything else, that is fine and let us have it.  However, if we want the type of society we have and if we want to encourage growth in economic terms, we will have to come to terms with how we do that.</P>
    <P>There are a number of more minor proposals in the Finance Bill that are to be welcomed particularly.  I welcome the tax relief proposed for income from certain farm leases where people of 55 years or more give a lease of their farms for at least seven years.  The Government have been positive on the question of land lease to break the land structure system away from the inadequate use of land. Such a purpose can only be achieved by the type of policy being pursued by the Government and I compliment them on that.  I wish also to compliment them on the increased rent allowance for tenancies for older persons.  It is good social legislation, as is the increase in tax-free interest in banks for elderly persons.  I welcome what the Government have done in that regard.</P>
    <P>One matter is absent from the Finance Bill which I thought might have been included.  Perhaps the Minister will consider the point I am about to make and see if he can introduce an amendment if that is appropriate on Committee Stage. I am especially concerned about the cost incurred by people who are financing their children attending colleges of higher education, particularly third level education. I know it is a burden on any parent in any part of the country to send a child to college now, particularly those who are just outside the means test limit and <Col N="1507" /> who cannot benefit from a higher education grant but I wish to point out a difficulty that exists for people who do not live in Dublin, Cork or Galway or in towns that have a third level educational establishment.</P>
    <P>People in Dublin and in the areas I have mentioned frequently forget that the greatest cost in sending a person from the country to a third level educational institution is the cost of maintaining them in the place where that institution is situated. The fees remain the same but the burden on a family from, say, Tipperary of sending a child to Cork or Dublin is infinitely greater than the burden on a family living in Donnybrook, Ranelagh, Dundrum or on the north side of Dublin who send a child to college in Dublin. The student can live at home and the cost of maintaining him or her in third level education is nothing like what it is for people in rural Ireland.</P>
    <P>One measure existed that was of some benefit, namely, the income convenant that parents could enter into with their children over a certain age.  If a parent had a child over 21 years who was attending an educational establishment, it was and is still possible for the parent to covenant with that child to pay, say, £1,000 per year.  This gave a tax benefit to the parent for that expenditure.  Since the Bill dealing with the age of majority was passed, the age of majority has been reduced from 21 years to 18 years and I should have thought it would have been appropriate in this Finance Bill to extend the facility of convenanting money from a parent to a child of 18 years.  This would be of considerable assistance to people, particularly those in rural areas who have to face a heavy cost.  People with incomes from £10,000 to £12,000 may find themselves outside the scope of the higher education grant scheme.  I ask the Minister's advisers who are present to take note of that point.  If I am wrong in what I am saying or if I misunderstand the position, perhaps the Minister will tell me.  However, if there is a lacuna there that has been caused as a result of the Bill dealing with the age of majority, I <Col N="1508" /> ask that the matter be dealt with.</P>
    <P>The budget and the Finance Bill will contribute to a more positive economic climate and this is essential.  Already there is evidence of an increased incentive to work and there is a stimulus to business.  Perhaps the VAT changes are the biggest contributor in this regard. Nevertheless, there are still some deep-seated fundamental problems in our economy that are not being addressed sufficiently.</P>
    <P>Current Government spending is slightly increased this year and effectively this means, albeit by only a small amount, that we are still somewhat less in control of the financial situation this year than we were 12 months ago.  This strategy was set out in the national plan but I urge the Government to ensure that in the next two years of the national plan the targets in that plan be adhered to rigidly. It is only if we control current expenditure that we will solve our economic problems that exist to such a frightening extent.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer also to the question of the public wage bill.  It is very easy for me to sit on the back benches and criticise the Government for not sticking to the cash limits they set out for themselves in their national plan.  I want to stress that I believe this to be a key problem in our economy at present, one we do not keep to the forefront sufficiently often.  I do not begrudge anybody in the public service the best in terms in wages and benefits to themselves.  But it is the value of money that matters at the end of the day and not the nominal amount one is given.  Unless this problem is tackled we shall merely ensure that whatever nominal amount we give to public servants, people in private industry, or the people who are unemployed will be worth a lot less than it is now.  It is acknowledged that, relatively speaking, our public servants are better paid than public servants in many other countries.  In terms of our economic welfare at present certainly they are not badly paid.  I would urge that the Government adhere to the limits they set out in their national plan.  It comprises a very large part of current Government <Col N="1509" /> expenditure.  It is critical that we ensure that we maintain the controls we set out in that national plan.</P>
    <P>I was amused, listening to a radio programme the other morning, the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme, when a former Minister for Finance, now a Member of the European Parliament, Richie Ryan was interviewed.  It is an interesting programme sometimes.  I must say also that probably we are very lucky to have those chaps on that programme every morning because they know a lot about everything and very frequently bring in people to get a comment on what is their own view on something rather than allow a person express a comprehensive view.  It was put to Richie Ryan the other morning that the proposal he had made a few days earlier &mdash; that we had to get current expenditure under control &mdash; was impossible, that one could not reduce the current budget deficit, that one could not reduce current expenditure by Government.  I was astonished.  It occurred to me suddenly that perhaps this view was more prevalent in this House and country than should be the case.  The fact is that at present this Government absorb 50 per cent of the gross national product for their own spending.</P>
    <P>There are two issues involved here. Some people would argue &mdash; particularly those on the left politically &mdash; that high public expenditure is a good thing.  I do not agree with that.  But what is lost in all of this is the fact that much of our public spending is not perhaps good in itself, that we are not getting a return on it, that it is not effective, that some of our public expenditure programmes are not efficient.  We are still an under-developed economy.  Given the type of private enterprise economy we have, the Government must resist absorbing the sort of money they do absorb.  If we are to proceed economically at all, more resources must be made available to the private sector.</P>
    <P>The elimination of the current budget deficit by 1987 has now been deferred, a decision which I am sure was not taken lightly by the Government.  Obviously it <Col N="1510" /> poses difficult economic and social problems. One thing I have not seen a great deal of in the past couple of years is the desire that appeared there a few years ago, specifically when Deputy John Bruton was Minister for Finance, that we needed to examine much more closely the public expenditure programmes we had.  Many people get annoyed and become upset when they hear health boards having to close a ward because of cutbacks.  I heard one story published by a health board official that because of cutbacks patients who had been getting three sausages with the tea would get only two.  This type of policy playing is utterly irresponsible.  A proper examination of the whole administrative structure of our health boards that absorb so much money has not been carried out.  In any discussions that take place in public at health board level about cutbacks the emphasis is on the service finally delivered to the patient because it carries a high public profile and because pressure is better applied that way on a Department of Health if one can cause hassle and problems.</P>
    <P>When the Minister for Health took a firm stand with health boards &mdash; on which I compliment him &mdash; it was interesting to note that they were able to manage cutbacks that did not affect the service ultimately delivered to patients.  I believe that if there was a proper examination carried out of the activities of all health boards &mdash; I do not confine these remarks to health boards, they apply across the board &mdash; there are many areas where savings could be effected, where programmes are seen to be inefficient or ineffective and where greater controls should be introduced.</P>
    <P>I mentioned health boards because they occurred to me as I spoke as something which I have thought and worried about before.  There are many expenditure programmes, some of which have been highlighted by the Committee on Public Expenditure of this House, which show the folly of some of our expenditure, for instance, Department of Justice spending of £13 million on prisons never built, the Minister for Health having indicated <Col N="1511" /> that in the Cork area alone there were 600 or 700 surplus hospital beds.  I am not talking of hospital beds only but of accommodation as well that is not needed at all.  I wonder how that arose. There were instances I raised in this House before of the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards and the IDA changing offices and that sort of thing, going wildly in excess of their authorised budgets.</P>
    <P>There are other areas in which our programmes do not appear to be very effective in what they do.  For example, I recall a report in respect of higher education grants, specifically in regard to people who attend our universities.  We introduced higher education grants to benefit people of all backgrounds so that they could attend college.  We introduced free education in secondary schools to achieve that same sort of purpose but, when the analaysis was done at the end of the day, it emerged that the only people who enjoy third level education, specifically in our universities, are people from middle income backgrounds or upwards of middle income backgrounds. Therefore the truth is that despite all the money we have spent we have failed to deliver to those people in most need.  Has there been any examination carried out since that report was published of the operation of our higher education grants scheme?</P>
    <P>The bovine disease eradication scheme is a scandal referred to dozens of times and I shall not go into it again.  Something is now being done about it but for years millions of pounds were being spent by the Department of Agriculture virtually to none or little effect.  Probably one could go through every single Department, every single public expenditure programme, and one would discover that many of them are trundling along without any examination to see how cost effective they are, or how effective they are in achieving the purpose for which money was passed by this House in the first instance.</P>
    <P>The problem is not just how much the Government spent but how badly some <Col N="1512" /> of that money is spent.  I might refer to the fact that in other countries they have managed to deal with this problem quite well.  I do not want to create the impression &mdash; lest anybody might take it from what I am saying &mdash; that there is no control.  There is a control over public expenditure here but it is reserved almost exclusively to a legal control, the Comptroller and Auditor General being charged under the Constitution with ensuring that moneys passed by this House for a purpose are spent on that purpose.  The net effect of that control is that we can spend money stupidly if we want to as long as we are honest about it and it is done legally.  But we can be stupid or insane in spending as long as we stick to the strict letter of the Vote passed by this House.</P>
    <P>In the United Kingdom nationalised industries are obliged to publish regularly performance indicators which enable the Government, economists and other interested parties to compare the performance of that industry with other industries or similar ones abroad to establish how they are going.  That is something that would certainly be of great value in our State-sponsored sector.  I would urge that we consider the introduction of such obligations on semi-State bodies.  There was a House of Commons paper published, I think, in 1981, on the efficiency and effectiveness of the civil service which contained some excellent ideas as to how one could streamline the operation of one's civil service and have identified areas of waste that existed.  Have we undertaken any such examination here?  In 1981, when Deputy John Bruton was Minister for Finance I recall an excellent document published entitled &ldquo;A Better Way to Plan the Nation's Finance&rdquo;. There was one proposal in that document adopted, that was the establishment of the Committee on Public Expenditure of this House.  That committee may well have brushed the wrong way some members, executives or boards of semi-State bodies.  That is part of the normal tension that takes place in this sort of examination.  But we cannot expect that committee to achieve all of <Col N="1513" /> the purposes set out in that document.</P>
    <P>That document contained other suggestions to which I want to refer.  For example, I want to ask the Minister for Finance whether consideration has been given to these suggestions.  One was the establishment of a Public Expenditure Commissioner.  The concept of the Public Expenditure Commission was explained in the report.  The commissioner would have the role of reviewing public expenditure programmes as to their effectiveness and perhaps recommending the elimination of wasteful or obsolete programmes of activities.  One of the advantages of having such a commissioner was that he would have the freedom of operating independently of this House and of the Minister and he could establish, away from a political environment, where programmes were perhaps failing to achieve what they should and where savings could be made, or where perhaps more money could be spent in a more effective way.</P>
    <P>There was also a proposal to introduce new controls for deficit budgeting, not that it would be impossible for a Government to indulge in deficit borrowing, because it is clear that for the foreseeable future Governments will have to rely on deficit budgeting, but to ensure that there is control over it and that it cannot be done easily and so that there will be greater restraint on Governments engaging in deficit budgeting when balancing their budgets.  The point was made in that document that what Governments are doing when they are engaging in deficit budgeting is spending money that has to be earned by future generations or by the generation who will be in this House in a decade or so.  I do not know if these matters have been followed up but this document should be reread by every Member of the House.  It would be of advantage to us all to do so and to bear it in mind when we make contributions to debates like this and in participating in our ordinary political activities.</P>
    <P>During my years here I have grown more conservative economically.  When I look at the economic difficulties I am forced to face the simple fact that if we <Col N="1514" /> are to overcome our difficulties we must ensure that Government and industry are side by side in tackling the problems. When I say that they should be side by side I am not talking about the Government throwing out benefits to industry or distributing handouts.  Unfortunately our attitude to political economic life has descended close to the gutter in that type of approach.  Over the last eight or ten years since I have become involved in politics I have noticed a lack of understanding in industry of Government problems and a lack of understanding in Government of industrial problems.  A lot could be done to overcome that.  I was in touch with the Minister for the Public Service some time ago about a specific company who were asking for an exchange of a senior member of their staff with a member of the Department of Industry.  I gather that that exchange has since taken place.  Programmes like that, involving the exchange of personnel, can be extremely valuable in the long term.  They will certainly improve the level of trust and understanding between Government and business.</P>
    <P>If we are to push on further the economic well-being of our country we will have to ensure that there is greater economic activity in business.  To do that the Government will have to tackle the cost of essential services.  I welcome the proposed reduction in ESB charges to certain industries.  That sort of approach is of assistance.  The Government have been outstandingly successful in relative terms in dealing with the problem of inflation. If the Government can push that further to deal specifically with the very high cost of essential services facing key industries a great deal more can be achieved than we imagine at the moment.  I urge the Government to go in that direction.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that something has to be done to address the problem of over-centralisation. This issue is frequently thrown around here on a political basis. But considering all the problems in Dublin it is quite clear that very&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would <Col N="1515" /> remind the Deputy that he is going away from the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about centralisation. There is over-centralisation. This is not going away from the Bill, it has very much to do with the grave economic problems we have.  It must be addressed.  The reason it came to mind was because of a lecture given by Professor Joe Lee, which was published in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 17 April last, on the question of centralisation and community.  I will quote one paragraph which relates to our economic development since the foundation of the State.  We sit here year in and year out and throw balls across to each other and blame each other for all sorts of things.  This is a very telling statement and one which should cause us great concern.  The professor said:</P>
      <P>We cannot avoid the conclusion that we have incomparably the worst record since 1921 of any economy in northern Europe, except the British.  Our recent performance appears even more dismal if we concede validity to the &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; hypothesis according to which more backward economies have the possibility of growing more rapidly by learning the lessons, and benefiting from the achievement of, more successful ones.  We are now perched, through our own efforts, at the wrong end of virtually every relevant league table.  The absolute gap between average northern European incomes and our own is as wide as the absolute gap between our own and African averages. The first pre-requisite for improvement must be to recognise the dimensions of the problem, and to admit just how deeply disappointing has been our economic performance, not just in the recent splurge of collective inanity, but for far longer.  Even the growth of the 1960s, however impressive by our own previous performance, still fell below northern European averages.  Having recognised reality, we must then proceed to search for explanations, not for excuses.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> It is interesting to anybody who reads the debates on Finance Bills or budgets which took place in this House over the past two or three decades to see the way different people were blamed for different things and parties were blamed for different things, but at the end of the day the great majority of people in this House have the same economic outlook.  The degree of difference between them is very little compared with many other countries. Perhaps we need to look further back and to look more closely at the basic institutions, the way this House works, the way the Government works, the way the Department works and so on.  It is not something that I will pursue now but it should give us food for thought if we considered it for a while instead of engaging in criticising the last person who was in this seat.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFOConnell" hpid="Dr. O'Connell Dr. O'Connell">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Connell</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears that I am always honoured to have Minister Birmingham in the House when I speak. I am very disappointed at the lack of imagination of the Minister for Finance. I thought he would have introduced some imaginative provisions in the Bill bearing in mind the failure of his budget.  I had hoped he would bring forward some new proposals.  It appears that the Minister is living in cloud cuckoo land and is out of touch with reality, because he stated that there are signs of confidence in the country. There is no such thing and the Minister is deluding himself and attempting to delude the public into believing that there is confidence in our economy.  Confidence is lacking.  The reverse is the position despite the superb efforts of the national handlers again and again to present an optimistic picture of our economy.  We hear phrases like &ldquo;poised for recovery&rdquo; from Ministers almost daily.  The partners in Government are deluding themselves into believing that they can gain the support of their followers as a result of their continued participation in Coalition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that fundamental changes in the taxation system were introduced in the budget.  Perhaps I am a little simplistic or not quite <i>au fait</i> with <Col N="1517" /> the position but this bureacrat from Brussels feels he can speak over our heads and convince us that fundamental changes have taken place.  I fail to see where those changes have taken place. In my view the media were lacking in not exposing the sham of the budget.  The media were easily misled.  In fact, they were totally biased in favour of the Coalition in the picture presented in comments and reports.  That surprised me.  It appears that the media is overawed by the Government.  I cannot understand how they were so easily misled into making some of the comments I read.</P>
    <P>The VAT changes were no more than an admission by the Government that they made a mistake in the first place when they decided to increase the rate to 35 per cent.  That punitive tax had the effect of sending traffic across the Border to the detriment of Irish industry.  The decision to increase the rate to 35 per cent was a grave mistake, but instead of admitting that mistake the Government tried to present the reduction in that rate as a fundamental change in the taxation structure.  The 65 per cent income tax rate was a disincentive to all.  It was introduced by the Government and when they realised it was wrong they changed it, but they did not admit that they had made the mistake in the first place.  Where is the fundamental change?  We have had an admission that the tax levels introduced by the Government were wrong. Those levels were punitive and a disincentive to investment.</P>
    <P>We have been told that as a result of the provisions in the budget there will be an improvement in take home pay.  I have not heard anything more ludicrous. Everybody is aware that there has not been any significant increase in take home pay.  The Government are trying to delude the public aided and abetted, intentionally or not, by the media.  We are presented with a rosy picture daily and people are told that an improvement in take home pay was an inevitable consequence of the progressive character of the income tax code.  Any totally objective person will say that that is farcical.  It <Col N="1518" /> is tantamount to misleading the public. There has not been any overall increase in take home pay and no incentive to work.  The Government are engaged in a book keeping exercise.  They are preoccupied with fiscal rectitude to the exclusion of all other aspects of the economy.  I am puzzled why the Labour Party are suffering this humiliation by participating in Government.  Whether they admit it or not their participation in Government will prove detrimental to them in the local elections.  I am sorry to see that happen because it is a great party.  It is tragic that we should see people, ostensibly in the interest of their party, participating in Government and accepting responsibility for the punitive measures that have been applied in recent years.  Members of the Labour Party are willing partners in the hairshirt measures that are making life harsh for our people.  The hardships resulting from the budget are growing daily.  There is public depression, dismay and a lack of enthusiasm.  There is a general malaise among the population. People are concerned that the Government are not making any effort to ease the burden on taxpayers.</P>
    <P>The Government's preoccupation with fiscal rectitude will be disastrous for the economy and could seriously endanger the stability of our democratic system. We must face up to that great danger. Where is the growing confidence that the Government speak of?  What evidence is there for such an optimistic prediction?  I do not see it.  Many people have said to me that if there were any opportunities abroad they would leave the country. That is a dismal picture to paint and I am sorry to have to say that.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that there will be no increase in taxation.  There should not be any increase because, if there is, this institution will be in danger.  However, I am afraid that in the weeks leading up to the local elections the Government will try to delude the public further with optimistic economic forecasts.  I am aware of the superb PR work being done by the Government handlers.  I see evidence of that work daily.  It is dangerous to have national handlers acting as they are.  We <Col N="1519" /> are having government by national handlers.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
    <P>...should it happen that a significant overrun begins to emerge during the course of the year then the Government will take whatever steps are required to keep the budget in line with targets.</P>
    <P>That is the key phrase in the Ministers speech because there is a definite indication in it that the Government will introduce a second budget this year.  The Minister will be able to say later in the year that in his speech on April 23 he said that there would be a second budget. That statement leaves the Government the option of bringing in a second budget after the local elections and I believe that is likely to happen.</P>
    <P>I cannot see any evidence of an improvement in the state of the economy. We are paying £6 million daily in social welfare payments.  That is serious and if it continues any longer I can see the Fine Gael Government, with the Labour rump, being forced to reduce the social welfare benefits.  Shades of the Cumann na Gaedheal Government which took the shilling off the pension in the twenties. They have brought in punitive tax measures.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;That Dáil Éireann deplores the major cutbacks in educational finances which have led to excessive increases in the size of classes, the unemployment of large numbers of teachers and many other serious problems in our schools and calls on the Government to make full and adequate provision for education.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Those are the terms of the motion put <Col N="1520" /> down by me and my party for this important debate.  This is a critical time for thinking about education because in the last months of the old year, the last term, parents are making decisions and thinking what the year beginning in September will mean for their children, what provisions will be made for their education and what questions they will have to answer. This debate is particularly opportune, following on the teacher's meetings held in Easter week.  It was interesting to follow those debates and to read them.  Reading between the lines is of even more significance. One can clearly discern the trend of thought emerging.</P>
    <P>There are really two versions of what is happening in relation to provisions for education.  There is the Minister's constant reiteration that there are no cutbacks, there have been no cutbacks and will be no cutbacks and that any cutbacks which have been occasioned have been caused by the Fianna Fáil Estimate of 1982.  I do not wish it to appear that there is anything personal in what I have to say but I will have to expose that claim as an absolute untruth.</P>
    <P>The Minister has stated on radio and in the newspapers that there has been no cutback but this is contradicted by the recent report of the National Economic and Social Council, a very representative and responsible group.  In their latest report, <i>Economic and Social Policy Assessment,</i> published in January 1985 they state that the percentage of gross national product spent on education has fallen and will continue to fall.  That group is representative of Government Departments, trade unions and agricultural organisations.  There will be allegations from the other side of the House of exaggeration on this side and reference to the misdeeds of the bad old Fianna Fáil people and the shining deeds of the present Government.  Before that hyperbole is embarked upon I would ask for an answer as to whether the NESC are correct in what they say or whether the Minister's statements are correct.  The public at large are entitled to know whether this body are telling the truth <Col N="1521" /> or whether the Minister in her repeated statements is telling the truth.  This is the question to which I want an answer before the gloss is put on whatever the Minister has to say.  On one of the mornings in Easter week I distinctly heard the Minister state that there has been no cutback in education.</P>
    <P>The National Planning Board were quite emphatic in their view and stated that the board recommend that because of the demographic pressures on the educational system there should be no cutbacks in real current public expenditure in this area in the years up to 1987.</P>
    <P>This was one of their comments on the National Plan.  Two very responsible bodies have made these statements.</P>
    <P>On Saturday, 13 April 1985 <i>The Irish Times</i> published a demographic study of Ireland which stated:</P>
    <P>...with present trends, every fourth person in Europe would be 65 or older by the end of this century.  But the Republic is still a long way from that situation with 30.3 per cent of its population in 1982 still under 14 years compared to about 20 per cent or less in most other EEC countries.</P>
    <P>A difference of 10 per cent is quite startling, the figure being 30 per cent here and 20 per cent in Europe.  If a statistic is produced tonight showing that we spend so much on education <i>vis-á-vis</i> other European countries it must be set in the context that the number of participants within the educational system bears absolutely no relation to the numbers going through the system in other European countries.  We do not have a problem; we have a resource but it is being handled as a problem.  There is no commitment by the Government to recognising the demographic reality.  Politicians are prone to standing up at party functions and talking about the great resource we have in our young people, but if we cannot adequately cater for that resource we are failing.  That is what is happening in the educational system.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Connell spoke about the PR exercise and the way the Government are <Col N="1522" /> going about their business by pretending that things are not as they are.  That is exactly what is happening on the educational scene.  There used to be a time when one chivvied the Department for being tardy or old fashioned but one was always very sure that what they were saying was true and that they had a basic integrity.  One was sure that they gave an honest answer, even if long delayed, and that any statistic or report would be quite accurate.  This was required because of the nature of the Department and its dealings with people.  Absolute confusion has now arisen.  I am not being personal when I say to the Minister that I have never met with such anger from people writing to me and telephoning me or among people I meet.</P>
    <P>People have become quite incoherent because they cannot express what they feel about what is happening in education. On the one hand the Minister tells us that there are no cutbacks, that curriculum reform is being proceeded with, that there is equality of opportunity for girls and boys, that there is commitment to the disadvantaged and that a comprehensive parents council is being set up.  However, the reality is totally different. First, the people were amused but then they became incredulous and now they are very angry.  They are anxious to know what is going on, what is the truth behind the facade in Marlborough Steet. There is confusion, uncertainty and alarm throughout all levels of education.  The planners, administrators, school managers and teachers' unions as well as the parents and students are totally confused regarding the Minister's intentions.  The weeks leading up to examinations are critical for everyone involved in education. Following that extraordinary interview which was reported in <i>The Irish Press</i> and which was followed by the Minister denying, then confirming, then denying and again confirming what she was reported as saying, the parents of young children are totally confused as to what the position will be in September next.  They do not know whether children of four will be admitted to primary schools then.  Likewise, school managers <Col N="1523" /> in post primary schools are unclear as to whether the age of transfer is to be changed.  Despite the various papers emanating from the Minister's office the uncertainty increases.</P>
    <P>Because of the cuts introduced in respect of pupil-teacher ratios, school managers and teachers at second level do not know what timetable they should prepare for their pupils for next year.  They do not know whether they will be allocated the existing number of teachers or what they are to do in the event of a teacher retiring, resigning or dying between now and the beginning of the school year. Neither do they know what subjects or options they may provide.  Third level institutions, too, are unclear whether they will be in a position to maintain the services they maintained in the past academic year.  Those leaving school after the intermediate and leaving certificate examinations do not know whether they will obtain employment, whether they will be admitted to apprenticeships or training courses or whether they will find places in third level education.  All the time the Minister has busied herself in making self-laudatory statements about what she has done for the disadvantaged at primary level, about what she intends doing in the area of curriculum reform or about what she intends doing in regard to eliminating stereotyping on the basis of sex in schools.  The reality is that what is happening in the education system is totally different from what the Minister claims is happening.  It is a case of everyone but my Johny being out of step.  It is like an Alice in Wonderland tale in which everyone but the Minister is wrong.</P>
    <P>The inadequate provision for remedial education in primary schools is potentially explosive.  I acknowledge the £500,000 that has been allocated in this respect but it is unworthy of the Minister to say that she is the first Minister to allocate special funds to the disadvantaged. I recall at some time between 1977 and 1980, when I was teaching and not involved in politics other than at local level and as a member of the National Executive of my party, the favourable <Col N="1524" /> response of the then Minister, Deputy Wilson, to the problem in inner city schools.  He sanctioned the employment of additional teachers so as to bring about a favourable pupil-teacher ratio in areas of real disadvantage and in which there was potential danger to young people.</P>
    <P>The Minister talks of providing extra teachers in the remedial area but she might tell us where these extra teachers have been placed and also how many such positions remain unfilled.  How many children are not being catered for adequately because of the unsatisfactory pupil-teacher ratio?  There is a very thin dividing line between the slow learner and the child who needs remedial teaching. Very often a child would not be in the remedial category if it were not for the lack of remedial resources and the lack of capacity to discern the child at an early stage as having a remedial problem. Because of the lack of resources to cater for him after he has been discerned, the child becomes remedial instead of being a slow learner.  There is an even thinner line between those needing remedial teaching and those who drop out.  Many pupils are leaving school because they do not think they can cope.  They are dropouts because of the system; but the problem, no matter which angle we view it from, can be related back to the unfavourable pupil-teacher ratio.  The child who drops out is very easy prey for anyone bent on mischief.  There is a thin line, too, between the mischief maker and the one who engages in crime.  Even if one cannot say clearly now that there is a link between crime and cuts in education there is a very clear line potentially between those two elements.</P>
    <P>The Coalition's programme for Government included a commitment to the allocation of remedial teachers to second level schools.  What has happened in that regard?  We ask that there be a clear commitment to the further provision of remedial teachers at both first and second level education.  A statistic published last year indicated that 20 per cent of pupils entering second level education have reading and writing problems. <Col N="1525" /> That is a direct result of the lack of investment in remedial education.</P>
    <P>I make a very special case this evening for the replacement of caretakers at primary schools.  During the past two and a half years the position has been that caretakers who resign or retire from primary schools or who die are not replaced. While that may have been included in the 1982 Estimates, we are now half way through 1985 and times have changed greatly in the meantime.  The Minister must realise that the non-replacement of these caretakers is imposing intolerable burdens on school principals who are unable to carry out essential duties because of having to cope with repairs, with vandalism and with various other matters that normally a caretaker would deal with.  Several teachers from some of the larger city schools have been in touch with me about this problem.  It was very shortsighted to have provided that these caretakers could not be replaced.  One would have thought that once the results of that policy became obvious, the Minister would have reversed it.  There are many cases of vandalism at schools at night because of the absence of caretakers.</P>
    <P>Another problem that results from the embargo on replacements is that parents find it almost impossible to contact a principal in a secondary school because of the absence of a secretary.  School secretaries are not been replaced.  In many instances it has been pointed out to me that these caretakers lived within the community in which the school was placed.  One school principal told me over Easter that the caretaker, on his way to bingo, or for his pint in the local pub, would check the school to see that all was in order.  He had a proprietorial interest in the school and in keeping it in order.  They were craftsmen of a kind as they had knowledge of carpentry and electrical work and the school was their business.  The same applied to secretaries in second level schools who took an enormous load off the school principal.  I am the spokeswoman on education for the largest party in the House and I want the Minister to let us know if four year olds will be <Col N="1526" /> accepted in primary schools next September.</P>
    <P>The Minister constantly repeats that there are no cutbacks in education and I have been accused of indulging in hyperbole by stating that there are.  I should like to quote some figures.  They are not a public relations exercise, they give the facts.  The GNP percentage spent on education has fallen and will continue to fall.  The post primary budget has decreased in real financial terms over each of the last three years.  To say that the figure increased from £380 million in 1983 to £440 million in 1984 and to £410 million &mdash; which was a decrease anyway &mdash; in 1985 masks the real figure which is the one in relation to the outturn in relation to the rate of inflation for the year for which the figures are quoted.  The shortfall in 1983 at second level was £16 million. The shortfall in 1984 at second level in real terms was £37 million and the shortfall in 1985 at second level in real terms will be £65 million.  The total education budget for 1985, non-capital, at primary level, shows an increase of 2 per cent which, in real terms, in minus 4 per cent, 5 per cent or 6 per cent.</P>
    <P>At post primary level it is minus and at higher education level it is minus 6 per cent.  The truth is that there is a decrease in funding for primary, post primary and higher education levels and some of the Minister's economies have, to date, been the cause of hundreds of teachers walking the streets.  It has created an unprecedented level of large classes as illustrated by the ASTI in their recent survey and has caused important subjects to be dropped. We must face this problem head on.  I accept that the Minister is committed to the intrinsic value and the basic long term value of curriculum reform.  I too am committed to this and I have said so on many occasions.  However, the Minister is not prepared to put her commitments on the line.  While very hard work is done by the Curriculum and Examinations Board in regard to the various documents which they have released and which make interesting and heartening reading, how are they going to implement their recom- <Col N="1527" /> mendations?  Expectations are raised but there is no commitment by the Minister to the necessary finances to fund such reform.  The Minister is an innovator at heart but she is not giving expression to it in regard to providing the necessary financial outlay which is needed in regard to such innovation.</P>
    <P>In a brief conversation with the Minister on radio recently &mdash; she had seven minutes and I had one &mdash; from 80 miles away, I said that curriculum reform could not be carried out unless the commitment to resources was there.  I was told that there had been marvellous reform and I accept that that is the case.  The school in which I taught for years has carried out curriculum reform through various measures but we are talking about reform throughout the whole country and the Minister said on several occasions that she is the only one who has tackled this problem and done anything about it. Nevertheless, in the radio interview, she said that this had been going on for years. She cannot have her cake and eat it.  She cannot say she is the person who dreamt it up and then say that there has been a real input by teachers and pupils over the last ten years.  Any reform that has taken place is due to the good will of school principals and teachers who saw the need for such reform and did something about it.  The best kind of curriculum reform is that which is tailored to meet the needs and wishes of the community in which the school is placed.</P>
    <P>A fascinating book <i>The Challenge of Change,</i> by Tony Crooks and Jim McKernan was published recently and talks about curriculum development.  I understand that the Minister could not come to the launching of this book but she was ably represented by her secretary.  The authors say that reform took place during Fianna Fáil Government.  Imagine that &mdash; and we are accused of not doing anything for education.  They surveyed all sorts of principals and teachers throughout the country as to what the response should be in regard to full scale curriculum reform.  The answers are very interesting. The majority of principals <Col N="1528" /> surveyed by form of questionnaire said that the teacher-pupil ratio was considered the most important constraint by principles.  Financial reasons and lack of resources were the next two constraints listed by principals.  Nine sources of support were identified and they were all considered very important.</P>
    <P>Twelve constraints were identified and, in their replies, principles rates the teacher-pupil ratio, the examination system, lack of time to implement curriculum innovations and lack of in-service education and training as the most significant. Of course we will be told that this is not true and the Minister will quote selective statistics to prove otherwise. This is a reputable book published under the aegis of the Institute of Public Administration, and with the blessing of the Department of Education.  The results have been tabulated and we will have more to say about this in the latter part of the debate in which we will talk exclusively about curriculum reform.  I am sure all this research has been done scientifically and correctly and the replies indicate that there will be no growth &mdash; in fact there will be regression &mdash; in the area of curriculum reform if the Minister does not give a committment to increasing finances and a turnabout of the adverse pupil-teacher ratio.</P>
    <P>People are confused regarding the haphazard policies emanating from the Minister.  I have been invited, through the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and I thank the Minister, to a day-long seminar in the RDS tomorrow on equality of opportunity for girls and boys in Irish education, and some very wonderful speakers are listed for it.  They are all very eminent but most of them are of one political faith.  We will be assailed and assaulted in the newspapers on the days following on all that has been done to remove discrimination against girls in education, but it will be totally untrue.  I have spoken to principals and teachers and and I have met young women who wish to take up subjects unrelated to what normally goes on in their school and cannot do so. Because of cutbacks, in the pupil-teacher ratio their school cannot employ a <Col N="1529" /> teacher to teach honours mathematics, woodwork, physics, chemistry or whatever has been cut back.  Teachers leaving means that course subjects must be concentrated on.  What the Minister is saying about removing discrimination against girls in education is all humbug.</P>
    <P>The Joint Committee on Women's Rights issued a report to the effect that the major restraint in the promotion of equality of educational access for girls in subjects unrelated to what they had hitherto taken up was due to the lack of teachers and resources and the pupil-teacher ratio.  It is all very well to make sweetie statements saying that the teachers will be so co-operative, the students will be co-operative and we will all be co-operative. It is ridiculous, because the only way they can be co-operative is to get the provision to supply the teachers to enable the subjects to be taken up in the classrooms.  You cannot be co-operative if you lose a teacher in a discipline. How can a teacher of 50 pupils turn around to teaching honours mathematics? I know of a school where honours mathematics cannot be taken, and three or four brilliant girls attending that school are fit to go on and take a very high degree in a related science subject.  The distance between them and the nearest boys' school offering honours mathematics is logistically not on because of traffic problems and those girls lack the means to get to that school.</P>
    <P>Therefore, let us cut out all of this talk that everything is being done to promote this type of equality and curriculum reform.  Numerous noises are being made and we hear many speeches, with a great deal of publicity, and seminars are being set up and drums are being beaten, but we are becoming very tired of that music, of hearing that we must go back to 1982 to realise that due to Fianna Fáil we have none of these things and that here was no commitment whatever to this advantage until the Coalition came in in 1982.</P>
    <P>Let us cast our minds back over 20 years and realise the huge strides that have been made in education.  One has only to take up a book such as John Coolahan's <i>Irish Education History and</i><Col N="1530" /><i>Structure</i> and to go back to 1958 and trace from Deputy Hillery's time to the time of the late Deputy Donagh O'Malley and all the other innovators in their day to know how trite and stupid many of the speeches and much of the comment and the blurb are.  It is not education.  I do not know what it is.  It is education by delusion so that the masses will be in some way indoctrinated into believing that huge advances in education have been made and will continue to be made. The reality is different.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;What will Fianna Fáil do?&rdquo; is the question asked in debates time and again in this House.  If Fianna Fáil were in power what would they do?  The Government ask how we would go about doing what we say we want done if we were in power.  I will tell the House exactly what we will do.  Fianna Fáil in Government will work towards a reversal of the pupil-teacher ratio until it is brought back to the 1982 levels.  We will ensure an adequate career guidance service and the provision of a proper remedial service in schools. In common with other social and national organisations we believe that the extent of provision, the standards and the achievements of our educational system must be upheld and improved upon rather than diminished as at present. Above all we want to see true provision for the disadvantaged, for remedial classes and for career guidance.  The issues which were raised in 1982 and which remained in 1983, 1984 and 1985 the Taoiseach has said in the national plan cannot be altered and will be adhered to rigorously.  Therefore, vice-principals at second level will be <i>ex quota</i> only in schools of more than 250 pupils &mdash; that is a very important issue; guidance teachers will be <i>ex quota</i> only in schools of more than 500 pupils; the pupil-teacher ratio will be increased.  The scale of grants towards the cost of clerical assistants I have spoken about already; and of course, school transport charges were introduced.</P>
    <P>The cutbacks in the pupil-teacher ratio have meant that not alone the subjects I have mentioned, such as honours mathematics <Col N="1531" /> and physics and so on and in many instances continental languages such as German which are so important in the EC, cannot be taken up because principals have had to juggle and jiggle with the remaining teachers; the course subjects, Irish, English, mathematics, history and geography at junior level and perhaps biology as the equivalent at senior level have become overstretched because of cutbacks.  Therefore, two things occur. We have an erosion of subject options while we are told increasingly that the main object of education is to be versatile and to have many skills, to have mobility of mind and an idea that one can move from one career option to another as they retract and expand, that one must at least have a chance to take up various subject choices.  The basic subjects which should be taught very adequately require a <i>rapport</i> between students and teachers which is not taking place either because of the inadequacies of the ratio.</P>
    <P>Our basic aim in this debate is (a) to point out the situation as it is and (b) to indicate the untruths of what we are being assailed with.  I have quoted statistics which I stand over, particularly those of the NESC which indicated that there have been and will be real cutbacks in the educational system.  Most of all I want to expose the myth that all is well, that everything is sweet and everybody is happy within the educational system. People are becoming more and more angry by the day, but they would not be as angry were it put to them that we are sorry we cannot do so-and-so, we cannot supply you with A, B, C or D.  Instead they are being told that they are getting adequate funding, there are no problems. When the Minister is replying apart from her brief, I would be glad if I could have the answers, in particular about the NESC figure of the funding for education.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1532" />&ldquo;Dáil Éireann recognises the progress made by this Government in educational development and reform in particular its emphasis on special intervention for the disadvantaged, and considers that adequate provision has been made to maintain this progress.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>My first reaction to the motion proposed by Deputy O'Rourke is one of surprise as to why it has taken the Opposition two and a half years to put forward this motion.  Perhaps they feel they have distanced themselves sufficiently from their involvement in those cuts and that the public will have forgotten their involvement or, perhaps, it is the typical political opportunism of present day Fianna Fáil that, following the Easter congresses of the teachers' unions and the recent publication by the ASTI of their document on the subject, they wish to jump on what they see &mdash; mistakenly &mdash; as a band wagon.</P>
    <P>The schizophrenia of Fianna Fáil has been clearly and unmistakably identified by this motion.  It may be uncomfortable for them to bear it but, in the dying days of 1982, two and a half years ago, when the realisation was forced upon them that the country had finally copped on to the financial chaos they had created, the Estimates for Public Services for 1983 were published on 18 November &mdash; the same Estimates which were given to me when I become Minister for Education and which included all the cuts that Deputy O'Rourke now decries.</P>
    <P>Let me quote once again from a statement issued by Deputy Gerard Brady on 18 November 1982 on the occasion of the publication of the Estimates for Public Services for 1983.  He said and I quote:</P>
    <P>Some other measures will have to be taken also to restrict current expenditure in 1983 to a level which can be met from available revenue.  These will include amendments to the conditions for the appointment of teachers in post-primary schools and a restriction to the larger schools of the appointment of remedial teachers in the case of national schools.  The relevant circulars <Col N="1533" /> to schools in relation to these matters will be issued in due course when the details have been finalised, following discussions with the educational interests involved.  The revised arrangements are to take effect from the commencement of the school-year 1983-84.  The adjustment to the pupil/teacher ratios in the post-primary schools would generally be in the order of 1 to 2 units to be achieved over a period of time as vacancies occurred in the schools.  A similar procedure would be adopted in relation to a phasing out of the schemes for the appointment of Clerical Assistants and Caretakers in National and Secondary Schools which were introduced in 1978 for the purpose of creation of employment in different economic and financial circumstances.</P>
    <P>On coming into office I looked at these measures and took out the worst of them because of the damage they would do to the education system.</P>

Which course do the Opposition wish us to pursue?  Let them identify for me and tell the country where additional funds will come from.  They cannot simultaneously demand bigger spending and lower taxation, or increased borrowing.  They owe it to the electorate to come clean on this issue.  They will be judged on the sincerity of their case.</P>

It is based on the following propositions: the level of taxation cannot be increased &mdash; it is already too high, particularly for the PAYE worker.  Our level of borrowing, particularly foreign borrowing, as a percentage of GNP is too high and must be reduced.  Our present level of educational services must be continued for the increasing number of pupils and students in the educational system and where possible improved.  The disadvantaged in our society must be given priority in the allocation of funds for education.  Finally, the educational system in our country must be made as cost-effective and as cost-efficient as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within those parameters, I now want to place on the record of the House the details of the policy I and the Government have followed.  Of course there were cuts in education, in 1983 &mdash; I never said there were not.  Of course the pupil/teacher ratio has been disimproved, <Col N="1536" /> but what has been done with much of the money saved from these cuts?  We have introduced a series of new measures which in the main divert the saved resources to the disadvantaged and other priority areas.  Let me be explicit.  In 1984, following the introduction of the Programme for Action, the Government made available the sum of £7 million for improved measures as follows: an increase of £4 per pupil, the highest ever, in the rate of capitation grant payable in respect of the running costs of national schools, costing £2.3 million; a special fund of £0.5 million for primary education in disadvantaged areas; an increase of £8 per pupil in the rate of grant payable to secondary school authorities, costing £1.6 million; an increased provision of £781,000 for inservice training, aid for school books and micro-computers in secondary schools; an additional £2 million for primary school building, £300,000 for grants to sport organisations; and £300,000 for the Curriculum and Examinations Board.</P>
    <P>I continued these improvements in the level of services in the current year.  Additional resources have been made available in 1985 at primary level for the continuance of the special subvention of £500,000 for the disadvantaged; the provision of additional remedial teachers in areas of special need; an increase in capitation grants for national schools; an increase of over 50 per cent in the grants under the national school libraries scheme, and additional investment in in-service training of teachers.</P>
    <P>The improvements at post primary level were: the reintroduction of the scheme for remedial teachers in post-primary schools discontinued in 1980 by the then Fianna Fáil Government; an increase in the grant in lieu of school fees; the provision of additional guidance posts in disadvantaged areas; the great expansion of European Social Fund assisted courses in post primary schools; additional investment in in-service training for teachers; and increased provision for the free books scheme.</P>
    <P>The improvements at third level were: <Col N="1537" /> an increase in real terms of 10 per cent in the maintenance grant for higher education students and an increase in real terms of the income limits for eligibility, both from September next.  A tapering mechanism will also be introduced to provide part of the tuition fee for those just outside the normal income limits for eligibility.</P>
    <P>In adult education an allocation of £150,000 is being provided this year as an initial step towards an allocation of £1 million per annum by 1987 to enable VECs to provide courses free of charge in literacy and community education in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>As the House will see, much of the money arising from the disimprovement of the pupil-teacher ratio and other areas has been diverted towards the disadvantaged. I make no apology to anyone for this course of action.  I have consistently said during my period of office that the disadvantaged will be my priority.  The measures I have taken on their behalf speak for themselves.  Do the Opposition want me to improve the pupil-teacher ratio at the expense of the disadvantaged? They know as well as I do that both cannot be improved in the present year. To tie educational advance and reform to further massive demands on the taxpayer is wrong and is completely unacceptable. I have nailed my colours to the mast.  I give priority to the disadvantaged.</P>

      <P>Talking about the disadvantaged brings me to my next point.  I read in the newspaper the other day, to my astonishment, that Deputy O'Rourke spoke of a connection between our current economic difficulties on the education front and the growth of crime among the young.  It is bad enough that there should be anyone in this House who would be disposed to make political capital out of our economic and financial difficulties. These difficulties have, of course, held back many developments in education which I would have been only too <Col N="1538" /> anxious to press ahead with.  I utterly deplore the fact that the Opposition spokesperson should use an opportunity in the newspaper to sow doubt and confusion in the minds of the community generally and to seek to capitalise upon the widespread concern about the present level of crime among the young.</P>

      <P>It is monstrous to suggest that the educational system is the cause of an increase in the crime rate.  The present day incidence of crime among the young is but a manifestation of an international phenomenon that prevails throughout the western world, the causes of which are complex and not too clearly understood.  One factor that is clear is that, in this country, it has mainly come to light among our under-priviledged groups.  On that front I can claim to have done more for the educationally disadvantaged, as a member of this Government, than any previous Government did.</P>

      <P>Having stated my priority, I want to turn new to the macro-budget for the education group of votes. With all the furore about cuts, sight is lost of the improvement in real terms in the resources made available.  I do so because the statements made at the teachers congresses and the recent figures which have been thrown around by some and also by Deputy O'Rourke are both misleading and inaccurate.  It has been suggested that there was a reduction in real terms in the expenditure for post-primary education since 1983.  That is simply not correct.  Such conclusions may be erroneously drawn if one does not take into account the subventions from the Youth employment levy, the ESF funding or the 5½ per cent increase in salaries, wages and pensions for the financial year 1985.</P>

      <P>In point of fact, on the basis of the index of inflation of the CSO instead of a shortfall as alleged in total expenditure for post-primary education, expenditure for post primary education in real terms has been maintained.  But if you take current expenditure alone, there has been an increase of £7.145 million in real terms in 1985 compared with 1982. There was a reduction in 1983 and 1984 in real terms on capital spending as, because of the cyclical nature of school building, sufficient cases had not reached tender stage to warrant and increase in real terms.</P>

      <P>I have also seen it suggested that the figures for educational expenditure indicated in the national plan <i>Building on Reality,</i> imply a reduction of 5 per cent of GNP between 1984 and 1987.  But what is overlooked by those who suggest this is that the national plan projections for education were net figures.  In other words, they did not reflect subventions from the youth employment levy or the ESF funding. But more importantly, these projections in the plan assumed no pay increase in 1985.  We all know now that an increase of 4½ per cent for the full 1985 financial year in pay and pensions has been approved for all teachers.  Those who might be tempted to believe some of the false suggestions that are around should understand the inaccuracies being made in the basis of calculations.  I say this. not in any sense of bitterness or anger, but in the interests of setting the record straight.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me give the facts about our expenditure on education since 1982.  The gross voted provision in 1982 was £738.9 million compared with an estimated expenditure in 1985 of £969 million.  Allowing for inflation, this represents an increase of 3 per cent in real terms.  This year our estimates have been increased by 8.5 per cent over 1984, compared with a projected rate of inflation of 6 per cent.  That is an increase in real terms.  That is the reality.  This account of our expenditure on education since 1982 and the increase in real terms is an indication of the Government's commitment to the development of our educational system despite the difficult financial situation.  We have already provided more funds every year since coming into office.  Of course, we would wish to spend more of the national cake on education but that proportion of the cake that is eaten up by repayments of our excessive borrowing over the years has increased, leaving less for the current public services, including education.  For example, in 1976 the percentage of GNP <Col N="1541" /> for the Exchequer borrowing requirement was 11 per cent.  In 1981, the percentage had grown to 16.3 per cent.  Since then, this Government, as I said earlier, have controlled the State finances and the percentages of GNP for the Exchequer borrowing requirement has been reduced to 13 per cent in 1985.  It is still too high and precludes us from doing all the things we would wish to do in education.</P>
    <P>We never have any difficulty in justifying expenditure on education.  We could double the budget and justify every penny spent in terms of the quality of the service offered.  But what would be the result&mdash;total financial chaos.</P>
    <P>Our level of expenditure, therefore, must take account of the capacity of the taxpayer to meet the bill.  To talk of ensuring a future for our young people does not mean only providing them with the best possible education we can give them, it also means handing on to them an economy in good health.</P>
    <P>The worst possible favour we could do our young people would be to saddle them with terrible national debts and to make them pay later for our spending now.  This debate and any debate about spending on education must take place in the context of that reality.</P>
    <P>The original motion alleges that excessive increases in the size of classes have taken place and that large numbers of teachers are unemployed.  Wild exaggeration of the effects of a pupil-teacher ratio reduced by one unit does neither the education system, the teacher nor the school management any justice.  We have heard much of the damage done to the education system by an increase in the size of classes and about subjects being dropped from the curriculum.  Let us get something straight once and for all.  Class size and range of subject options are decided by the principal of any post-primary school within (1) the parameters of the pupil-teacher ratio, (2) the length of the school week and (3) the number of hours taught by each teacher.  Pupil-teacher ratio is not the sole determinant of class, size or subject options.  Never let us forget that fact.  It is perhaps understandable <Col N="1542" /> that these options are not highlighted at teacher's conferences, but they should be remembered.</P>
    <P>With regard to pupil-teacher ratio, every one forgets that from 1972 to 1977 the pupil-teacher ratio for the appointment of teachers in secondary schools was the present figure of 20.1.  At that time the national ratios varied from 18.2 to 18.8.  Then for the school year 1977-78, the ratio was improved from 20:1 to 19:1.  The national ratio varied from 17.8 in 1977 to 17.1 in 1982.  The national ratio for 1983 was 17.5 to 1 and an estimated 17.9 to 1 in the current year.  These are the facts.  To talk then in wild, exaggerated terms of the disastrous effects of the change in pupil-teacher ratio is just irresponsible.</P>
    <P>Now let us look at another factor which decides class size and subject options&mdash; the average number of hours taught by each teacher.  For a long number of years now, there has been a trend for post-primary teachers to reduce the number of hours of instruction per week.  An analysis was done in my Department in 1973 of the average teaching week of secondary teachers over a period of years.  It showed that between 1964 and 1973 there was an estimated drop of 41 minutes in the average weekly teaching time of secondary teachers.  It would be interesting to update that study.  The plain fact is that if post-primary teachers were prepared to teach for one or two extra class periods per week, the effects of the reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio would be substantially less or avoided altogether.</P>

Not one permanent teacher in a post-primary school has lost a job. <Col N="1543" /> Not one permanent teacher in a post-primary school has been made redundant.  The position is that some 600 teachers who are in excess of the quota have been retained in post-primary schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>Even from 1977 to 1981 when hundreds of extra graduates were trained, large numbers could not get jobs. If we are going to debate the issue of education cuts let us have a serious debate.</P>
      <P>Turning to primary teachers where, of course, there was no disimprovement in the pupil-teacher ratio, the position is that 97 per cent of the teachers who qualified in 1982 have been appointed to posts in national schools.  This is comparable to the experience of previous years. The figures for 1983 are 81 per cent appointed and for 1984, 40 per cent.  Long term substitute employment is available in national schools where teachers are absent through illness, maternity leave and attendance at University courses. The total number in substitute employment on any given day is estimated at 600. In deciding on the number of teachers to be trained, it is necessary to ensure a supply of personnel to undertake such substitute work which is essential for the proper maintenance of educational services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before going on to talk about the ordering of priorities I want to refer again to the issues of class size and subject options, which have been highlighted recently.  In assessing the validity of any claims that may be made, it is important to remember that considerable improvements have been made between 1982-83 and 1984-85 in the situation in junior <Col N="1544" /> science-an improvement of 19 per cent; senior cycle physics-an improvement of 14 per cent and in senior cycle biology &mdash; an improvement of 13 per cent.  In addition for other subjects the difference between 1982-83 and 1984-85 is only 1 per cent in either direction, some positive, some negative.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the issue of subject choice.  On this question, we have reliable data supplied annually by the schools themselves.  I have had a detailed analysis made covering every subject at both the junior cycle and the senior cycle for the years 1982-83 and 1983-84 which demonstrates that the accusation in general is not only unsustained but unsustainable. The details of the schools offering various subjects are as follows.</P>
    <P>Despite a slight fall in the number of post schools providing a junior cycle course, from 805 in 1982-83 to 803 in 1983-84, the numbers of schools providing various elective subjects showed increases between these two years.  This occurred in the case of modern languages &mdash; German and Italian &mdash; science, home economics, music, art, technology &mdash; all three subjects &mdash; PE, and classical studies.</P>
    <P>There was a slight increase in the number of post primary schools offering the leaving certificate from 775 to 778 between 1982-83 and 1983-84.  There were increases recorded for almost all subjects in the number of schools offering particular subjects.  Most schools offered higher course Irish, English, Maths, all modern languages except Spanish, geography, all science subjects, all technology subjects, accounting and business organisation, art and music.  These again are the facts based on returns from the schools.</P>
    <P>I have also heard allegations that there has been a continual reduction in teacher numbers in recent years.  This is not the case.  There was a fall in the number of incremental teachers between 1982-83 and 1983-84 but a rise in the number of wholetime equivalents between 1983-84 and 1984-85.</P>
    <P>In 1983-84, there was a total of 39,811 in primary and post primary <Col N="1545" /> schools.  Now in 1984-85, there are 40,194 &mdash; an increase of 383.  Post-primary teachers including whole time equivalents have increased from 19,079 in 1983-84 to 19,310 an increase of 231 teachers.  The cost of the teaching service has increased over the years.  In 1984, the cost to the taxpayer for salaries was £627 million.  In 1985, this cost including the latest increase of 4½ per cent has grown to £669 million, an increase of 6.6 per cent over 1984.</P>
    <P>Now let us look at the realities.  The Irish education system is strong, vibrant and adaptable.  Much development and reform have taken place over the past two years.  Following the Programme for Action which charted the way ahead for the next few years, the system is coming into top gear.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Hussey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Curriculum and Examinations Board is operating well and has already published two excellent papers.  The reform of our curriculum is in good hands and is well under way.  This initiative, widely welcomed in educational circles, is potentially one of the most significant steps taken in Irish education.</P>
      <P>The setting up of a parents council has been facilitated and the inaugural meeting of the primary and post primary tiers will be held on 11 May next.  The provision of micro-computers in every post-primary school was completed last year.</P>
      <P>The major breakthrough in European social funding for pre-employment and technician courses has led to a considerable increase in the numbers attending such courses.  Some 14,000 young people started the pre-employment courses in September last.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Funding has also been approved for the middle level technician programme in the RTCs and colleges of technology. The numbers attending these courses have increased from 4,000 to 10,000 since 1984.  The expansion of this programme <Col N="1546" /> means that the vast majority of students of RTCs and colleges of technology are now receiving State grants or scholarships.</P>
    <P>The Government made the sum of £500,000 available in 1984 and again in 1985 for the disadvantaged areas, as well as additional funds to increase the free books schemes, to provide extra remedial and guidance teachers, and to improve the school library schemes.  The higher education grants' scheme is being significantly improved for those students whose parents are in the lower income groups, adult education, particularly in the areas of literacy and community education where courses will attract additional funds this year and up to 1987.  These are just some of my priorities.  I suggest to the House that the many areas of reform that I have undertaken are in the present financial circumstances the most effective way of spending our resources.</P>
    <P>I am concerned that the quality of the teaching in our schools should be as high as possible.  What takes place within the four walls of the classroom is what education is all about.  The educational system is not all about the numbers of teachers in schools.  For that reason a further priority of mine has been to increase significantly the resources for in-service training of teachers.  In 1984, a sum of £377,464 was expended on in-service courses, compared with £226,136 in 1983. This year a total of £486,000 is being made available.  The provision for 1985 represents a monetary increase of 114.9 per cent over 1983 and an increase in real terms of 87 per cent.</P>
    <P>A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I believe I have demonstrated to any fair-minded person that the channelling of resources has been done in the most effective way possible.  We should be proud as a country &mdash; and in this I have no hesitation in including Fianna Fáil Governments in the more distant past &mdash; that our education system is as strong and as internationally respected as it is today.</P>

      <P>This motion will show that there is great concern among the people about the trends in education.  The purpose is to show the Government of the day, who are obsessed with balancing books, that reducing our education standards will have serious, long term repercussions for this nation.</P>
      <P>The amendment put down by the Government is hypocritical in its every sentiment.  The Minister has not spoken with one ounce of conviction.  She has been told, time and again since taking office, that she is completely off beat. She spent almost all her time this evening telling what Fianna Fáil were doing and arrived at the latter part of her speach before making any attempt, as she said herself, at being serious and telling us what she proposed to do.</P>
      <P>The teachers, parents, boards of management, members of the Minister's own party and particularly the Labour Party spokesperson on Education, are unanimous that education development has not alone stopped but has taken a few steps backwards.  Imagine trying to convince people that progress has been made in educational development or that there is special intervention for the disadvantaged. This is nothing short of telling untruths.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that this motion is before the House because in the past two and half years the trends in education have given cause for concern in our community. Educational standards have been painstakingly built up over many years and slow but positive progress has been made.  One must consider that just over <Col N="1549" /> 100 years ago generations of Irish children had no formal education whatsoever. Some of the luckier ones found themselves at hedge schools where they were taught the three Rs &mdash; reading, writing and arithmetic &mdash; and where the teacher, if caught, was executed and the parents of the children tortured.</P>
    <P>Slowly but surely, we made progress and then came the free primary educational system where every child under 14 years of age was obliged to attend primary school.  Progress was made with the building of secondary schools, which were confined mainly to people with means.  That meant that in rural areas, particularly, three to four out of a parish might have attended such secondary schools.</P>
    <P>Then came the vocational education committees who built schools for second level education known as &ldquo;the tech.&rdquo;. This was an enormous advance and with the introduction of the concept of free education, with universities already well on their way in this country, it was decided to build regional technical colleges and every child in the nation could attend first, second and third level education without too much hardship on any parent.  Deputy Wilson brought us the closest we have been to cherishing each of the children of this nation equally.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>We made progress in that area, but in the last two and a half years we have taken many steps backwards. This is in evidence at every level of education.  The reason for the steps backwards are the cutbacks proposed and operated by the present Government. Deputy Hussey was given the most important task of being Minister for Education and one would have thought that, with our history of education, any Minister would have been able to fight off any attempt at cutbacks in the education budget.  Instead, she weakly gave way to the swashbuckling demands of the Minister for Finance, who showed complete disregard for the rights of young people. Both these Ministers displayed an attitude <Col N="1550" /> of no confidence in our children or in their future, when they withdrew from them the educational facilities which were rightfully theirs.  Were they reacting to remarks such as that we have the most educated dole queue, or questions like why should we educate for export?  Yes, we have massive numbers unemployed and we have massive numbers emigrating. But Fianna Fáil believe that this will not always be the case.  We must demonstrate confidence in our youngsters and show them that there is a future for them.</P>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil believe that we can provide a future worthy of our young people and we intend to give them the best education there is, so that they can take their rightful place in society and that wherever they travel they can hold their heads high.  The Minister was not an hour in office when she decided to take the school buses off the road, but she was beaten off that track by strong, constructive criticism from Fianna Fáil. She has caused great resentment between families by that very action, which resentment will last for generations to come. The Minister for Finance provided the axe and the Minister for Education wielded it right, left and centre from sheer ignorance of what was going on in the country.</P>
      <P>I know of children who because of such cutbacks had to forego their second level education.  Shame on the Minister that she would deny any child of this nation an opportunity of any type of education, an opportunity which Fianna Fáil had given to every child.  The Minister, by her scrimping and scrounging attitude, has created the situation in which there are far more travelling on school buses than there is insurance for.  We in Fianna Fáil do not support overspending in any respect, but we expect our children to be treated with dignity and not to be herded like cattle to our schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a recent survey it has been discovered that 75 per cent of pupils leaving national school today need remedial teaching in secondary schools.  This is an indictment of the Department of which the Minister is now in control.  There are children passing through the national <Col N="1551" /> school system who on leaving have a reading age of five or six years.  Such a child was obviously left behind in the national school and will obviously be left behind in the secondary school.  How can that child achieve anything in life?  The big problem is that there are so many such children.  Seventy-five per cent of pupils going into second level education have a reading age of ten years or less. This is a national scandal.</P>
    <P>The art of reading is a most essential ingredient for living, whether it be for work or pleasure.  No matter what the job, a person must now be able to read. It is necessary on building sites, farms and council schemes, where orders given in writing are now the norm.  If a person cannot read, he or she will just not be employed.  Is that the progress to which the Minister referred in her amendment? Where is the special intervention for the disadvantaged in that situation?  It is bad enough not to be able to find a job, but not to be able to qualify for a job is an indictment of the Minister's weak grasp of our educational needs.  Imagine the embarrassment of those who cannot read, and cannot even fill up an application form for social welfare benefit, which for him or her is inevitable.</P>
    <P>There are many situations in which such a person will be embarrassed &mdash; in a restaurant, at a football match.  An example is the person who left Dublin for Galway and ended up in Kerry because he could not read the signposts.  The Minister must realise that we are approaching the 21st century.  She is condemning children to a life without being able to read or write.  They are bereft of the satisfaction of gathering information from books and they face the tragedy of not having a job.  They also have to bear the embarrassment of being scoffed at because of their inability to read.  They will not thank the Minister for the cutbacks in this area of education.</P>
    <P>All pupils entering vocational schools have a reading age of ten or less and that fact cannot be repeated too often.  No amount of platitudes or crying will change that situation.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of <Col N="1552" /> today's date there is a story on education. Five thousand new teaching jobs are needed if we are to have parity with the North according to the union.  The first two paragraphs of the report read as follows:</P>
    <P>New research shows that over 5,000 more permanent national teachers would need to be employed in the Republic to bring the pupil-teacher ratio into line with that of Northern Ireland, according to the Irish National Teachers Organisation.</P>
    <P>The general secretary of the union, Mr. Gerry Quigley, said that this was at a time when Northern teachers were dissatisfied with their own ratio which was 22 to one - higher than Britain's.</P>
    <P>There are many pupils in classes of over 35 and in many instances in classes of over 40.  In such a class the slow learner does not stand a chance.  The teacher finds himself or herself in the dilemma that if they move ahead with the brighter pupils the slow learner will be left behind. If called upon to read, the slow learner's anxiety will further lessen his ability, causing untold anguish to the child.  Let no one blame the teachers.  They do excellent work, often times above and beyond the call of duty.  Their work rate and dedication must be matched by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware that there are hundreds of primary, secondary, third level, remedial and career guidance teachers who are unemployed, some of whom the Minister has encouraged to emigrate?  All the nonsense of the Minister this evening will not change those statistics.  There is a great demand for a reduction in the pupil-teacher ratio, as there is a demand for remedial teachers. The teachers are available.  Some 500 of those who qualified in the primary section in 1984 are still unemployed.  They are on social welfare.  Would it not be better to pay them to meet the demand, rather than to pay them to stay at home?</P>
    <P>With regard to large classes, there are 58,343 pupils in classes of 40 pupils.  Solving this problem must be given priority. <Col N="1553" /> Second level education needs remedial teachers immediately.  As I said before, the figure is that of 75 per cent who are in need.  For instance, in the vocational scheme in Wexford there are 2,438 pupils in seven schools located in the county and for that number of pupils we have three remedial teachers.  There is an embargo on the employment of more remedial teachers and let nobody tell me otherwise.</P>
    <P>However, the real problem is in the primary schools.  This may have been caused by the fact that parents do not pay the same attention to helping their children as they did in the past.  Television is an easy way to keep children out of trouble.  In many instances both parents are working and when they arrive home late in the evening they are too tired to spend time with their children.  We cannot turn back the clock.  We are in a new era for which we need answers, not excuses.</P>
    <P>There are 20,500 primary school teachers permanently employed at present but we need 26,000 if we are to keep that sector on a par with the North.  There are only 700 remedial teachers employed at this level of education.  I estimate that the ratio of national teachers to remedial teachers should be at least ten to one. Momentum was gathering for a resolution of this problem but the Minister has broken that momentum.  She should get back to the job for which she was appointed.  The cutbacks are causing misery.  Commonsense should be the order of the day.</P>
    <P>The Minister has attacked county vocational education committees but her obvious intention to lessen the status of these bodies will not be tolerated.  An instance of this point arose recently when Wexford Vocational Education Committee intended to build a new vocational school at Gorey.  The committee investigated all possible sites and they decided to move to a site north of Gorey town. This site was extensive and would have accommodated future extensions and it would allow for adequate playing facilities and a campus near the residential area of Gorey.  The committee debated the topic for one year, they visited the <Col N="1554" /> site on three occasions and they called the Department officials to Gorey but eventually they were told by the Minister that they would build where they were told on a site provided by the Loretto community.  The CBS will also build there but the site in question is a bog.  It is small, there is no change of finding playing facilities near by, the contours are all wrong and the boundaries of the site are the railway line on one side and the national primary route on the other. Some 1,200 pupils will have to be accommodated that area, with not enough room to swing a cat.  That is what the Minister's cutbacks are achieving.  To add insult to injury, the vocational education committee were told that their views were no longer necessary or required.  I am saying the vocational educational system has served this country well and its contribution in the educational area has been enormous.  Its local knowledge has been most beneficial.  It is vital that we retain the local interest in education.  Too often we have seen services diminish with the erosion of local democracy.  The resistance of the vocational education committees to the Minister's proposals must leave her in no doubt that the elimination of such committees to accommodate her own weakness at the Cabinet table will not be acceptable.</P>
    <P>In third level education the cutbacks have meant that because of the higher entry standards many children have been deprived of the opportunity of having a third level education.  Regional colleges were set up by us to help those who were not so good at academic subjects.  We recognised that everyone has talent and that everyone has the right to develop that talent.  Education is a basic right to whch every child is entitled.  Going through the system is not enough.  Each child is entitled to bring to fruition his or her talents but the Minister has made a mockery of that philosophy.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 549 to 551 inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The State mining lease held by Flair Resources (Ireland) Ltd. over the Ballingarry coalfield is in the hands of a receiver. A number of expressions of interest in the mine property have been made to the receiver, one involving a lease transfer agreement between a Canadian company and Flair Resources (Ireland) Ltd. prior to the latter going into receivership. However, I have not received any request from the receiver for my approval of the assignment of the lease to any of the parties who have been in contact with him.  In this connection any proposal by the workforce to operate the mine on a co-operative basis would have to be addressed to the receiver in the first instance.  If any such proposal is put to me by the receiver I will give it due consideration.</P>
      <P>In December 1984 my Department, concerned about the effect the flooding would have on the mine, engaged consultants to investigate and report on the condition of the flooded mine at Lickfinn and to estimate the cost of dewatering and rehabilitating the mine.  While they had difficulty in precisely assessing the consequences of flooding for the mine workings, the consultants considered that mine roadways and heavy machinery now under water will not have deteriorated significantly before about July-August 1985 but that after that time deterioration could occur.  It was estimated that the minimum cost of dewatering the mine and rehabilitating the mine roadways and transport facilities would be about £165,000; this figure does not include the cost of rehabilitating mechanical and electrical equipment.  The precise cost would depend, of course, on conditions at the time of dewatering and on the condition of the roadways and equipment after dewatering had been effected.  I am not in a position to comment on the extent to which these costs might discourage potential purchasers.</P>

      <P>Retail prices for beef are not subject to detailed price control but are subject to extensive and regular monitoring by the National Prices Commission.  The commission's latest published report, for November-December 1984, shows that in the 12 months to December 1984 the increase in the national average retail price for beef at 2.3 per cent was the same as the 2.3 per cent increase recorded in producer beef prices.  The commission <Col N="1299" /> indicated that they were of the view that the levels of retail margins taken were not unreasonable in the market conditions.</P>
      <P>Statistics available to the commission in respect of the period January to March 1985 show an increase of 7.6 per cent in producer prices for beef sold for home consumption.  The increase in retail prices over the same period, as indicated by the commission's surveys, is 2.4 per cent. Reports of the National Prices Commission are issued to Deputies and are available in the Dáil Library.</P>

      <P>Section 37 of the Road Traffic Act, 1961 provides for the carry over of endorsements on a driving licence to subsequent driving licences.  Under this provision a person whose licence has been endorsed must, before he can obtain a licence free from endorsement, satisfy the licensing authority that he has held a driving licence either during a continuous period of not less than three years or a series of discontinuous periods amounting in the aggregate to not less than five years after the date of the original endorsement.</P>
      <P>In the case referred to by the Deputy the licence in question, which had been endorsed on 12 August 1981, expired on 8 July 1982.  It was not, however, renewed until the applicant applied for and was granted a three year licence on 30 September 1982.  He will have satisfied the requirement that the endorsement be carried on the licence for a continuous period of three years on 29 September 1985 and may then be granted a licence free from that endorsement.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to issue a public <Col N="1315" /> statement in relation to the proposal to establish a waste transfer station at Baldonnel. Following is the text of the statement:</P>
      <P>Proposal to establish a Waste Transfer Station at Baldonnel, County Dublin</P>
      <P>The Minister for the Environment, Mr. Liam Kavanagh, TD, has decided to carry out a review of the need for a central waste transfer station for hazardous wastes, the viability in present conditions of a facility on the lines decided upon by the Government in May 1981 and the possibility of making alternative arrangements for hazardous waste disposal services of the kind which are necessary to serve the needs of industry and the environment.</P>
      <P>The proposal to provide a central waste transfer station was developed because of the inadequacy of the facilities available in this country in 1981 to cater for the safe disposal of hazardous wastes which could seriously prejudice the operation and expansion of existing industry and inhibit the attraction of new industry.  In addition, there was public disquiet about unacceptable waste disposal practices and the implications of these for public health and the environment.  Against this background, the Government announced a national waste disposal strategy providing for a central facility, backed up by a network of co-disposal sites at which land-fillable wastes could be accommodated.  The central facility was intended as a depot to which hazardous waste producers who did not have satisfactory alternative means of disposal could send their wastes for assembly in categories and quantities suitable for export to approved disposal facilities abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While there have been some unavoidable delays, plans for a facility designed to the highest possible environmental and safety standards have now been virtually completed. In the meantime, however, there have been developments which could have a <Col N="1316" /> bearing on the proposal.  In particular, consultations with private sector interests have established that the waste disposal services now being provided have developed to a considerable degree since the central waste transfer station was decided upon and that there may well be an interest in expanding these services and providing new facilities.  In addition, recent developments suggest that the continuing availability of the export option for certain wastes may be in question.  For these reasons, and because the planned facility would provide only part of the total hazardous waste disposal service needed by industry, the Minister considers it essential that all aspects of the proposal should now be reviewed.</P>
    <P>The Minister will be meeting the UK Secretary of State for the Environment, Mr. Patrick Jenkin, in London next month for discussions on a number of matters of environmental concern.  The Minister proposes to take the opportunity to discuss with the Secretary of State the question of exports of hazardous wastes for disposal in the UK, taking account of the coming into operation in October 1985 of the EC directive on transfrontier shipment of toxic and dangerous wastes.</P>
    <P>With a view to exploring further the possibility of developing other options for dealing with hazardous wastes, the Minister is inviting interests concerned to submit to him, within two months, any proposals they may have for the development of existing hazardous waste disposal services, or the establishment of new facilities to deal with these wastes.  Such proposals or facilities could relate to depots, transfer stations, or facilities for the incineration, solidification, recovery or other treatment of wastes.  The Minister would be particularly interested to learn of possible joint-venture operations between existing Irish firms and firms which operate, or have access to, a range of disposal facilities abroad.</P>
    <P>The Minister proposes to establish a small expert group to assist those <Col N="1317" /> interested in developing proposals (for example by giving them access to relevant information), to assess whatever proposals emerge, and to make recommendations to him.  It will be the Minister's intention to consider, on the basis of these recommendations, whether, and to what extent, he could assist in the development by private sector interests of suitable schemes, or whether the establishment of the central waste facility should be proceeded with.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 627 and 628 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the Irish seamen's compensation scheme, pensions and allowances are paid to seamen who were injured due to warfare while serving on Irish ships during the 1939-1945 Emergency period and to widows and other dependants of <Col N="1333" /> seamen who lost their lives in similar circumstances during that period.  The statutory authority for payment of such pensions and allowances is the Continuation of Compensation Schemes Act, 1946, which continued in force the Emergency Powers (No. 263) Order, 1943.</P>
    <P>Under the scheme a person may be awarded a pension if he was a dependant of a seaman and is in pecuniary need and incapable of self support.  When the seaman referred to in the Deputy's question was reported missing, his parents' claim to an allowance under the seamens' compensation scheme was investigated and disallowed because pecuniary need was absent.  The person referred to in the Deputy's question was not a dependant of the missing seaman, and, consequently, he is not eligible for an allowance under the scheme.  The person in question and his solicitors were informed of the position by letters from my Department in February and August 1984, respectively.</P>

      <P>Davitt House, the Department of Labour building in Mespil Road, was completed in the mid-1960s.

      <P>The building occupied by the Department of the Public Service in Kildare Street is owned by the State and is part of a complex completed in the mid-1970s. The brickwork in the entire complex was in danger of falling away from the main structure of the building, and the owners of the rest of the complex engaged a contractor to carry out remedial work at their property.  For reasons of convenience, safety and cost, and with the approval of the Government Contracts Committee, the same contractor was engaged (without advertising for tenders) to carry out the appropriate work at the Department of the Public Service.  The cost of that work will be about £110,000.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit on 27 November 1984 and his claim was allowed at the appropriate maximum rate in his case of £96.55 weekly.

The balance outstanding to date is £219.55.</P>
      <P>He does not however satisfy the contribution condition of having 280 paid contributions in the seven year period prior to the date of his claim to enable him to receive the maximum rate of unemployment benefit for the full period of 390 days.

      <P>The person concerned whose husband died on 29 June 1984 was awarded a widow's non-contributory pension of £74.25 per week with effect from 17 August 1984.  This is the maximum rate for a widow under 66 years of age with three qualified children.</P>
      <P>Her late husband had worked in Britain for some time and the Department of Health and Social Security, Newcastleupon-Tyne, were requested on 10 October 1984 to investigate her entitlement to a British pension.  Arrears amounting to Stg £1,251.15 were received from that Department on 12 December 1984 in respect of widow's allowance payable for a period of six months after her husband's death.  Payment of her Irish non-contributory pension is subject to a means test, however, and these arrears were held pending a final decision by the British Authorities on the claimant's continuing entitlement to a pension from them after the expiry of the six month period.</P>
      <P>The Department of Health and Social Security have now awarded her a continuing widow's benefit at a rate of Stg £15.75 with effect from 1 January 1985 and further arrears of Stg £220.50 to cover the period of 1 January 1985 to 8 April 1985 will be sent by them shortly.</P>

      <P>The person concerned reached age 66 years on 12 January 1985 and claimed a contributory old age pension on 25 January 1985.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a contributory old age pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires a claimant to have a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions over the period from the beginning of the 1953 contribution year or from the beginning of the year in which he entered into insurance, whichever is the later, to the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached pension age.</P>
      <P>The Department's records show that the person concerned had a total of 135 contributions in the required period which, in his case, is from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1984.  This is equal to a yearly average of only five and, therefore, he does not qualify for a contributory old age pension.  The local social welfare officer has been asked to investigate his entitlement to a non-contributory old age pension and a decision will be made when the investigation is completed.</P>

This continued to be cashed for the six weeks up to 28 March 1985.  The other three quarters of the amount paid in respect of that six weeks is being offset against the arrears arising on the separate claims on behalf of his sister and two brothers all of whom have different guardians.</P>

      <P>The appeal of the person concerned <Col N="1398" /> against the reduction in the rate of deserted wife's benefit being paid to her was received at the end of January. The immediate cause of the appeal was the cessation of an increase of £12.80 a week in respect of a dependant over 18 years of age who ceased full time education in July 1984.  Owing to an administrative error, this reduction was not made in the pension until 20 December 1984.</P>
      <P>The appeal also made reference to another dependant who had reached 18 years of age in 1983, the increase in respect of whom had ceased to be paid at that stage.  The precise entitlements of this latter dependant, whether by way of increase on the pension of the person concerned or otherwise, are being investigated at present.  A social welfare officer will call on the person concerned within the next few days to discuss the details of the questions at issue.  If necessary, following that officer's report, the case will then be submitted to an appeals officer for determination.  The person concerned is at present in receipt of payment in respect of herself and three dependent children.</P>

      <P>The production of whitethorn quicks is a traditional form of culture which can be expanded to meet increased market demand.  Enlargement of fields reduced demand and prices for hedging plants. Consequently many producers cut back on production.  More recently demand has increased and supplies are more scarce and expensive.  The improved demand and prices provide the incentive for producers to increase output.  It could also be advantageous for the growers to consider forming a group to improve the planning of their production and marketing. Grant aid is not envisaged for the production of thorn quicks.</P>

      <P>Council Regulation (EEC) No. 1054/81, which established a common measure for the development of beef cattle production in Ireland and Northern Ireland, expired on 30 April 1984.  I have requested an extension of the Regulation <Col N="1423" /> which would allow for the construction of performance and progeny testing facilities at Sligo AI Centre.  The Council of Agriculture Ministers undertook to decide on the matter following on a proposal from the Commission.  I expect the Commission to put forward a proposal shortly.</P>

      <P>Dairying has in recent years been among the more remunerative of farm enterprises. The future prospects for dairy farmers, including small farmers, will obviously depend on the level of EC price increases.  However, the extent to which we achieve greater efficiency at farm, processing and marketing levels will also have a major impact on producer returns.</P>

In recent years, however, in order to facilitate publishers, the Department accept submissions in manuscript form, so that approval can be given prior to printing and publication.  In this context my Department's inspectors have an opportunity at draft stage to discuss the application of the guidelines on sexism and sex-stereotyping to individual texts.  I am satisfied from the positive response which I received from the publishers that they too are committed to eliminate sexism, sex-stereotyping.  I consider it unlikely that it will be necessary for me to refuse approval to specific textbooks on these grounds.
