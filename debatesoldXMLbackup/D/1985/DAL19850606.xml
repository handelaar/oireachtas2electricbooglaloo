    <Title>Estimates, 1985. - Vote 23: Office of the Minister for Justice.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East</i>): I move:</P>
      <P>That a sum not exceeding £17,030,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>I propose that all the Votes for which I am responsible be taken together, but I shall endeavour to answer any questions on any particular Vote.</P>
      <P>The total Estimate for all the Votes for which I am responsible is £315,111,000, an increase of 7 per cent over the expenditure for these Votes of £295,454,000 in 1984.  The Estimate is made up as follows:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Vote 23 &mdash; Office of the Minister for Justice, £17,030,000; Vote 24&mdash; Garda <Col N="591" /> Síochána, £233,818,000; Vote 25&mdash;Prisons, £49,715,000; Vote 26 &mdash; Courts, £8,623,000; Vote 27 &mdash; Land Registry and Registry of Deeds, £5,806,000; Vote 28 &mdash; Charitable Donations and Bequests, £119,000.</P>
    <P>The element of expenditure which is greatest is pay and allowances etc., which accounts for 81 per cent of the total estimates and shows an increase of 3 per cent compared with 1984.</P>
    <P>The overall provision for the Garda Síochána in 1985 is £233,818,000.  The major items included in this figure are £179 million for salaries, allowances and overtime and £31.5 million for the pensions of former members and widows of former members of the Garda Síochána. In addition, £9.5 million is being provided for travelling, subsistence and miscellaneous expenses, £7 million for Garda transport and £4.3 million for radio, computer, office and other equipment.</P>
    <P>The provision for salaries and allowances provides for the continuation of Garda recruitment in order to maintain the strength of the force at approximately 11,400.  As I have already announced the general restriction on public service recruitment is not being applied to the Garda Síochána and any vacancies occurring during the year will be filled.  Over 100 recruits have been appointed so far this year and on the basis of current trends, I expect that about 150 further appointments will be made in 1985&mdash; the precise number will depend on the number of vacancies arising from retirements, resignations, etc.  Overall, approximately 1,200 recruits have been appointed since the Government took office, but allowing for wasteage due to retirements etc., the net increase in the overall strength of the force in the period is over 700.</P>
    <P>In considering the Estimate for the Garda Síochána it is inevitable that attention should be focussed to a substantial extent on the present crime situation.  For some time now this has been one of the major issues confronting our society. Before dealing with some of the specific measures that have been taken to deal <Col N="592" /> with crime I want first of all &mdash; even at the risk of repeating views that I have expressed before in this House &mdash; to make a few general remarks about it.</P>
    <P>The maintenance of law and order in society is a primary responsibility of Government and it is a responsibility which this Government have taken and continue to take very seriously.  When we took office in 1982 crime was increasing very rapidly and it was recognised that urgent measures needed to be taken to deal with the situation both in terms of physical measures such as prison accommodation and in terms of much needed reform in the criminal law.  As Minister for Justice charged with the responsibility of implementing the Government's policies in this regard, I am happy to say that considerable progress has been made in combating crime, and Deputies will recall that earlier this year the House endorsed the action I have taken and am in the course of taking when debating a motion on the subject.</P>
    <P>I know that some people have in the past said, and may again say, that the measures that are being taken to deal with crime fail to address themselves to its underlying causes.  The causes of crime are many and varied, and there is general agreement that poverty and social deprivation have a lot to do with it.  Yet, as I have pointed out before in this House, that fact of itself does not give a complete or satisfactory answer.  For one thing, it does not explain how it is that many people who are poor or live in what might be termed deprived circumstances never commit crime at all.  However, as the House knows from what I have said before, I accept that, by and large, persons involved in crime come from underprivileged backgrounds.  These are matters we must take into consideration in formulating a balanced policy for dealing with all the ills of our society, including crime &mdash; but in the meantime we must attack the phenomenon itself and the perpetrators of it, because the people of this country expect the Government to do no less than that.  Because the people have a legitimate right to demand security in their persons and property now and not <Col N="593" /> at some time in the future, it is the duty and responsibility of the Government to do all it can to provide them with this.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding the general impression that may have been created lately of spiralling crime &mdash; an impression created mainly because of the problem of car stealing in Dublin and attacks on elderly people in some western areas&mdash; the fact is that, for the first time in many years, the level of serious crime has dropped.</P>
    <P>In 1981 crime increased by about 23 per cent over the previous year; in 1982 the increase was about 9 per cent and in 1983 it had dropped to about 5 per cent. last year &mdash; 1984 &mdash; crime was down by 2.6 per cent in the State as a whole. In the Dublin Metropolitan Area 57,664 indictable offences were recorded, a decrease of 4.8 per cent on the figure for 1983.  I am hopeful that this downward trend in serious crime can be maintained given the full co-operation of the public with the Gardaí and given the commitment of the Government to resolving the problem.</P>
    <P>From the Figures I have given, it will be apparent that the measures that have been taken since I became Minister are proving effective.  There are three main components of the policy I have been pursuing.  First there is the question of reform of the criminal law &mdash; which was tackled in the Criminal Justice Act, with which the House is, I am sure, familiar and also in the legislation setting up the community service system &mdash; the Community Service Act 1984.  Second, the policy aims to strengthen the Garda Síochána to make it a more effective force in the fight against crime and to increase the rate of detection of criminals, and the third main aim is to provide adequate prison accommodation to contain people sentenced to imprisonment and to ensure that those who represent a danger to society serve their sentences in full.</P>
    <P>I do not propose to go over the ground of the legislation that has been enacted. The House has already spent a lot of time on that, and I will be coming before the House again shortly with the Complaints Bill and with the treatment regulations.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="594" /> As regards the Garda Síochána.  I have already mentioned that we are maintaining the force at its present high level. Maintaining the size of the force is, of course, only one of the measures being taken.  Steps have been and are being taken to improve Garda effectiveness&mdash; including the technological capability of the force &mdash; about which I will say more in a moment &mdash; and to ensure that he available resources are used to best advantage.  Particular emphasis is being placed on the provision of garda foot patrols, which are very important in the prevention of crime, and it is the policy of the commissioner to have as many gardaí as possible on foot patrol duty. There has been a substantial increase in the number of uniformed gardaí who are performing foot patrols and, in addition, the operation of new rostering systems is giving an improved garda presence on the beat at the times of greatest need.  Of course, without the benefit of modern technological resources the force could not provide an adequate response to the crime situation and, accordingly, the development of improved communications and computer equipment for the Garda Síochána has been one of my major priorities.</P>
    <P>The Estimate includes provision to enable the installation of the new national Garda communications network to proceed without delay.  The first phase of this network is now virtually completed.  This covers all of the 18 Garda Divisions outside of the Dublin Metropolitan Area and it provides the gardaí with their own independent radio communications system between divisions, between each division and its district stations and between these stations and the subdistrict stations attached to them.  In all close on 700 stations will be linked in this way.  This system is due to come into operation next month.  The finishing touches are now being put to it and the necesary training of the Garda in the operation of the system is being done at present.</P>
    <P>The second stage of the national network is the system for the Dublin Metropolitan Area and I recently signed a £2 <Col N="595" /> million contract for the radio equipment which will go into the 43 DMA stations and the new central DMA control centre. Tenders for a computerised command and control system to be installed in the control room are now being evaluated and I hope that it will be possible to place a contract for this element of the system in the near future.  Expenditure to date on the system is in the region of £7.5 million and the amount provided in the current year &mdash; £1.945 million &mdash; is sufficient to cover the amount of equipment that can be delivered and installed this year.  As you can see, the costs associated with this communications network are very high but the Government are satisfied that it is something that the Garda must have, now more than ever, when there is such particular concern about the levels of crime.  The system being provided is second to none in the world and I know that the Garda will put it to good use, to the benefit of us all.</P>
    <P>The provision for Garda computer equipment for 1985 is also sufficient to enable planned development of the force's computer network to take place. Towards the end of last year a contract worth over £300,000 was placed for the purchase of a large number of additional visual display units and ancillary equipment. This has enabled all the 18 Garda divisional headquarters and some other major stations outside the Dublin Metropolitan Area, and a further number of the busiest stations within the Dublin area, to be linked directly to the Garda computer.  This facility for immediate access to records &mdash; to check out, for example, stolen or suspect vehicles &mdash; is of very great practical assistance to the Garda.</P>
    <P>The provisions made for both radio and computer installations demonstrate clearly, I believe, that the Government are ensuring that the Garda continue to have the benefits of most up-to-date technology and equipment.</P>
    <P>In regard to the training of members of the Garda Síochána, as the House may be aware, the Garda Commissioner recently, with my approval, established <Col N="596" /> a committee to examine Garda training needs at all levels, from recruit stage up to and including the courses appropriate to senior rank level.  The committee include people from the private sector and the academic field who have valuable experience in personnel training and development.  In view of the wide range of training that they have been asked to look at, it will of necessity take some time for them to complete their work.  I have, therefore, asked the committee to give priority to the basic training to be provided for recruits as I am anxious to have an improved training curriculum ready for the next intake of recruits.  I hope that it will be possible to implement the recommendations of the committee at a very early date following receipt of their report.</P>
    <P>With regard to promotion in the Garda Síochána, as I have mentioned before, a new scheme setting out the procedures to be followed has been agreed by myself, the Garda Commissioner and the various Garda staff associations.  The aims of the system are to select for promotion the candidates who are best qualified and most suitable in all respects and to do this in a way that is fair and accepted as fair. I am confident that this new scheme will make a very significant contribution to the well-being of the Garda Síochána.  I hope also over the next few months to be giving further thought to other measures to improve the capability of the force to respond to the demanding challenges of to-day.</P>
    <P>As well as tackling effectively the manifestations of crime, I believe that measures aimed at preventing it are vitally important and this view is shared by the Garda authorities.  The Garda Síochána have within their ranks a full-time crime prevention advisory service.  The total strength of this unit is 24, comprising a detective inspector and four sergeants based at Harcourt Square who serve the Dublin Metropolitan Area.  There are two sergeants in the Cork East division and one sergeant in each of the other 17 Garda divisions.  There is also an administrative unit at Garda Headquarters with overall responsibility for crime prevention. <Col N="597" /> In addition, all members of the Garda Síochána have a responsibility in the prevention of crime as part of their ordinary Garda duties and the Garda authorities are anxious that all members of the force should promote public interest in crime prevention.</P>
    <P>Neighbourhood watch is perhaps the most effective crime prevention method yet devised internationally and I am glad to say that arrangements are now in train &mdash; following a successful experimental period &mdash; to extend the scheme throughout the country so far as practicable. Because of its potential as a measure of crime prevention, the Government recently allocated funds &mdash; about £150,000 &mdash; specifically for the promotion of the neighbourhood watch scheme and an extensive television and radio campaign has now been launched to give information and advice to people as to how they can become involved.  Other crime prevention measures will also be promoted including schemes such as the Muintir na Tíre developed community alert scheme in rural areas.  Neighbourhood watch is a strategy designed to combat today's crime problems.  It is a crime prevention programme intended to enlist the active co-operation of the community in a neighbourhood by getting them to observe and report suspicious activities, and by promoting the kind of anti-crime attitude and behaviour that should be found in a caring community.</P>
    <P>In neighbourhood watch a community accept a responsibility for the prevention of crime in their own area, and individual citizens accept this responsibility for themselves and for their neighbours.  In crime prevention the emphasis heretofore has been on the role of the garda alone.  He was seen as being there to prevent and detect crime and to maintain public peace and good order.  No structured role existed for members of the public to assist in this work.  Citizens frequently turned a blind eye to suspicious and criminal activity believing that such activity was not their responsibility but that of the Garda.  Neighbourhood watch creates a system in which the Garda and <Col N="598" /> the community establish a partnership the aim of which is to prevent crime and create a better environment in which to live.  It provides residents with constructive activities which have a positive effect on local crime levels, as well as being supportive of victims of crime.</P>
    <P>Other measures to get the Garda and the citizen into closer contact are being pursued by the formulation and implementation of a policy of community policing. In recent years there has been a growing recognition of the need to involve the community at large in crime prevention activities and specific policies are being developed to this end.  Measures are being taken to provide mechanisms whereby the community can play a more active role, in co-operation with the Garda, in crime prevention activities.</P>
    <P>As part of this policy the Garda authorities recently established a number of police clinics on an experimental basis in the Finglas and Tallaght areas of Dublin. These clinics involve the attendance of a garda, once or twice per week for about one and a half hours, at centres at a distance from Finglas and Tallaght stations. The members who operate the clinics are in radio contact with the local station and are available to discuss aspects of local policing, provide crime prevention advice and supply various forms such as motor tax, driving licence, etc.  While it is yet too soon to assess the effectiveness of the police clinic experiments, the early indications are that they merit further evaluation over a longer period.</P>
    <P>The extent to which drug abuse has furthered in the past and continues to fuel the commission of serious crime is well known.  The Garda have, I am glad to say, successfully got to grips with this problem in the last couple of years as evidenced by the quantities of illicit drugs which have been seized and in the numbers arrested and successfully prosecuted &mdash; some being the biggest pushers in the drug trade.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that, as a result, they have reason to believe that since 1983 illegal trafficking in drugs has levelled off and that the situation is now improving.  In <Col N="599" /> 1984, despite an intensification in Garda activity there was a decrease in the level of drug seizures and in the number of persons charged with drug offences which is further evidence of a drop in drug trafficking.  However, there will be no complacency and new tremds, particularly with regard to cocaine, will be carefully watched.</P>
    <P>It is understood from the Garda authorities that 68 per cent of drug seizures in 1983 were made by uniformed and detective personnel (other than Drugs Squad) and in 1984 seizures by this group constituted 70.4 per cent.  This is positive evidence of the success of the special course on drugs which is aimed at training and motivating members of the Garda Síochána generally to take a special interest in the problem of drug abuse and become actively involved in controlling it.</P>
    <P>This debate gives me the opportunity to confirm the Government's unremitting commitment to deal with the threat posed to the security of the State by the Provisional IRA, whether it be along the Border or elsewhere in this country.  Over the past 12 months or so we have seen a number of spectacular successes by the Garda and they are to be complimented on some outstanding police work.  I have in mind the seizure of the most sophisticated bomb-making equipment in Lusk, the seizure of the arms shipment aboard the <i>Marita Ann</i> and the capture of those who sought to bring its deadly cargo ashore and the successful investigation into the armed robbery at Drumree.  As the House knows, legislation enacted earlier this year, with the co-operation of all sides, enabled the Government to seize substantial funds held for the purpose of the IRA.  I wish to extend my appreciation and thanks also to the Defence Forces who assist the Garda in dealing with the activities of paramilitary groups.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of deep regret that, at a time of high unemployment when support and assistance is vital for young persons encountering difficulties in gaining employments, scarce resources have to be <Col N="600" /> allocated to such an unproductive area. From the mid-seventies the cost of the violence in the North has accounted for about one quarter of total expenditure on security.  However, the level of Garda commitment to preserve the security of the State is vital and it will be maintained. Nevertheless, one cannot but lament the fact that jobs could be created for school leavers but for the need to divert Government resources into measures necessary to tackle the destructive activities of those who believe in the bomb and the bullet as a means of exercising power.</P>
    <P>Before leaving the Garda Síochána I want to refer to the ongoing policy of identifying particular tasks that can be performed by non police civilians&mdash;such as, for example, traffic by-law enforcement, typing, filing and other secretarial, either through the Civil Service Commission or otherwise, people who are specially qualified and trained to do these jobs. This policy has proved very effective up to now and we have 433 civilians already working in the Garda Síochána in jobs formerly done by trained gardaí.  In addition there are now 125 traffic wardens.  There is scope for more of this and I intend to do what I can to see that the policy is continued and extended.</P>
    <P>So much for the Garda Síochána Vote; perhaps I may now turn to the Prisons Vote.  The 1985 Estimate for Prisons of £49,715,000 will have to be revised later this year to cater for additional expenditure arising from the unprecedented growth in the numbers in custody.  The level of that growth can be seen from the fact that at the beginning of this year there were 1,491 in custody whereas by the start of this week well over 1,900 offenders were being accommodated.</P>
    <P>That is an extraordinary increase for any prison system to cope with over such a short period and inevitably makes heavy demands on the system.  I am sure the House will join me in paying tribute to the efforts of the prison service in dealing with these demands.  The <Col N="601" /> increased numbers which can be held in custody have been made possible by maximising the use of existing custodial accommodation and by the acquisition of temporary additional accommodation such as Fort Mitchel on Spike Island and the education units at Cork and Arbour Hill prisons through the relocation of educational facilities at those institutions.</P>
    <P>There can be no doubt that the number of offenders being accommodated in some of our institutions is, in terms of prison administration, undesirably high. This, however, has to be balanced against the need to ensure that offenders serve to the greatest extent possible sentences imposed on them by the courts.  I think the message is at last getting across to people who indulge in criminal activity on a serious scale &mdash; particularly of the type which has given rise lately to great public concern &mdash; that there is prison accommodation to ensure that they will serve whatever sentences are imposed and that more will be made available if necessary.  I do not intend to do anything which would reduce that deterrent.</P>
    <P>However, we have to be realistic about the difficulties posed for the prison system by the high numbers in custody. While overcrowding in our prisons is mild compared to the level which has been resorted to in many other countries, it is inherently undesirable and I have been concerned to ease it as much as I can. This requires a flexible approach which has due regard to the capacity and nature of the various institutions and, at the same time, the need to ensure that sufficient accommodation is available to cope with offenders committed to custody for serious offences.</P>
    <P>As part of that approach I have decided to temporarily transfer prison staff to Fort Mitchel so that additional offenders can be sent there.  During the summer months particularly, I hope to use the accommodation at the Fort to alleviate pressure on the older institutions at a time when the burden of imprisonment with them can be all the greater.</P>
    <P>The system of home leave which I introduced in 1983 as an alternative to &ldquo;shedding&rdquo; will continue to be availed of <Col N="602" /> to an extent consistent with the nature of the scheme.  Under the scheme offenders serving sentences for relatively minor offences are allowed periods of home leave subject to certain conditions such as a requirement to report to the local Garda station.  The nature of offences where this scheme can operate is limited and leave is only granted after consultation with the Garda.  Should any evidence emerge that an offender is in any way abusing the scheme he is returned to custody.</P>
    <P>I am also prepared in certain circumstances to ease pressure on custodial accommodation by continuing to grant slightly more than the statutory remission to offenders who are of good behaviour in custody.  I believe that this can be justified on a number of grounds.  Sentencing is not so precise a science that a reduction of say two or three weeks in a sentence of six months could be said to defeat the purpose of the original sentence. Deputies will be aware from the representations which they receive that circumstances can change while an offender is serving his sentence which could justify some leniency.</P>
    <P>In regard to temporary releases &mdash; parole&mdash;generally&mdash;of which there has been some unjustified criticism in recent times &mdash; I should say that they form part of every civilised prison system throughout the world.  I would like to put on record that I will continue with our temporary release system in relation to proper programmes which are worked out for individual prisoners.</P>
    <P>It is the case that some of the forms of release which I have outlined might be used to a somewhat lesser extent if extra custodial accommodation was available. But I am satisfied that they represent a justifiable response to a difficult situation and take into account the reality of prison administration and the need to protect society.</P>
    <P>The use of the single officers' quarters in Portlaoise as custodial accommodation should add further flexibility to the prison system.  I have not finally decided the exact use which will be made of the accommodation.  I am thinking along the <Col N="603" /> lines of a unit which could be used for the treatment of alcoholic prisoners or perhaps a unit to hold low risk women prisoners.  This latter option has particular attractions because even with the work which is in hands to improve conditions in the women's prison in Mountjoy, it is very difficult to bring conditions there up to an appropriate standard.  In determining the use to which the quarters will be put I will, of course, have due regard to its location and the understandable concerns of local residents.</P>
    <P>In 1982 there was a daily average in custody of 1,236 whereas now the daily average is running at about 700 more than that.  It is against that background of the large increase in numbers which are now being coped with that I want to deal with the charge made by a number of Opposition spokesmen that the present accommodation difficulties would not have arisen had the prison capital programme put forward by the previous administration not been halted by this Government.  That charge is not true and if those who make it took time to consult with members of their own party who were directly involved in the capital programme they would quickly realise their mistake.</P>
    <P>Putting it simply, the earliest major additional accommodation which could be made available under the capital programme was the place of detention at Wheatfield.  That project has continued without interruption &mdash; indeed the bulk of the 1985 capital allocation of £12.13 million relates to it &mdash; but it will be 1987 before that accommodation is ready for occupation.  It will be clear, therefore, that even if the entire capital programme had proceeded as planned it would not have been able to provide immediate accommodation to deal with the numbers now being committed to custody.  In the circumstances I had no option but to provide additional accommodation in the manner which I have outlined.</P>
    <P>Prison construction is of its nature expensive and I will be dealing with the prison capital programme in a few moments.  I was always of the view that <Col N="604" /> this was an area of prison administration which could benefit from a thorough review of penal policy generally in this country.  Such a review is now being undertaken by a distinguished committee under the chairmanship of Dr. T. K. Whitaker and I understand the committee hope to present their report in a matter of months.  I am sure all Members of the House look forward to the outcome of the first major review of our penal system since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>The task of the committee is an enormous one.  There are no easy answers in an area so fundamental to the way in which we as a society organise ourselves. I hope that when the report is published it will lead to an informed debate which will encourage a wider appreciation of the difficult issues which arise in our penal system and an acceptance that sometimes the more immediately popular &ldquo;solutions&rdquo; may not necessarily be the more effective.  Among the issues which the committee are considering are alternatives to custody and the nature of the regimes which operate in the prisons.  I believe the Estimates reflect the consistent progress which has been made by successive administrations in these areas.</P>
    <P>One of the most significant developments in increasing the range of sanctions available to the courts has been the implementation of the community service scheme which I brought into operation last December.  Already the scheme is having considerable success and about 140 orders have been made so far.  A further 108 cases have been referred by the courts to the Probation and Welfare Service for assessment of the suitability of offenders for the scheme.  In relation to the orders which have already been made I should point out that these are cases where custodial sentences would have been imposed had the Community Service Scheme not been in operation.</P>
    <P>One of the main functions of the Probation and Welfare Service is to deal with offenders on probation and under other forms of supervision.  The service has expanded greatly over the last decade or so and there are now about 200 staff <Col N="605" /> assigned to it.</P>
    <P>In dealing with offenders in the community it is important that resources should be available which would benefit these offenders and encourage them to lead a useful life in the community.  For this reason my Department, through the Probation and Welfare Service, encourage the establishment by voluntary community groups in various parts of the country of hostels, day-centres and workshops to which offenders, especially young offenders, can be referred.  Several of these centres are already in operation and more are planned.  The provision for such centres is included in subhead G. of the Prisons Estimate and this year amounts to about £1.3 million which is more than double the level of expenditure three years ago.  Services to offenders in custody are being developed as much as possible, although the high numbers in custody can make this difficult.</P>
    <P>The provision for educational equipment and materials of £165,000 compares with a provision of £120,000 last year.  I should stress that this amount is only intended to cover equipment and materials and does not cover staff or capital costs.  These are met from expenditure by the vocational education committes who provide over 80 full-time teachers for the various institutions.  I would like if I did not see any more comment about only £165,000 being spent on education in the prisons when the figure simply refers to equipment and there are 80 full-time teachers paid out of the Education Vote and the capital expenditure for the facilities in the prisons comes out of the prisons capital expenditure Vote.</P>
    <P>In this connection I should mention that the decision to relocate the educational units at Arbour Hill and Cork should not be taken as indicating a lack of commitment to education within the prisons.  The decision was necessary to provide additional secure accommodation for offenders, but the educational facilities are being relocated in those institutions.  Although the new facilities are not as good, there should not be any <Col N="606" /> diminution in the actual level of educational services available to offenders.</P>
    <P>Increased provision has also been made for work-training in the institutions. Expenditure on equipment for this is provided for in subhead F. of the Prisons Vote, and this year's estimate of £396,000 compares with an estimate of £330,000 last year.</P>
    <P>I believe that the provisions which have been made in the estimates in the areas of alternatives to custody and services within the prisons reflect a conviction that people should be sent to prison only where it is clearly necessary in the interests of society to do so and that, in prison, services must be made available to offenders to encourage them to lead better lives when they return to society.</P>
    <P>As I have mentioned already, £12.13 million has been allocated to the capital programme for prisons and places of detention.  Considering the financial restrictions of the present time, I am sure that Deputies will acknowledge that an allocation of this dimension indicates a serious commitment to making progress towards rectifying the shortage of custodial accommodation.  Most significantly, the money made available is enabling work to continue at Weatfield.  Site works, services, perimetering and services buildings were completed earlier last year and work commenced in September on the custodial buildings of a place of detention for young male offenders between the ages of 16 and 21.</P>
    <P>The contract period is 36 months and it is expected that the project will be completed on target in 1987.  It is being constructed to a plan substantially expanded over what was first envisaged, with provision now for 320 places rather than the original 150.  Plans for the women's prison, to be located at Whatfield also, have been brought to the stage at which it is possible to invite tenders and place a contract when financial resources are available.  The site has already been developed, serviced and perimetered but the custodial buildings still remain to be built.</P>
    <P>A third project to provide 180 places on a site at Rathmore Road in Cork has <Col N="607" /> not yet reached tender stage and is at a standstill for the present but could also be resumed if resources were there.  Apart from these projects, new accommodation for education, work and recreation has been completed in Limerick and necessary security facilities have been provided there.  Major work on the repair of about one half of the perimeter wall of Mountjoy is almost completed and work on the other half is due to commence very shortly.</P>
    <P>I come now to the area of my Department's responsibilities relating to the courts.  Broadly outlined these responsibilities range from the preparation and promotion of any necessary legislation governing the establishment, constitution, jurisdictions, and functioning of our courts to ensuring that, as far as practicable, all courts and court offices are enabled to function effectively.</P>
    <P>I might make a preliminary point here. Courts are staffed in the general context of the civil service, and, as Deputies will be aware, there have been severe restrictions on recruitment to the public service since 1981.  Inevitably this has had serious effects on the working of the courts and court offices, particularly in view of increasing workloads.  Nevertheless we have made improvements on a number of fronts and I hope that further improvements will be possible despite the continuing difficulties.</P>
    <P>A matter of particular concern to me at present is the delays which in recent years have developed in relation to the hearing of High Court jury actions and criminal and civil business at a number of Circuit Court venues.  In an effort to improve the situation the Government have given their approval to the appointment of an additional judge of the High Court and an additional judge of the Circuit Court.  The Bill containing these proposals has been circulated.</P>
    <P>Statistics for the High Court for the 1984 legal year, i.e. the year ended 31 July, 1984, show some significant improvements in the state of High Court business.  The main features are:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="608" />  (a) an increase of 84 per cent in the number of jury actions disposed of during the year &mdash; 5,725 as compared with 3,107 in the previous year;</P>
    <P>(b) an increase of 26 per cent in the number of non-jury (common law) actions disposed of&mdash;633 as compared with 503 in the previous year;</P>
    <P>(c) a reduction from 20 months to 15 months in the average delay from the date of setting down to the date of hearing in the case of jury actions and from 13 months to three months in the case of non-jury actions. </P>
    <P>While these improvements can be attributed to several factors, I think it appropriate to pay tribute to the President of the High Court and to his predecessor, now the Chief Justice, for their special efforts, and also to the judges and court officers concerned whose co-operative approach in this matter has been very significant.</P>
    <P>In Cork the delay in hearing High Court jury actions has, in recent times, become somewhat more serious than elsewhere and as a result, the President of the High Court has doubled the number of sitting days in Cork in the current legal year, which commenced on 3 October last.  It is my earnest hope that the extra sitting days will reduce the arrears to a more acceptable level.  While there are some delays in hearing cases at other major centres at which High Court jury actions are held, they are not as serious as the delays in Dublin and in Cork.</P>
    <P>The courts computer system, which has been issuing summonses and court lists for Dublin city and county, has been extended to prepare appeal papers.  This has led to a substantial saving in time for court staff and has helped reduce the delay between District Court convictions and the Appeal Court hearing.</P>
    <P>As regards the operation of the courts, one of the greatest problems continues to be accommodation.  Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of court accommodation, with certain exceptions in the Dublin area, is vested by law in local authorities.  This has given rise to particular problems in a number of areas, <Col N="609" /> and most Deputies will be familiar with problems of this kind in their own areas. However, there have been improvements in a number of cases.  The reinstatement of Waterford courthouse was completed in autumn 1982 and the new courthouse provided by Wicklow County Council in Bray became available in September last.</P>
    <P>Work on the restoration of the fire-damaged courthouse at Monaghan started early in March and is expected to be completed within 18 months.  Planning for the reconstruction of Cavan courthouse is at an advanced stage and it is expected that work on the project will start before the autumn.  Other local authorities are dealing with less extensive works on an ongoing basis but, naturally, progress in this area is affected by the current financial situation.</P>
    <P>In Dublin, work has started on the development of the Four Courts Hotel site as an office block to accommodate the various court offices at present housed in the Four Courts building, thus freeing further areas there for development as additional courtrooms and ancillary accommodation.  The office block project should be completed within three years and conversion of the office space in the Four Courts will be put in hands as soon as possible after that.</P>
    <P>The situation of the Children's Court in Dublin is a matter of some concern. The accommodation available to the court has been unsatisfactory for some years now and the position deteriorated in November, 1981 when the Dublin Castle premises were declared unsafe. The court is at present accommodated on a temporary basis in the Morgan Place wing of the Four Courts, but this is proving unsatisfactory for a number of reasons.  The Office of Public Works are now in the process of adapting two houses at Smithfield to provide temporary accommodation for the court pending the provision of a purpose-built courthouse on an immediately adjoining site. I expect the temporary accommodation to be ready for use within a month and the purpose-built accommodation to be available by the end of next year.</P>
    <P>Deputies will be aware that the money <Col N="610" /> necessary to build the permanent Children's Court is being provided from the dormant funds of suitors in the High Court under the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984.  The new Children's Court complex will provide generous waiting and consultation facilities, conference rooms and duty rooms for probation and welfare officers.  This will ensure that all who are concerned with the welfare of children appearing before the Courts will be adequately facilitated.  The plans include two courtrooms and judges' rooms, a retiring room for solicitors, and separate waiting areas for gardaí, witnesses and members of the public.</P>
    <P>The 1985 provision for civil legal aid is £1,462,000.  Although this allocation will not, of itself, allow for any expansion of the board's services, I am glad to say that, as I announced in the Dáil on 29 May 1985, the board will be able to expand its services this year due to funds available under the provisions of the Funds of Suitors Act, 1984 that will enable it to open new law centres in Tallaght and Athlone and a second centre in Cork. These centres will be financed until the end of 1987 from the monies available for civil legal aid under the Act.  The residue of funds available under the Act will be used to open further law centres during 1986-1987 at Dundalk, Portlaoise, Castlebar and Letterkenny.</P>
    <P>The 1985 provision for criminal legal aid is £2 million which represents an increase of £150,000 on the 1984 allocation of £1.85 million.  This is due mainly to a likely increase in the amount of legal aid granted by the courts in 1985 compared with last year.  The Supreme Court ruling that accused persons have a constitutional right to legal aid in certain circumstances should be borne in mind in this context.  I might add that included in the £2 million allocation for 1985 is the cost of paying value added tax, currently at 23 per cent on legal fees payable under the scheme and this is ultimately recouped to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>As regards law reform, it is not within the rules of this House for a Deputy to advocate legislation in the course of an Estimates debate.  Accordingly, all I <Col N="611" /> propose to say on this subject is that my main concern is to implement the Government's programme of law reform in my area of responsibility as quickly as possible.  With this in mind, I will be bringing legislative proposals before the House in the usual way, as soon as I am in a position to announce them.</P>
    <P>The Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds is another area for which I have responsibility.</P>
    <P>The work load in the Land Registry is continuing to be high with an average annual intake of approximately 218,000 applications during the eighties.  About 120,000 of these, or 55 per cent are applications for land certificates, copies of folios and instruments and copy maps.  In general, the Registry is providing a good service where applications in these categories are concerned, with average delays being maintained at a level of eight working days or less.  There can, however, be significant differences in the time it takes to supply a copy document, in particular, a copy map.  The main reason is that in about 50 per cent of cases the provisions of a copy of a registry map involves substantial preliminary work that includes the reconstruction of an existing map &mdash;which, apart from being on an old sixinch scale can at times be in very poor condition.  The reconstruction is usually to the latest 25 inch ordnance survey scale.</P>
    <P>The other main categories of work are applications for first registration, including the establishment of title acquired by possession, applications for registration in respect of land already registered and applications under the ground rents purchase scheme.  There are long delays in finalising applications in these areas because of the complex nature of the work involved and because of the large volume of applications in relation to the number of staff available to deal with them.  Like the rest of the civil service, the Land Registry is subject to the embargo on the filling of vacancies.  Prior to the embargo its authorised staffing was 541.  At the end of May, 1985, the authorised staffing had been reduced by 78, or <Col N="612" /> 14.4 per cent, to 463.  The overall volume of work in 1985 shows a 4 per cent increase over that for 1980, the year by reference to which the authorised staffing of 541 was settled.  Despite the increasing workload and the decreasing number of staff every effort is made to finalise applications as quickly as possible.</P>
    <P>Proposals for major improvements in both the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds are at present in abeyance because of the embargo.  These include a reorganisation of the processing of applications under section 49 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, the extension of compulsory registration, the amalgamation of the staffing structures of the Land Registry and Registry of Deeds and the computerisation of some of the records of the Registry of Deeds.  However, within the existing constraints, other measures are at present under consideration, particularly the extent to which modern technology can be used in making the registries more efficient.</P>
    <P>The computerisation of the Land Registry folios which commenced in December 1982 is proceeding.  All the Dublin folios will be computerised by the end of this month.  This means that about 20 per cent of the applications lodged for registration annually are now being processed by computer, although the number of Dublin folios represents only about 10 per cent of the total for the State as a whole.  This is a major step forward for the registry and has already resulted in considerably increased efficiency.  For example, the pre-computerised system is based on one original folio per registered property; post-computerisation, an unlimited number of copies is available within a matter of seconds, resulting in immediate service for people calling to public counters.</P>
    <P>The extension of the computerisation programme to other areas is at present under consideration.  The future role of the local registries which are attached to the 25 Circuit Court offices in the counties other than Dublin will have to be taken into account in this context and other preliminary arrangements, including the purchase of additional equipment, <Col N="613" /> have also to be completed before the programme can be extended.</P>
    <P>A source of much public complaint in recent years has been the telephone system serving the Chancery Street building of the Land Registry.  I am happy to say that a modern PABX system will be provided later this year to serve the three Land Registry offices in Chancery Street, the Setanta Centre and Bow Street.</P>
    <P>Votes 23 to 28 cover a large and varied volume of work and services. Accordingly, my remarks were not intended to be an exhaustive description of everything coming within the ambit of the Votes.  As I said at the start of my remarks, however, I welcome Deputies to speak on any aspect of the Votes and I shall endeavour to reply to any points raised.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Estimate for the Department of Justice affords the House an opportunity to debate the operations of a Department which, in recent years, has been of increasing interest and concern to the people.  The very sizeable Estimate, £350 million, and the areas of activity related to it is an indication of its relevance and importance in the lives of the people.  One of the harsh realities of our time is the increasing amount of the annual budget which has to be allocated to the maintenance of law and order. This is a phenomenon common to most countries, and it would be unrealistic to expect that Ireland would remain forever immune to the happenings in neighbouring countries.  If anything, we did not wake up in time and learn from the experience of our neighbours in mainland Europe particularly with regard to escalating crime.</P>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister one can only conclude that his speech is a further chapter in the public relations exercise which has been synonymous with the performance of the Government over the past two and a half years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>One can understand the political motivation of a Minister in endeavouring to justify his performance and the performance of his Department. The Minister made a very bold attempt to do this just now.  I do not say this with any level of vindictiveness, but it is dishonest to attempt to suggest that this very crucial area of national administration is at anything other than a crisis at present and has been for a considerable time.  The Minister knows that what I am saying is true.  Never in the history of the State has law and order been at such a low level and low ebb as it is at present, regardless of the statistics.  The Minister's speech was an encyclopaedia of statistics; but, nevertheless, ordinary citizens collectively say that law and order is and has been at a very low level.  There has never been such a level of fear and insecurity, especially in relation to old people residing alone in urban and rural areas.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister will agree that there is a crisis in our prisons and the Garda are more exposed than ever before to the dangers of maintaining law and order in a society, part of which is rebelling against and resisting traditional values and codes of behaviour.  I claim that this is a by-product of the Government's failure to deal with the growing level of social and economic problems facing us at present.  There is no doubt that there is a direct link between the level of crime, violence and lawlessness and the level of economic and social development.</P>
      <P>I should like to ask the Minister, nonetheless, if the Estimate and his statement have credibility.  Are we wasting time in discussing it when we know that the House debated and approved an Estimate for prisons of £11.5 million in 1984 and we now know that the eventual outturn was an expenditure of £5.5 million? I do not know the relevance of this debate in terms of Government expenditure except, perhaps, that it gives us the opportunity of commenting on this very wide area and I am glad that the Minister stated he would welcome objective comments from Members of the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The rapidity of the growth in violence <Col N="615" /> and lawlessness is surprising and frightening. It is particularly vicious in that the old and the young are so often the victims.  It means that the State is compelled to spend an increasing amount of its gross national product in financing the various State agencies involved in the maintenance of law and order.  One can readily appreciate the futility of having to spend scarce national resources needed for more productive work on this aspect of Government administration.  On the other hand, we must balance that cost against the inevitable threat to lives and damage to property if we did not make adequate provision in this regard.</P>
    <P>Crime will never be completely eliminated. We have, however, a duty as legislators to create a society in which crime will be reduced to the minimum.  I said that there is a direct link between the level of crime and economic and social conditions.  There is also a link between the psychological attitude which generates violence and the level of confidence or degree of security felt by the people at any given time.  Taking these two factors into account, it is easy to understand why the country is now in the grip of a wave of crime which will be difficult to control.</P>
    <P>I welcome the recent statistics which seem to indicate that crime is on the decrease.  I read the reports, the trends are heartening and encouraging, and I hope that they continue.  To whatever extent we can, we will support the Government and the Minister in relation to bringing about a further lessening of crime.  When I referred to the social and economic conditions and the link between them and crime and violence, I naturally had in mind the very high level of unemployment.  There can be no doubt that there is a direct and positive link between the high, unsatisfactory level of unemployment and the increase over the past three years in the level of crime, particularly in so far as it relates to young people.  Any sensible Member who analyses the situation will understand the frustrations of young, highly qualified people leaving schools and colleges to find that they have no hope of getting <Col N="616" /> jobs.  Until such time as we can deal effectively with the root cause of the problem, we will not make the level of progress which we would all like to see.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government should seriously consider the report prepared by Dr. Brendan Walsh in this morning's newspapers on the level of alcoholism in this country.  It confirms the widely held view that there is a growing need to control and restrict the level of alcohol consumption here.  The abuse of alcohol may not be the cause of many of our economic ills but it has certainly been the root cause of many of our social ills, particularly in recent years.  I plead with the Minister of State to use her influence to encourage the Government to abandon, in the national interest, the proposed liberalisation of our licensing laws. Dr. Walsh's report is timely, especially in view of the fact that we are debating the Estimate for the Department of Justice today.  All reports issued in recent years in regard to absenteeism, admission to psychiatric hospitals, drug addiction and family problems and disputes point to the fact that many of the problems arise as a result of alcoholism.  It is grossly irresponsible of the Government to even contemplate introducing legislation to make alcohol more freely available to young people.</P>
    <P>I would regard it as a great achievement, even if it was the only success I recorded while acting as spokesman on justice for any party, if I got the message across to the Government that the liberalising of the licensing laws is a retrograde and dangerous step which they will regret.  Members on all sides, from our involvement with families and attendance at so many social functions, must agree that the abuse of alcohol is a national evil which should be controlled. I was disappointed to hear that the Government are thinking of introducing legislation to make alcohol more freely available.</P>
    <P>In the course of his speech the Minister dealt at length with the problem of drug addiction, but it should be remembered that there is a very close link between the sale of alcohol to young people and the <Col N="617" /> opportunity that environment presents for drug pushers to peddle their illicit wares.  I am sure fathers and mothers will be pleading with public representatives to ask the Government to abandon their ludicrous proposal to liberalise the licensing laws.  I understand that the changes are being introduced under the guise of aiding the tourist industry, but I have not heard one tourist complaining that he or she could not get a glass of &ldquo;Paddy&rdquo; or vodka.  I do not think it is right or logical to introduce such changes under that heading.</P>
    <P>The problem here is compounded by the fact that we have the youngest population in Europe.  Our young people are more energetic, better educated and aspire to greater heights and expectations than any previous generation, but we must respond in a more meaningful and positive way in regard to the creation of a social and economic environment that will permit them to contribute to the development of the country.  To some extent we are doing things in reverse.  We are being forced to spend large sums of public money as a response to the break down in law and order.  Crime could have been curtailed if there was proper investment in the economy.  Demands on the State, especially in regard to social welfare schemes which are important at a time of high unemployment, could have been reduced.  I cannot see any trend in economic planning that will get us away from the policy of responding to social change rather than putting forward credible economic plans.  That must be one of the greatest challenges facing the Government.  They must try to reverse the trend and generate economic activity so that young and old can feel they have a useful role to play in society and are not, as they are at present, compelled to drift into the undesirable area of crime.</P>
    <P>I would like to see the Government or the political parties collectively putting their heads together and introducing a long term plan.  One of the things that have bedevilled the country is the rapidity with which economic policies change. The Government in power may introduce policies but within a few years there is a <Col N="618" /> change of Government and a change of plan.  From the point of view of providing more jobs that is not good.  To some extent that represents a theoretical assumption, a little like the old story of which comes first, the chicken or the egg, but my economic philosophy in this argument is correct and worthy of consideration by all Members.</P>
    <P>Due to the nature of the functions and operations of the Department one feels an urge to co-operate with the Minister in achieving the common goal of creating a peaceful and law abiding society.  It would be my natural inclination to go as far as I possibly could along the road towards providing support for the Minister in this very sensitive area.  I hold the view that one should resist trying to make political capital from this very important subject; nevertheless, different parties have different emphasis and priorities in the area of law and order and it is inevitable that I will have to be critical of some aspects of this Government's performance.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil fully subscribe to the goal of creating a society where everybody lives in a peaceful environment and where lives are not put at risk, but we do not always agree with the way this objective is achieved.  I said earlier that crime is a direct product of our economic environment.  It is a reflection on the House that the Minister finds it necessary to state that one of his greatest achievements over the past two and a half years has been the fact that we now have the biggest number of prisoners in the history of the State behind bars.  That is a sad statistic about which we should not have any sense of pleasure, because it is a reflection on how we have ordered the economic affairs of our country in recent years.  It is also a reflection on the House that I find it necessary today to be critical of the Minister's failure to make more prison accommodation available.  It is ironic and a reflection on society that the Minister and I have to dwell on these types of statistics.</P>
    <P>Whichever side of the argument we look at, the fact remains that we are presiding over a society where violence <Col N="619" /> and crime are rampant and a growing number of people feel unsafe and insecure. The statistics on crime present a depressing figure in terms of insecurity and cost to the nation &mdash; there is an average of 102,000 serious crimes committed here each year; the number of violent crimes, such as armed robberies, has doubled since 1980 and the value of property damaged or stolen is approximately £43 million a year.  There can be no doubt that the situation is serious and calls for drastic measures.  We have now reached, and in some instances exceeded, the European crime average, regardless of what the Minister may say.  I acknowledge that the most recent figures seem to indicate a downward trend, but this is due in no small measure to the dedication and commitment of the Garda Síochána. They have done tremendous work in a very difficult climate to bring some kind of sanity back into the area of law and order.</P>
    <P>It is right to acknowledge that the Minister increased the manning levels in the Garda in recent years, but I have to remind him that that was part of a trend which was taking place when Fianna Fáil left office.  The major commitment to increase the level of the Garda was made by a Fianna Fáil Minister for Justice and, I like to be fair, was continued by the present Minister.  Such measures are essential in the short term, but I put it to the Minister that they are reactionary measures and do not tackle the root cause of the problems.  The Minister and the Department have to cope with a problem which is directly linked with the failure of his Cabinet colleagues to generate a level of economic activity which would, through job creation, eliminate or reduce the need for people resorting to crime.  I am sorry if I am repeating myself in this area, but I am totally convinced that the root cause of the problem is whether we will be able to change the present economic environment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>While I do not condone <Col N="620" /> crime in any shape or form, I find it easy to understand how in many instances it can happen.  I also acknowledge the sad fact that this is happening to families with no tradition of crime, where decent hard working fathers and mothers have reared and educated their families but now find their children cannot even find employment. The position has been worsened by the unwillingness of the Government to take timely action to deal with the problem.  I emphasise the work &ldquo;timely&rdquo; because over the past 12 months in particular we have seen the most glaring examples of reactionary politics and policies in relation to security matters.  The Minister seems to be responding all the time to some crisis, to some serious breakdown in law and order.  When a Minister, particularly a Minister for Justice, finds himself in such an insecure position, that is having to react without having made adequate preparations, that is a very dangerous situation.</P>
      <P>One of the essential ingredients for success in the Department of Justice is the generation of an atmosphere of confidence, and over the past 12 months that confidence has been shaken in many areas, particularly in the case of older people and those residing alone.  I honestly believe the sense of insecurity prevalent in the country emanates from the Department of Justice because people fear we will not be able to cope with the threat to life and limb.  Over the past couple of days we read in our newspapers a further report which highlights that level of insecurity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Between now and next winter, which is obviously the most vulnerable time, I ask the Minister to ensure that his Department take every possible action to provide for the security of old people, particularly those residing in rural areas.  Our security problem is further exacerbated by the division of our country.  The Minister dwelt at some length on that aspect. The maintaining of Border security is a growing and intolerable problem which no country of our size should have to endure for so long at such great cost. Apart from the great physical strain on <Col N="621" /> our gardaí, army and customs officials, the continuing existence of that unnatural boundary is creating an environment in which lawlessness flourishes, and tragically the cost is far too often the loss of life or serious injury, not to mention the loss and destruction of property.</P>
    <P>I should like here to pay tribute to the courage of our Garda and Army and to sympathise with the families of those who died in the call of duty.  We sadly and tragically recall the number of instances in recent years in which members of the Garda Síochána lost their lives in defence of our rights and freedom.  The cost of maintaining Border security, essential though it be, must surely be the greatest waste of scarce financial resources for a country of our size anywhere in the world.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Minister did nothing and said nothing to restore confidence and reassure the old that the environment in 1985 will be safer than it has been over the past 12 months.  I welcomed the press conference of yesterday which endorsed the extension of the neighbourhood watch scheme.  I have watched with interest the operation of that scheme, and it deserves further expansion.  It has an important and useful role to play in our society.  However, it is not substitute for community policing and should not be so used.  It should be used simply as a complementary measure supporting the gardaí in their efforts to maintain law and order.  It would be totally wrong to allow a situation to develop where we would depend more and more on systems such as the neighbourhood watch.  I appeal to the Minister of State who is present to use her influence within her Department for the purpose of emphasising the importance of the Garda Síochána, in the first instance, as being the front line of defence in relation to security matters, supported and complemented by the neighbourhood watch scheme.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence that the level of crime will be drastically reduced in the immediate years ahead.  Therefore, the public are entitled to and are demanding positive and tough action in dealing with the hardened and organised criminals in <Col N="622" /> their war against society &mdash; a war which in certain areas will be extremely difficult to control.  We have the sad and tragic evidence of that war day after day, particularly in Dublin and in the larger urban areas.  The gardaí there are put under serious pressure and threat, having to abandon their patrol cars because of the level of violence with which they are confronted. That is a very undesirable and dangerous situation.  We will have to give full and maximum support to the Garda in stamping out, once and for all, that type of violence.</P>
    <P>I hope that we will never have, as some would suggest we have at present, no-go areas for our gardaí in Dublin city.  For whatever support and strength are needed by the Garda to deal with that kind of opposition within society, the Minister has the full backing and support of this House.  To think that any organised group of people in this city or any other would feel that they could take unto themselves the right to control an area is something which this House could not, should not and I hope never will tolerate.</P>
    <P>The people are demanding that those convicted in our courts, particularly of serious charges, should be made to serve their prison sentences.  This House had long and tedious discussion on the Criminal Justice Bill which strengthened the legislative base for law enforcement as far as the Garda are concerned.  That Bill is positive and balanced legislation in a very difficult area of national administration. However, it is a matter of disappointment to me and the Members on this side of the House that the supporting legislation on the complaints procedure has not yet come before the House.  I appeal to the Minister to ensure that there is no further delay in regard to that desirable and essential legislation.  Its absence is inhibiting and preventing the implementation of the Criminal Justice Bill, which is so badly needed at present. The Minister indicated today that it is his intention to bring that legislation before the House at an early opportunity.  I have asked a number of parliamentary questions in that regard over a number of months and the reply always seems to be <Col N="623" /> that the legislation will be brought in at an early date.  The Minister should be in a position to tell the House in his concluding comments on this debate when exactly he proposes to bring in that very important measure, to enable the House to debate it and have it passed as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the availability of the Criminal Justice Act will strengthen the hands of the Garda in the difficult areas where existing legislation prevented them from taking positive and effective action.  I should like to pay tribute from this side of the House to the members of the Garda Síochána.  They continue to uphold the dignity and esteem which have been synonymous with the force since its inception.  Their task is becoming more difficult.  They have the backing, goodwill and respect of the vast majority of our citizens in their work.  They should not be discouraged by the isolated incidents within the force which tend to embarrass its members from time to time.  The Criminal Justice Act will support them in their efforts to combat crime.</P>
    <P>We must give them the support of the many technological aids available to their counterparts throughout the world and which are, regrettably, also available to the organised criminal underworld of today.  Above all, we must provide the highest level of training for our young Garda recruits and ensure that the initial training is followed by updated and advanced in-force training.  I am glad that the Minister indicated to the House that it is his intention to proceed along those lines.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department have not responded with sufficient speed to the changing needs of the Garda force.  In many cases the lives of the gardaí have been placed at unnecessary risk by our failure to provide simple requirements such as bullet-proof vests, spiked chains to deal with car thefts and joyriders, and suitably equipped vehicles to counter the huge and serious problem of car ramming. I hope that the level of financial provision sought by the Minister will <Col N="624" /> make it possible to equip the Garda in a way that will help them in their duties.</P>
    <P>The House should recognise the dedicated and effective work of the Garda drugs squad.  The Minister should be guided by their expertise and experience and he should make available to them all the resources needed to help them in their very difficult work.  I spoke in the past of the seriousness of the drug problem. It is an area of crime that poses the greatest social threat to our young generation.  I dealt at length with the subject in a recent Dáil debate and it is not necessary for me to deal with it in the debate today.</P>
    <P>I want the Minister to assure the House that people convicted of serious drug offences will have to serve their full sentences. Many people have very strong views on that area of law enforcement.  It is no secret that this has not been the case.  The Garda have been frustrated in their efforts to combat this crime.  Frequently they seen offenders getting away with small sentences or having sentences remitted after serving only a short term in prison.  That is a very undesirable situation. Information available to me suggests that a person apprehended by the Garda in recent times on a very serious and substantial drug charge had been released from prison on a similar drug-related offence after serving only 13 months of a two year sentence.  This is very serious.  It does not give me pleasure to have to refer to this in the debate.  I expect the Minister to give a categoric assurance to the House that where people are committed to prison as a result of a court hearing connected with serious drug offence they will not be allowed back on the streets until they have served their maximum sentences, subject to the normal remissions which we must accept as part of the criminal justice code.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to tell the House if orders for early release from prison always originate from a recommendation of the prison governor or officials of his Department who are qualified to assess each case.  I ask him if there is a departure, as has been suggested, from the long-established procedure where the <Col N="625" /> district justice who imposed the sentence in the first case was consulted on and advised of the release of prisoners.  It is important that the public be reassured in relation to matters of this kind.  I was pleased to hear the Minister assure the House last night that neither he nor his Department were involved in the early release of a prisoner from Limerick prison who was there on a serious car theft charge.  The Garda Síochána should not be made the scapegoat in cases that attract considerable publicity, as happened in this case.  Nonetheless, it was reassuring to me at Question Time yesterday to hear the Minister in a position to state there was no interference in any way by him or his Department in relation to this incident.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly with the courts.  The matter was referred to by the Minister and the subject was covered by me in some detail when we were discussing the recent Courts Bill.  Again, I wish to stress my disappointment that the Minister did not avail of the opportunity at that time to update and reorganise the entire District Court system which he could have done effectively under the terms of the Bill.  The new District Court rules are to be welcomed but they will not be fully effective in the absence of court reform.  The lack of uniformity in court sentences in many cases leaves much to be desired and leads to considerable frustration on the part of the Garda Síochána who put much effort into apprehending criminals only to see them back on the streets within a relatively short time.  As I said in my contribution on the Courts Bill, our courts are irrelevant to the vast majority of people who are confused by the legalistic jargon that surrounds our court operations.  The Minister should do something to control the level of representation required by a citizen to secure justice in our higher courts because in many cases the cost is prohibitive.  I was glad to hear the Minister make a general reference to this matter but that is not sufficient.  It requires positive and strong action by his Department.</P>
    <P>While I realise that urban areas present <Col N="626" /> a serious and demanding security problem for the Garda and the Minister, it has been tragically demonstrated in the past year that the concentration of Garda activity in urban areas has led to the retreat of the criminal to the relatively safer environs of rural Ireland.  I never thought I would see the day that an old woman would be pushed into the fire and then forced to flee from her home when it was set on fire.  This change in the crime pattern must compel the Minister to rethink the situation in relation to rural policing.</P>
    <P>At Question Time yesterday the Minister indicated that there were no closures of Garda stations.  While that is correct statistically, the reality is that the manpower has been reduced.  Gardaí have been taken out of rural stations and that is the same, if not worse, than actually physically and structurally closing down the stations.  A strong case can be made for the restaffing of rural Garda stations from which personnel have been removed in recent years.  I ask the Minister to put more gardaí into rural stations.</P>
    <P>In any debate on law and order one has to deal with the adequacy and conditions in our prisons.  A system which has not the capacity to deal fully and effectively with offenders committed to prison by the courts totally undermines the entire efforts in the area of law enforcement. The Government decision to abandon the phased prison programme introduced by Fianna Fáil was one of the most dangerous and irresponsible decisions taken by the Government.  It has contributed in a major way to the present serious crime situation.</P>
    <P>Last week in another debate I put some figures to the Minister in relation to estimates in the past couple of years.  I stand over those figures and the information I made available then.</P>
    <P>The present level of overcrowding in our prison will lead inevitably to more trouble and will render both dangerous and difficult the task of prison officers.  I sympathise with the Minister in his dilemma.  I welcome his efforts in regard to the utilisation of Spike Island as a prison.  I supported him fully in that deci <Col N="627" /> sion.  While it was a reactionary decision, the Government should have made provision to make the prison habitable and secure following the decision to abandon the new prison development programme. It is difficult to make any sense of the Minister's panic reaction in opening Spike Island without any financial provision in that respect having been made in advance.  The decision to abandon the new prison programme was taken two and a half years ago.</P>
    <P>If the Minister were serious about providing adequate accommodation for prisoners he would at that time have made at least tentative arrangements for providing security at the Spike Island detention centre.  Instead he took no action of that kind but apparently lived in the hope that the problem would disappear. Eventually, however, he discovered that was not to be the case and consequently Spike Island was put into use as a detention centre.  I accuse the Government of turning a blind eye to the problem of prison accommodation, because we would not have this problem if the necessary action had been taken in time.</P>
    <P>The latest decision by the Minister to transfer prisoners to the new officers' quarters at Portlaoise is both dangerous and unacceptable so far as the local residents are concerned.  However, I welcome the Minister's assurance that he will have consultations before deciding to transfer prisoners to Portlaoise and that he will keep in mind the needs of the local residents.  The proposed location is outside the existing prison complex.  It is in a residential area of the town.  The Minister abandoned the proposal to locate a similar prison in Dublin and I cannot see any reason for his deciding to transfer the problem to Portlaoise.  I appeal to him to be considerate in regard to any such decision.  I understand that more suitable accommodation has been recommended to him.</P>
    <P>Finally I appeal to the Minister to renew normal relations with the Prison Officers Association.  This is not a time for scoring moral victories over a sector of our security system who do an <Col N="628" /> extremely difficult job on behalf of the nation.</P>
    <P>I am glad to have the opportunity of contributing to this debate, and I hope that I have highlighted at least some of those areas that are of relevance and which need urgent attention.  I am confident that other speakers to the debate will have objective and constructive comments to make, also.</P>

      <P>In my short contribution I should like to concentrate on the provision of finance for the pilot scheme on conciliation which comes within subhead H of the Vote for the Minister's Office.</P>
      <P>The background to the setting up of this scheme, which is to consider the provision of concialiation services for people whose marriages have broken down, is that for some time past groups and individuals involved in family law have been pressing for a scheme of conciliation which would be based on the type of schemes existing in Britain and other countries.  I am very interested in the whole idea of a conciliation service.  It is an area I have been working towards since my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Justice.  In 1983 I organised a seminar in Dublin for the purpose of giving to those interested an opportunity to hear details of what is happening in England and to make their own contribution.  That seminar was very successful.  The papers submitted on that occasion were published.</P>
      <P>In addition, in 1983 also I asked the Legal Aid Board to prepare a report on the need for such a conciliation scheme and on what their perception of the scheme would be.  This report was prepared and involved, I understand, a great deal of time and trouble on the part of the board.  It is a comprehensive report but it has not been published.  It is a very good basic working document.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Regardless of how good seminars and reports may be, they are not a substitute for action.  I am very happy that the Minister for Justice and the Government <Col N="629" /> have agreed to my request for the provision in this year's Estimate for funding a pilot scheme.  This means that we will now have action, and this will be in the form of a limited three year scheme.  This will give us the opportunity of examining how such a service would operate in Ireland and how people might be expected to relate to it.  The announcement in this regard was made in February, but there seems to have been some confusion.  Not as much publicity as might have been expected was given to the project, but the response has been very encouraging in that the social agencies involved with family groups in the matter of marital breakdown have been very positive in their response.  Similarily, I have had a number of phone calls from people anxious to know whether the project is in existence and if so how they could contact the group.  These people have told me that they believe this sort of service to be just what they need.</P>
    <P>It was agreed first that a steering committee be set up to decide on the framework for the service, the training of conciliators, the acquisition of premises and other necessary features.  I am very happy that the committee are comprised of a very talented and caring group of people whose names I should like to put on the record.  They are Mr. James O'Higgins who is a solicitor and involved in family law cases and who was originally a member of FLAC, Ms. Maura Wall Murphy, who is a social worker and involved at present in family conciliation work; Ms. Mary Mulcahy, who is chairperson of AIM Group for Family Law Reform; Dr. Gabriel Kiely, who is a lecturer in social work and director of the family studies unit at UCD: Mr. Eric Plunkett, who is secretary of the north west branch of the Irish Association of Social Workers and who is a probation and welfare officer; Miss Joan Carr, a former director of The Samaritans currently involved in counselling on alcoholism in St. Patrick's Psychiatric Hospital, Dublin; Miss Joan O'Mahony, a member of the Legal Aid Board; Mr. John Smith, who is in the Department of Finance; and Mr. Chris Morris, who is a probation and <Col N="630" /> welfare officer.  They are working as a voluntary group.</P>
    <P>The calibre of these people indicates the recognition of the need for this service. I am very happy that one of the stronger recommendations of the Committee on Marriage Breakdown was that such a scheme be established.  I know it had a different name &mdash; the term used was &ldquo;mediation&rdquo;&mdash; but it constitutes the same kind of service.  I might put on the record the meaning of conciliation and what it is hoped to do.  There is no settled definition really of what conciliation is but it is aimed at helping couples to resolve disputes which arise following the breakdown of marriage without recourse to legal proceedings, or with as little recourse to such proceedings as possible. It ought not be confused, as sometimes it is, with reconciliation, which is an entirely different concept.  Conciliation is also seen as something distinct from marriage counselling which is aimed primarily at the prevention of marriage breakdown and the reconciliation of the parties.  By comparison the established breakdown of marriage is taken as a starting point in the process of conciliation.</P>
    <P>The overall purpose of conciliation is to minimise the harmful effects of marriage breakdown on couples and their children.  A couple availing of a conciliation service could expect to have a number of sessions with a trained conciliator whose job it is to get them to come together and to explain clearly the practical matters that need to be agreed upon following the breakdown of the marriage. The couple will be encouraged to take control of their affairs, to work out their own solutions on matters such as custody, access to children, financial provisions and disposition of the matrimonial home. In particular parents are helped to maintain their parental role despite the ending of the marriage.  The reality is that while husband and wife would be very hostile to each other and may have had a relationship that had been going wrong for a long time and which eventually splintered, their relationship with their children is something that must be maintained <Col N="631" /> in the best interest of all concerned.</P>
    <P>Parties whose marriages have broken down very often tend to look towards the law and legal provisions for solutions to their problems in the first instance.  The adversarial courts system can set a couple at loggerheads from an early stage and does not always produce satisfactory results.  Litigation can also be a very costly process.  Clearly there is need for an alternative approach and a conciliation service provides such an alternative.</P>
    <P>The details of the pilot scheme will be worked out by the steering committee in ensuing months.  It is hoped to have the conciliation service operating on an experimental basis later this year, I hope, not later than October.  At this stage it can be said that the service will operate out of court, which is very distinct from operating through the courts procedure where a district justice might recommend that conciliation should take place.  This will be totally voluntary and out of court. The service will not be means-tested.  It is envisaged that clients most likely to benefit from conciliation will be referred to the service by solicitors, doctors, clergy, Legal Aid Board law centres, marriage counsellors, family assessment or counselling service.  I should emphasise that this is the first Governmentfunded out of court conciliation scheme to be set up in these islands.  I am positively hopeful of the outcome of the deliberations of the steering committee and shall be very happy to announce the opening of this first service some time before the end of the year.</P>

      <P>I am pleased to have an opportunity of saying a few words on the introduction of this Estimate by the Minister for Justice.  There is not doubt that Justice is one of the most important Government Departments at present particularly in view of the very heavy increase in crime that has taken place over the years.  I hope my contribution will be regarded as constructive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I represent the constituency of Dublin <Col N="632" /> South-West which includes the whole area of Tallaght and part of Clondalkin, an area in which crime, housebreaking and the general breakdown of law and order has been very much on the increase over the years.  I want to say to the Minister of State present that that is not meant in any criticism of the Garda responsible for the operations in that area.  Indeed I should like to avail of this opportunity to compliment the Garda in Tallaght for their wonderful work despite their inadequate accommodation and facilities.</P>
    <P>I might compliment the Minister on his detailed approach to this Estimate. However, I was very disappointed that there was no mention of the proposed new Garda station in Tallaght about which there has been much talk over the years and various questions answered in this House.  The most recent reply given was to the effect that work on the preparation of contract documents for the new Garda station in Tallaght is well advanced and it is expected that tenders for the job will be invited before the end of the year.  That reply was given in October 1984.  Having gone through the Minister's remarks, I do not see any reference whatsoever to the provision of that new Garda station.  Possibly there was some announcement about it I did not hear but, had there been such announcement, I am sure the Minister would have referred to it in his remarks today.</P>
    <P>It must be remembered that Tallaght has a population of approximately 80,000 at present and the Garda station sited there is totally inadequate to service the area.  While I appreciate that there may be difficulties encountered in the provision of a new station &mdash; in view of the expansion of the Tallaght area and recent new developments there &mdash; one would have hoped that at least it would have been possible to provide some temporary accommodation, such as area stations or the like in order to help the people and the gardaí operating there.  I want to express my utter disappointment in relation to this matter, which has been raised many times in this House.  There have been various deputations to the Minister. <Col N="633" /> I welcomed the news given some time ago that contract documents were being prepared because it is a facility badly needed by the Garda and the Tallaght area alike.  It must be remembered that Garda strength has increased annually in the area but without any corresponding increase in their accommodation.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of equipment for the Garda.  One attends various meetings, those of residents' associations and others when a point very often made in the presence of a garda is that when there is some crime committed, some theft or housebreaking reported, the Garda are not in a position to visit the scene to investigate such occurrence, there being no transport available to them.  I want to make it perfectly clear that I am not choosing this subject out of any wish to criticise.  This relates only to the day to day events in the Tallaght area.  It is sad that when people from an area inhabited by 80,000 people, ring up the Garda station to report a crime the reply they get is that the Garda are not in a position to deal with the matter because they do not have transport.  It is well known that this Garda station has been without a garda car for two or three days on occasions due to a breakdown.  If there is a shortage of cars in headquarters it should be possible to rent a car to service the area. Although Tallaght has grown so rapidly its importance may escape some people, but the people living there and who have invested their money in houses there are entitled to some protection and proper services.  The Garda despite very limited accommodation and facilities have done trojan work in this area.</P>
    <P>The neighbourhood watch was introduced into this area some time ago and it is going very well.  Apparently before the neighbourhood watch was set up some of the residents' associations got the impression that funds would be made available to them from the Department. In a recent reply to a Dáil question the Minister told me that there were no proposals for the direct funding of neighbourhood watch committees but that the cost of media promotion and so on was being dealt with.  This has caused disappointment <Col N="634" /> to many residents' associations operating in the Tallaght areas.  I appreciate that it is difficult for a Department to meet every request, but these people are voluntary workers anxious to help and some consideration would be appreciated.</P>
    <P>The Minister in his statement referred to the increased numbers of people in prison.  We welcome that but must ask ourselves if this is the answer to the problem. We should address ourselves perhaps to the roots of the problem.  We must all accept that the very high level of unemployment in many areas plays a huge part in the increase in theft.  I appreciate the difficulties facing a Government in endeavouring to attract new industries.  The constituency I represent has had very little investment to create new industries to alleviate the serious unemployment problem there.  If people have too much time on their hands they will devote their energies to something other than work.  It is a pity we have so many young people in prison today.  I appreciate that it is the duty of everyone to ensure that criminals are brought to justice, but we should look for another solution to the problem.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on his work so far, but the rapid increase in crime over the years leaves us disappointed with the overall situation.  In the Dublin area alone it is well known that many crimes are not reported because people know that there are not the facilities to deal with the criminals.  In some areas, if it becomes known that a person reported a crime he is treated in a way which we must regret, and we must attach some responsibility for this to the Department of Justice.  The time has come when this sort of thing should be tackled.  I hope the Minister will bear in mind the validity of my points in relation to the Tallaght Garda station and the facilities there.  The gardaí operating there are doing wonderful work despite the inadequate accommodation and facilities.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MauriceManning" hpid="Mr. Manning Mr. Manning">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Manning</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with great interest to Deputy Hyland, who made a very sensible and constructive contribution. <Col N="635" /> Many of the ideas he outlined today are worthy of deep consideration.</P>
      <P>I compliment the Minister for Justice on his work.  No Minister has had to face such a variety of problems in such a short space of time as has this Minister, and few Ministers have inherited a Department in such a low state of morale as did the present Minister.  In the two and half years under this Minister, who it must be remembered had no previous Ministerial experience, he has shown a sureness of touch and a great steadiness in dealing with the many problems he faced.  The public appreciate this.  The Minister has restored the morale and credibility of his Department and has set in train a series of major reforms the effects of which will be felt in our society in the decades ahead.  It is not easy to speak well in public of one's friends, so I will not go on too long with this.  However, history will judge this Minister to have been one of our finest ever Ministers for Justice.</P>
      <P>In the short two and a half years we saw the passing of the Criminal Justice Act after one of the fullest and best debates this House has ever had.  We will shortly see the emergence of the Garda Complaints Tribunal, a reform which is much overdue.  We have seen the inquiry into the penal system and I hope that that report will be following by action.  We have had promised changes in the whole area of Garda training, the establishment of the neighbourhood watch system and the Courts Bill which perhaps did not go far enough but which is an important reforming measure.  The Bankruptcy Bill is a major Bill coming from the Department of Justice.  It was first introduced in 1982 but the genesis of it goes back decades.  This Bill is now on its way through Committee Stage.  There are 149 sections in this Bill and the committee are at present as far as section 80.  This much needed reform of the bankruptcy laws which has simply eluded the attention of the House over all these years will become law by the end of this year or early next year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The results of much of the Minister's work will not always be immediately or <Col N="636" /> quickly visible.  Changes in the area of the administration of justice or law reform are not easy.  There are a variety of interest groups, each dissatisfied with whatever the Minister produces, each vocal, articulate, well organised.  The closest similarity is in the field of education where any Minister will have to deal with and adjudicate on claims of various interest groups and ultimately come out with what is best in favour of the community. In the welter of competing claims it is possible to overlook the progress which is being made.  The changes initiated over the past two and a half years will leave a lasting mark on our system of justice.</P>
    <P>We must exercise caution about what is happening.  It is important that the changes now taking place be properly planned because staring us in the face at the moment are the consequences of a lack of planning in the decades past.  So many of the problems outlined by the Minister and by the two speakers opposite this morning are due to a simple lack of planning in the fifties and sixties.  This lack of proper planning and foresight took many shapes.  It can be seen in the provision of enormous, soulless housing estates where no attention was paid to proper or even basic amenities like transport, shops and so forth.  These badly designed, badly planned housing estates created an environment in which crime would prosper, where there was very little incentive to people to keep within the law.  In many cases these communities have fought back.  The people have banded together and got the amenities which should have been there in the first place.  Had they been there in the first place, many of the problems we have today would not have arisen.</P>
    <P>The prison space crisis is also due to a lack of planning, perhaps easier to understand. Irish life in the forties, fifties and sixties was peaceful and tranquil.  A murder was an isolated event which made the front pages of the national newspapers. A murder trial was followed day by day by half the population.  It was rare, dramatic and caused interest.  The prison figures for those years show that crime <Col N="637" /> was steady or dropping.  Prisons were closed.  Our streets were safe.  There was very little house breaking.  However, if we are being honest we must admit that perhaps one of the reasons why our crime rate was so low in those years was that we exported our discontent and dissent. This was the time of massive emigration of those who had they stayed at home might well have taken to crime or at least a minority of them might have done so. I am sure the Ceann Comhairle remembers that in our courts a district justice would often give a person convicted the option of going to England or to jail.</P>
    <P>Those days are gone now and our problems are our own and we must face up to them.  In that climate of very little crime and almost no murder it would have been a brave politician who would say that scarce capital resources should be spent on prisons rather than on schools or hospitals.  Also a problem then as now was that very few constituencies were willing to have prisons built in their neighbourhood. Indeed, I must compliment the Deputy from Laois-Offaly who successfully prevented the establishment of a prison in that area.  Perhaps we all would act in the same way under local pressure.  People do not want prisons in their areas.  We like to pass that problem on to the next area, the next town, the next constituency.</P>
    <P>In the fifties and sixties nobody foresaw that the Northern Ireland situation would explode and that violence and crime in Northern Ireland would spill over dramatically into the Republic.  None of us foresaw either that our local crime would explode for a variety of reasons in the way it has.  Therefore, this absence of planning left us with a totally inadequate prison system.  It meant also that when the crime wave occurred massive and very rapid recruitment of large numbers of prison officers took place.  Perhaps in many cases proper screening processes were not followed and a small minority of people got into the prison service who would not normally be there.  This was the result of rapid major recruitment over a short time.  To a large extent the prison space problems which the present and <Col N="638" /> any future administration must tackle are a legacy of the failure in the past to foresee what might happen.  Perhaps people should be blamed for it, perhaps not.</P>
    <P>Building a prison is not just a straightforward operation.  There are many types of prisons and there is a great deal of division of opinion as to what exactly the regime should be in a prison.  The problem cannot be resolved overnight, and I have very little patience with people who castigate the Minister for the necessary stop gap measures which are being taken at present.  Spike Island is not the answer, but it is at least in the short term meeting an immediate problem.  The Minister never claimed that it would do more than that.  He did not see it as a long term measure.  There is great inconsistency if not hypocrisy on the part of those who on the one hand roar and shout for sterner methods but, who on the other hand, as soon as a practical solution is provided are the first to complain that it does not meet the situation.  They pick upon the obvious faults that are in any short term, stopgap measure.</P>
    <P>The same lack of planning is evident in the way in which the Garda Síochána have developed over the years, though here the excuses are less valid.  If any institution has been studied in depth it is the Garda Síochána and their operation. We had the Conroy Commission, a major analysis of how the Garda Síochána should be reformed and changed. Aspects of the Conroy Report have gathered dust and have not been implemented and they certainly are as valid today as when the report was produced. We had the major Stokes-Kennedy-Crowley Report on the operation of the Garda Síochána, which for reasons I do not understand has never been published but which is available at least to the Minister and his advisers.  In recent years the various representative bodies, the Garda Representative Association and the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors have in a constructive way put forward proposals for improving the operation of the police force.  Therefore, there is no question at this stage of a need for a commission or analysis.  The <Col N="639" /> problems in the Garda force are clear to all of us.  There is sufficient material there for the Minister to consider.</P>
    <P>The problem here over the year has been one of political will.  In the highly volatile security situation of the seventies it is understandable why Ministers in the Department of Justice should have been preoccupied with security when they themselves were living under threat of kidnap, when they were constantly protected by gardaí and the Special Branch, when there was a great unknown. Nobody knew just what could happen when there was &mdash; as there is still &mdash; a threat to the very existence of the State, and it is easy to understand why Ministers would be preoccupied with questions of security.  Unfortunately, a consequence of that was an unwillingness to look at the whole organisation and operation, of our police force, and there are a number of key areas in the administration of the Garda Síochána which are crying out for urgent attention.  In some cases I believe changes are being made.</P>
    <P>There is the whole question of recruitment. In the past, and still to some extent, gardí were recruited in a totally haphazard way, a crude way.  There did not seem to be any system of aptitude testing and seeing whether or not people who would be playing a very sensitive role in society were psychologically suited to be policemen.  Being a policemen confers power and authority on a person which can be and unfortunately as we have seen in the past has been abused.  I wonder how much thought was put into the question of screening people.  I know of one survey which was carried out on recruits in the late seventies or early eighties in a class in Templemore which led to the conclusion that some of those people should never be allowed to wear a police uniform because there was a likelihood that they could and might well abuse their power.  Screening and aptitude testing to find out if there are personality defects need to be looked at very <Col N="640" /> carefully.  There is no shortage of information about psychological tests and programmes.</P>
    <P>The very valuable report from the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism yesterday on Garda training spelled out in detail many of the defects or shortcomings in the present system, and what needs to be done.  We should not have needed that report, because any commonsense look at the way in which gardaí have been trained in the past would lead to a number of conclusions. First, the training period is much too short.  Secondly, there is far too little emphasis on the academic side, on the study of society, on dealing with the public, on community relations and perhaps too much emphasis on discipline and military aspects of policing.  I know from talking to people in Templemore that there has been a major change in emphasis recently and that over the coming years there will be a major change in emphasis.</P>
    <P>A third area was also touched upon this morning, that is, the way in which our police force has been deployed over the years.  We have the silly, pointless use of gardaí on tasks for which they were ill suited and they were not available for the purposes for which they were recruited. We have all seen in Garda stations a garda laboriously typing out a report with one finger.  The youngest secretary would do it ten or 20 times faster and more efficiently.  We have seen gardaí on clerical duties, process serving and so forth, which could be done by civilians or by some sort of auxiliary police force.</P>
    <P>The public are frustrated when they report a burglary or a car theft or something that happens in their area.  There is not a garda in sight and they arrive at the station to find five, six or seven gardaí seemingly involved in work which has very little bearing on crime.  I hope the whole question of deployment will be looked at.  In the same way I often wonder whether the court system could be made more efficient so that gardaí would not be required to be in attendance for very long hours, often hanging around to make a very brief intervention in a case <Col N="641" /> where perhaps a written submission might well suffice.</P>
    <P>All of this brings me to the main area of weakness in the Garda Síochána which stems from the absence of planning I mentioned, that is, the whole question of management.  Here we find the biggest problems.  The managerial revolution has not been felt in the upper levels of the Garda Síochána.  In many cases the structures and the attitudes are archaic. Recently Senator Durcan drew attention to what he saw as the scandal of absentee superintendents, with superintendents living 60 to 100 miles or even further away from the areas to which they have been assigned.  He made the point, rightly, that a superintendent or a chief superintendent must live in the area where he operates.  He must be part of that community.  It is not good enough to have superintendents living 60 or 80 or hundreds of miles distant from their areas, I was going to say their constituencies. It would be very difficult for any of us not to live in our own constituencies. We have to experience and feel at first hand the problems and the thinking of the people we represent.  Even more so a chief superintendent should be resident in his area.</P>
    <P>Over the past number of years the Garda Síochána have always reacted to a crisis either by upping the numbers, hiring more people and bringing in more recruits irrespective of what they will be used for, or else by a call for greater technology, more machinery and equipment, often without any great thought as to what the equipment would be used for. It is not with fixed wing aircraft or more helicopters that the fight against crime which we have all spoken about this morning will be won.  It will be won by better deployment of the existing forces. We have enough policemen.  We are spending enough money on them.  We must get better value for the taxpayers' money from the forces which exist already.  That will come about only if there is a major managerial revolution within the Garda Síochána.  I can see nothing wrong with bringing civilians into the upper levels of the Garda, civilians <Col N="642" /> with a proven track record in management at high levels, to perform tasks at which they excelled in the private or the public sector.  They could bring their expertise to bear on the running of the Garda Síochána.</P>
    <P>I know the reform of the Garda Síochána is a minefield for any politician.  The interests of the Garda Síochána as a whole are often not best served by some of the more strident representatives of the various organisations which operate within the field of justice.  Any Minister must be conscious of the general good. He must not become a tool of any Garda organisation or pressure group.  He must stay above that.  The general public would have greater respect for the Garda organisations, and they would have greater credibility with the public, if they spoke a little less often and moderated the tone in which they couch many of their demands and many of their attacks, and if they took a course in communications to improve the way in which they present their often legitimate cases to the public.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland referred at some length to the licensing laws.  I would not disagree with the objectives which Deputy Hyland has in mind.  A review of our licensing laws is long overdue.  The legislation committee are now examining the licensing laws in great detail.  Deputy Hyland referred to the report by Professor Brendan Walsh, an excellent report, which will be the basis upon which the legislation committee will proceed.  The problems are very clear and explicit. There is general agreement in the House as to what the problems are.  There is the epidemic of under age drinking and the need to curb that in some way.  That will not be easy if there is not the involvement of parents.  The use of identity cards is a possibility.  How far it will go I do not know because, unfortunately, there will always be publicans who will not be aware of their responsibilities and who will be willing to serve people who are under age.</P>
    <P>The second point mentioned in the report is the virtual absence of control over off-licence outlets and the ease with which people who are under age, and people who are chronically alcoholic and <Col N="643" /> should not be served drink, can be served in the off-sales outlets.  Then there is the question of the hours.  Here I take issue with Deputy Hyland.  There is an important need to review the drinking hours, not necessarily to extend them.  A number of changes are necessary.  For example, the number of Sunday night extensions is a great scandal.  People are drinking late into Monday morning with the result that there is a very high level of absenteeism or sore heads at work on Monday morning. I would like to see an end to all Sunday extensions.  Perhaps the licensing laws could be changed.  In Edinburgh on an experimental basis at first, and now continuously, the licensing laws have disappeared.  Pubs can open as they please.  Edinburgh had a horrific record of drunkenness.  The net result seems to be that there is less drunkenness, that after the initial splurge people respect the right to drink in their own time and at their own speed without the bout of last minute drinking coming to closing time which we have here which has all the pubs closing at the same time and disgorging their less than sober occupants into the road.</P>
    <P>It is important that we look at the licensing hours to see if they are having a bad effect, to see if they could be changed.  Deputy Hyland used the word &ldquo;liberalise&rdquo;.  I consider that is the wrong word and &ldquo;rationalise&rdquo; probably is the most accurate description of what should be done.  I should point out to the House that the legislation committee have received an enormous number of submissions from interested groups all over the country of the possible reform of the licensing laws.  I hope the Minister will not move to bring changes into the law until all of those groups have had their say in the legislation committee and until the distilled wisdom of that committee can be presented in the House as a course for action.  Perhaps Deputy Hyland would not find too much to disagree with in that particular interpretation of what is happening.</P>
    <P>I would like the Minister to have a look at the whole area of official secrets.  It <Col N="644" /> does not affect many people.  The Minister, in reply to a Dáil question last week, did not see the matter as urgent.  It is certainly important if it is not urgent. Our present legislation dates back even further than the 1963 Act, which consolidated a whole series of measures which had been in existence since the first World War and before it.  Our present Act is a minefield.  Under the present legislation an official secret is more or less what an official says is secret.  It is a bit like Alice in Wonderland, things are what I say they are.  Things are so vague at the moment that many matters are kept secret when there is no reason to keep them secret and officials can hide behind a veil of secrecy on matters which are of genuine, legitimate public interest.  I fear it will take a scandal like the Ponting affair in Britain to do something about this.  We have essentially the same legislation as Britain.  If those changes were made now it would open up the whole area and could prevent us ever arriving at that type of situation.  The Minister gave his criterion last week for legislation; was it urgent?  He felt it was not urgent and even if it was it certainly would not be high on his agenda.  I would like him to have a look at this matter and perhaps refer it to a committee of this House or to the Law Reform Commission for possible courses of action.</P>
    <P>There is another scandal which I believe all Members of the House would agree on, which is reaching epidemic proportions, that is the question of uninsured car drivers.  This matter has been mentioned many times before.  It is a national scandal and those people who are paying car insurance are carrying the burden of those who refuse to pay.  This has been discussed in some detail and I only want to make a passing reference to it.  Surely it is possible to devise some system of compulsory disc which will show very quickly if a car is insured.  I am sure everybody will agree that the checks on drivers to see if they are insured should be far more stringent and frequent than they are at present.</P>
    <P>Quite a number of speakers have referred to the neighbourhood watch <Col N="645" /> scheme, which has just been launched.  I believe everybody would agree that the concept of neighbourhood watch has generated great enthusiasm throughout the various constituencies because people want to be involved, they want to be part of protecting what they see as the way of life to which they are entitled but people also have a great fear of vigilantes.  All of us have seen how vigilantes very quickly become a cover for thugs, bullyboys and those who want to work out their personal vendettas under the guise of law and order.  The community neighbourhood watch offers the right level of participation and constructive involvement. It also creates a very good spirit of self help among decent people who want to live safely and without fear and it brings about a genuine communication between the Garda and the community.</P>
    <P>It is extraordinary how this communication has been lacking down the years. It is only in recent time in the cities that some real communication has once again begun.  I must pay tribute to the Garda who in recent years have been very courteous in dealing with the public, often in dealing with people who are abusive or difficult.  I find a very high level of courtesy and helpfulness among gardaí and, in particular, Ban ghardaí.  I believe the type of people who are recruited as Ban ghardaí are of a very high calibre.  I am sure we would all be very happy to see further recruitment of Ban ghardaí and to see their role greatly increased in overall policing.</P>
    <P>I would like to see an extension of the community principle to deal with dangerous driving, not just joyriding.  All neighbourhoods have examples of people who speed through built-up areas, who are oblivious of the safety of the young and old and who make life miserable and dangerous as well as creating fear among people.  There are a number of ways of dealing with this.  One way I have been pioneering for some time is the greater use of ramps in built-up areas.  Ramps today need not be complicated.  They are steel, they can be nailed down on to roads and can be moved very easily.  I canvassed this fairly extensively in my constituency <Col N="646" /> and I asked people if they would be willing to support, on an experimental basis, the setting up of ramps in certain areas. The response has been very enthusiastic. People are certainly willing to pay the small price of inconvenience if it means the roads are safer, that drivers will have to slow down and that their children and old people will be less likely to be knocked down.  I urge the Department of Justice, in conjunction with the Department of the Environment, to get together to see if, in selected areas where the residents are agreeable, ramps could be constructed on the roads for a trial period to see if it makes the roads safer and reassures the people who are genuinely worried about speeding.</P>
    <P>I know there are many other speakers who want to get in so I will not delay any longer.  There is enormous scope for reform, particularly in small matters in relation to the whole area of justice.  Perhaps the Minister at some stage might consider bringing in a miscellaneous provisions Bill where all our ideas on small things which could easily be reformed could be lumped together.  We could then have a genuine debate in the House on the matters which concern the people we represent, where there would be general agreement as to what should be done and where the improvements could be effected.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>I should acknowledge initially the compliments paid by the last speaker to our spokesman, Deputy Hyland, I endorse those as fully as I can. I know that Deputies Manning and Cosgrave and the Minister of State will share with me our concern that our spokesman, Deputy Woods, has been forced to absent himself for some months.  I avail of this opportunity to extend to him our good wishes and hope that he will be back with us in the best of health before very long.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There my compliments must end.  I cannot agree with Deputy Manning that the Minister for Justice has been a success.  My reason for saying that <Col N="647" /> is the evidence which is around us.  On the Minister's own admission prisons cannot cater for or cope with the number of people who have been sent there.  There is great discord in the Garda force and similar unease and disquiet among prison officers.  Legislation is promised and we hear eloquent statements about what is needed but there is delay in its implementation. Article 41 of our Constitution states that the rights and freedoms of our citizens must be guaranteed but as a result of those delays these rights and freedoms are painfully absent.  It gives me no pleasure to say that but there is no point in my coming to this forum and representing the views of my constituents and those outside my constituency when I know that ahead of the great social problem of unemployment is the concern, unrest, fear and unease that resides in everyone with relation to their well-being. Half of the population are afraid to stay in their homes at night lest they be attacked and the other half are afraid to go out lest they be attacked.  That might be a slightly extreme presentation of the case but everyone present will accept that is the new order of the times in which we live.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is not happening under Deputies Doherty or Gerard Collins as Minister but under Deputy Noonan as Minister who, following his appointment, made it clear that he had the solution to all our problems.  He has done practically nothing of a positive nature.  If he had, he would not be admitting to the situation that exists.  He admits that there are 1,200 people contained in our prisons but there are another 700 people who should also be in prison.  We know as a result of statements made even by the Minister and other Members of the Government that morale in the Garda force is at its lowest.  They feel rightly or wrongly &mdash; rightly as far as I am concerned &mdash; that they have been let down as regards the assistance and strengths that they should have received from the Government.  As regards their desire to implement laws and regulations which they saw as fitting <Col N="648" /> the needs of the people, they were subject to a very articulate lobby by minority groups, and what could be described as the rightful babble of the majority has been lost.  This was evident especially last year when we were discussing the Criminal Justice Bill.  I would hate to have been a member of the Garda force.  There was a general castigation of them in respect of every move they made.  Perhaps it was justifiable in the case of a small minority of them but there are good and bad in every profession, for example, among politicians, doctors, engineers and so on. There is no doubt that in the membership of the Garda we have an ability, dedication, commitment and intelligence which was prepared to apply itself to the pursuit of duties and responsibilities.  Yet after hot pursuit when they get their man in the cold atmosphere of the courts or here we are more concerned about whether they have crossed every t and dotted every I than about expressing to them our commendation for work well done.  It gives me no pleasure to say that.  I detect among the Garda an attitude where they know that their salary will come at the end of the month and they are not all that concerned about running the risk of finding themselves, arising from their enthusiasm for the work, being fined rather than being commended.</P>
    <P>The great Criminal Justice Bill was to give to them backing and recognition. The Minister said that worth-while measures could not be implemented without the prior establishment of the complaints body.  That has been promised by him on several occasions, the most recent promise was on 20 March last when at column 188 of the Official Report he stated:</P>
    <P>Many indeed might regret that the detention powers of the Bill and some of the other key provisions are not yet in force as undoubtedly they would be useful in dealing with some of the current problems.  I hope to be in a position to rectify that situation very shortly by bringing before the Oireachtas the Bill to set up a Garda Síochána Complaints Board. ...</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="649" /> The Minister hoped to do it very shortly. If &ldquo;very shortly&rdquo; has any meaning at all one would have the right to expect that it might have been done before the end of the first week in June.  I predict that we will not have it by Christmas.</P>
    <P>It may be that what is known as joyriding has been contained for the present but, as sure as it has, some other equally serious problem will arise.  We will have a repetition of what happened as regards that problem and as regards attacks on the elderly &mdash; action being taken when it is too late because the Minister has neither the resources nor the backing of the Garda to the extent that is necessary. One can have all the regulations one likes but all great things happen at the margin. The margin of success in respect of the implementation of law and order cannot be seen unless there is recognition that the Garda have the backing of the House, the Minister, the Commissioner and the Department of Justice to the extent that we would be prepared to judge them not perhaps on the one inevitable omission which will occur as a result of lack of industry or effort but on their overall performance.  Unless that word goes out to them, we are wasting our time if we think we can contain the problem.  While I am dealing with the Garda and their justifiable disappointment in us, there is no better example than to quote the affront given to them in respect of the committee which was established to examine recruitment, training and retraining of the Garda.  The Minister referred to this in his speech but he did not say that, in the establishment of that committee, he or his advisers saw fit to exclude a representative from the two Garda bodies.  Ponder that for a moment. If a committee was established to examine the position of politicians, teachers, journalists, doctors and dentists in regard to suitable recruitment to those professions and how best to discharge their duties, how they should be trained and the need for retraining and <i>ab initio</i>, representatives of those groups were excluded, the weakness is so obvious as to be sinister.  What, in God's name, is the justification for excluding a representative <Col N="650" /> of 11,500 members from a committee which has been set up to examine their business?  Perhaps the Minister will be able to satisfy me as to why that was done.</P>
    <P>I presume that the two Garda bodies will be making submissions to academics as to how best the academics might recommend that the position of the Garda could be improved.  I imagine that when the recommendations come &mdash; if they ever do &mdash; the knowledge that the Garda had no input will not greatly appeal to them.  In my time I met the odd wrong one in the Garda and, armed with the criticisms made about him, I interviewed him in the local Garda station and got explanations in respect of the criticism made against him.  Invariably, I found that the garda in question, perhaps with one or two exceptions, was able to satisfy me as to the correctness of his actions in the pursuit of his responsibilities.</P>
    <P>I wish to comment on an interview with Deputy Skelly on the radio this morning. He represents the area in which I live, and elected representatives should be prepared to pursue the normal channels available to them in respect of justifiable complaints.  I have listened to and admired Deputy Skelly in this House.  His statements often displayed courage; but, listening to him this morning, an elected Member of this House stating that he felt he was being hounded by the Garda, that they were out to get him and that he had proof of that, is not geared to encouraging respect for this House or for the Garda.  There must be a better way of doing this, and I appeal to Deputy Skelly to supply me with any evidence he has.  I am as anxious as he to protect the rights of anybody elected to this House to say what he or she thinks appropriate in the House.  If he does not have any evidence, he is obliged to make the position clearer than he did this morning.  The impression was given that situations pertain here which we know exist in Eastern countries where the elected representative is a unit and must act in accordance with the dictates of Big Daddy.  He must also obey an <Col N="651" /> all powerful dictator, but that is not the position here.</P>
    <P>I am not going to dwell on what I said earlier on, but I have taken issue with the Garda and, where necessary, made reports arising from my dissatisfaction with them and never once have I had the slightest evidence of their disappointment in my so doing.  I am sure that other Deputies have had the same experience. I appeal to Deputy Skelly to come in here this afternoon to enlighten us in relation to the manner in which this vendetta is being carried out against him.  If he convinces us we all should take appropriate action.</P>
    <P>I should now like to refer to that other important and vital area, the courts. Before I was elected to the House I was beginning to harbour doubts as to the court system here and in other countries. I had a feeling of disappointment, of annoyance at times, of surprise and frustration as to the way the courts, law and justice operated.  Already I had seen that, from something which ordinarily we are expected to accept as being a firm and absolute matter, depending upon the whim, the humour, the interest or the influences of the person sitting on a chair in the courts the life of a fellow citizen could be affected to a point and to an extent that was not fair or just.  The more I observe the courts the more I am convinced of the inappropriate fashion in which the work is carried out, of the complete lack of any standards in the manner in which sentences are passed, of the isolation that the person who has to go to the courts feels.  A person called before the courts hires a solicitor and a man or woman in a gown and wearing a wig sits in judgment on something that is vital to that person but the person is very seldom introduced to the area which so affects him or her.  I make no apology for calling it the vested interests of the professional classes in getting from the operations that are called justice and law the salary and remuneration which is not, in my opinion, commensurate with the service they give to the person before the courts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="652" /> It seems all the while to be organised so that the person involved is not told what is going on.  He or she must stand and wait, like expecting the result of a national lottery, to find out whether he or she has won or lost the case, whether he or she may face a sentence of six, nine or 12 months.  It appears that there are no criteria or, if there are, they seem to be so subject to other matter that it is impossible to get any correct line as to what is going to happen.  I do not think that is good enough for our citizens.  We know that it is Sean Citizen's taxes that pay for the education of solicitors, barristers and judges.  It seems extraordinary that having paid for their education people must pay them if they want to talk to them.  That is the position that exists.</P>
    <P>I have been critical of what is called &ldquo;free legal aid&rdquo; to the extent that formerly legal people were disposed to exercise their charity in respect of fellow citizens in trouble with the courts and did so running a risk that there would not be a fee forthcoming.  Free legal aid only guarantees that lawyers will not have to do that free any more.  In the courts a solicitor or barrister can have simultaneously three or four cases on hand and may be running from one court to another looking for adjournments but all the time be insensitive or oblivious to the needs of the client.  In most cases the adjournments are sought because it suits the lawyer involved.  I do not think that is good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister told us that most of the problems facing us today arise from areas where what might be described as the underprivileged live.  I suppose it can be shown that people who are exceedingly poor are underprivileged and are driven to extremes not common among others, but I venture to suggest that if other people were subjected to the adversity and trials of such people they would not withstand them.  Staying with that area, and the injustice of it, I should like to ask how many people from such areas become solicitors, barristers or judges. We know that the court area affects such people very much and one would imagine, in respect of the discretion a <Col N="653" /> judge can show, that it would help him or her in assessing what has motivated a person appearing before the court to the extremes they have indulged in if he or she had experienced some of the trials and tribulations of the person involved. It never happens.  I do not know of any judge who can boast that he or she came from Ballyfermot, Finglas, Tallaght or Coolock.  Very few lawyers can boast that they came from Tallaght, Coolock, Finglas or Ballyfermot and very few solicitors came from those areas, notwithstanding the fact that the money that went to the education of those people by and large came from those areas.  It must be remembered that in those areas the greatest number of PAYE workers live. We are all aware that it is such people who make the biggest contribution to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>If socialism is about giving representation to the people who pay in the areas where the lucrative vineyards exist then the day has come when we must guarantee that there will be fair representation not just in the matter of normal justice but in so far as the person sitting on the bench or pleading the case would be in a better position to interpret the mind, the feeling and the motivation, or lack of it, of the person before the court than exists at present.  I want to see an end to the position that obtains in our courts where sentences depend not on specific well formulated data but to a large extent on the whims and the prevailing climate in the courtroom, whether a judge likes a lawyer or not or whether in the presentation of the case a lawyer was able to excel another.  That should not be happening.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see a never ending rise in what is called free legal aid.  There is nothing free.  We all know that today even fresh air is not free.  Education is not free.  Everything has to be paid for. This was demonstrated in today's Estimate because in respect of the Garda, courts and prisons a sum of £304 million has been provided.  That money must be got from the people.  The people are not getting a fair return from the Garda because they do not have the resources, <Col N="654" /> backing or legislation to which they are entitled, and they are not getting a fair return from the courts because of the traditional attitude adopted there.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I raised the question of prisons and the lack of accommodation which led to the situation where there was disrespect for our courts.  As a person who served on the committee of St. Patrick's for ten years, it was unnecessary for the Minister to remind me of normal parole procedures and how certain prisoners' sentences are reduced by a fifth or a quarter, depending on their behaviour &mdash; but I was not referring to that.  I was talking about people who were sentenced in court but before they reached Mountjoy it was discovered there was no room for them.  Since last March 500 people have been sentenced but our total prison accommodation is for 1,100.  It cannot be a coincidence that on the day 20 people are sentenced another 20 are released.  This type of situation is being manufactured.  There are consultations taking place between a clerical officer or an executive officer in the Department of Justice and the governor of the prison. The officials say that 20 people must be taken into the prison and 20 others will have to be released.</P>
    <P>With a view to acquiring additional accommodation I suggested that the Minister reopen Daingean.  He said it was not possible and reprimanded me for making that suggestion.  He said Daingean could not contain these people and that that was why he had taken over Spike Island &mdash; it was surrounded by water and there was no danger of anybody escaping from it.  He has been proved wrong and he will appreciate that there was more in my suggestion than in his own.</P>
    <P>The fact that people are being released from prison before they would normally qualify for such release is lessening people's respect for our courts.  The Minister need not tell me of the additional 500 spaces he has created.  He has manipulated spaces but he has not created any new space.  The spaces he is talking about were inherited from his precedessor, Deputy Seán Doherty, but there was not the same need for them <Col N="655" /> during his term of office.  Whatever else Government Deputies may say, they are not very vocal in their criticism of the former Minister for Justice because they realise that when he was in office crime was much more contained than it is during the term of this much-lauded holder of the office.</P>
    <P>It is not good enough to say that poverty and social deprivation are the cause of our problems.  That is a slight on those who, through no fault of their own, are out of work, are poor and deprived. I have the honour of representing an area where there is a great deal of poverty and deprivation.  However, the vast majority of those people have a sense of what is right and what is wrong, which is comparable with and, as far as I am concerned exceeds that held by people in other areas.  I came from a home where we could not boast of great riches.  I am not saying we were deprived, but there was many a day when we could have done with more money.  There was never a question of any member of that household coveting what belonged to a neighbour. It was never suggested that it was justified for us to take what did not belong to us or that we would injure another person to get what he or she had.  Thankfully, that attitude remains in the majority of Irish homes.  It is an unnecessary and unjustifiable castigation of the poor to attribute all the problems of today to them.  But if it were so, then the Minister should exhort the Government to remove the source of the problem from these areas, a problem which he is failing to solve.</P>
    <P>The attitude of Ministers and of Ministers of State is not helpful.  Recently we had a contribution from the Minister of State Deputy Fennell.  She has gained for herself the reputation of being concerned and sensitive to the needs of all, but especially of ladies.  We are to commend her on every effort she is making towards removing impediments put in the way of females, but I found what she had to say recently very strange.  Traditionally a lady felt much more comfortable going to town carrying a handbag.  That was <Col N="656" /> fashionable, traditional and functional, but no longer is a lady happy to do that because she knows if she carries a handbag she runs the risk of being attacked. Everybody knows that, and the Minister of State also knows it.</P>
    <P>I suggest that that is a far greater problem for ladies today than many other alleged problems that Minister of State Deputy Fennell would want to articulate. When talking about the absence of law and order and the lack of freedom to go about one's business, that Minister says that it is not serious crime that impinges most on society but rather cases of petty vandalism such as handbag snatching and a general lawless attitude displayed by many young people.  Anybody who has been subjected to the trauma of handbag snatching knows its effect, but that in the eyes of the Minister of State is petty crime and we should not bother too much about it.</P>
    <P>This is all part of the effort towards deflating the existing emergency and denying the absence of the protection which the State should give to our citizens. What about the case of the lady in her own home visited by somebody who takes the contents of her handbag?  Is that, as far as the Minister of State is concerned, a petty crime?  Should that encourage us not to be as critical towards herself, the Minister for Justice and the Government as we are in respect of their failure to act in accordance with their constitutional requirements to guarantee to the citizen the right to go about his or her business satisfied that he or she has the protection of the State and is at least guaranteed that if such attacks occur the person responsible will be brought to justice and made to pay the penalty?</P>
    <P>On the question of penalty, I referred earlier to the fact that while I was a member of the committee of St. Patrick's, with the late Senator Jimmy Dunne and others, I endeavoured to bring much-needed improvement to the lives of prisoners there.  I am very sensitive to the application of the charity and understanding that should exist, but if one examines penology since the world <Col N="657" /> began there is no evidence that the kinder one is to people who commit crimes the better will be the response.  One can make any deduction one likes from that, but it is a statement of fact.</P>
    <P>We must appreciate that, even though man has changed everything around him, including all the changes from technology and so forth, in respect of his emotions man has not changed.  There is no evidence whatsoever that one serves better the cause of rehabilitating somebody who is guilty of a serious crime by supplying luxurious surroundings and providing many comforts that are denied to others. People say that lack of proper rehabilitation in our prisons is the reason for there being so many criminals.  It is the reverse, as far as I am concerned.  People do not mind going to prison now, apart from the discomfort that comes from overcrowding. The conditions are such that it is no longer a penalty to go to prison.</P>
    <P>As Minister of State at the Department of Education, I was associated with the process that led to the establishment of an institution at Lusk that was supposed to cure all the problems of the young teenage criminal.  That was built at a colossal investment by the nation, but there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever that it has improved the situation one bit.  Rather have those people created more havoc there than they ever did in Daingean or Glencree or places from which we all recoiled years ago.</P>
    <P>It is not the fashionable thing to say and one will be castigated for a hard line or something less complimentary, but I have no doubt that if you are looking for a way of teaching people the lesson of their wrongdoing it will not be done by treating them to a succession of comforts. We must apply ourselves now to establishing forms of corrective training that will not make little of the human being and will be more likely to bring the improvements we all want, rather than perpetuating those which have been in existence for the last ten years and have proved to be ineffective.  I have placed before the House matters which I regard as appropriate to this Estimate and have indicated &mdash; and am reluctant in saying <Col N="658" /> this but must be honest with myself &mdash; that I see absolutely no evidence that the present Minister for Justice has done anything worthwhile.  He talked, promised big, did a good PRO job; but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. The proof of his promises and measures should be seen outside, and there is no evidence that he has made any contribution to improving the situation he inherited. Rather is there ample evidence that it has become much worse under his guardianship.  Certainly the position <i>visà-vis</i> the Minister, the Department and the Garda has not much improved and that is to nobody's advantage.  Certainly, the erstwhile respect for the courts has gone, which is to nobody's advantage. His Minister of State treats the terrible present emergency as vandalism and petty crime.</P>
    <P>I am not so foolish as to expect that there will be any great response to what I have said.  Rather will there be an effort at protecting the ministerial position, as happened here when I raised the question of the lack of spaces for people sentenced to imprisonment.  At that time the Minister accused me of contributing to his problems in not preventing the deputy leader of our party from opposing the establishment of some prison in the centre of the city.  That was the only case he could make against what I said.  He avoided saying that a Minister of State in his own Government was at the same meeting and was more vocal in his criticism of the proposal than was the deputy leader of our party.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Government find themselves in a position where there is a complete lack of confidence in them in respect of law and order.  In the forthcoming elections an opportunity will be given to people to pass judgment on the performance of Ministers.  I am making the case on what is called law and order, the major one I shall put to the people.  If the election results show that the people are satisfied, if they vote against me and the rest of our candidates, I will be happy to come here &mdash; I will not wait until we are next discussing the Estimate &mdash; and say that I was wrong, that the people are <Col N="659" /> quite happy with the Minister.  However, I know I will not be obliged to do so.</P>

      <P>The fact that so much money has been spent during the year in the Vote that deals with the Garda Síochána and the prisons emphasises the serious situation that has arisen over a period of time.  The many crimes committed in respect of house robberies, aggravated assault in which some senior citizens were attacked and brutally beaten, car robberies and so on testify to the growing problem we must confront and ultimately try to solve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last year we had a long discussion when the Criminal Justice Bill was going through this House.  At that time the measure was opposed in certain quarters, and that opposition got much publicity. The people involved said the Bill was not necessary but in recent months some of those voices have been mute and seem to have disappeared from the headlines.  It is now realised we were right to bring the Bill forward.  My only regret is that some of the sections are still not in force.  It is nearly a year since the measure passed this House but to date the complaints procedure has not been dealt with.  This procedure is necessary before the measure can be implemented fully.  I do not know the reason for the delay.  When the Bill was being drafted it is obvious that consideration was also given to the complaints procedure.  The delay in this connection seems inexplicable.  We must ask if the delay has been caused by the parliamentary draftsman or by the Attorney General's office.  It is essential that the complaints procedure be brought forward without further delay.  As we are now in the month of June it does not appear likely that it will come before us until the autumn and that is not satisfactory when one considers that the Bill went through this House almost a year ago.  I doubt if the delay is due to the Minister.  I am sure he is as anxious as anyone else to have the measure implemented fully.  Whoever is responsible for the delay should be asked to act faster <Col N="660" /> than they have done in the past few months.</P>
    <P>The amount of money provided for the Garda Síochána is considerable.  It is more than £233 million and this testifies to the commitment of the Government to help the Garda.  While they have been given some equipment and the necessary resources to fight crime much more has to be done.  The Garda Síochána should be a customer-orientated service.  New methods of training must be considered. I am a member of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism and I hope that some of the recommendations of the committee will be implemented as soon as possible.  Another committee is looking at aspects of Garda training and I hope they do not take too long to report. I hope they take the necessary evidence and that they pay attention to the various Garda organisations and others who have contributed.  At times committees sit for quite a long time but when they report nothing is done about it.</P>
    <P>Recently I visited Templemore with other members of the committee and I was interested to see the on-the-job training and some retraining schemes.  Members of the Garda Síochána throughout their careers in the force must be given the opportunity to do refresher courses. I was glad to see that all gardaí are now trained in relation to drug offences and drug abuse.  This means that the garda on the beat will recognise tell-tale signs in relation to this problem and will be able to act accordingly.  It is good that members of the force who are not specifically in the Drugs Squad have achieved considerable successes.  A special tribute must be paid to the Drugs Squad who have had notable successes in the past. They have ensured that some of the so-called drug barons and people who have literally helped to murder our young have been put away.</P>
    <P>It is important that the Garda Síochána get a new national communications network. It is desirable that the whole system be put into operation as soon as possible.  The Neighbourhood Watch system has been launched successfully.  It is now covering a number of areas and is <Col N="661" /> getting a good response from the public. They are interested and realise that the best way to beat crime and to ensure that their property and that of their neighbours is protected is by a community-based action by assisting the Garda.  I hope that the provision of telephones will not be held up by red tape.  Where the Garda recommend that public phones be provided or that old people who are living perhaps in flats or in old people's homes should be given phones, their recommendation should be acted upon without delay.  Yesterday while canvassing I spoke to a person who has been waiting five years for a phone.  It is ridiculous that there should be such long delays especially when elderly people are concerned having regard to the importance of their being able to keep in touch with family members or with other relatives. I trust that where the Garda make such recommendations there will be an instantaneous link-up with Bord Telecom to ensure that telephones are provided.</P>

      <P>There has been much reference recently to the level of the prison population and to the problem of providing adequate accommodation for prisoners.  With increasing numbers of people being convicted and being sentenced to longer terms of imprisonment, extra accommodation has had to be provided. Despite various assertions from Opposition spokeman, they, too, must realise that the matter is not merely as simple as constructing four walls and then claiming to have a prison.  Extra prison accommodation has been provided on Spike Island and despite a couple of initial hiccups, I trust that additional prisoners can be accommodated there before the new Wheatfield prison becomes available. When we have extra accommodation we can ensure that all those who are convicted and sentenced for having <Col N="662" /> committed very serious crimes such as car stealing and in particular crimes against old people, will serve almost every day of those sentences.  We must ensure that there will be no such concept as a shedding policy whereby people serving sentences for very serious crimes are released early.</P>
      <P>Reference has been made to the numbers of people convicted recently in respect of offences connected with motoring, for instance, in respect of driving without insurance.  In that regard I urge that the disc system will be introduced without further delay.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred to delays in the Land Registry.  In the context of the obviously necessary embargo on the recruitment of staff in the public service, there might be a more prudent judgment. While I appreciate that we have a massive public service bill and that we must consider areas in which there is scope for getting a better return for the taxpayers' money, a strict across-the-board embargo affects many people by reason of the delays caused by staff shortages.</P>
      <P>Perhaps some building society work which might not require immediate attention could be left over so that more pressing matters might be dealt with.  In the case of building society work the clients are likely to be involved with the society for a number of years but there are many areas that are more urgent, for instance, areas relating to the sale of houses and so on.</P>
      <P>The embargo should not mean strictly taking someone from any area.  There has been a 14 per cent reduction in one area. Having regard to the fees paid in respect of the lodgment of documents such as deeds and so on, the Land Registry should be paying for itself.  The embargo should not be applied strictly across the board.  It should not mean that an area where a certain level of staff is very important are left short while perhaps staff could be taken from some other area without causing too much difficulty.  The aim should be to keep up the level of staff in areas in which a shortage would have a serious effect on the public in terms of delays.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="663" /> I urge that the embargo be used sparingly and that careful consideration be given to any proposal to remove staff from such areas as the courts or the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. We must ensure that the courts system does not break down because of staff shortages.</P>
    <P>I welcome the appointment of an extra judge to deal with Circuit Court cases. This is in the Bill published today.  One hopes that that Bill will have the effect of speeding up the whole process and of bringing about a reconsideration of some of the outdated systems.  Obviously, this would involve some time but it is possible to deal more speedily with cases while considering them sympathetically.</P>
    <P>In the whole area of Garda and community relations there must be greater evidence of the provision of a service. People should be assured that following Garda response to their complaints, there will be a follow up and further communication.  The service in some areas of the country is somewhat sloppy but perhaps in the context of the new training methods for the Garda, greater emphasis will be placed on putting gardaí into areas where they will be in a better position to come to know the people so that locals will know that today, for instance, Garda Murphy will be on duty while Garda Jones will be on duty tomorrow. If the people know their gardaí they will be prepared to co-operate with them in their fight against crime.</P>
    <P>I support the measures being taken by the Minister but I appeal to him to take action in the matter of the delay in establishing the Garda complaints procedure. This delay is not justified.  I do not know whether the fault rests with the parliamentary draftsmen or with the office of the Attorney General but I trust every effort will be made to establish the tribunal as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I hope to introduce the Bill establishing the complaints procedure in the Dáil during the present session.</P>
      <P>The provision in the Criminal Justice Act, 1984, providing for consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail has been in operation since 1 March 1985.</P>
      <P>Two other important changes made by the Criminal Justice Act in relation to the law on bail have also been in effect since 1 March.  First, to make the provision on consecutive sentences effective, so far as sentences passed in the District Court are concerned, the Act increased from 12 months to two years the aggregate term that a district justice can impose when passing two or more consecutive sentences. Second, the Act made absconding on bail an offence for the first time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The three changes in question made by the Criminal Justice Act represent a very considerable tightening up of the law in the bail area.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> When the Government were considering proposals in the Criminal Justice Act they examined this matter and decided on three initiatives.  The first was to introduce consecutive sentences for offences committed while on bail.  Until the Criminal Justice Act, or those decisions relating to bail, were implemented on 1 March last, if somebody committed an offence while on bail in effect they had immunity from punishment because sentences would be concurrent &mdash; there were not consecutive sentences.  The second proposal implemented under the Act is that absconding while on bail was made an offence.  Third, the jurisdiction of the District Court was raised to two years to allow for consecutive sentences in the District Court.  Of course, there can be consecutive sentences in the Circuit Court as well for offences committed while on bail and there can be modules of three, four or five years added on for a whole number of offences to make quite extensive sentences.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The question of implementing any <Col N="666" /> other fundamental changes in the right to bail would run us into constitutional difficulty.  There was a Supreme Court decision at the end of the sixties which decided that bail could be refused only in the most restrictive circumstances and that, in effect, to refuse people the right to bail would be a form of preventive detention.  As people are innocent until they are proven guilty it would be preventive detention to deny access to bail and bail would be denied only where there was very strong information that somebody was going to abscond or was going to intimidate witnesses.  Otherwise bail is freely available.</P>
    <P>The provisions of the Criminal Justice Act are being effective now, and will continue to be effective.  We may not have as big a problem in the future as we have had.  It seems to be a problem more in areas like car stealing, burglary and larceny than in other areas, and consecutive sentences are appropriate in those cases.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> My advice is that change along the lines the Deputy suggests would require a constitutional referendum and we have no proposal to hold such a referendum.  I would ask the House and the Deputy to look at the other side of the question.  There are examples in other jurisdictions where somebody is refused bail and is in jail awaiting trial for one and a half, two or two and a half years.  It would be a major encroachment into the civil rights of the citizen if we made that kind of constitutional change.  The only other information I can offer which might be helpful is that in the assessment of say, car stealing in the Dublin area in the first three months of the year approximately 20 per cent of people being arrested by the Garda in April-May were people who were out on bail and who were repeating <Col N="667" /> offences.  The problem certainly is there but these people are being processed through the courts now and will be subject to consecutive sentences.  We will see how that will progress.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister not consider taking proceedings which would go right to the Supreme Court again to enable them, 20 years on, to review the decision to which he referred? The Minister will be aware that the Supreme Court have for some time found that, in the light of current circumstances they are entitled to review decisions taken by that court previously.  In view of the restrictive application of that particular decision &mdash; into which I do not need to go in detail now &mdash; would the Minister not consider that it would be worth while to have the Supreme Court review the position at this point?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.</P>
      <P>I refer to my reply to Questions Nos. 381 and 382 of 18 October, 1984 about a place of detention and a prison at Wheatfield, Clondalkin, County Dublin.  As regards other locations, further progress towards building at Rathmore Road, Cork, for 180 and at Portlaoise for 120 depends on availability of funds.  Apart from proceeding as quickly as possible with these new places, the pressure on accommodation makes it necessary to take urgent steps to provide temporary accommodation for use at short notice. The bringing into use of Fort Mitchel on Spike Island and the taking over of the Education Units at Arbour Hill and Cork prisons are examples of measures that have enabled me to increase the prison population from about 1,670 at end of January to over 1,900 this week.  Further changes in use of existing accommodation will be made if necessary in order to hold all those committed by the courts and I am still pursuing my search for other premises that could be used as prisoner accommodation.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy misunderstands the situation.  He should have consulted the people in his own party who would have been familiar with decisions taken.  There were plans to expand prison accommodation which were initiated approximately in 1979. Certainly decisions taken by the Government in 1981 and also in 1982 slowed down that process.  But once I came to office I proceeded in all speed with advancing the project which was furthest advanced, that is the Wheatfield one. The availability of funds since I became Minister in 1982 has not inhibited me from providing prison space.  It is simply that of picking up the plans that were there and advancing them as quickly as I could.  The amount of money available still leaves me with a situation in which I cannot get Wheatfield into use until 1987. I think the Deputy is aware that even the amount of capital provided by the Government in 1983 &mdash; or was it 1984 &mdash; was not fully utilised because the plan was not sufficiently advanced.  Therefore there is no question of there being a possibility of providing any other new prison building, regardless of the amount of capital funds made available to me, simply because the Wheatfield project was the one most advanced and that is the one we carry on with.  Down along the line, if I had extra money now I could move along the Portlaoise project and I could move along a project in Cork, but they would not be of benefit until the <Col N="670" /> years 1989, 1990 or 1991.  Regardless of what way I proceeded I was left with a situation where with existing accommodation and any new temporary accommodation I could acquire, I had to provide accommodation for a number which had increased from approximately 1,200 to 1,940.  That is what has happened over the last two and a half years.</P>

In view of the premature releases running at over 1,000 per annum and the fact that in 1982 over £15½ million was allocated and upwards of £12 million to £14 million has already been spent on consultants' fees on the original programme, would the Minister acknowledge that if he has not cancelled the project he is slowing down which has not only undermined the whole prison system but the legal and judicial systems?

      <P>asked the Minister for Justice if he will comment on a report in the media (details supplied) which disclosed that Nazi war criminals used this country as an escape route at the end of the Second World War and that because of the political climate at the time these matters were not fully or properly investigated; the action that was taken by the Aliens Section of his Department and the Garda Síochána at that time in relation to the suggestion that this country was used as an escape route; if he will comment on reports that Dr. Joseph Mengele lived in this country under an assumed name for approximately six weeks; and if he will make a statement on the matter in the light of the grave public concern caused by these disclosures.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> Such an examination as it has been possible to give to the matters dealt with in the question has not brought to light any record in my Department bearing on them.  That perhaps is not surprising since what is alleged is that an alien came here under an assumed name &mdash; which is not specified &mdash; almost 40 years ago and it must be assumed that if there were any records these would refer only to the assumed name.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, I think that I might be misleading the House if I were to leave matters at that.  If, in fact, available records <Col N="676" /> did contain information on the subject I should certainly have to consider whether it would be proper for me to disclose it, in the context of parliamentary questions or otherwise, having regard to the fact that it concerns, as I have indicated, matters of past history the raking over of which could, moreover, promote public controversy.</P>

Is the Minister aware also that there is a suggestion that a number of other Nazi war criminals escaped Europe through Ireland?  Would he not agree that it is in the public interest that any records either within his Department or with the Garda should be made available and that these matters be not left to rumour or open to suggestions that may not be accurate?</P>

There are substantial arguments against any requirement to establish a <i>prima facie</i> case and it is a requirement that was abandoned as a standard condition by the Extradition Act, 1965.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 16 and 17 together.</P>
      <P>As regards Question No. 16, it is an offence under the Pension Books (Prohibition of Alienation) Act, 1932 as extended by the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, 1935, section 63, the Children's Allowance Act, 1944, section 17, the Social Welfare Act, 1952, section 63 and the Defence Act, 1954, section 263, to take an allowance or pension book as security for a loan.  If a licensed moneylender is shown to have acted in this manner he would risk prosecution as well as refusal of his application for a certificate of fitness on the ground that he was not a &ldquo;fit and proper person to hold a certificate&rdquo;.  I have no evidence that these provisions are inadequate.  No reports of complaints have been made to the Garda or myself of moneylenders holding allowance or pension books as security for loans.</P>
      <P>If, however, any evidence of moneylenders engaging in such practice is brought to the attention of the Garda they will take appropriate action including, if the evidence is sufficient, criminal proceedings.  Accordingly, if the Deputy has any particular case in mind I would invite him to bring it to the notice of the local Garda.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Question No. 17, it is not clear from the question what specific activities the Deputy has in mind.  In this context the Deputy will be aware that I have answered a number of questions in the recent past in relation to various aspects of moneylending.  I refer the <Col N="685" /> Deputy to replies to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 625 &mdash; Volume 354, No. 6, column 1216 &mdash; of 29 November 1984; 640 and 641 &mdash; Volume 355, No. 10, columns 2221 and 2222 &mdash; of 12 February 1985; and 480 &mdash; Volume 355, No. 11, columns 2461 and 2462 &mdash; of 13 February 1985.

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Deputy's precise question was about the use of pension books as security for loans. There is a whole series of provisions in different pieces of legislation which make it an offence to use books such as pension books or children's allowance books as security for loans.  If a licensed moneylender is shown to have acted in this manner by accepting a pension book, he risks prosecution.  It would be a matter of making a complaint and getting him prosecuted.  Obviously that would weigh very heavily in a refusal of his application for a certificate of fitness on the grounds that he was not a fit or proper person to hold a certificate.  I am sure one could be deemed not to be a fit and proper person to hold a certificate in the absence of deemed not to be a fit and proper person to hold a certificate in the absence of criminal proceedings, but some other evidence would have to be shown.</P>

      <P>That is precisely the point I wanted to make.  Can the individual concerned be prohibited from getting a certificate in cases where criminal proceedings have not been taken? The other question is: does this offence <Col N="686" /> with regard to moneylenders also apply to banks such as the major banks and the banking groups giving loans?  Does that prohibition also apply to them &mdash; they cannot take pension books or children's allowance books as security for loans?</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> It does not just apply to moneylenders.  It is an offence under the Pension Books Act, 1932, to take an allowance or pension book as security for a loan.  There is no reference to moneylenders in that.  On the question of fitness to be granted a moneylender's licence, section 6 of the Moneylenders Act, 1933, deals with a certificate required for the grant of a moneylender's licence and specifies the conditions.  I will provide the Deputy with a copy if that would be helpful.</P>

      <P>I have established a committee representing the Garda authorities and my Department and including a specialist in electronics to examine and report on the measures necessary to introduce a system of electronic recording.</P>
      <P>Electronic recording, whether by way of audio tape recording or video recording, would require substantial resources and would have practical implications for the criminal justice system as a whole. The committee will be conducting field trials to enable all the implications to be assessed and to determine how best to introduce the system.

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> A Cheann Comhairle, I propose to take Questions Nos. 21 to 23, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>I have seen the article in question &mdash; an article which does not, I would point out, purport to be more than a summary of the report of the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism published recently.</P>
      <P>I outlined my attitude to this issue in reply to Parliamentary Question No. 17 of 8 March 1984 when I told the House that I was not satisfied that an answer to the problems posed by shortcomings in the operation of security firms was to be found in statutory controls.  Since then the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism has reported on the matter and recommended a statutory system of control.  In view of this, I will have the question looked at again but I think, in fairness, I should say that I am still not convinced that an answer to the problem necessarily lies in a system of statutory control.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the growing number of security firms who are providing a valuable service for society, does the Minister not think that the public interest would be best served by eventually reaching a stage where these firms would be licensed and subject to some form of statutory control?  Otherwise there is an inherent danger that property <Col N="689" /> could be lost as a result of some irregular activities of these firms.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick East) Mr. Noonan (Limerick East)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> One way of approaching it would be to encourage these groups to self-regulate and to have their own professional licensing system. That is the attitude I have been taking up to now.  As I said, the Committee on Crime, Lawlessness and Vandalism recommended statutory control.  The situation in Britain, as announced by the Home Secretary in answer to a parliamentary question in December 1980, is that he and the Secretary of State for Scotland had decided against legislation to regulate the private security industry and had concluded it was preferable to support and encourage self-regulation within the industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Mr. De Rossa Mr. De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Mr. De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>There is little doubt that the whole private security business gives cause for concern.  Does the Minister not agree that there is need for some regulation as to the way these firms dress their personnel in uniforms, many of which are similar to Garda uniforms, and their activities in public places particularly in crowd control and so forth?  There have been reports of private security personnel taking action and assaulting people at public functions.  Does the Minister not feel there is a need to regulate in such a way that it is clear what their rights are and what their responsibilities are?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> We will have security firms with us as a part of modern life for a long time to come. There are two ways of approaching regulation. It can be done by statutory control or it can be done by self-regulation.  I was of the opinion that it would be better to support and encourage self-regulation within the industry so that they would have higher professional standards.  They do not enjoy any immunity from the law above and beyond the rights of any other citizen.  If they operate within the law they are free to operate; and if they contravene any law, whether by wearing a facsimile of a Garda uniform or engage in the activities the Deputy suggests, they <Col N="690" /> would have no protection under the law and they would be liable to prosecution like anybody else.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept that they, like the Garda are constrained by the law.  Would the Minister not accept that in many circumstances where these personnel operate in places which are considered by the public to be public places, such as shopping centres, which in fact are private grounds, that the public in general are unclear as to what their rights are in relation to obeying instructions or being apparently arrested by those people?  Does the Minister not feel that his Department have some responsibility in clarifying what these people are entitled to do?</P>

With regard to the question of security firms operating in shopping centres, it seems to me that if they are impolite and if they are harassing people the public have a choice to shop elsewhere.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 29 together.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that investigations are being conducted at present into allegations that racialist and anti-semitic literature is being produced in this country for distribution here and for transmission outside the State.  On completion of these investigations a report will be submitted for the direction of the DPP if the circumstances so warrant.</P>
      <P>I am aware that racialist and anti-semitic material, purporting to be printed and published in Ireland, has surfaced in Britain from time to time in recent years. However, the fact that printed material designates that it was &ldquo;made in Ireland&rdquo; is, of course, not proof that such is the case and it is believed that a racialist &ldquo;comic-type&rdquo; magazine purporting to be printed and published in Dublin was, in fact, produced abroad.  The Garda are satisfied that the magazine was not produced here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While some preliminary consideration has been given to the question of what <Col N="693" /> legislation might be necessary in this area to give effect to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, it has not been possible to make progress because of the pressure of other urgent legislation.

      <P>I do not think the Minister clearly understood the matter. The position seems to be that the premises in Dublin at 69 Eugene Street are the headquarters of the National Socialist Irish Workers' Party, Nazi group, and are used as a distribution centre.  I do not believe it was suggested that the publications were necessarily printed or published here.  They are distributed from here because they cannot be distributed in Britain as a result of the race relations laws.  We have no similar legislation here and they can freely distribute this type of literature.  It is the distribution of literature of this type which has slogans such as &ldquo;Jews Out of Ireland&rdquo;, &ldquo;My Struggle&rdquo;, &ldquo;Niggers Back to Africa&rdquo;, &ldquo;The Holocaust&rdquo;, &ldquo;Six Million Lives&rdquo;, &ldquo;Hitler was Right&rdquo; and so forth.

      <P>Is the Minister aware that literature under the name of this group has been received by members of the Jewish community in Ireland and has also been received by some black students in Ireland from other countries and that the Garda are of the belief that due to the <Col N="694" /> absence of legislation no proper prosecution can be brought against those distributing or printing such literature or against those who create fear or distress by leaving such literature in places frequented by minority groups in this country? In the light of the concern that the activities of the National Socialist Irish Workers' Party has given rise to, would the Minister agree that, as a matter of urgency, we should have race relations legislation brought into force so that distribution of such literature is made a criminal offence and so that the Garda will have a role in preventing such literature being distributed or printed in Ireland?</P>

      <P>I refer the Deputy to the reply which I gave to Parliamentary Question No. 544 of 21 March 1985 in which I indicated that following the completion of training for divisional and district officers in the methods of establishing and managing schemes of neighbourhood watch, it was the intention to extend the scheme as widely as possible.  Since then training seminars have been completed for officers in the Dublin Metropolitan Area and in Cork, Limerick and Galway.  A publicity campaign on crime prevention measures has just been launched which invites local community groups to initiate schemes of neighbourhood watch in their areas.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> The Revised Estimates for Public Services shows a provision of £214,000 for 1985 under Subhead B.I. of Vote 27 as against a 1984 provisional outturn of £71,000.  A breakdown of these figures is given in a table on page 80 of the Revised Estimates. The table shows that the bulk of the increase is accounted for under the sub-headings &ldquo;Compensation&rdquo;, which provides for £115,000 as against £5,000, and &ldquo;Cleaning services, and laundry&rdquo;, which provides for £47,000 as against £27,000.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Compensation&rdquo; in this context is compensation under section 120 of the Registration of Title Act, 1964, for losses sustained, for example, as a result of errors of registration.  The increased provision reflects the expected level of awards to be met.  Experience so far for 1985 is that an award of £6,500 has been made on foot of one claim and a further claim of £78,000, approximately, plus costs is pending.  There are other possible smaller claims in the pipeline.</P>
      <P>The increase under &ldquo;Cleaning services, and laundry&rdquo;, is due to a number of factors including the loss of the Land Registry's services attendant male cleaner post under the embargo on the filling of posts in the Civil Service.  As a result, more cleaning work is being done under contract in 1985.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 38 and 39 together.</P>
      <P>The arrangements for the disposal of confidential waste in my Department are in accordance with those applying throughout the Civil Service.  There is a contract with a commercial waste disposal company to destroy unwanted confidential papers from its headquarters. The company pulps the paper under the supervision of the Department's staff.  In other offices of the Department, confidential waste is destroyed, usually by shredding or burning, by the staff themselves.</P>
      <P>The finding of papers at Palmerstown was investigated and the indications are that, through a misunderstanding, the papers in question were disposed of as ordinary waste paper.  Appropriate steps have been taken to avoid a recurrence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In view, however, of the reference in one of the questions to confidential files <Col N="700" /> relating to the affairs of members of the prison service and of statements issued to the media to the effect that what occurred had endangered the personal safety and even the lives of the officers concerned, I think it is right to say that the papers in question were not files about officers but signed slips of paper from various members of staff requesting the Finance Branch to make deductions from pay and to transfer the amounts into a savings account.  Although such transactions are of course private and should be treated as such, as they normally are, I doubt that very many people would agree that any possible threat to the safety of officers concerned could have arisen from what occurred.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The question of the safety of officers arose from the fact that the names of officers and the prisons to which they were allocated were also on the documentation and that is where the danger lies in view of the assaults on prison officers recently.  Can the Minister indicate what specific steps have been taken to ensure that documentation in relation to the affairs of prison officers, even in regard to non-confidential matters, are not disposed of on public dumps in future?</P>

I want to make the House, the Minister and, through him, the Government and the public generally aware of the totally unsatisfactory situation in which the relatives of the victims and the injured survivors of the Stardust tragedy find themselves today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no need for me to remind most of the Members of the House of the horror of the Stardust fire, all the suffering, tragedy and unhappiness which <Col N="804" /> was brought in its wake and the way it shattered a small local community.  I want to tell the House, the Minister and the Government that today, four years later, the effects of that tragedy have not been dealt with.  The debt which society owes to the victims has not been paid, justice has not yet been done.</P>
    <P>I want to avail of this Estimate to ask the Minister for Justice and the Government to act to secure justice for this unique, desperately unhappy, unfortunate and neglected group of people.  I have to say &mdash; and I am sure most people agree with me &mdash; that the plight of this group of citizens is a reflection on us all, on our legal system, on the State, on society and on our political institutions. There are two aspects to this matter and the Stardust relatives and their families are equally concerned about both of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not going into the merits, but I am very grateful for your warning.  One of the issues is the question of compensation to the victims and their families.  The second aspect of the matter is the implementation of the fire safety recommendations laid down in the report of the tribunal of inquiry.  I accept that you should not permit me to pursue the second aspect, although the relatives of the Stardust holocaust are very much concerned about that too.  I ask the Minister, as a member of the Government, to take note of the fact that the crucial recommendations in the report are not yet implemented and that action should urgently be taken about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The second issue is that concerning compensation to the victims and their families and it is to that matter that I wish <Col N="805" /> to direct the attention of the House.  The question of compensation comes within the Minister's area of responsibility.  I am sure that the great majority of people would be surprised and indeed horrified to learn that, to date, not one penny of compensation has been paid to any of the relatives or the victim survivors of the Stardust fire.  Not alone have they not received compensation of any kind, but there is no immediate indication that compensation will be paid within the foreseeable future.  Furthermore, many of these families are now being asked to pay a sum of £1,000 each on foot of costs. Most of us would have to accept that that is a total absurdity and it makes a mockery of our system of justice.  This whole matter should have been settled long ago and compensation should have been paid by now, but instead of receiving compensation these unfortunate families and individuals&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy were talking about the delay in having the cases disposed of, that would be in order; but he is referring to the delay in paying compensation, which seems to be anticipating the result of the hearing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad you found it necessary to intervene to make that fine distinction; but, in deference to you, I will talk from now on about the delay in dealing with the cases and, as a result of the delay, paying whatever compensation would arise from a settlement of the cases.  In the interests of justice, sanity and humanity, the State, through the <Col N="806" /> instrument of the Government and the Minister for Justice, should act now through some of its agencies to deal with the absurd situation of these families.</P>
      <P>Some families, in their desperation, have formed a committee to try to get to grips with the problem, and to go over the efforts which that committee has made in recent times is a study of frustration. They wrote to the Minister, the Attorney General, their own legal adviser, the li = "2" fli = "-1"President of the High Court and the Taoiseach and the result, so far, has been nothing but a complete run around.</P>
      <P>The Minister will be entitled to ask me what do I suggest might be done at this stage.  I should like to put a few proposals to him.  I suggest that he accept in principle that he should act, that he should intervene.  I am aware that in reply to a letter from a member of the committee he indicated that he did not think a meeting with the members of the committee would be appropriate.  After due consideration I ask him to reverse that decision and to take this matter aboard as Minister for Justice, the person to whom we must ultimately look to secure justice for our citizens.</P>
      <P>Secondly, I should like to point out that in the Estimate before us there are sums of money allocated for two specific purposes, £1.4 million for civil legal aid and £4 million for compensation for personal injuries maliciously inflicted.  On the civil legal aid side I should like to ask the Minister to go carefully into considering whether funds from that scheme could be made available to enable these families complete these cases.  That would at least get us rid of this absurd situation where families are now, four years later, being asked to pay out £1,000 instead of receiving money.  One might as well ask some of the families for £1 million as ask them for £1,000.  Certainly, none of them has £1,000 in reserve.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter I should like to ask the Minister to look at is in regard to the £4 million provided in the Estimate for the criminal injuries fund.  I accept that for these funds to go in that direction would mean a complete change around, it would mean dropping their cases in the ordinary <Col N="807" /> courts and going before the tribunal but I should like to ask the Minister, having examined the matter, to ask some law officer to steer these families, without any access to private legal aid, through that tribunal as quickly as possible and get them the compensation to which they are entitled through that fund, if that is regarded as feasible.  There is a precedent for that.  The Minister will be aware that in the case of ground rents the county registrar is delegated by law to help people buy out their ground rents.  I suggest to the Minister that he carefully consider some such mechanism for processing these cases through the tribunal for compensation for criminal injuries.</P>
    <P>I may be asked if these cases would succeed before that tribunal.  I do not know but I am aware that the report of the tribunal of inquiry did find that the fire was maliciously started.  I understand that some individuals have taken claims for malicious injury against Dublin Corporation and succeeded on that basis. There is a <i>prima facie</i> case to go before the tribunal on the basis that the injuries were maliciously inflicted because it has been established, as far as I understand, that the Stardust fire was maliciously started.</P>
    <P>Another approach I ask the Minister to consider &mdash; this is one very much favoured by the families and their relatives &mdash; is the question of establishing a special court or holding a special sitting of the High Court to deal expeditiously with these cases.  The committee wrote to the President of the High Court and received a very courteous reply but within the parameters of the existing position there is very little he can do to help.  That is the implication of the letter he sent to the committee.  In the course of that letter he said that he appreciated the desire of the committee that their cases should be brought to a speedy conclusion but he went on to say that as far as he was aware no application had yet been made to the court on behalf of any of the parties in these cases to have a date fixed for hearing. I do not know how the Chair's <i>sub <Col N="808" /> judice</i> ruling stands up in the light of that sentence but I will waive that point.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am concerned with &mdash; I know the Chair shares my wish &mdash; is that anything we do in the House should be to help and protect these families.  The courteous letter which the President of the High Court sent to the committee seemed to indicate that as far as getting the cases dealt with quickly and expeditiously was concerned there was not a great deal he could do to help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that he look into the matter to see whether it would be possible to have a judge of the High Court set aside, or some special division of the High Court established, as a once off measure, to deal with these cases.  The Minister, and other Deputies, may say that that would be a unique thing to do but it must be remembered that we are dealing with a unique matter.  The Stardust tragedy was unique in many ways. It was unique in the size of the tragedy, in the number of people who died and in the extent of the injuries suffered by a large number of other victims.  It was unique in that it was a tragedy concentrated on young people and on a small local community.  It shattered that community. My appeal to the Minister is to treat it as unique and if, in order to get the cases dealt with quickly, there have to be some special arrangements, some special sittings, some special divisions or a special allocation of a judge of the High Court I hope he will not hesitate to introduce them.  What is happening is becoming a scandal.  It is becoming a reflection <Col N="809" /> on us, on our society and, indeed, on our political institutions.  Certainly, it is becoming a reflection on our system of legal justice.</P>
    <P>Something must be done.  In my view these people are entitled as of right to action.  If the Chair did not prevent me saying so I would say that they are entitled as of right to compensation but I accept that I should not attempt to prejudge the cases in that regard.  However, the people are certainly entitled to a speedy settlement of their claim.  That is not happening.  Just four years after the tragedy the position is practically the same as it was immediately following the occurrence.</P>
    <P>I want to say to the House, to the Minister and to the Government, that the situation cannot be let linger any longer. This group of citizens, through no fault of their own, find themselves in the situation in which they are today.  We cannot leave them there feeling bitter, disillusioned and, as they would say if you were talking to them, with a dreadful feeling that nobody cares about them, that the State does not care about them, that their own country has no interest in them or their fate.  We cannot allow that to continue. I believe we owe it to ourselves in this Parliament and the legal system owes it to us as a community to take the situation aboard and deal with it.</P>
    <P>If legislation is needed to deal with any of the methods I have put before the Minister, he knows he only has to ask us and we will put the legislation through in one day.  There is no difficulty or impediment that would hold up the special type of court arrangements I am talking about, or access to the criminal injuries compensation fund or the civil legal aid fund that a Bill put through this House quickly cannot eliminate.  The Minister knows it is only a matter of asking us and we will expedite any such legislation through the House.  He will have our full co-operation if he introduces legislation of this kind.</P>
    <P>I apologise to you, Sir, for perhaps taking up what many might regard as an undue length of time dealing with one specific matter on a general Estimate of <Col N="810" /> this kind, but it does provide me and the House with an opportunity to act to remedy a very serious injustice in our society today.  Many of the survivors are still ill or in need of medical attention; many of them are unemployed and some of them will probably never really work again; many of the families are very seriously underprivileged or barely above subsistence level; they are psychologically wounded and they feel helpless and abandoned.  This is the sort of situation in which this House should intervene when a group of our citizens feel like that.</P>
    <P>We often talk about making this House relevant to the current situation and to the people's needs and requirements.  We often talk about making our democracy better.  This is a case where this House can confound all its critics, can be seen to be responsive to the needs of the people, and particularly a deprived group.  Once the matter is brought to our notice and the full tragedy of the situation is understood, this House, through its instrument, the Government, will be seen to act quickly and expeditiously to get this matter settled, to take this load off the backs of these families, to get them the compensation they may be entitled to and, above all else to get this horrible feeling of injustice and neglect from which they are suffering removed.</P>

While it is true that crime is at an unprecedented <Col N="811" /> level, he turned around and made apologies for some of these criminals when he said unemployment was a reason for many of these crimes being committed.  To a degree he is right.  Unemployment is a factor but it can never be accepted as an excuse for people committing crimes. The majority of unemployed people do not commit crimes.  Therefore I cannot and never will be able to accept that people commit crime because they are unemployed.  Sadly, unemployment is a fact of life we will have to live with in the years to come.  There are 14 million people unemployed in Europe and that figure is likely to climb as automation and technology continue to take their toll.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hyland suggested that the greatest problem in the country was the abuse of alcohol and asked the Government to drop their proposals to extend the licensing hours.  I would like to add my voice in asking that the Government drop that ridiculous proposal.  One of the greatest problems in this country is the abuse of alcohol.  There is something in the Irish character which is attracted to alcohol and we are paying a fearful price for it.  The fastest rising statistic is the number of female alcoholics in Ireland, people who have ready access to alcohol through the various take-away outlets provided by supermarkets and so on.  This has spread to school boys and school girls drinking at frighteningly young ages. There is hardly a family who have not been touched by the ravages of drink. Every Deputy will be aware of the problem associated with drink &mdash; battered wives, sometimes battered husbands, neglected children, hungry children, children who are deprived because of parents' addiction to drink.  I fear the increased number of problems which will arise from extended licensing hours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allied to the alcohol problem is the drug problem which is in its infancy here at present but within the next ten or 15 years is likely to pose problems on a par with that of alcohol.  For people who traffic in drugs, particularly hard drugs, no punishment is severe enough. <Col N="812" /> I implore the Minister to ensure that all persons convicted of drug offences get no parole from jail and suggest that they be given hard labour.  I could recommend another possible sentence but I know that it would not be implemented.  People who traffic in drugs, causing terrible human misery for young impressionable people, should be shown no mercy.  Those who traffic particularly in heroin should be given life sentences, again with hard labour.</P>
    <P>There are many other problems associated with crime and the amount of £300 million is surely frightening.  However, I would not quibble at any amount expended on fighting crime.  The battle to restore law and order is being lost because of the liberal influences which have crept into society.  Contrary to what other Deputies have suggested, it is not out of deprivation that people commit crime, but because of the prevailing affluence. It is a sad reflection on society today that the Government of the day, the Minister for Justice, the Garda authorities and prison officers are at variance with each other.</P>
    <P>For some of the Opposition speakers to have suggested that the current spread of crime is in some way attributable to the present Government is ludicrous.  This problem did not manifest itself over a couple of years.  It has been growing for many years.  All parties can be indicted with the exception of your party, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for their failure to recognise the problem in its embryonic stages.  It has now grown into the greatest problem facing the man in the street. Crime and unemployment are the only issues.  Social legislation is a non-issue except possibly in the media.  The full resources and the strength of the Government should be directed to combating crime.  Otherwise it will escalate out of all proportion and at the end of this century we will have horrific crime.  I fear that the will to reinstate law and order is not there.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies caused delays in the passage of the Criminal Justice Bill through the House over the last year. This Bill was something which the entire <Col N="813" /> country felt was necessary.  For the most part these Deputies were lawyers who are all absent today and none of whom has spoken.  Perhaps they recognise that they were out of touch with reality and I hope that is the case.</P>
    <P>Several Deputies advocated the growth of the community neighbourhood watch, but I am not too happy about that.  It is the duty and the function of the Government to uphold law and order, through the agency of the Garda Síochána or, possibly, the Army.  The community neighbourhood watch is not wholly desirable.  It could lead to excesses and to extremists taking the law into their own hands.  I would rather advocate the creation of a police reserve as a backup to the Garda Síochána.  In that context, I congratulate the Garda Síochána on the excellent work they are doing.  It is the politicians who are mainly responsible for the present sad state of law and order. They failed to recognise a growing problem and to take realistic action.  That is the root of the problem, not the Garda Síochána or a lack of commitment.</P>
    <P>I particularly congratulate the Garda Síochána in the Dundalk and Border region for the great work that they have done over the last 15 years in erecting protection, with the Army, for the Border town of Dundalk.  Dundalk is a town of 27,000 people which has sadly suffered a bombing fatality, but only one, and which is again in possible danger following the lunatic comments in the Northern Assembly of men like George Seawright and George Graham.  After the recent horrific killing of nine people in Newry, these men called for reprisal attacks on Border towns, specifically Dundalk.  It is a great tribute to the Garda Síochána that Dundalk has come practically unscathed through the 17 years of savage fighting in Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>However, the Garda are not above criticism and would do well to accept constructive criticism.  I suggest to the Minister that a six weeks' training period in Templemore for a boy of 17 or 18 years is entirely inadequate and after such a short term he is let out on the streets, <Col N="814" /> possibly on his own, which is wrong. These young people should be given up to a year's training and be taught a certain amount of discretion and courtesy.  Many of them lack those qualities.  Recently I was involved, for the first time in my life, in an altercation in Drogheda in which three young members of the force showed a total lack of courtesy, not only towards me but towards the position I hold as Member of the Parliament in Dáil Éireann.</P>
    <P>I deplore the £186 million spent in protecting the Border.  I indict the IRA for causing that money to be spent year after year and in addition the terrible damage which they do economically to our country and in particular to my town of Dundalk. For 17 years until recently, Dundalk had not had investment because of its proximity to the Border.  The amount of £186 million is a horrific sum for a country of our size, having a population of less than 3.5 million.  This is yet another way in which these armchair Republicans are hurting this country.</P>
    <P>The onus of security should be borne more heavily by Britain, who are the cause of our problems.  Last Monday I had occasion to go out to Courtbane where an incursion by the British Army took place.  The media described it as an incursion, but I would describe it as an invasion in which up to 40 or 50 armed soldiers came into County Louth to the extent of 400 yards within the Border. These then had the audacity to issue a statement that this was due to a map reading error.  This is an insult to the Irish nation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>That at 11 o'clock in the morning almost a regiment of men only a few fields from the barracks of Crossmaglen would encroach to that extent and had to be stopped by the presence of four gardaí in a car is astounding. That they could claim it was due to a map reading error defies logic.  The Border is clearly identifiable in that region as it is divided by the Courtbane River.  That Scottish regiment have been resident for several months in the Border area and <Col N="815" /> they knew exactly where the Border was situated.  Yet, they came in in defiance of the Garda Síochána and our soldiers because they are not prepared to rely on Garda surveillance and they searched several derelict houses.  As a result of what they did they alienated everyone living in that region.</P>
      <P>One of the reasons why many young people are attracted to violence in the Border regions is because of the excesses of these people.  I ask the Minister for Justice and the Taoiseach to take positive measures against a repetition of these invasions or incursions.  They number over 90 in the past few years and they are not acceptable.</P>
      <P>The only way to stop anything is to have deterrents.  I am asking that these men be arrested and detained by the forces of law and order and charged in an Irish court of law.  It is an offence in this country to carry weapons and if the law is to mean anything it must be upheld. These people should be charged in an Irish court.  If that should happen, they would take bloody good care to ensure that they did not come in again.</P>
      <P>The jails in this country are a matter that need examination.  It is one area where politicians have been complacent during the years.  They failed to recognise a problem that is now out of control.  No Government, either Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil, had the foresight to see what was likely to happen and the prison building programme was not implemented early enough to ensure that prison accommodation would be available when needed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The prisons I have seen are not my idea of a prison.  When people go to jail having transgressed against society, they should be placed in spartan conditions, not in rest homes, guesthouses or grade 3 hotels.  My idea of prison is a penitentiary where people are not ill-treated but where the going is so rough that when they come out of prison they make a mental resolve not to go back to jail. They should be treated reasonably well, fed three times a day and given a book to read.  They should not be given sauna baths, snooker tables, colour television <Col N="816" /> sets which they break up occasionally in riots or any of the so-called cultural requisites. I would not worry too much about providing educational facilities because most of the prisoners are recidivists.  They return to jail and why not when they can avail of rest homes of the quality we are providing.  There is an urgent need to continue with the jail building programme.  We should not spare any money in this area.  If every county needs a jail let us build them.  However, we should have buildings where spartan conditions obtain and to which people will not want to return.</P>
    <P>The jury system should be abolished.  It is responsible for many of our problems. Most jurors have no experience of law and many have not the education necessary to make proper judgments.  The jury system is archaic and should be abolished.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I support some of the points made by Deputy McGahon, in particular his strong plea to the Government to insist that our integrity as a nation be protected and vindicated.  For too long British forces have invaded our territory. Even in my own period as Minister for Foreign Affairs this happened but not on the same scale as the recent event.  These incidents were always excused as being map-reading errors or something similar. If we want to demonstrate to our own people that we have authority over and an obligation in respect of our own jurisdiction, clearly we must demonstrate to another Government that deliberate instances of this kind cannot be tolerated. If we do not do that our own authority will be undermined in the face of highhanded actions by the forces of another Government.  I will not dwell on this particular incident any longer but I am convinced that the case referred to by Deputy McGahon &mdash; and he has considerable experience of this in his area &mdash; is not accidental.  It is time we indicated that this kind of invasion of our territory will not be tolerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Whatever actions we take, whether it be police action, prison action or court action, they are no substitute for the <Col N="817" /> development of standards and good conduct in society.  That is the best guarantee of a good social order.  In everything we say and do in this House and elsewhere the most effective and best approach is that based on decency and common concern for all our citizens.  Only when we demonstrate that in everything we do, in our legislation, in our programmes and in what we do and say, will we get the kind of society for which our independence was achieved.  I often think, was it for this that the Wild Geese fled, was it for this that the sacrifices were made, to have the kind of society we are talking about now?  The people who gave us all our opportunities were people of deep conviction and human concern.  They looked to the future to build a nation of which all of us could be proud.  We have a long way to go.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the symptoms of the problem is not enough: we will not solve it until we bring about a degree of social awareness and decency.  Then, there will not be a need for the degree of punishment, imprisonment and the court sanctions we are witnessing today.  There has been a serious and dramatic change in the entire social order.  Unless those of us who are better off can demonstate our concern particularly for the old, the sick and the unemployed, we will not be able to promote the standards that are necessary and desirable.  We spend all of our time here talking about additional gardaí, prisons and more punishment but at the end of the day we will not achieve the kind of social order and stability that is necessary.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister said that poverty and social deprivation have a lot to do with crime and that by and large persons involved in crime come from underprivileged backgrounds.  It is time we acknowledged that but that is not to say that everyone who is impoverished or who comes from an underprivileged background is involved in crime.  It is to say, though, that the pressures which lead to crime arise from social deprivation. The most recent example of this was the horrific event in Brussels last week <Col N="818" /> because to a considerable extent that derived from areas such as the north of England especially where there is no dignity because there is no work and where the only outlet is a rejection of authority. We must recognise that linkage and being to deal with the causes.  For that reason the most important role of the Government is to try to ensure that for our people there is the dignity of work and the promotion of a proper environment in which to live and work.  That is the best way, the only way of dealing with today's problems. Economic policies are essential but I shall not go into that in detail.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Suffice it to say that recent indications from the OECD and other organisations in respect of our tax system and all that area indicate that we are on the wrong track.  I hope we will put matters right because otherwise we will be in these difficulties for a long time.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that he refrain from using the word &ldquo;thugs&rdquo; when referring to offenders though one notes that that is the term used in this respect, too, by the Garda and the courts.  The word is offensive.  These offenders may be totally unacceptable to us because of their behaviour.  Everything they do or say may be contrary to the standards we are anxious to promote but for a Minister to use such a rejectionist type term as this Minister has done not once but many times, is to invite further reaction and rejection of authority.  The law exists to deal with offenders and once they have been apprehended and convicted they must be made aware that the programme to deal with them will be sensitive.  Those of us who have had the privilege of education and of relative wealth should be very conscious of making any collective condemnation of offenders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If at the end of the day there is not a proper penal system, the entire system falls apart.  In recent times our penal system has been found to be totally inadequate. I do not regard the penal system as being a case merely of locking people <Col N="819" /> behind doors and rendering them more socially inadequate than was the case before their conviction.  Obviously we must protect society from people who are not capable of accepting their responsibility in society.  That is the first obligation but equally we must do everything possible by way of education and rehabilitation programmes during the period of detention to make up for the deprivation that many of these people have suffered throughout their lives.  Are we prepared to ignore the fact that there are some children who are born into a criminal environment, so to speak?  Are we in our comfortable homes and with our comfortable families to judge as thugs those deprived children?  The offences they commit may well be thuggery but as I am aware from my work in court, we should be careful before referring to them as thugs.</P>
    <P>There are two facts staring us in the face in relation to the prison programme. I do not envisage that programme merely as the locking up of people behind bars. First, due to the very mistaken Government decisions that the Government have been taking since their return to office, more than 1,000 persons are being released prematurely each year from the prison system.  That is wrong.  It undermines the Garda, the courts and society. What is the point in apprehending offenders, putting them through the legal process and sentencing them if they must be released within a short time because of the lack of accommodation?  That situation is unacceptable and must be corrected.</P>
    <P>Because of the inadequacy of our prison accommodation, education services have been discontinued.  That is shameful and should not have been allowed happen but in addition there are now multiple occupied cells which were intended exclusively to provide only single accommodation which is no longer feasible because of the lack of accommodation. It is not a fitting way to run the prison system.  The problems that arise in that sort of situation are likely to render prisoners less adequate to cope socially <Col N="820" /> on their release from prison than was the case when they were detained.</P>
    <P>The Government deliberately halted an essential four prison development programme for which more than £15 million was being provided in 1982.  I was Minister for Finance when we sanctioned that programme.  I was convinced then in 1980 of the necessity for it.  Perhaps that decision was due to inexperience or to a lack of awareness of the significance of the programme but we are now suffering the consequences.  The four prisons were to have been at Portlaoise, Cork and Wheatfield.  Two were to have been provided at the latter location but none was intended simply for the detention of people behind iron bars.  They were to be much more than that, but to a considerable extent the money has been wasted. The original target was that the programme would be completed by 1985-86 and I am sure the Minister's officials will be able to confirm that but now we are talking about the possibility of the programme being concluded by the year 1989-90 that is, if it is proceeded with at all.  That shortsighted decision to postpone the programme is undermining our courts, the Garda and the prison officers.</P>
    <P>The Minister distinguishes between people released on parole and about whom the Garda and the courts are not consulted and others released by way of remission but about whom the Garda and the courts should be consulted.  Regardless of whether we use the term parole orearly remission, people are being allowed out of prison early and not for any good social reason.  They are being released early solely because the Government have failed to provide adequate prison accommodation.  That is a terrible indictment.</P>
    <P>I hope what I have said will be seen as recognising our first responsibility here, to get at the conditions that create crime and the pressures on underprivileged families particularly in a criminal environment.  That is the first obligation. I hope we do that.  If we reach the stage that we do not provide adequate custodial accommodation, which this Government have failed to provide, because of the <Col N="821" /> dual impact of lack of employment and social depression of a kind that is unprecedented, we are almost guaranteeing that the conditions about which we now complain will become chronic in the foreseeable future.</P>

      <P>Deputy Haughey raised a very serious matter in regard to the Stardust tragedy that occurred just over four years ago.  I want to outline briefly some matters I have noticed in recent years.  Local authorities have made serious efforts to ensure that a tragedy such as the Stardust one does not recur. However, a number of dancehalls, discos and public places which people of all ages frequent still have their exits barricaded and locked.  The Garda and fire officers should be more vigilant in this respect and attend a number of places where such functions take place, inspecting them while functions are in progress.  The locking of such exits is a very serious matter. There will have to be serious action on the part of officers of the law to ensure that any public building the exits of which are locked or barricaded is immediately closed down.  There has been one tragedy and there will be others unless action is taken to ensure that these places are inspected regularly by the appropriate authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point I wanted to make is in regard to the discussions that have taken place in regard to the Garda Síochána.  I notice that the report published recently mentions foot drill and &ldquo;square bashing&rdquo;. It is important that there continue to be considerable discipline taught to the Garda.  They need to be superbly fit and to have a sense of discipline.  They need considerable physical training whether that be military style or otherwise.  I must confess that I am not happy with their present method of training.  A six month <Col N="822" /> period of initial training is important, as is a year's probation, followed by a final period of six months which would probably be sufficient.</P>
    <P>I might deal very briefly with the bringing of cases before the District Court. The Minister has made considerable progress in regard to the bringing of cases to the High Court.  I am concerned at the serious delay in preparing books of evidence by the Garda Síochána and then by the Chief State Solicitor in cases being brought to the District Court.  It is vital that there be greater expedition in the preparation of these books of evidence. This matter has been the cause of major controversy between District Justice Delap and the Director of Public Prosecutions and some cases have been struck off the list because of the failure of the latter to have these books of evidence prepared.  The Minister will have to devise some method to ensure that such delays are obviated.  But personal criticism of the Director of Public Prosecutions by District Justice Delap is wrong&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="TomEnright" hpid="Mr. Enright Mr. Enright">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Enright</NameTxt>
      <P>Such personal attacks by a district justice are unjustified and wrong.  This House will have to take a serious view of any district justice who continues to make such personal attacks. If they continue I shall feel obliged to raise the matter in the House and to have that district justice removed from office. It is totally wrong to have such personal attacks made on the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Nevertheless it is important that constructive efforts be made to ensure that books of evidence are prepared in time and cases heard in the normal course.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I should like to thank Deputies for their constructive contributions to this debate.  Their comments will be fully considered in the context of policy and in relation to the day-to-day <Col N="823" /> operation of the work and services provided for in the Votes we have been debating.  Certainly I shall take on board the constructive points made by many Deputies of all parties here.</P>
      <P>It is a coincidence that I have been on Question Time for the last four days and that my Department's Estimate debate should occur now.  In effect, most of the points that have been raised have already been dealt with in the very large number of questions to which I have replied over the last four days.  I shall not go over the same ground again simply to fill in time.</P>
      <P>I think the House is aware that my principal responsibilities are in the area of the Garda Síochána, the prisons and the courts but I also have responsibility for legislation.  Deputies are aware of the commitments I have given on legislation, the legislation which has been passed and the state of Bills before the House.</P>
      <P>I should like to comment briefly on crime prevention and then to go on to take up individual points made by Deputies. Finally, I should like to give an initial response to the very serious matter raised by Deputy Haughey this afternoon.</P>
      <P>I have been saying for some time that we should concentrate more of our resources on crime prevention.  In this respect I have used a simple enough argument but I think it is one with which most of the public would agree.  Once a crime is committed there is an injured party, there is a victim, there is a car stolen, there is a house burgled.  All the concentration of the resources of the State are then invoked to bring the offender to justice.  The Garda are called to the scene, they investigate it, if their investigation is successful they prepare the book of evidence which is sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, he issues proceedings, when the matter is taken to court, through the courts &mdash; there may be free legal aid or not &mdash; and eventually somebody goes to prison.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the whole process of criminal law there are two things that are very striking and which are common to all offences. First, there is an injured party and there is a victim.  Little can be done by the <Col N="824" /> process of bringing the offender to justice to compensate the victim.  Second, all the initiatives of the criminal justice system take place at very substantial cost to the taxpayer.  Deputies will be aware from the global figure of the Department and from individual Votes that the Garda cost money, the courts cost money and the prisons cost money, a lot of money, and it is the taxpayers who must pay.  If we could concentrate more of our resources on crime prevention we would have no victim, no injured party and we would not have the costly process of the criminal justice system.  That is why I would like to advocate again in the House that communities, especially in urban areas, get involved in the new neighbourhood watch scheme which has been launched nationwide.  I should like all of us to support the Garda Commissioner in his initiative in this crime prevention area.</P>
    <P>There is tremendous merit in crime prevention.  It is particularly effective and has been found to be so in dealing with the type of crime which is causing us most concern at present.  For example, problems of attacks on old people in the west.  The best method of dealing with that is that neighbours would look after neighbours, people would be aware of strangers in their locality, that there would be a system whereby there would be neighbourly community checks on old people to ensure that they are safe, that there would be a contact system built up through scattered rural areas where people live in isolated places.  That will prevent it.  This would be the case also in urban areas, where one of the main problems is that of larceny and burglary. There are certain houses which are more vulnerable than others.  It is a matter of general knowledge now that if two people are out working their house is more vulnerable to a burglar during the day than if there were somebody at home.  If somebody is living alone and he or she goes out, that house is more vulnerable to burglary.  Houses in suburban areas or in semi-rural environments on the edges of cities &mdash; because of the general belief that they have more disposable consumer <Col N="825" /> goods in them &mdash; are more vulnerable to burglars than other houses.</P>
    <P>Neighbourhood watch schemes can identify the premises most vulnerable and the people most vulnerable.  Neighbour helping neighbour in co-operation with the Garda Síochána can be effective in preventing crime.  Deputy Hyland gave a commitment of support and co-operation in the fight against crime, and I welcome that.  The Deputy spoke about the £11.5 million voted for prisons in 1984 and the fact that only £5.5 million was spent.  The Deputy suggested that that indicated a lack of commitment.  The fact that only £5.5 million was spent was not an indication of a lack of commitment to bring our prison accomodation up to planned levels.  These sums related mainly to the prison in Wheatfield, which is on target. The money was not spent because certain contracts did not fall to be paid before the end of the year.  It was intended to commence construction of a place of detention for male juveniles at Wheatfield early in 1984.  In order to make the most of the good weather financial provision was made for a full year's building work in the Vote.  In view of the need for more accommodation it was decided to construct an expanded plan which would provide 320 places rather than the orginal 150.  This caused some delay because it was necessary to revise the working drawings and adjust the tender documents.  As a result the contract was not placed until just before the builders' holidays.  Large scale work did not commence until September and much less expenditure than anticipated arose.  The work is on target and is due for completion towards the end of 1987.  Perhaps the later start in 1984 will be more than compensated for by doubling the accommodation provided.</P>
    <P>The James' Street project was referred to.  I intended to acquire a residence used by the Christian Brothers in James' Street.  There was local opposition to it and the property was withdrawn from sale.  The project was not abandoned by me.  The matter was taken out of my <Col N="826" /> hands because the religious order involved refused to go ahead with the sale because of local opposition.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland suggested that I am reacting to events in dealing with crimes which were a symptom and that I was not getting to the root causes.  There is nothing to add to what I said in my speech this morning.  I accept that there is a relationship between crime and people living in underprivileged areas, but while we are waiting for economic and social improvements we have to deal with the symptom.  We must invoke the courts, the Garda and the prisons to deal with the criminal manifestations, whatever the root causes.  I accept that we cannot ignore the root causes.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland is opposed to the liberalisation of the licensing laws and referred to newspaper reports of 6 June regarding a submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Legislation on the question of drink abuse and to the amendment of the intoxicating liquor laws.  I intend fulfilling the decision taken by the Government in the national plan. I will give licences to high grade restaurants under certain restrictive conditions. I intend proposing to the Government that licensed premises should remain open until 11 p.m. on Sunday night all year round and that there should be some extension in June, July and August as outlined in the national plan.  I do not know what the Government will decide on that but I am thinking of a modest extension in opening time.  That is not the end of the matter.  I have major proposals in hand for a Bill to amend the licensing laws which range over the whole area of under age drinking, clubs, endorsements and the whole area relating to drink about which representations have been made.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland suggested that Garda manpower was being reduced in rural areas.  It is not, but the numbers in the DMA have increased by over 600 in the same period.  The numbers in rural areas are being kept up.</P>
    <P>Deputy Walsh complained of a delay in the provision of a new station for Tallaght. The Deputy will appreciate that the provision of Garda stations is a matter <Col N="827" /> for the OPW.  The arrangements for the provision of a new station in Tallaght are at an advanced stage.  I understand that the OPW have received tenders for the building of the new station and are processing those as quickly as possible and there will not be a delay in placing the contract.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon referred to the idea of a police reserve.  I do not have plans to establish a police reserve.  I am concentrating on identifying tasks that can be performed by civilians.</P>
    <P>I have dealt with the major points raised by the Opposition spokesmen.  A number of other points were made which were dealt with during Question Time or in my speech this morning.</P>
    <P>The matter raised by Deputy Haughey is the most serious matter raised in this debate today.  We have tremendous sympathy for the victims of the Stardust fire and for Deputy Haughey, who I know was sincere in his contribution here today.  The Deputy urged that special provision be made for the Stardust victims and their dependants and made three recommendations for examination &mdash; that I should accept the principle that I should intervene in the process of determining their claims for compensation; that I should re-examine both the civil legal aid scheme and the scheme of compensation for criminal injuries with a view to assisting them in steering their way through the procedures; and that I should, by way of legislation if necessary, bring about special sittings of the High Court to this end.</P>
    <P>The matters raised by Deputy Haughey are not only complex but touch on fundamental issues of constitutional law affecting the separation of the Judiciary and the Executive.  In the time available to me I can only undertake to have these questions examined as a matter of urgency.  I should make it clear that this does not imply any commitment on my part.  In the limited time since Deputy Haughey's contribution I have been informed that 219 writs in all were issued, 108 statements of claim were filed and that the State has delivered a defence in <Col N="828" /> 79 of these.  One case started in February of 1984 has gone through the process and a notice of trail has been received.  If it were acceptable, and without commitment, that this would be seen as a test case for liability, that might be a way of expediting matters in the other 219 cases. I would ask Deputy Haughey to consider that.  Both the Deputy and the House will appreciate that this is an initial response as I had very little time to get a detailed reply to the points made by the Deputy. We all share the Deputy's concern and we should bend our will and our minds to seeking to solve this problem because, as the Deputy pointed out, if all other systems fail this House is the last resort and the Government must be the instrument of this House in providing justice. I accept what Deputy Haughey said and hope that we can as a result of his intervention come up with some process which will expedite things for the people involved in litigation and which will bring them to justice in a shorter period than if we had not had Deputy Haughey's intervention.</P>

      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before Dáil Éireann on 28 November 1984.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If it is strong, the principle of equality must be constantly upheld and brought up to date.  This entails constant vigilance as regards the relevance and reasonableness of the range of exceptions permitted.  In the sphere of equality legislation, it is undoubtedly the exception which proves the rule, and determines its strength.  The Employment Equality Act, 1977, makes specific provision for the review of protective laws when the concern for protection which originally inspired them is no longer well founded.  The law has a special role to play both as a reflection and an instrument of change. It acts as a reflection because the law always lags behind the social change which precedes it and which it embodies.</P>

      <P>If a response to the crisis of human tragedy is slower than humanity <Col N="831" /> and passion demand, we should respond as quickly as possible to the emotions that are being displayed in this House.</P>
      <P>To return to the motion, the law is also an instrument which serves to promote social objectives and to combat the forces of inertia embedded in traditional work culture and patterns of behaviour.</P>
      <P>Section 14 of the Employment Equality Act recognises that certain requirements in four Acts administered by my Department may in effect be forcing employers, by law, to discriminate against women in employment.  It accordingly empowers the Minister for Labour to repeal or amend any such requirement by Affirmative Order.  In addition to my proposals for amending the original equal pay and employment equality statutes, I intend to make use of these powers to effect further changes by order wherever desirable.  The additional measures will effect necessary changes in the provisions of the Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, and modify the blanket exclusion of certain significant occupations from the coverage of the equality legislation.</P>
      <P>The purpose of this measure is to modify certain provisions in the Mines and Quarries Act, 1965.  Subsection (1) of section 107 prohibits the employment of females below ground in a mine, and section 110 restricts the employment of women at night at a mine.  These provisions have outlived their usefulness and, in the words of the 1977 Act, are nowadays &ldquo;likely to affect or impede the elimination of discrimination in relation to employment or the promotion of equality of opportunity between men and women in relation to employment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>On the basis of a review of these provisions undertaken in my Department and the views of industrial, professional and other representative bodies which have been communicated to me, I propose with the approval of the House, to make an appropriate Order under section 14 of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The draft order before the House today, proposes to abolish the restriction on the employment of women at night in <Col N="832" /> mines.  The draft order also removes the prohibition on women working underground in a range of professional occupations which may require practical experience of underground work (for example some management or training posts), or involve spending an amount of time underground.  This category includes specialists in fields such as radiology, geology and medical personnel.  Female students in these disciplines who, as part of their courses may require `work experience' in underground work in mines and who, up to now, have been effectively barred from such experience, will also benefit from the change effected by this order.</P>
    <P>As regards the total abolition of restrictions on the employment of women underground, we are constrained by ILO Convention No. 45 which Ireland ratified in 1936.  The Convention forbids the employment of females on underground work in a mine; it does, however, provide that national laws or regulations, may exempt certain categories of females employed in non-manual work.  In this instance, therefore, the proposed order would allow those categories of women to work below ground.  To remove the ban completely on women working underground in mines would require Ireland to denounce ILO Convention No. 45, and the earliest this could be done would be in the year commencing 31 May 1987.  In the meantime, I will be giving further consideration to the desirability of following this course of action.</P>
    <P>As required by the Act, I have consulted the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the Federated Union of Employers about this proposal and neither body has raised any objection.  The modification has also been welcomed by the Employment Equality Agency and the Council for the Status of Women, whom I have also consulted, and by the Working Party on Women's Affairs and Family Law Reform in their recently published recommendations <i>Agenda for Practical Action.</i></P>
    <P>The draft order requires the prior approval of each House of the Oireachtas <Col N="833" /> by way of Affirmative Resolution, and I request the Dáil to express such approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this draft order and the commitment of the Minister to remove obstacles to women in employment which in the past may have been an advantage to them but now are a disadvantage and a disincentive.  I look forward to the introduction of any further legislation that may be needed to remove the obstacles still remaining and the discrimination particularly with regard to age limits and social welfare.  I know <Col N="834" /> there are not particularly the Minister's responsibility but I want to include them on the record.  I hope that the Minister will in the near future come in and give us a programme not only of removing obstacles but also of firm action which is necessary to ensure that the spirit of this legislation is implemented and not just left on the Statute Book.</P>
      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 5 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Friday, 7 June 1985.</P>

      <P>The early indications are that the scheme of community service orders, brought into effect last December, is proving successful and is being widely used by the courts.</P>
      <P>Prior to the scheme coming into operation a number of meetings and seminars were organised by my Department to promote the scheme among voluntary organisations and the Judiciary.  These were very successful and orders have been made in almost all areas of the country.  It is proposed to hold further such meetings to encourage the making of orders in the few areas where they have not so far been made.</P>
      <P>A total of 26 personnel from the probation and welfare service of my Department are employed full time on community service together with a small number of administrative staff who are engaged part time on the scheme.</P>
      <P>To date, a total of 310 cases have been referred by the courts to the probation and welfare service for reports as to the suitability of offenders and the availability of work.  One hundred and forty orders have been made, 64 cases have been rejected and 106 are still being investigated.</P>
      <P>In only one case so far as an offender failed to comply fully with an order.  That offender was returned to court and was sentenced to nine months detention.  Ten orders have been completed successfully.</P>
      <P>A wide range of activities has been undertaken for the benefit of various groups of individuals in the community. Examples of these are the provision of raised flower beds which can be easily tended by people confined to wheelchairs, renovating a swimming pool for boy scouts and carrying out maintenance and decoration work to an old folk's home.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I propose to take Questions Nos. 45 to 48, inclusive, together.</P>
      <P>The allocation of manpower to specialised units such as the juvenile liaison officer scheme is a matter for decision by the Garda authorities in the light of their assessment of needs having regard to overall resources and other demands on Garda services.</P>
      <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of 79 members are at present assigned full time to juvenile liaison officer duties.  The deployment of the members concerned is set out in the attached tables.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The juvenile liaison officer scheme essentially provides for the cautioning of <Col N="704" /> certain juveniles as an alternative to prosecution. The function of the juvenile liaison officer is to maintain contact with any juvenile assigned to him.  The juvenile may be one who has committed an offence and having been warned, has been informally committed to the care of the officer.  The juvenile liaison officer may also be given the care and guidance of a young person who, though not known to have committed an offence, may be regarded as a potential delinquent by reason of unsatisfactory behaviour, such as persistent truancy, running away from home, staying out late at night, unruly at school or at home, behaving in a disorderly manner, or frequenting undesirable places.  Such cases would come to notice through teachers, parents, school attendance officers, or other gardaí.</P>
    <P>The number of young persons dealt with under the scheme in each of the last three years is as follows: 1982, 4,743; 1983, 5,404; 1984, 6,278.</P>
    <P>A central administrative section in Garda headquarters is responsible for the overall control, administration and operation of the scheme.  Each juvenile liaison officer is accountable to his local district officer.  Members are required to undergo a special residential training course of a month's duration covering a range of subjects relevant to the work and duties of a juvenile liaison officer. These courses are held in the Garda Training Centre, Templemore.</P>
    <P>I am informed by the Garda authorities that while an additional nine juvenile liaison officers have recently been appointed, there are no proposals at present to extend the scope and operation of the scheme, but the matter will be kept under review.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> There are various ways of taking account of and benefiting from developments in criminology and I would not necessarily agree that the setting up of a specific section in my Department on the lines suggested would represent the best use of resources even if the <Col N="707" /> necessary additional resources were available.  The position at present, however, is that an embargo designed to achieve a reduction in staffing is in force.</P>
      <P>Policy making for the Department is the responsibility of the Minister, except in so far as the matters in question are of sufficient importance to warrant their being referred to the Government.</P>
      <P>As regards the question of a police authority, the Government programme includes a commitment to set up such an authority and appropriate legislation will be prepared as soon as other matters of an even more pressing nature have been dealt with.

      <P>Some offenders on temporary release from Loughan House who have fulfilled the conditions imposed on them have had a renewal granted to them at Sligo, not because there was no accommodation in Loughan House but because the railway timetable was such as to create practical travel difficulties if they went to Loughan House.  Some others have had their release renewed immediately on their reporting at Loughan House.  This does not mean that requesting them to report formally to the prison authorities at Loughan House (or to a representative at Sligo) was unnecessary or a waste of funds, though the possibility of requesting such persons to report at some other prison instead is being explored.</P>

      <P>I am aware that a report on the matter in question has been made to the City of Dublin Vocational Education Committee. The position is that the operation of the Government embargoes on the numbers serving in the public sector apply to the non-teaching staff of VECs. Two of the posts in question under the City of Dublin VEC have been exempted from the embargoes on the basis of their teaching content.  The other posts are at the second and third level sectors of the committee's scheme for which sectors there is an authorised non-teaching staff complement of 729.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the contention made by the Deputy in the last part of the question that there is consequently a deterioration in the education provision for an increasing number of students.

      <P>During 1984 work commenced on the implementation of the various recommendations of the Government Task Force on Drug Abuse as they affected the area of education.  The Department of Education are co-operating with the Health Education Bureau in the provision of training for teachers.  For example, four information days were held during 1984 together with an extended summer course.  Further information days will be held during 1985 together with a number of workshops-seminar and a further summer course.  Progress has been made, in co-operation with the Health Education Bureau, on the production of materials and teaching programmes. A set of video films has been tried out on a pilot basis and has now become available to schools together with two manuals on teaching methodology. Two teaching posts have been sanctioned in two of the treatment centres. The Curriculum and Examinations Board has been asked in conjunction with the Health Education Bureau, to encourage the development of health education in a central position in the school curriculum.</P>

      <P>The information sought by the Deputy regarding the schools which received special assistance through the programme of special educational measures for disadvantaged urban areas in 1984 is given in the following tabular statement.</P>
      <P>With regard to schools to which it would be proposed to offer assistance in 1985, the position is that it is not yet possible to supply a list of the schools, since the necessary authority for the expenditure involved has not yet been received.</P>
      <P>Regarding the criteria used to select schools for participation in the programme of special educational measures, the following were among the various factors taken into account:</P>
      <P> (a) pupil/teacher ratios which seriously hamper effective schooling;</P>
      <P>(b) poor environment (building, playspace etc.);</P>
      <P>(c) unemployment in the area and vandalism;</P>
      <P>(d) poor attendance record of pupils;</P>
      <P>(e) lack of community support. </P>
      <P>The financial assistance provided in respect of approved home/school/ community liaison programmes in 1984 amounted to £49,094.  The grant was paid to 31 schools from which acceptable programmes were received.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Education if she considers that the north inner city area of Dublin is a disadvantaged area; if she will list the schools there which she considers to be disadvantaged; and if she will outline the special assistance she will make available to those schools.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, my particular concern is with areas of educational disadvantage or disadvantage leading to impaired progress by children in the matter of education.  In relation to the Programme of Special Educational Measures for Disadvantaged Areas, which was initiated in 1984, my approach has been to concentrate on particular problems of educational disadvantage rather than on geographical areas where varying degrees of educational disadvantage are to be found.</P>
      <P>In recent years 32 additional teaching posts were sanctioned in 22 national schools which are situated in that part of Dublin which could be regarded as Dublin north inner city.  These posts were sanctioned as a means of countering particular problems of local disadvantage.  In addition three schools received assistance through the Programme of Special Educational Measures for Disadvantaged Urban Areas in 1984.  The measures from which these schools have benefited include the following:</P>
      <P> (i) special inservice training courses for teachers;</P>
      <P>(ii) grants for books and materials;</P>
      <P>(iii) grants for initiatives in home/ school/community liaison. </P>
      <P>It is hoped to assist some further schools in this area through similar special measures in 1985.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 78 together.</P>
      <P>I would refer the Deputy to paragraph 3.1 of the Programme for Action in Education which reads as follows:</P>
      <P>A major issue seen by managers, parents and teachers is the inadequacy of funding for National Schools.  The difficult financial position of the Boards of Management is recognised by the Minister.  The funding of National Schools will be a major priority of the Minister and the Government in the allocation of the resources available for education.  In addition, special funding should be directed to disadvantaged areas.  The question will be addressed as to whether a system of financing based totally on enrolments can deal with the special circumstances arising in individual schools, notably schools which are developing or showing a decline in enrolment.</P>
      <P>While this general matter is still under consideration in my Department, additional funds have been made available to the patrons of schools which have been designated as serving certain disadvantaged areas in Dublin, Limerick and Cork.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mrs. Hussey)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that schools in various parts of Dublin city and in the country generally, including the area referred to by the Deputy, have special needs.</P>
      <P>The special needs of all schools, currently seeking additional posts for remedial teachers, will be considered in the context of their priority of need.  In the area referred to in the question, remedial teaching posts have been allocated in the past and, in addition, extra teaching posts have been granted on the grounds of disadvantage under the &ldquo;Inner City Scheme&rdquo;.  The latter posts can, at the discretion of the school authorities, be used for remedial purposes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>No Acts or Regulations relate specifically to the safety of persons working on such schemes.  My Department is currently examining the relevance of the Safety in Industry Acts and Regulations to persons working on youth training schemes and I will take account of the result of that examination when I bring forward proposals for the reform of the safety and health system based on the report of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at Work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In practice, special arrangements have been made by the two principal bodies directly involved in youth training; AnCO and CERT.  AnCO observes a code of safety practice which outlines minimum safety requirements for most activities conducted within training centres. Trainees attend an induction course which covers occupational safety and health.  Furthermore, AnCO issues safety guidelines for community youth training programmes (CYTP) to committees and foremen stating the standards required during construction work.  Before the programme starts, AnCO has responsibility for ensuring that equipment and <Col N="724" /> services supplied by the sponsoring bodies of a CYTP project conform to the relevant legislation.  A safety delegate, from the Safety Committee of each AnCO training centre, visits each CYTP site regularly to inspect the training conditions and to ensure that safe conditions and practices are created and observed.</P>
    <P>Similarly, CERT ensures the safety of trainees by a range of activities which includes lectures, fire drill and first aid demonstrations, and checking of premises by a CERT training adviser.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 81 and 85 together.</P>
      <P>The arrangements that exist to assist apprentices who have been unable to complete their apprenticeships as a result of employers going out of business are as follows:</P>
      <P>An employer of an AnCO registered apprentice is required to notify AnCO in advance of his/her intention to make an apprentice redundant.</P>
      <P>On receipt of this notification AnCO endeavours to assist the apprentice concerned to continue and complete his/her apprenticeship by one, or a mix of, the following measures:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a) seeking, in conjunction with the National Manpower Service another employer to allow the apprentice continue his/her apprenticeship; (b) providing updating of skills courses in AnCO <Col N="725" /> and other recognised training centres; (c) assigning them to block release courses in regional technical colleges; (d) placing them with suitable employers on a temporary basis.</P>
    <P>All unemployed and redundant apprentices who are notified to AnCO are issued with a brochure giving details of procedures and guidelines for unemployed apprentices.</P>
    <P>In 1982, AnCO assisted 1,455 unemployed/redundant apprentices in this manner, while in 1983, 2,556 apprentices were assisted.  In 1984, 3,450 apprentices were assisted.  In 1985, to date, 980 apprentices have been assisted with a further 1,408 currently being assisted.  It is estimated that, in all, some 3,000 will be assisted in 1985.</P>
    <P>The increase in the number of apprentices becoming redundant as a result of the economic situation of the past few years is a matter of concern.  Nevertheless, I am satisfied that AnCO is doing all it can within its limited resources to assist these apprentices and to maintain apprenticeship numbers in line with the likely demand for skilled workers when the economy improves.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The following directives relating exclusively to safety and health in the workplace, which have been adopted by the EC Council of Ministers, are awaiting implementation in this country:</P>
      <P> (i) Council Directive of 27 November 1980 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to chemical, physical and biological agents at work (80/1107/EEC &mdash; commonly known as the &ldquo;framework&rdquo; Directive)</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="726" /> (ii) Council Directive of 28 July 1982, on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to metallic lead and its ionic compounds at work (82/605/EEC)</P>
    <P>(iii) Council Directive of 19 September 1983 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to chemical, physical and biological agents at work; asbestos (83/477/EEC). </P>
    <P>The &ldquo;framework&rdquo; Directive was due for implementation on a phased and ongoing basis from December 1983.  This Directive has a much wider application than the traditional scope of domestic safety legislation and consultations were necessary between Government Departments on aspects of the implementation and enforcement of the Directive.</P>
    <P>The second and third listed Directives, relating to the protection of workers exposed to lead and asbestos, come within the umbrella of the &ldquo;framework&rdquo; Directive and are to be implemented by Member States by January 1986 and I January 1987 respectively.  Work is in progress on preparing Regulations to implement those three Directives as early as possible.</P>
    <P>The following Directives relating in some respects to safety and health in the workplace, which have been adopted by the EC Council, are awaiting implementation in this country:</P>
    <P> (i) Council Directive of 15 July 1980 laying down the basic safety standards for the health protection of the general public and workers against the dangers of ionising radiation (80/836/Euratom &mdash; commonly known as the &ldquo;ionising radiation&rdquo; Directive)</P>
    <P>(ii) Council Directive of 24 June 1982, on the major accident hazards of certain industrial activities (82/501/EEC &mdash; commonly known as the &ldquo;Seveso&rdquo; Directive). </P>
    <P>The &ldquo;ionising radiation&rdquo; Directive was due for implementation from December 1982.  Responsibility for its implementation rests partly with the Departments of <Col N="727" /> Energy (the co-ordinating Department). Labour, Health and the Nuclear Energy Board.  The parties involved have been in consultation in regard to the method and means of implementation and Regulations are being drafted to give effect to the Directive.</P>
    <P>The &ldquo;Seveso&rdquo; Directive was due to be implemented from 8 January 1984, in the case of new industrial activities and was due to be implemented from 8 January 1985, in the case of existing industrial activities.  The implementation of the Directive involves a number of Departments and discussions to determine their respective roles have been concluded. Regulations to implement the Directive are at present being prepared.</P>

      <P>Health boards were responsible for the collection of the youth employment levy from farmers for the tax years 1982-83 and 1983-84.  The health boards estimate that £8,201,364 is outstanding in respect of those years.  This sum is due in respect of 93,660 demands.  It should be kept in mind that some persons would be served with a number of these demands and that some demands would relate to balances outstanding following payments on account.</P>
      <P>The Collector General was responsible for the collection of the levy from the self-employeed for the tax years 1982-83 and 1983-84.  The Collector General estimates that £19,429,749 is outstanding in respect of those years.  This sum is due in respect of 166,737 demands.

A total of £15,889,393 is outstanding in respect of this year from both farmers and the self-employed in respect of 139,685 demands.

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The implementation of the recommendations of the working party on child care facilities for working parents is a matter for the various authorities involved.  These include certain Government Departments, health boards, trade unions and employers' organisations.</P>
      <P>The main recommendations of relevance to my Department relate to the extension of coverage under protective legislation to part time and temporary employees and other similar categories where they are not already covered, and the extension of the period of unpaid maternity leave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The general question of reducing the eligibility thresholds in labour legislation is kept under review by my Department. In fact, I arranged under the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act, 1984, which came into force on 30 November 1984, to lower the eligibility thresholds to 18 hours a week under the Redundancy Payments Acts, 1967 to 1979, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, and the Unfair <Col N="729" /> Dismissals Act, 1977.  This brings eligibility thresholds in labour legislation into line with the threshold for eligibility under the social welfare code.</P>
    <P>The question of extending the period of unpaid maternity leave will be considered when the Maternity Protection of Employees Act, 1981, comes up for review.  The working party also recommended to trade unions and employers that they should adopt a more constructive approach to considering possible changes in relation to the status of part time and temporary work, alternative working arrangements, and the provision of forms of day care facility at or near the work place.  In recognition of its important promotional and monitoring role, I asked the Employment Equality Agency last year to examine what stimulatory role it might usefully play in promoting a constructive dialogue between both sides of industry in these matters.  I am convinced that the advice and influence of the Agency can usefully complement the report of the working party and encourage the social partners to translate its recommendations into practicable initiatives.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>The principal source of information on the destination of school leavers is the school leavers' survey.  The survey sample is designed to be representative of the situation nationally rather than of individual localities.  It is not possible, therefore, to derive information from it in <Col N="730" /> relation to a specific area such as Tallaght.</P>
    <P>The most recent survey for which results are available was carried out in May 1984 of persons leaving school during the 1982-83 academic year.  The main findings are that an estimated 28,400 leavers, just under 46 per cent, were in employment; 15,600 (25 per cent) were enrolled in further education; 13,400 (21.6 per cent) were still seeking their first job and 2,300 leavers (3.7 per cent) were unemployed after having had a job and lost it.  These findings show an improvement in the position over the previous year with a 3.1 per cent increase of those in employment and a decline of 2.1 per cent of those unemployed.</P>

      <P>The Dangerous Substances Act, 1972, which is administered by my Department, provides for the making of regulations for the protection of persons and property from the hazards associated with dangerous substances.  A comprehensive set of safety regulations relating specifically to petroleum, and which include provisions for warning notices, alarms, labelling of tanks and warning signs on vehicles, was brought into operation in 1979.  Further regulations relating to the conveyance by road of 25 other scheduled substances were brought into operation in 1980.  They provide for the labelling of tanks, containers and packages, display by vehicles of appropriate signs, training of personnel, and the action to be taken in the event of an incident involving a scheduled substance.  I propose to extend this list of 25 substances very shortly to include a far wider range of substances.</P>

      <P>I am satisfied that the present means of transporting acrylonitrile to the Asahi Plant, Killala, County Mayo is the safest method of transporting it.  I am informed that the question of transport by sea was fully considered and was rejected due to the unsuitability of local ports to receive vessels of the size required and the hazards in regard to this type of transport arising from storms on the west coast in the winter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendations on the safety measures and operational procedures to govern the transportation of this chemical by rail from Dublin to Ballina were adopted following in-depth studies and consultations with representatives of the Asahi Company, the Department of Transport, C.I.E., Mayo County Council, Dublin Port and Docks Board, the IIRS and an inter-departmental safety committee.  The Deputy will be aware from a recent reply which he received <Col N="734" /> from the Minister for Communications that CIE operates safety arrangements in regard to rail transport which conform to the international arrangements for the carriage of dangerous goods by rail.  The chemical is transported by road by CIE from Ballina to Killala and such transport is covered by the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) Regulations, 1980.</P>
    <P>The industrial inspectorate of my Department carry out regular road checks to ensure that this legislation is complied with.  The Regulations provide for measures to be taken and standards, to be observed in the conveyance by road of certain dangerous substances including acrylonitrile.  The labelling of tanks, containers and packages, display by vehicles of appropriate warning signs, training of personnel and the action to be taken in the event of an accident involving this chemical must meet the requirements of this legislation.</P>

      <P>Irish Shipping Limited has never been a designated body under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, and questions on the company should be addressed, in the first instance, to the Minister for Communications.  In the circumstances, I do not propose to comment here on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies on Irish Shipping Limited mentioned in the Deputy's question.</P>
      <P>Section 25 of the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, does not confer on me the power to make an order fixing a quorum in respect of a designated body.  This is a matter for the Minister with primary responsibility for the designated State enterprise.  My role in this regard under the Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, is purely a consultative one.  Statutory Instrument No. 196 of 1979, made by the then Minister for Transport and Power on 1 June 1979, fixes the quorum for a meeting of the board of the B &amp; I Company Limited at six.  This is the only order made under section 25.</P>
      <P>The Deputy might also note that an order under this section cannot be made unless a resolution approving the draft has been passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  The Worker Participation (State Enterprises) Act, 1977, makes provision for the appointment of elected worker directors to the boards of seven State enterprises (Aer Lingus Teoranta, British and Irish Steampacket Company Limited, Comhlucht Siúicre Éireann Teoranta, Nitrigín Éireann Teoranta, Bord na Móna, Córas Iompair Éireann, Electricity Supply Board).  The Act is not primarily concerned with the conduct of board meetings, and the Minister for Labour has no function in relation to provisions allowing board meetings to be called by requisition.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The article referred to illustrates the scale of the problem of controlling heroin production, and the problems which the Governments of producing countries must face in tackling the producers and dealers.  Corruption and criminality are features of the activities of those involved in drug dealing throughout its whole chain from producer to street pusher.</P>
      <P>The article indicates that the Government of the country named is concerned about the problem, and has reduced the quantity of drugs produced in areas under its control.  The article also gives the view that not enough is being done to combat the problem.</P>
      <P>I understand in fact that the Government in question co-operates with the United Nations drug agencies, and in particular with the UN Fund for Drug Abuse Control which has been particularly happy with the results of its programmes there for crop substitution.</P>
      <P>On a more general level, the question of tackling the vast problem of production, transport and distribution of drugs is clearly one where only international co-operation can succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Ireland of course co-operates fully with various UN agencies involved in this question.  Ireland is also a member of the Council of Europe Co-operation Group <Col N="740" /> to Combat Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking in Drugs (called the &ldquo;Pompidou Group&rdquo;), which is at present looking at various new ways to combat traffic in drugs.</P>
    <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government appointed a special task force on drug abuse and the report of the task force was issued in September 1983.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the apparent increase in world wide awareness of the seriousness of the problems posed by drug production and traffic that was shown in the debates at the United Nations General Assembly at the end of 1984.  In fact the awareness of the seriousness of the problem at the highest level in many countries seemed to have increased.  In addition to the expressions of commitment contained in the resolutions adopted on this subject, certain concrete initiatives were undertaken there to tackle the up-dating of controls on drug movements.</P>
    <P>In my view it is through international co-operation of these kinds, and through the fostering of world wide awareness of the seriousness of the problem, that most can be contributed to the problem.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 105 together.  The Eastern Region Settlement Strategy 2011 is intended to provide a framework within which the local authorities, private and public agencies and individuals can formulate their short and longer term plans, programmes and investment decisions.  The report has now been circulated to all local authorities and other interested bodies for their reactions. My Department and the Industrial Development Authority, which is the Government agency responsible for the promotion of industrial development, will have regard to the content of this <Col N="744" /> report in planning to meet the industrial needs of the areas in question.</P>
      <P>I have been informed that the IDA have acquired an industrial site at Collinstown, North Kildare.  The site is at present being actively promoted for new industry.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>Under the Industrial Development Acts all projects requiring substantial grant-aid from the Exchequer in respect of an industrial project must be submitted by the IDA to the Government for approval. This is quite understandable as it is the Government who at the end of the day must account for the expenditure of many millions of pounds of taxpayers money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following on negotiations between the IDA and the Hyster Corporation, the Government in June 1984 considered proposals for grant assistance for a project involving an &ldquo;all makes parts&rdquo; venture to manufacture a wide range of parts for forklift trucks and other handling equipment.  The proposal involved was <Col N="745" /> very expensive in terms of Exchequer costs and would have resulted in a very high grant cost per job.  It was recognised that there was a very considerable risk attaching to the project because its success depended to a large degree on the company's ability to establish itself in a market, &ldquo;all makes&rdquo; spare parts, which it had not hitherto serviced and in which there was considerable competition.  In view of this high cost and the relative degree of risk attached to the project, the Government was concerned that the Exchequer was being asked to contribute a disproportionately large share for the financing requirements, compared to the contribution that the promoters themselves were prepared to make.</P>
    <P>In all these circumstances, the Government indicated to the IDA that it would be prepared to approve grant assistance for the project only on the basis of an increased upfront cash contribution from the company as evidence of their confidence in the project's success.  The Government considered that in view of the high Exchequer cost and the disproportionately high degree of risk that the State was being asked to bear, such an approach was totally justified.</P>
    <P>It should also be clearly understood that the expected employment figures mentioned in public debate would only arise in the event of the project being a complete success and then only after a period of ten years.  In the earlier years of the project and during the period in which the State's investment would be most at risk, the employment projected would be at a very much lower level.</P>

      <P>Local authorities have powers under various codes which would enable them to secure the development or reinstatement of disused quarries, sand and gravel pits.  Planning permission is required in the first instance for development of this nature and it is standard practice, in granting permissions for this type of development, to include conditions requiring appropriate restoration, reinstatment and landscaping following the cessation of quarrying operations. Local authorities also have power under the Planning Acts to engage directly in the development of land; this could include the restoration of former quarries or sand and gravel pits for amenity or other appropriate purposes.  The services of An Foras Forbartha, including its conservation and amenity advisory service, are available to planning authorities, for guidance in matters of this nature.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if his attention has been drawn to the fact that two-thirds <Col N="747" /> of those killed or injured in road traffic accidents in 1984 were not wearing safety belts; if he feels that stricter penalties for non-compliance with the law would be desirable; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>Provisional figures compiled by the Garda Síochána show that 463 persons were killed and 7,781 injured in 1984.  Final figures and detailed analysis of them will not be available until later this year.</P>
      <P>A detailed analysis of road traffic accidents is however, available for 1983 in the Foras Forbartha report &ldquo;Accident Facts 1983&rdquo;.  On the safety belt aspect, information as to whether those killed or injured were wearing safety belts is not available in all cases.  Where such information is available, the report shows that of 142 drivers and front seat passengers killed in 1983, 106 or 75 per cent were not wearing safety belts.  Of 2,779 drivers and front seat passengers injured, 1,112 or 40 per cent were not wearing safety belts.</P>
      <P>Prosecutions by the Garda Síochána of front seat car occupants, for failure to comply with the safety belt wearing regulations, totalled 13,119 in 1983.  This represents an increase of 31 per cent on the 10,081 similar prosecutions in 1982. The prosecution figures for 1984 are not yet available.</P>
      <P>I have already taken action to increase the mandatory penalties for non-compliance with the safety belt regulations.  The Road Traffic (Amendment) Act, 1984 increased the relevant maximum monetary penalty from £20 to £150 for a first offence, and from £50 to £350 for a second or subsequent offence.  In addition, persons convicted of a second or subsequent offence remain liable, at the discretion of the court, to a term of imprisonment not exceeding three months.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have, on several occasions, expressed my concern about the need for a substantial increase in the use of safety belts.  I believe that low safety belt wearing rates <Col N="748" /> do not generally represent a conscious defiance of the law but reflect a combination of insufficient public awareness generally of the benefits of using safety belts and forgetfulness on the part of from seat occupants.  In publicity campaigns conducted in the period leading up to Christmas 1984 and the New Year, the National Road Safety Association, with the co-operation of the Garda authorities, laid special emphasis on the wearing of safety belts.  I have provided an increase of 34 per cent in non-pay funding to the National Road Safety Association in 1985, the major purpose of which is to enable the Association to pursue an extended publicity campaign this year on safety belt wearing.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 123 to 130, inclusive, together. A sum of approximately £820,000 will be available from the Fisheries Vote for harbour development works at Howth in 1985.  The expenditure up to 31 March 1985 on development works at the harbour amounted to £10,674,421.  I understand from Bord Iascaigh Mhara that the ice plant is now in operation at the harbour. The value of fish landed at Howth in 1984 was £3,006,562.</P>
      <P>The Howth harbour development scheme makes provision for a number of sites for leasing for the establishment of fish related industries.  It is, of course, a matter for private enterprise to avail themselves of these sites for the erection of manufacturing units to suit their own requirements.  In accordance with an undertaking given to existing tenants on the west pier that they would be afforded the first option on these sites, my Department will shortly be discussing the matter with them to ascertain their interests. When this has been done other applicants will be considered for the remaining available sites.</P>
      <P>Finally the erection of an auction hall at Howth has been under consideration in the context of the development scheme for the harbour.  However in view of the limited funds available for fishery harbour works generally and the need to allocate these funds as equitably as possible on the basis of the most urgent and pressing projects throughout the country it has not been possible to include this particular project for Howth in the Fishery Harbour Development Programme for 1985.  I am not in a position to say at this stage when the project will be undertaken.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="760" /> The recently initiated Dublin Transport Authority Bill requires the proposed authority to make recommendations to the Ministers for Communications and the Environment, as appropriate, on the long term planning of road and rail transport in the Dublin area.  Thus, any proposals to extend the DART system fall to be considered by the authority, in consultations with CIE and in the context of meeting the overall transport requirements of the Dublin area.  The authority will be required to consider the public transport needs of the new towns to the west of Dublin city as a priority task as soon as it is established, hopefully in a matter of a few months.</P>
    <P>I should point out that because of the enormous cost involved (some hundreds of millions of pounds) all possible options &mdash;and not only rail-based ones &mdash; will have to considered by the authority.  As the Deputy will appreciate, the low-density character of the Dublin area militates against the inherently expensive rail-based option.</P>

      <P>The Fire Services Act, 1981, makes it clear that the proprietor and management of a premises frequented by the public are responsible for guarding against the outbreak of fire and for ensuring, as far as is reasonably practical, the safety of persons on the premises in the event of a fire outbreak.  Following the tragic fire at Bradford football club, my <Col N="771" /> Department issued a circular to all fire authorities (Who are responsible for fire safety enforcement within their functional areas) drawing their attention to the need to inspect all premises covered by the Fire Services Act, 1981, including sports stadia, for fire safety purposes. Extracts from a copy of booklet entitled <i>&ldquo;Guide to Safety at Sports Grounds&rdquo;</i> published by the British Home Office was enclosed with this circular.</P>
      <P>Earlier this year I asked My Department to prepare a regulation making it an indictable offence to lock an exit or obstruct an escape route in any premises while it is in use for public assembly purposes. This regulation will be introduced immediately following completion of consultations which are now taking place. In relation to the construction of buildings for the purposes of sporting activities or events, including grandstands and other like facilities, the provisions of the proposed building regulations will ensure that such facilities are safe both from a structural and a fire safety viewpoint.</P>
      <P>In regard to other aspects of safety at sports grounds I would draw the attention of the Deputy to the replies given by the Minister for Justice to Question No. 9 on 30 May 1985.  In addition, the Minister of State at the Department of Education has become involved, in association with the relevant sporting bodies in considering safety and crowd control measures at sporting fixtures and has circulated a copy of Recommendation No. R (84) 8 of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe to all local authorities and to the major sporting organisations.  The recommendation relates to the reduction of spectator violence at sporting events and, in particular, at football matches. The Garda Síochána normally consult with the organisers of major sporting events with a view to determining the security arrangements which may be appropriate.  Consideration is being given in my Department to what additional measures may be necessary in relation to events which involve large crowds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 160 and 161 together.</P>
      <P>The Government's programme for local government reform, as outlined in the policy statement which was published on 30 May 1985, is designed to be implemented within the aggregate level of taxation stipulated in the National Plan <i>Building on Reality</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Principle financial effect of the devolution measures will be to shift resources from the centre to local level, in line with the particular arrangements in each case.  In the medium and longer terms the programme is expected to lead to savings in operational costs as a result of making services more accessible and curtailing delays and duplication.  Any additional transitional or operational costs which may arise for local authorities initially will not be significant in the context of their overall operational costs and <Col N="775" /> will be expected to be matched by compensating savings and redeployment.  As indicated in the policy statement it is an integral part of the reform programme that efficiency and value-for-money will be promoted in local government.</P>
    <P>It is not possible at this stage to estimate reliably the additional operational costs that may arise from the reorganisation of the local government system or to differentiate in this respect the costs of structural changes from the unavoidable costs of expanding services in line with population growth.  Here too there will be emphasis on compensating economies so that any additional to net operational costs will be kept to a minimum.</P>
    <P>Implementation of the reform programme is already under way, mainly through the Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985.  Further legislation will be published before the end of 1985. It is the intention that the programme as a whole, including the devolution measures, will be completed, or fully on the way to completion, in the lifetime of this Government.</P>

      <P>Medical cards are issued to persons with full eligibility for health services i.e. persons who in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the health board, are unable to provide general practitioner services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.  Income guidelines have been drawn up to assist the chief executive officers in determining applications for medical cards and for ensuring uniformity of decisions between health boards.  Evidence of the applicants income is required by the chief executive officers in assessing eligibility.</P>
      <P>The income of small farmers is determined on a factual basis and the income guidelines are then applied.  This determination of income normally entails an assessment by health board officials of the income and expenses of the farm. The criteria for medical card entitlement differs from the criteria for unemployment assistance so that it is not possible to arrange for automatic acceptance by health boards of the social welfare officers assessment of means.  However, health boards have been encouraged to develop closer liaison with social welfare officers with a view to improving uniformity in assessing income for both health and social welfare purposes.</P>

      <P>Free electricity allowance is provided as an additional benefit for elderly and permanently incapacitated persons who are in receipt of qualifying social welfare type pensions.  The benefit is confined to qualified pensioners who reside either alone or with other qualified pensioners or with certain &ldquo;dependent&rdquo; categories of persons.  A person receiving unemployment assistance does not come within the categories for satisfying the &ldquo;living alone&rdquo; condition of the scheme.

Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants whose parents or relatives are wellto-do and those in poor circumstances.

      <P>The person concerned claimed optical benefit on 12 February 1985.  His claim was approved on 5 March 1985 and a letter of authorisation for presentation to his optician was issued to him and he was informed that the Department would pay the full cost of any sight test and a fixed contribution towards the cost of glasses if required. On 15 March 1985 this letter was returned by the optician to claim payment for the completed treatment, including the supply of glasses.  The cost of the glasses chosen exceeded the amount of the contribution under the optical benefit scheme and as a result the claimant was liable for the balance of the cost which amounted to £55.10.</P>

      <P>Children's allowance is normally paid from the first day of the month following the birth of a child provided a claim is made within three months. Where a claim is not made within three months payment can only be made from the first of the month following that in which the claim is made.

However, where there are exceptional or extenuating circumstances for the delay in making a claim, payment may be allowed in full.</P>
      <P>The husband of the person concerned is the claimant in the case.  He did not claim allowance in respect of his third child, born 20 February 1984, until 15 August 1984.  As no explanation for the delay in claiming was put forward, payment was only made from September 1984.  However, in view of the statement made by the Deputy in relation to the claimant's wife, the person concerned is being requested to supply further details in the matter, including medical evidence, and when this is received the case will be reviewed and he will be notified of the outcome.</P>
