    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Taoiseach if the Government recognise the role of Comhdháil na nOileán as an organisation representing the inhabitants of our off-shore islands and the comhdháil's aims for the development of the islands through the provision of the necessary level of services, facilities and amenities; and if he will give a direction to all Government Departments, State agencies and semi-State bodies to have due regard to these aims in all aspects of their administration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government recognise the useful role that Comhdháil na nOileán and similar bodies can play in promoting the development and wellbeing of island communities around our coast.  Comhdháil na nOileán have already been in contact with a number of Ministers, Departments and State agencies on matters related to the development needs of island communities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The comhdháil have also recently been in correspondence with me on their aims and objectives and I am drawing the <Col N="1066" /> attention of my colleagues in Government to this correspondence and to the comhdháil's submissions to me and I am requesting them to take account of these submissions in the formulation and administration of Government policies which affect the development of island communities around our coast.  The Deputy will be aware that Departments and State agencies have already done much to help island communities and there is a recognition of the special problems and difficulties which they face.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to express my appreciation of the Taoiseach's oncoming attitude in this matter.  Might I ask if he would agree that persons who wish to continue to reside on one of our offshore islands are entitled to a reasonable and satisfactory level of services, in other words, that the State fully recognises the right of people to continue to live on these islands if they so wish and that, as residents, they are entitled, within limits, to the same level of services, facilities and amenities as people who live on the mainland?  If the Taoiseach agrees with that general principle, would he take whatever action is possible to make sure that that fundamental principle is understood, acknowledged and, in so far as is possible, implemented by Government Departments and State-sponsored bodies in particular?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>Does that include Inishvickillaune?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about all-the-year-round residents.  I am quite capable of looking after myself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would agree with the Deputy that while there are necessary limits to the extent to which State spending could be applied in individual cases to enable a relatively small number of people to remain on an island, priority should be given to encouraging people to remain and there should be a willingness to go beyond the normal in providing State services in these cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1067" />
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that, apart from anything else, it would be administratively very convenient if the comhdháil were given something in the nature of a consultative status by Government Departments and bodies generally in so far as most of the problems are common to all the islands and most of the amenities and facilities required are again common to all the islands?  In that respect the comhdháil could have a very helpful and constructive role to play in advising and assisting Government Departments and agencies in carrying out the sort of general directive principle which the Taoiseach and I both agree is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course, the problems are not solely ones for Government Departments and agencies.  Local authorities are also involved.  The Government do recognise the useful role that the comhdháil can play in promoting the development of islands off our coast.  The comhdháil have been in existence for a relatively short period, since September 1984.  The most effective way in which they could operate to achieve their aims and objectives would be to work closely with the people who have been democratically elected to represent island communities in local authorities and Údarás na Gaeltachta and the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am sure there would be an openness to representation from them in the different areas, including local authorities, who may have functions to perform in relation to particular islands.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Finally, would the Taoiseach agree, that while, of course, the role of the public representative is paramount, each public representative in the normal course of events would be making a special case of representation on behalf of the particular situation in his or her constituency, but the comhdháil would have experience of common problems and, therefore, would be able to supplement in a very constructive way the role of the individual public representative?</P>

    <Col N="1068" />
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but obviously it would not replace it.  I am sure they would wish to work with and through the elected representatives and that the various agencies, including the local authorities, would be happy to work with them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Taoiseach accept that the biggest difficulty confronting the communities residing on our off-shore islands is communication, first of all, the difficulty of travelling and the cost of travelling?  In view of the special difficulties they have over and above any other group in the country, would he nominate one Minister or Minister of State with special responsibility for island affairs to whom these island communities could make their representations?  It has proved very difficult and costly for them to have to travel to different Departments &mdash; that is one of the biggest difficulties &mdash; whereas if there was one Government Department with special responsibility to look after their interests they would not have to hop from Roinn na Gaeltachta to Industry and Commerce, Tourism, Communications and to all the different Departments which is really causing these island communities a lot of expense and difficulty.  They feel if there was one Minister with some special responsibility for taking care of their needs they could go to him direct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's long experience as a Minister will have led him to understand and appreciate fully that the responsibility for the different activities and the different services lies with individual Government Departments. There is no way in which you could allocate ministerial responsibility for all these services whether they be communications, agriculture, transport, energy and the various things the Deputy mentioned to one Department because those functions lie essentially and necessarily with individual Departments.  Given that, if there is any way we can facilitate these communities in making representations by co-ordinating the arrangments for representations when they have to make these difficult journeys we shall certainly try to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1069" />
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Taoiseach will accept that the Central Government Committee in the Department of Finance look after certain aspects of that work and if he could appoint some co-ordinator at Government level it would overcome this major difficulty for the islanders?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Central Government Committee in the Department of Finance deals with some of the islands, others may come more under the framework of Udarás na Gaeltachta.  Those two bodies between them cover a number of the aspects the Deputy is talking about.  When they are dealing with specific requirements relating to particular Departments there is no way you can shortcircuit communication with those Departments.  We can certainly try to facilitate them.</P>

      <P>asked the Taoiseach the proposals, if any, the Government has for the reform of the Constitution of the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government do not propose to bring forward any amendment to the Constitution at present.  As I indicated to the Deputy in reply to a question on 9 October 1984, my views on the need for certain constitutional changes are well known.  I do not intend, however, to pursue them at this time in order not to prejudice, in any way, the outcome of the current Anglo-Irish discussions or the Oireachtas debates on the Report of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Marriage Breakdown.</P>

      <P>When the Taoiseach gave me his reply almost a year ago I asked him could he indicate when he thought it might be possible for the Government to bring forward amendments to the Constitution which he has clearly indicated he feels are necessary.  I ask him again can he indicate when, if at all, the Government intend to introduce any amendments to the Constitution?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>In my answer I have explained the position.  I do not think I could add to that.  Obviously the discussions to which I referred and to which I referred also in my reply to the previous question have not yet been concluded and in respect of one particular matter, which may or may not be in the Deputy's mind, we have a forthcoming debate in the House which should take precedence over any question on constitutional action.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias de Rossa Proinsias de Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to one specific matter which is in my mind, that is the question of divorce, does the Taoiseach not consider that we have reached a ludicrous situation where backbenchers and presumably Ministers in the Government are promoting Bills for changes in the Constitution when the Government are not taking steps to pursue their declared policy?  Could he not indicate at this stage when he feels it will be possible for the Government to move on this or on any other aspect of constitutional reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already made it perfectly clear that the question of any Government action on this matter is something which will arise for discussion after the Dáil debate.  In a matter of this kind, where the House decided to establish a committee, which went to enormous trouble to issue a very good report, which had 700 written submissions and 24 oral submissions, it would be contemptuous of the Government to proceed in this House with legislation of a particular character which might or might not conform to the views of the majority of the committee until the House has a chance to debate the committee's report.  When that has been done certainly the time will be ripe to consider what action, if any, should be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias de Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Taoiseach not consider that the hope he offered to many people North and South on this island when he announced his constitutional crusade, including myself &mdash; I <Col N="1071" /> had great hopes in relation to what he was talking about &mdash; now has been lost? Could he indicate that, following the debate on the report of the Committee on Marital Breakdown, he will then announce a programme on constitutional reform?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered that question.  With regard to the question of divorce, whether there should be Government action in the matter, this is something to be considered after the debate in the House.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if, in view of the deteriorating situation in South Africa, the increasingly repressive measures adopted by the Pretoria government, including mass arrests, the shooting of unarmed civilians and the execution of Benjamin Moloise, and the decision of many countries throughout the world to introduce new measures against South Africa, the Irish Government plan to take any new steps to increase the pressure on South Africa to abandon its policy of apartheid; if the Government will now <Col N="1072" /> introduce economic sanctions and, particularly, if they will ban the export of computer and electronic equipment to South Africa from Ireland; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the Government's view on economic sanctions against South Africa.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 26 together.</P>
      <P>I have stated many times, before this House and elsewhere, the Government's opposition to the abhorrence of the system of apartheid in South Africa.  I would like to reaffirm this now as well as the Government's wish to see an end to the system by peaceful means and the emergence in South Africa in its place of a democratic and multi-racial society. The aim of Government policy is to seek to help bring this about by applying pressure on the Government of South Africa to persuade it to change its policies.</P>
      <P>The Government consider that the imposition of effective mandatory sanctions against South Africa is a means of further increasing international pressure on South Africa to abandon its apartheid policies and to this end has supported proposals that the UN Security Council should consider such sanctions.  In 1984 Ireland co-sponsored a resolution to this effect at the UN General Assembly and has previously co-sponsored resolutions urging the imposition of an oil embargo and a ban on new investment in South Africa.  The Government believe that sanctions should be carefully chosen, graduated, properly imposed by the Security Council in accordance with the Charter of the United Nations and fully implemented.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Within the European Community the Government have actively sought agreement among the Ten on common measures to be taken against South Africa. Agreement was reached on a number of such measures by the Foreign Ministers of the Community on 10 September last. These measures were not intended to be a <Col N="1073" /> substitute for sanctions or other stronger measures.  The measures were regarded as a minimum and the Ten in their statement specifically referred to the fact that the question of other measures, including sanctions, remained on the table.  The measures were designed to make clear, in unambiguous terms, the seriousness with which the Ten viewed the situation in South Africa and the need for the abolition of the apartheid system in that country and the opening of a genuine dialogue with the representatives of the black majority population.</P>
    <P>I need hardly add that the Government keep the situation in South Africa under close scrutiny and that our policy with regard to finding ways of increasing pressure on South Africa to achieve peaceful change in that unfortunate country is kept constantly under review.  In this connection, and with specific reference to Irish action at the United Nations, I wish to inform the House of the following additional steps which the Government propose taking in the matter:</P>
    <P>(1)  Ireland will work for international implementation of the measures recommended in Resolution 39/72G &mdash; the resolution we co-sponsored &mdash; on Concerted International Action Against Apartheid.  This resolution calls for a cessation of further investment in and loans to South Africa, an end to all promotion of trade to South Africa, to all military and nuclear collaboration with South Africa and for further aid for victims of apartheid and those struggling to bring about a non-racial democratic society there.</P>
    <P>(2)  Ireland will work for strict compliance with Security Council Resolution 418 of 1977 which established a mandatory embargo on supplies of arms to South Africa.</P>
    <P>(3)  Ireland will work towards making mandatory the embargo on the import of arms and paramilitary equipment from South Africa set out in the provisions of Security Council Resolution 558 of 1984.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1074" /> (4)  Ireland will seek to have the provisions of Security Council Resolution 569 on the suspension of all new investment in South Africa and the suspension of guaranteed export loans to South Africa made mandatory.</P>
    <P>The Government do not consider that a unilateral ban on trade with South Africa would be appropriate or effective.  Such a ban could be in conflict with our treaty obligations arising out of our membership of the European Community and the GATT.</P>
    <P>On the specific matter of a ban on exports of computers and electronic equipment, I would point out that the Government already take steps to ensure that no exports of this type go for the use of the South African security forces and that this was one of the measures agreed on by the Ten in September.  The Government's view remains that, for pressure on South Africa to be effective, broad international agreement is required on measures such as the strengthening of the existing arms import embargo, the introduction of an oil embargo and a ban on new investment in South Africa.  The Government will continue to seek international agreement on the adoption of such effective measures.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister believe that the Community should and must take effective action to mark its abhorrence of the systematic killing of unarmed black civilians and the attempt to suppress international coverage of this in defence of a totally unjust and iniquitous system of government?  Can the Minister possibly be satisfied with the Community's action and attitude to date? Would he agree it has been absolutely minimal and has been more designed to fend off public opinion in Europe than to effect any real change in South Africa?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has asked three or four questions.  I would wish that the Community and the UN would take stronger action against South Africa &mdash; I said that in my reply.  It is not correct to say that the measures adopted by the <Col N="1075" /> Community on 10 September last were designed to fend off, as the Deputy said, public opinion.  There was a basis on which we could get the Twelve to agree. I personally wish they could go further but at the moment there is no willingness among all members of the Community to go any further.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister specify precisely the steps being taken to ensure that the computer and electronic equipment being exported from Ireland will not be used by the South African security forces?  Will he accept that the type of equipment being exported is a key element in South Africa's operation of its pass laws?  Would he indicate whether the Government have considered the ten point programme which the Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement presented to his Department last June?  Have steps been taken to pursue any of these ten points?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>In regard to the first point, the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism seek an assurance from people exporting to South Africa that such equipment would not be used by the security forces in South Africa, and the Department seek an assurance from the people buying the equipment and sending it that it will not be used by or sold to the security forces in that country.  We have no reason to believe that that condition is not adhered to.  The Irish Anti-Apartheid Movement submitted a programme to my Department four or five months ago and, as I said here and in the Seanad on a number of occasions, the programme contains many good points, but our most effective action can be in partnership with our colleagues in the EC and in the UN.  We have been working effectively there.</P>

      <P>Three representatives went down in early September.  When they arrived they had not decided whether to go ahead with their trip or not because conditions were imposed on them some of which they could meet but some of which they could not.  I do not argue with the decision made by them on the spot.  Their main purpose while there was to seek to influence the South African Government and to gather whatever information they could.  They went there as representatives of the 12 member states.  They made a decision on the spot and I do not suggest they could have made a different decision.</P>

      <P>Have the Government considered withdrawing from the &ldquo;no visa&rdquo; agreement with South Africa in view of the stronger hand it would give to the Irish Government to control visits of various South African diplomats to <Col N="1077" /> Ireland?  This applies also to sporting organisations of one kind or another.  Is the Minister aware that we are likely to have a visit this weekend from the South African Ambassador in London?  Have the Department been informed or consulted about this visit?  What would the Department's attitude be to such a visit?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of such a proposed visit.  We would not necessarily be informed because the South African Ambassador in London is not accredited to this country.  There is free movement of travel between here and Great Britain and therefore he would be free to step on a boat and come here without informing anybody.  The imposition of a visa has been considered, particularly in the light of what occurred when the workers in Dunne's Stores went there.  On balance, we decided we should not do it.  A no visa requirement does not necessarily mean that people from one country cannot go to another country. We do not allow South African sporting organisations to come here even though there is no visa requirement.  We decided that if a visa were required by South African citizens coming to Ireland, undoubtedly the South African Government would reciprocate and this would not be of benefit to the many people who go to South Africa seeking information and to meet various groups of people there.  Missionaries have to go through South Africa to get to Lesotho where we have a big aid programme.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he is aware that under Spanish law an Irish national can be detained in prison for up to four years without being tried for any offence; and if he will make representations to the Spanish authorities to have the law of that country changed to ensure that Irish nationals in the country held on suspicion of having committed any crime will be tried within a more reasonable period, or released from prison.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Spanish law on criminal procedure contains provisions under which any prisoner in Spanish jurisdiction may be held before trial.  There is no discrimination between Irish and other prisoners in this regard.</P>
      <P>The detention is called &ldquo;provisional imprisonment&rdquo; and can be decreed only when the judge decides that there are sufficient grounds for believing that a crime has been committed and the criminal responsibility attributed to one or more persons.  The imprisonment will not last longer than three months in respect of prosecution for a crime carrying a jail sentence on one to six months; not longer than one year for crimes carrying a sentence of six months to six years and not longer than two years for crimes carrying a sentence of over six years.  In the latter two cases where circumstances do not allow a trial within the stipulated time limits and when the accused might evade the course of justice, imprisonment may be extended to two and four years respectively.</P>
      <P>In effect the four year provision to which the Deputy refers is an exceptional measure reserved for crimes of the most serious nature, I understand that it was mainly intended for terrorist offences. The practical maximum period of detention before trial is two years.</P>
      <P>These provisions apply to all prisoners in Spanish jurisdiction and it would not be appropriate nor indeed effective for me to make representations to have them changed.  Irish citizens abroad are, of course, subject to the law of the place in which they are.</P>
      <P>Naturally, in cases where an Irish citizen is in custody, we offer all appropriate consular assistance, including every effort to bring about an early trial.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if he will report to the House on the present position regarding the release of an Irish national, Brendan Flynn, who has been in prison in a Spanish jail for over one year following his arrest on a suspicion of having been involved in a murder, and in respect of whom there is no indication that the Spanish authorities will bring him to trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister of State informed the House of the facts of the case as of 14 March 1985.  Since that date the Irish Embassy in Madrid and my Department have continued to be closely involved in the case, and to maintain direct contact with Mr. Flynn, his family and his Spanish lawyers.</P>
      <P>Under Spanish criminal procedure there are two principal stages before trial: stage 1 is the &ldquo;instruction&rdquo; or investigation where a judge, having decided that there are sufficient grounds for indictment, compiles a summary proceeding.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In stage 2 the State prosecutor, after <Col N="1080" /> an evaluation of the evidence contained in the summary proceeding, makes a formal accusation in writing classifying the crime and proposing a penalty.  The defence lawyer studies this and makes his own proposal in writing.  Once this step has been completed the case comes to public hearing before a tribunal of three judges.</P>
    <P>In Mr. Flynn's case the first stage has been completed for some time.  The State prosecutor is evaluating the evidence, and is expected shortly to present a formal accusation in writing to the tribunal. The Embassy, on my instructions is strongly pressing to have the matter speeded up.</P>
    <P>On 25 April of this year bail of 5,000,000 pesetas (approx. IR£27,000) was set for Mr. Flynn but this has not been availed of.  His lawyers' efforts to reduce the amount of the bail have so far been unsuccessful.</P>
    <P>As I said in reply to Deputy Molony's earlier question, what the Minister of State said at the time was that the case was expected to come up for trial the following month.  In fact it did not reach its second stage until, I think, 25 September last and, to repeat what I said earlier:</P>
    <P>The State prosecutor is evaluating the evidence, and is expected shortly to present a formal accusation in writing to the tribunal.</P>
    <P>Our Embassy in Madrid are pressing to have this done as quickly as possible in an effort to speed up the trial of Mr. Flynn.</P>
    <P>I can assure the Deputy and the House that we are concerned about the length of time this has taken.  But it is another jurisdiction and the person who is charged with the crime must be tried under the laws of that country.  We are endeavouring to ensure that these are speeded up as far as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the Minister has been making representations. My purpose is to highlight what seems to be a dreadful injustice being <Col N="1081" /> done to an Irish national.  Has the Minister had an opportunity to see the book of evidence produced by the Spanish police in relation to Mr. Flynn's case?  If he has, would he agree that it is full of nonsense &mdash; I am not going to go through it again &mdash; matters which I pointed out here on 14 March last?  Would the Minister confirm the information I have, which is that there is no further evidence or information available to the Spanish authorities that would add to the information they had available to them in March last?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not confirm or deny that; I do not know.  I have not personally seen the book of evidence. But I do know that the Embassy and the authorities here have been facilitating whatever evidence was necessary in Mr. Flynn's defence in every way and that that will continue to be the case until he is brought to trial.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>One final point which arises on Question No. 6: in the circumstances of this case would the Minister consider giving special advice and warning to Irish people going to Spain of the draconian measures obtaining there, that people can be incarcerated on suspicion for years without being put on trial?  Is the Minister aware that it is common knowledge, and privately admitted by diplomats in Spain, that if Mr. Flynn's family paid the £30,000 he would never see a trial, or have the opportunity to clear his name, and that he would never get his money back? Would the Minister agree that these matters should be highlighted for the thousands of Irish people who go to Spain each year?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The recent suspension of a wide range of civil liberties by the Government of Nicaragua, the circumstances leading to this action, and the continuing crisis in Central America are <Col N="1083" /> matters of serious concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>As the House is aware, it is the Government's view that the problems of the Central American region can be resolved only by a political agreement coming from within the region itself, which respects the principles of noninterference and inviolability of frontiers. To that end we have, along with our partners in the European Community, supported the Contadora process since its inception as representing the best opportunity to achieve a political solution to the crisis in the region.  It is our fervent hope that the current negotiations on the final text of a Contadora Act for Peace and Co-operation, which have entered a critical phase, will be successful.</P>
      <P>For their part, the member states of the European Community, together with Spain and Portugal, are actively seeking to contribute to a solution to the crisis by underpinning the Contadora process through closer political and economic dialogue with the countries of the region. The Second Conference of Foreign Ministers from Central American and Contadora countries and their Community counterparts will take place next week on 11-12 November in Luxembourg.  The first was held in San José, Costa Rica, in September of last year, when, as President-in-office, it was my privilege to act as co-chairman of the Conference.  The Luxembourg meeting will mark an important stage in the institutionalisation of political dialogue between the two regions.  It will also be the occasion for the signature of a Framework Co-operation Agreement between the European Community and the countries of the Central American isthmus which will provide for closer economic co-operation between both sides.</P>

      <P>As I said in my reply and as the Ten European Community Ministers said in San José last year and again more recently, the best prospect for peace and stability in the Central American region must emanate from the region itself.

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>A reply has been received from the South African authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The terms of the reply are along the lines of the public utterances of South African spokesmen at the time the group were refused admission.  The South African authorities indicated that they have no objection to persons from abroad, including critics, visiting South Africa and that it was to be hoped that the Dunnes' Stores group would clarify their intentions should they still wish to proceed to South Africa.  The reply contained a suggestion that their ambassador <Col N="1085" /> in London would be prepared to meet the group to discuss the matter.  I understand that the strikers have been in contact with the South African Embassy in London regarding obtaining entry for the group into South Africa in the near future.  The Government have already made known to the South African authorities their concern about their action in excluding the group, who were travelling at the invitation of the South African Council of Churches, a body committed to achieving peaceful change in South Africa.  I can assure the Deputy that future developments regarding the group's attempts to visit South Africa will be followed closely by my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the most recent developments in South Africa regarding press and media censorship of events taking place there, does the Minister agree that it is now more important than ever for the Government to step up their efforts to pressurise the South African Government to end apartheid? Does the Minister also agree that part of those efforts should be withdrawal from the &ldquo;no visa arrangement&rdquo; as the treatment of the Dunnes' Stores strikers is a clear example of the manner in which South Africa chooses to ignore this arrangement when it suits her?</P>

I agree with the Deputy that the decision of the South African Government to place restrictions on media and press coverage of the troubles in that country is not an advancement.  Their excuse that much of it has been fabricated rings very hollow as any one who saw the television pictures a fortnight ago of soldiers appearing from boxes and shooting innocent bystanders could not believe that that had been fabricated.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Indications are that while sufficient food is available overall to meet current requirements in the countries of Africa affected by famine in 1984 and earlier this year serious difficulties remain in some areas because of logistical problems.  Significant efforts are being made by the countries concerned, with the support of the international community, to overcome these problems.</P>
      <P>In so far as the future is concerned, the prospects are that the forthcoming harvest will be better as a result of more favourable climatic conditions than has been the case in recent years.  Nevertheless, a continuing relief effort will be required because of the disruptions of the past year.  These disruptions included, population movements in search of food as well as voluntary and organised migrations from arid to more productive areas.  As a result, there has been reduced planting in some areas.  Moreover many vulnerable people do not have the purchasing power to acquire the food which is available.  The main lesson to be drawn from the recent tragic events in Africa is the necessity of enhancing the capacity of the affected countries, and of the international community, to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies of this kind.  In addition there is the fundamental need to address the basic question of development and, in particular, of food production in the countries at risk.</P>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the Irish aid programme is concentrated on four priority countries in Africa and about 50 per cent of our assistance is directed towards agricultural and rural development. The national economic plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> provides for a very significant increase in the resources available to this programme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that some of the agencies involved on the ground in these famine-stricken countries, who advised us of the pending disaster of famine which did take place <Col N="1087" /> eventually last year, are now advising that there will be insufficient food, particularly in Ethopia, as a result of the present crops not being satisfactory? Does the Minister agree that we should pay far more attention to the advice coming from these agencies and, if so, will he ensure that much of the food stocked throughout Europe at a cost of £7,500 million per day should at this early stage be transferred to those countries and held in reserve to alleviate famine when it comes?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Most of the world organisations who are concerned about famine in Africa, including the EC, the World Health Organisation and the United Nations seem to agree with the assessment I have given, that overall there is enough food even though there are problems in specific areas.  Perhaps the Deputy is referring to a report which emerged during the last few days from Concern in this regard.  The director of Concern arrived home the day before yesterday and I have asked the Department to invite him in to discuss the situation. When we have had the benefit of his expertise I will have a clearer picture.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I commend the Minister for his initiative in making arrangements to meet the director of Concern. However, the Minister must surely be aware that some British newspapers had a comprehensive report at the weekend on the situation as I outlined it and they all seem to be certain that there will be another great disaster unless we make a positive and genuine effort to lay on food stocks within these countries.  Does the Minister agree that if we wait until famine occurs we will have the same difficulties to overcome and that many thousands of people will die?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 21 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Following the invasion of Southern Lebanon by Israeli forces in March 1978 the United Nations Security Council decided on 19 March 1978, in the light of the request of the Government of Lebanon, to establish UNIFIL for the purpose of &ldquo;confirming the withdrawal of Israeli forces, restoring international peace and security, and assisting the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the <Col N="1089" /> return of its effective authority in the area&rdquo;.  The mandate of UNIFIL has since been renewed 17 times by the Security Council, most recently on 17 October 1985 to cover the period up to 19 April 1986.</P>
    <P>The Deputy will be aware that UNIFIL has since its inception been prevented from fully discharging its mandate.  In recent months the situation has remained highly unsatisfactory because of the failure of the Israeli authorities to bring to completion their withdrawal from Southern Lebanon and to end their continued support for the South Lebanese army. The Government share the view of the UN Secretary General that the continued involvement of Israel in South Lebanon is contributing to a heightening of tension in the area and thereby adds to the risk of an escalation of violence.  The Government hope that all those with influence on the parties to the conflict will use that influence to press for greater co-operation with UNIFIL by all concerned in the region.</P>
    <P>In agreeing recently to the dispatch of a further contingent for a six-month tour of duty the Government were mindful of the fact that, in spite of the obstacles placed in their path, UNIFIL remains an important and recognised factor for stability in South Lebanon.  It continues to provide a measure of protection for the local population against the activities of armed groups active in the area.  It makes a valuable contribution through the provision of humanitarian assistance. Both the Government of Lebanon and the UN Secretary General have expressed the wish that the force should remain.</P>
    <P>During the period covered by the present mandate the Government will be monitoring carefully the situation on the ground with a view to determining at the appropriate time the nature of our future involvement with the force.  Given the clearly expressed will of the international community that UNIFIL should be facilitated in undertaking the tasks mandated to it, it is of particular importance that progress be made in creating an environment more favourable to the attainment <Col N="1090" /> of this objective.  A particular responsibility lies with the Israeli authorities in this regard.</P>
    <P>As regards the decision of the Netherlands Government to withdraw their contingent, it is not expected that any significant additional burdens will fall on the Irish contingent to UNIFIL following on this decision.  Responsibility for the area of operations previously assigned to the Netherlands contingent has been reallocated to the Fijian and Nepalese battalions.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the primary task of UNIFIL was to oversee the withdrawal of Israel and that has now been completed?  The various communities in Lebanon, Christians, Shi'ites, Sunnis, Druze and others each have their own militia and they look primarily to them to provide protection for their community groups.  Does the Minister not consider in view of the length of time that has expired that the risks of exposure of UNIFIL are greater than the benefits that might apply from their continuing presence there, a view apparently taken by the Netherlands Government? Consequently, when the next review comes up, will the Minister consider taking a step like that adopted by the Netherlands Government?</P>

      <P>We will have to wait until after the six months to see what action the Government will take.  The Government took into account the points of view made by Deputy Taylor when they decided to assign another battalion to the UNIFIL force.  I do not agree with the Deputy when he said that Israeli influence in Southern Lebanon is gone. The Israeli troops may have gone through the southern part of Lebanon to their own country but they have influence especially through the South Lebanese army.  In my opinion and that of many other people in the area, it is not in any sense of the word a force independent of Israeli influence or the Israeli army.  The local populations would certainly wish to see UNIFIL remain because they feel they need protection from these forces. <Col N="1091" /> In other parts of Lebanon there is a little glimmer of hope in the talks that have been going on in the past few weeks under the guidance of the Syrian Government. All of us should wish those talks well and hope that out of them will come a government that can fulfil part of the mandate, namely, that the Lebanese Government should get and maintain full support in their own territory.</P>

    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 24, 37 and 38 together. Fr. Romano has not been seen by his colleagues since 11 July 1985.  Witnesses of his abduction in Cebu in the Philippines said that he had been picked up by men, who, judging by their equipment and the fact that they were driving a car with government licence plates, appeared to be in the military services.</P>
      <P>I am well aware of the concern felt by many people in Ireland and elsewhere at this disappearance.  The Honorary Consul in Manila was instructed to pursue the matter with the Philippine authorities as were our embassies in London and Beijing.  The implications for the safety of Irish missionaries in the area were brought to the attention of the Philippine authorities.  Our embassies in Canberra and Washington were also asked to approach their host countries and request them to use their good offices in relation to the case.</P>
      <P>On the occasion of international conferences in Nairobi and Bangkok the issue was raised with the Philippine representatives, as it was with the Philippine Ambassador to Ireland, who is resident in London, during his recent visit to Dublin.</P>
      <P>The Philippine authorities have at all stages assured us that they are conducting an investigation into Fr. Romano's disappearance and are searching actively for him.  Regrettably we have no firm indication as to his whereabouts.</P>
      <P>The Presidency's representative in Manila raised on behalf of the Ten the case of Fr. Romano with the Philippine authorities, thus acting upon the resolution adopted by the European Parliament on 12 September 1985.</P>

      <P>The second part of the Deputy's question might be considered as an exaggeration, but obviously concern must be expressed for all missionaries in the Philippines, and particularly for the Irish missionaries, in view of what happened last year about their ability under that régime to fulfil their mission.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the progress, if any, which has been made at the inter-governmental meetings reviewing the treaties and political co-operation decided at the last European Council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The work of the intergovernmental conference relating to revisions of the EEC Treaty has focussed particulary on four areas which have been described by the Luxembourg Presidency as &ldquo;the linch-pins of the discussion&rdquo;. These are: the completion of a single internal market and the use of qualified majority voting to make this possible; increasing the economic and social cohesion of the Community; enhancing the role of the European Parliament; and, increasing the executive and management powers of the Commission.</P>
      <P>The Commission has very recently made proposals regarding the further development of the European Monetary System.  This area could also possibly become a central one in the work of the conference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Other Community areas in which the Commission and various member states have submitted proposals include: research and technological development; the environment; cultural co-operation; development aid policy; the question of incorporating a declaration on protection of fundamental human rights in the <Col N="1097" /> treaty; and, the question of differentiated participation by member states in Community activities.</P>
    <P>The Government are taking a positive approach to the work of the conference by tabling proposals, proposing amendments to proposals tabled by others, and by supporting, where appropriate, proposals from others.</P>
    <P>In its work on the question of achieving a single internal market, the conference is focussing on a number of areas where the replacement of an existing unanimity requirement by qualified majority voting would facilitate bringing about that goal. Most member states seem ready to go forward in this regard.  There are, however, particular areas such as the harmonisation of taxation, which are sensitive for this country and for other member states, and in respect of which we and others are seeking to have a requirement for unanimous decisions retained.</P>
    <P>The question of enhancing the role of the European Parliament is one on which it may not prove easy to reach agreement, since some member states are questioning the need for new treaty provisions to achieve this objective.  Various proposals for revisions of the treaty which have been tabled at the conference would give the Parliament stronger influence than at present on the substance of decisions taken by the Council in particular areas of Community activities to be determined. They would also provide that in certain other areas, including the creation of new Community own resources, and treaties to be concluded between the Community and third parties, the agreement of the Parliament would be required before the necessary decisions could be taken.  The Government are taking a broadly positive attitude to both kinds of proposals, while seeking to have taken into account some reservations on particular details of these proposals.</P>
    <P>The conference is also discussing a number of proposals for strengthening the executive and management powers of the Commission.  The Government support this objective.  The Government also have a broadly positive approach to the proposals which have been tabled at <Col N="1098" /> the conference providing for Community policies in the areas of research and technological development and environment, although we have reservations on some of the details and will seek to have these taken into account.</P>
    <P>As part of the Government's approach to the work of the conference we are seeking, together with others who share our concerns, to focus attention on the need to give effective expression, in a revised treaty, to the objective of increasing the economic cohesion of the Community, particularly through the reduction of differences in the levels of economic development as between the regions of the Community, and to provide for the necessary steps in this regard. We have tabled proposals in this sense. There is some cause for satisfaction at the fact that the objective of increasing the cohesion of the Community is now established as one of the main issues in discussions at the conference although opposition has been expressed by some member states to aspects of the Irish proposals and other proposals tabled on the subject.  The Government will seek to ensure that this objective is kept well to the forefront in the work of the Conference.</P>
    <P>It is too early to say whether the results of the conference will be incorporated in amendments to the existing EC Treaty, in a new treaty, or in some other manner.</P>
    <P>As regards the European political co-operation aspects of the intergovernmental conference, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of the Community, meeting on 22 July on foot of the conclusions of the Milan European Council, instructed the Political Committee to draw up &ldquo;the text of a draft treaty on the basis in particular of the Franco-German and United Kingdom drafts concerning political co-operation with a view to a common foreign and security policy&rdquo;. The political directors of the Ten, Spain and Portugal, together with the representative of the Commission have met on a number of occasions and are continuing to work on draft elements of a treaty on European political co-operation.  The aim <Col N="1099" /> is for Foreign Ministers to present proposals to the Luxembourg European Council on 2 and 3 December.</P>
    <P>There has been some discussion of the working methods of European political co-operation and, in particular, the idea has been canvassed by several of our partners that the notion of majority voting in EPC be explored.  However, a substantial number of partners, including Ireland, are firmly attached to the existing consensus principle, which is central to the manner in which European political co-operation functions.</P>
    <P>There appears to be broad agreement on the principle of a secretariat for European political co-operation.  We have made clear our view, which is shared by a number of our partners, that the secretariat should be light and compact. It should be aimed at dealing with practical matters without complicating the existing institutional balance of the Community. We see no advantage in the creation of a cumbersome new institution which, in our view, would not meet the practical needs of European political co-operation.</P>
    <P>On the question of co-ordination on security matters, the Taoiseach clearly identified the guidelines of our approach both at the Milan European Council and during his subsequent statement to this House on the outcome of that meeting.  It is our view that co-ordination on security matters going beyond political and economic aspects should remain outside the framework of European political co-operation. This view is fully understood by our partners.</P>

      <P>I propose to reply to Questions Nos. 28 and 25 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am aware of a recent Bill that passed the US Senate on 19 September, and of the various earlier Bills before the Senate and House of Representatives in recent years.  The Embassy at Washington has <Col N="1101" /> on my instructions kept in regular touch with the US authorities on this matter.</P>
    <P>US immigration rules are based on global quotas, divided into preference categories.  There are no separate national quotas.  The Bill that passed the Senate on 19 September does not therefore provide for increased quotas for Irish citizens.</P>
    <P>With regard to non-immigrant visas, for tourism and business purposes, there are no quotas, national or global.  Each case is dealt with on its merits.</P>
    <P>None of the recent Bills before the Houses of Congress has become law.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the Government have been trying to sweep the question of emigration under the carpet and with the statement in this morning's <i>Irish Independent</i> that the Government still fight shy of the scandal, allowing instead people who are often unskilled and unprepared to end up on the human refuse heap of the world's capital cities?  Would the Minister also agree that there are anything up to 70,000 illegal Irish immigrants in the US and will he state what the Government are trying to do to regularise the situation?  Would the Minister also agree that the present regulations requiring either family connections or skills which are in short supply are too restrictive and that as a result only a tiny proportion of a quota of 20,000 allowed under the 1965 Act is actually being used?</P>

    <P>Question again proposed: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Before the adjournment of the debate I was dealing with the possibilities that will arise as a result of this legislation in relation to job opportunities. I made the point that, contrary to what has been said, the Bill is quite wide ranging in that there will not be a restriction in terms of the type of enterprise the <Col N="1205" /> corporation might invest in.  The definition of &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; is quite broad.  In the course of his speech the Minister said:</P>
      <P>Opportunities exist in all sectors of industry, manufacturing, services, tourism, agriculture, natural resources and so on.</P>
      <P>He said the NDC will be in the unique position of being able to exploit all such opportunities, that it will be able to find gaps in the market place which private enterprise is not exploiting and will be empowered to establish a business on its own initiative to meet that demand.</P>
      <P>That makes a nonsense of the arguments put forward by Fianna Fáil speakers when objecting to the Bill.  On the last occasion I said I could not understand the objections of Members opposite because the public sector wanted to get involved in job creation, something it will be able to do under the Bill.  The public sector will be empowered to do that in partnership with the private sector in joint ventures or in co-operation with State-sponsored commercial enterprises. That augurs well for the future in the area of job creation, given the enormous problems we have in that area.  It also redresses a balance that has not been looked at in the area of equal opportunity in recent years.  It recognises something that has been ignored in the last five or ten years &mdash; the enormous growth in our young population &mdash; and gives us an opportunity to indicate how the huge number of jobs that will be needed in coming years, if we are to employ the greater proportion of our young population, are to be created.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Opposition contributors, particularly Deputies Flynn and Reynolds, were critical of the mention of investment in the area of natural resources because it had been suggested that that provision would get us out of the Bula-Tara problem.  We are aware that difficulties have arisen in regard to that deal and that there is a danger that 400 jobs will not be provided for want of a very modest investment. The failure to bring Bula into production is due solely to delays in processing planning applications, initially at Meath <Col N="1206" /> County Council level and, latterly, by the opposition orchestrated by the multinational Tara.  As a result, permission was not granted until the end of June. Recently that company got in the way of the coming into production of the Bula mine with its offer to the Government for a takeover which was to be completed in January.  That did not happen.  The important point I made in regard to that deal is that Bula, not Tara, now has the richest zinc-metal ore body in Europe with a life of about 25 years whereas Tara still has 20 years to run.  The nature of investment in mining is long term and the likelihood is that if Tara succeeds in scuttling the Bula deal the metal will stay in the ground for the next 25 years with Tara using it as a bank.  As a result not a single job will be created.</P>
    <P>To date Tara have taken ore worth £800 million out of the country and not a single penny of revenue has been paid to the State.  If the deal with Bula is allowed to collapse &mdash; Bula is a totally Irish-owned company &mdash; not a single job will be provided in the next 20 years and the £10 million the State has invested will be lost.  The State at present has a 49 per cent stake in it and we should remember that.  The Tara offer to take over by assuming £22 million of its debt was designed to thwart the implementation of the bankers' trust lead project.  The viability of the mine, which is mentioned in the Bill, is not in doubt because the bankers' trust was prepared to organise a £96 million package last spring.  It is now intended to reactivate an independent development.  My passing reference to that deal is for the purpose of making a request to the Minister to give Bula a little more time.  I am not talking about a few months&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will go back to the Bill when I have finished the sentence, if the Chair does not mind.  A little more time should be given so that the loan, which was scuttled by a multinational company <Col N="1207" /> that does not have any interest in providing jobs or revenue or doing anything for the State, can be reactivated.</P>
      <P>I do not know what all the fuss is about in regard to the Bill.  What we need is massive job creation and that can be done only by providing huge sums of money and opportunities and confidence.  The State must become involved because the private sector does not always want to or is not always able to become involved in certain areas.  The banking sector are also not inclined to do so.  In a recent debate on the Finance Bill I referred to the banks' decision to levy small businesses regarding expansion loans.  At that time I quoted Mr. Hely-Hutchinson, chairman of the Bank of Ireland, as saying that it was just not possible for a bank, using investors' funds, to continue this type of business without adequate compensation. There were really only two alternatives: first, that the banks be subsidised to provide loans which they did not consider to be safe or, secondly, as I said then, that the State should get into those risk areas.  What is said in this House is often soon forgotten.  Many complained against the banking sector that it was the only institution which did not help out during the recession but foreclosed on people and called in loans, refusing to become involved in the risk area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Fianna Fáil have been unfair in their failure to acknowledge that the Labour Party pressed for incentives and initiative on the part of the Government to fill this gap.  This legislation makes a good start at adequately filling that gap.  What Ireland needs, as some Minister said, is not a Day for Ireland but a whole generation who will work to get the country back on its feet.  If you want a generation to become involved in lifting the economy and the country and in preventing massive emigration, you have to provide the required resources.  It is only by providing amounts such as that provided in this Bill that you can think about doing that.  For example, a project which took up the total amount involved here for a commercial construction venture, given the figure mentioned in the national plan for job creation, <Col N="1208" /> which is £6,125 to create every public sector job&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>By this means you could create 4,000 jobs.  If a multiple of three or four times this amount were available as many as 20,000, with 8,500 construction jobs, could be created.</P>

    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Let the Deputy not get excited for a moment.  These are the figures which will help us to solve our problem.  If we have not the imagination to become so involved, we will not solve those problems at all.  The day is gone when you could take up a small venture, build an office block, rent it to your friends and get a few people working, or create an industry in a town or a part of a city and make many people happy.  We have a very serious national problem in the numbers of unemployed.  We have the beginning of emigration, young as well as old.  During the fifties and sixties they were leaving Ireland at the rate of 20,000 per year.  The people who then emigrated to England in boat loads were the unemployed workers who had nothing.  However, in the last two years that is not the type of person who is emigrating, because countries will not let in unskilled people at the moment because they have not jobs for their own. The people we are losing today are the educated, skilled, technical people.  The unrest that should have taken place in the fifties and sixties did not because of this emigration and so socialism did not materialise at that time.  Most of the people in that category will remain in Ireland now.  Their anger has been demonstrated in the last year and they are not prepared to stand idly by and wait while Members of Parliament twiddle their thumbs and come up with job answers for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the coming years you will find a very well articulated protest similar to the present one on the part of the public <Col N="1209" /> service and teachers and also on the part of the unemployed and the PAYE sector in the last couple of weeks.  We must try great initiatives to get, not hundreds of people back to work but tens of thousands.</P>
    <P>Anybody who has looked closely at the IDA method of job creation and their announcement of job numbers over the last few years will have noticed that they have abandoned talking about how much below target they were.  This is mainly because they have not been able to reach their targets.  Now they lump together, say, 150 jobs created in perhaps ten different areas of the country.  What is needed now is massive initiative and that will only be got by massive private investment or a combination of public and private investment.  Investment from the private sector would be of greater benefit to the economy because there is a negative cost involved and for every job created in the private sector we get back £6,125 while for every job created in the public sector there is a cost of £3,125.</P>
    <P>This is an important start and I would like to encourage it.  In Dublin, with the greatest population, we have the biggest problem.  No great schemes have come forward since I came to this House, or in the last ten years.  Dublin is a sleeping giant and the will to waken it is not there. If it is, it has not been demonstrated. However, there have been successes elsewhere that I have looked at in my research for this debate.  There are two cities in Canada with which I am very familiar, one with a population of 2,000,000 and the other of 500,000.  By investing heavily in the city centre of the bigger of those two cities an enormous number of jobs has been created in providing major shopping centres.  One of these cities is Toronto and the other Edmonton, Alberta.  These have become major travel and shopping centres for North America.  There is no reason why a city such as Dublin, on a river, should not be equally a major city for travel from the United Kingdom and from Ireland. The initiative has been stolen from us, but &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; is not the right word.  We have been asleep.  A city which has had <Col N="1210" /> terrible problems for the last ten years is away ahead of us.  Belfast has already decided to invest £300 million in its downtown area.  We could do a similar thing. Edmondton has a population of 500,000 people but by promoting its location in an aggressive and successful manner it has developed to the extent that this little-known city has brought 50,000 jobs in the supply service to the city.  That could be done in Dublin to save it from falling into the river because it is so dilapidated. Nobody seems to be doing much about it, although a study is going on at UCD.  Twenty years ago a study was undertaken by British consultants who said that Dublin would be judged by what was done along the quays.  Of course nothing has been done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill and congratulate those who pressed for it.  There are many possibilities under this Bill.  The powers and objects of the Bill are worth enumerating because of the criticisms that have been levelled at it.  It was supposed to have been a sop to the Labour Party. That is nonsense but, at the time, I must congratulate the elements within the Labour Party who have fought for this Bill.  Deputy Mervyn Taylor and others, including the former Deputy Noel Browne, have pointed out that the private sector in many senses has failed because it has not come up with all the answers.  It is madness to ignore the great muscle of the public sector, given the amount of money that it squanders on useless projects which do not provide any long-term jobs.</P>
    <P>The 1 per cent levy has brought in about £90 million and the amount of money which has been put back into youth projects is very limited.  Anyone who examines these projects will see that some of them of questionable worth are given tens of thousands to provide temporary jobs for a supervisor and a few people in districts all over the country. That is as bad as the one-off jobs that the Minister for Finance is fond of complaining about.  Perhaps I had better withdraw that in case he did not say it.  I have heard <Col N="1211" /> people say it is as bad as providing one-off jobs in areas such as housing where no jobs remain when the houses are finished.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill the State will provide up to £300 million for projects such as joint capital ventures in co-operation with State-sponsored commercial enterprises. The corporation will be required to act in a commercial manner and investments may be made only in enterprises which are profitable and efficient and have a reasonable prospect of profitability. These criteria already apply in the private sector and it is important that we should insist that these criteria should operate in the future.</P>
    <P>We all have worries and hang-ups about red tape and bureaucracy, stone walling and the damage that can be done by people who have not the imagination or the grasp of business to get on with projects.  One wonders how this will succeed at all if it is not in the private sector. We have learned a lot over the past few years and parliamentary committees have in certain respects become very successful watchdogs over the spending of public money, particularly the Committee of Public Accounts and the committees examining the spending of State bodies.  This Government have made it almost a cause to cut out squandering and wastage of taxpayers' money.  In the past decade or two we as a people have also learned much, mainly through our involvement in the European Community, wider travel, and the tremendous success of Irish entrepreneurs and bodies such as CTT and the IDA who are spread worldwide and whose enormous experience enables them to compete with the best in the world.  That expertise can be put to use.</P>
    <P>Deputy Flynn was worried about the revolving investment fund for employment under section 10 (1) (k) which states:</P>
    <P>to establish and maintain (as soon as practicable after the vesting day) an investment fund which shall be known as &ldquo;the Revolving Investment Fund for Employment&rdquo;, into which there shall <Col N="1212" /> be paid any moneys realised by the Corporation on investments, dividends paid to the Corporation and, subject to any directives issued by the Minister under section 31 (2), any profits accruing to the Corporation and which shall be used for the purposes for which the Corporation is established.</P>
    <P>The main objection raised by Deputy Flynn seemed to be to the phrase &ldquo;subject to any directives issued by the Minister under section 31 (2)&rdquo;.  He felt that the Minister could use this power to empty the coffers of the NDC and that projects which got off the ground would be sold off fairly quickly.  Section 31 (2) states:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, direct that the profits of the Corporation, in any year in which a directive is made under this section, be applied in such a manner as may be specified in the directive.</P>
    <P>The Minister is given power but the task which has been set is not an easy one. The corporation will have to start projects from scratch, get them going and make them profitable.  That is what private enterprise is all about and it is no mean task to perform.</P>
    <P>It does not give Members of this House much credit for intelligence if anyone imagines that millions of pounds will be spent to start a company from scratch and that it will then be flogged off at a rock bottom price within a few months to the private sector.  It is very unlikely that successful ventures will be disposed of very quickly.  The revolving fund is a great idea in that it will provide more money on a continuing basis in the light of the experience built up in selecting and creating new ventures.  Given that this decade's technology will be out of date in the next decade, we cannot sit back and expect that jobs created this year will be still going in ten years' time.  Over a period of ten to 12 years 95 per cent of all businesses fail completely.  People should remember that fact when trying to create jobs in difficult times, especially <Col N="1213" /> when we are relying so much on multinational companies to provide them for us and when we have Deputies Reynolds and Flynn trying to promote a multinational company like Tara with the help of Government and Irish investment. That is an enterprise which will not give a single extra job.  I would ask Deputy Reynolds why is he pushing Tara, why is he pushing Bula, all the time?</P>

      <P>Section 31 (2) provides power for the Minister to issue directives. The Minister should retain that power because the objective of the Bill is to have a successful operation.  However, I caution the Minister not to expect too much.  If you sell off your successes you will highlight your failures, and there will be failures by this corporation.  I do not think it is a good idea to sell off good projects easily and quickly.  I share the concern of Deputies about red tape. People have found it difficult to get things through Departments, particularly those of Energy and Labour.  We have had long experience of the IDA and I am sure we can get over this problem in regard to the NDC.  I should like to think that this would encourage private investors from within and outside the country, but I share Deputy Keating's concern about the provision of money for projects. Unfortunately, taxation levels here are so high that investment is unattractive for many people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would not limit the corporation in the way proposed in the Bill.  The Minister said it would develop new markets and strengthen existing Irish industry.  He said it would compete with companies being operated from other countries.  It is stated that the corporation would become involved in industrial undertakings and commercial enterprises ancillary to industrial undertakings, with certain exceptions, such as banking, insurance, advertising, public relations.  I do not understand the reference to businesses ancillary to industry because they would include construction projects which could <Col N="1214" /> get involved in the revitalising and the rebuilding of the inner cities in Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway.  I do not see why the Bill should propose to restrict the corporation in this respect.</P>
    <P>The commercial criteria are important. It is important that we would have a constant stream of funds available for the corporation, which will stand apart from the IDA.  I have heard people saying they are starved of capital and the IDA will not help them.  This corporation will fill a gap which has been there.  The corporation can examine such companies and take equity in them in return for investment. The IDA are not empowered to do that.</P>
    <P>The Bill has been brought forward with caution &mdash; much consideration was given to it.  We should consider the figure of £300 million.  It has been said that it costs more than £6,000 to provide a job in the public sector.  The figure mentioned in the Bill would provide 50,000 jobs.  That is what we require and it would be throwing in the towel if we said we could not come up with such job numbers as 50,000.  If we cannot do that we are sounding the death knell of the country. This is the late 20th century.  We have been on our knees for the past 100 years. We have had independence during the last 50 years.  We had an industrial boom in the sixties but in the early seventies we were faced with oil crises and we are still trying to recover from the blows struck by ourselves because of lack of performance. In the mid-seventies our young population blossomed and we took pride in the fact that we produced so many children that we had the youngest population in the world.  However, we did not provide jobs or recreational facilities for them in the eighties.  We have enormous problems now, crippling our economy, devastating our way of life, destroying the morale of the adult population, wiping out the values built up over centuries. All of this has happened within a short space of time.  The gauntlet has been thrown down.  The significance of the provisions of this Bill will become apparent only over the next year or two. I hope it will prove to be a forerunner <Col N="1215" /> in the learning process, teaching us to produce something no other country in Europe has been able to do, that is, tens of thousands of jobs, thereby reducing the unemployment level of 250,000 to a level with which we could live.  That is the reason I welcome its provisions.  I know very few people in the private sector would risk the money involved here, indeed who could afford to become involved in these areas that the banking sector has failed totally to tackle.</P>
    <P>This Bill highlights for us one important factor: that we cannot depend on anybody else to get us out of our present difficulties.  It was found that the farmers could not rely on the banks any more than could the industrialist or small businessman, as was clearly demonstrated earlier this year when the proposed levy on small businesses was later withdrawn because of fears of its unpopularity. I shall not go into the reasons that the banks cannot be relied on.  We must become involved ourselves in the risk area and the provisions of this Bill enable us to do so.  Its provisions have not been treated seriously by the few Members I have heard contribute from the far side of the House.  They spoke about white elephants, bureaucracy, red tape, disasters and ideologies.  They have very short memories because they should remember that they set up some such projects themselves, some former Ministers I have heard rightly praising certain semi-State companies that were established.</P>
    <P>When I have endeavoured to be constructively critical of certain ventures I have been castigated by Opposition Members.  One must ask: to what are they objecting?  They are objecting to investment in jobs.  They try to pass it off by contending that it is an exercise by way of appeasement of the Labour Party, that it is the Labour Party endeavouring to appease their voters.  I have said many times over the past year that what is required is imagination, massive job creation and confidence in ourselves so that we as a nation can solve our problems.  I have said that what is needed is a whole generation.  That generation is waiting <Col N="1216" /> outside seeking money, investment.  We have taken the plunge.  To begin with there is up to £300 million with which to become involved in projects.  If necessary we can travel the road ourselves alone, or jointly with others.  We will take equity participation.  We are prepared to look at almost anything.  We will take on any opposition emanating from foreign countries.</P>
    <P>This Bill is by way of being a self-help project, demonstrating that at last somebody has listened.  Remember the door has been hammered over the past few years by the same people who criticise. As somebody who was heavily involved in private enterprise, I must confess to having had fears and doubts about any such proposal.  Having studied the provisions of this Bill, having thought about their possibilities, all of those fears and doubts have been allayed.  I am of opinion that we have come up with something really unique.  This may well prove to be the forerunner of a saving of the economy and the retention of our people as a whole.  This nation cannot go forward with half of its people, nor with a third, retired, redundant with the remaining one-sixth or one-ninth working.  We need to have all of our young population working. We cannot accelerate or augment the leisure programmes at present available to such people, activities they are taking up because they have not got work to which to apply their minds.  We cannot risk allowing our young people to continue to become involved in the kinds of leisure activities that are permissible, acceptable, not sufficiently frowned on here, such as the gaming business, the drink industry, the incredible £1,200 million we spend on drink, the £300 every member of the population spends on it. To be selfish about the issue for a moment, let us remember the fantastic cost to the nation as a result of the sickness brought about by excessive drinking.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the problem but it has nothing whatever to do with the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;could amount to as much as £900 million had we not such waste.  The provisions of this Bill represent leadership in a different sense. Deputy Gene Fitzgerald may laugh but his colleague, Deputy Flynn, was very upset about its provisions.  I do not know why Deputies opposite are so upset by the provisions of this Bill, but they are. If it does not represent leadership, what does it represent? The money involved could be one billion, or £1,000 million, but it represents a start.  If young people are to work, taking advantage of all of the technology referred to in the provisions of this Bill, then they will not continue to be preoccupied with leisure activities, ruining their health, increasing the cost of our health services.</P>
      <P>There are many implications in the Bill and it is a great vote of confidence in the future.  Because of that, I should like to stress the importance of those who will be entrusted with the task of setting up these businesses and investing this money.  They should think carefully about the work they are doing because they are entrusted with a very important task.  The future of many people will depend on their efforts because they will be able to provide many jobs, depending on how they carry out their task.</P>
      <P>There is a precautionary element in the Bill in that the Minister is retaining &mdash; as in the case of the Minister for Communications in regard to air fees &mdash; the right to invest money in projects brought forward. They must be good projects and nobody will be careless about investing £300 million.  The money will be given out piecemeal and the projects will have to be good.  I am sure that the IDA will be available for consultation and may be for participation and they are regarded internationally as nobody's fool.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1218" /> The Bill also helps to redress an imbalance in the area of equal opportunities. This is providing opportunity.  We have been very restricted in the past in the area of careers and equal opportunities do not exist.  The Bill is a step in the right direction and because control comes from the National Development Corporation they will work nationally and will give people in every town and village an opportunity to work and settle in their own areas.  It does not matter where they live.</P>
    <P>Another important factor to which nobody has alluded is that even if the total amount, £300 million, was spent it would not just provide the direct jobs that such money invested would bring about.  It would indirectly provide many more jobs because there are always spinoffs. If you spend a sum of £100 million on a shopping centre, offices and a recreation area, extra jobs will be provided in the construction industry as 90 per cent of materials are Irish.  There will also be jobs in the services sector and in other industries.  There is a spin-off all down the line and an economist would need to examine it to explain it fully.  There will certainly be a spin-off in clothing, carpet, painting and lighting factories.  It is not just limited to the amount of jobs which a certain sum of money will provide.  It also encompasses the spin-off areas which I mentioned.  If there were various sums of this size invested, you could very quickly build up to tens of thousands of jobs which would certainly stop the rot. Given that our finances are in good order and that controls are in place, it would not take more than a few years to get us out of our difficulties.</P>
    <P>Even if I started as a sceptic, having objectively examined the Bill I can see no fault in it.  It will do what it sets out to achieve.  It is well structured and provides a wide range of opportunities within which to invest.  It is not too restricted, apart from restrictions to which I referred, and there are enough safeguards to ensure that there will not be any waste.  Their method of expending money is so controlled as to be able to mitigate losses.  There will be a build-up <Col N="1219" /> of information from their portfolio over a number of years so, within a few years, their successes can be monitored.  Their flexibility and boldness in setting out to create jobs in a suffering economy makes nonsense of the Fianna Fáil objections which I heard to date.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeneFitzgerald" hpid="Mr. Gene Fitzgerald Mr. Gene Fitzgerald">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Gene Fitzgerald</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Deputy Skelly, I have absolute confidence in the vast majority of our young people who in their leisure pursuits are unlike those whom Deputy Skelly knows. They are involving themselves to a welcome increasing extent in leisure activities of a fine, clean and healthy nature.  I cite as evidence the Cork and Dublin city marathons, increased athletic activity, games being played and the increased need for community centres.  It is a wonderful development and I do not share Deputy Skelly's view that the vast majority of our young people are following the wrong leisure pursuits.</P>
      <P>Legislation needs to be analysed to ascertain its aims, who will benefit and what it will replace.  I say there is nothing for young people in what the Government are proposing in this case.  There are no jobs.  Second, there will be no increased economic activity as a result of this measure and, third and most important, there will not be a restoration of confidence in the ordinary people. These three points must merit consideration from us in this House.  That is why my party have decided, very wisely, that this measure is a combination of ideological nonsense and a public relations exercise on the part of an ailing Government. It is an effort to provide a new promotional image, to sell a Government who have lost their way very badly where jobs for young people, confidence in our economy and economic activity are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here I must refer to the handlers. Today in this House we had the case in which a Member of the House drew to the attention of the Chair but was not allowed to raise in the House the way a handler of this Government tried to <Col N="1220" /> convey a completely dishonest story of something that happened six years ago in an effort to damage the image of a member of this party.  What the Government are proposing in this Bill has much to do with their efforts to get a new image.  If a Government have to resort to these dishonest tactics &mdash; I am sorry Deputy Skelly left the House so quickly because I wanted to outline my knowledge of the history of this measure &mdash; because of opinion polls, the recent local elections and because of their knowledge that their fortunes are waning rapidly, they are wasting the time of the House. I suggest that what is proposed for the NDC could be looked after by existing agencies in most cases and where that is not possible there could be minor amending legislation.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly referred to the IDA and the great role they play.  I have supported and continue to support that authority in their efforts at job creation and industrial promotion.  They have done a very good job but times are different now.  There is need to look at the whole area of industrial promotion and at the functions and role of an authority like the IDA. Because of technological development, I suggest that any new types of industry may not be as long-lasting as the traditional industries that were set up in the past decades.  There may well be a more limited cycle of life for the new type of industry we will attract.  I hope it will not be too short, although in a few cases there have been disappointments. We will have to take into account the fact that there may be a limited life for industries that do not adapt or change in accordance with technological development.  In fact, Europe as a whole seems to have lagged behind America and Japan in the matter of job creation while taking account of advances in technology.  If there is need to amend existing legislation this party will support it in any way possible.  Young people deserve more honest Government and they deserve more beneficial and well thought out measures than those set out in this Bill.</P>
    <P>The National Development Corporation has been around for the past ten or <Col N="1221" /> 12 years in various shapes and forms.  The idea was first floated in the mid-term of the Coalition Government of 1973-77. Since that time four Labour Party leaders, several general secretaries and a host of Labour Party political advisers have come and gone.  In that time the thinking behind the proposal has not become more concise or beneficial.  There is no clearer idea now regarding the direction the NDC will take than was the case when it was first mooted some ten or 12 years ago.  I will cite a parallel to illustrate the point I am making.  It is something about which everyone in this House is complaining; in fact, I warned the Minister what would happen in 1981.  I am talking about the Youth Employment Agency. We are told there is an ovelap of functions and that there is a need for an umbrella organisation.  Yet, in 1981 in this House we were told that the YEA would act in that umbrella agency capacity and would embrace all the other organisations. What happened was different: another tier was set up.  The agency was born in the same way as the NDC, a product of a marriage after an election when two parties came together.</P>
    <P>Since the YEA was set up there have been changes at the level of chief executive and chairman.  There was a kind of incest in the way the type of people concerned were appointed.  I will not go beyond that.  I hope there will not be a similar approach with regard to the NDC. I hope it will not be a case of appointing people close to the two parties concerned. I hope the Chair will allow me one brief diversion.  The Minister appointed his entitled number of people to the Cork Harbour Board and for the first time in 23 years not one person was appointed from what I would describe as the lower Cork Harbour area because party people had to be accommodated who had no relation to the harbour board.  When I refer to the lower Cork Harbour Board area I refer to Rochestown, Passage, Monkstown and Ringaskiddy. I will not go into that matter any further.</P>
    <P>At the time I made it very clear to the Minister that not enough thought had <Col N="1222" /> gone into the Youth Employment Agency.  I am afraid the same thing will happen in the case of the NDC.  Everyone in the House agrees we have a plethora of agencies.  Deputy Skelly spoke at length about this £300 million.  I do not know what period is involved but I will throw out one figure to the House.  In a period of about six years the various agencies have spent about £5 billion in job creation. I understand there are probably about 50,000 fewer employed in manufacturing industry today than there were six years ago. While I welcome any expenditure on job creation, Deputy Skelly should not get carried away with the idea that this money would be a cure for all our ills or that this was opening a bright new horizon which will help us solve all our problems.</P>
    <P>If anybody is to be complimented for preparing this legislation it is the draftsmen, because I referred to this earlier as being ideological nonsense.  I think these draftsmen were brilliant.  They tried to appease both Government parties by throwing them sprats.  The National Development Corporation was first promised more than 12 years ago and it is now being introduced three years into the life of this Government.  I suggest that the timing of the introduction of this Bill has something to do with the next election, because many Government Deputies know there is no need for this corporation.  They know that, if this corporation had been set up some time before the next election, it would have been seen to have been a failure.  This Bill is being introduced near election time so that the Government parties will be able to say to the electorate that they set up this corporation which will cure all our ills.</P>
    <P>Four years ago I spoke to the Minister opposite about the Youth Employment Agency and told him what would happen. Everybody accepts that what I predicted happened, and the same will apply in this case.  The previous speaker rambled all over the place.  He spoke about the Tara Mines and Bula Mines at length and more than once, but if he reads the debates in this House in the middle seventies he will <Col N="1223" /> see the warnings issued at that time by our spokesman.</P>
    <P>Section 3 (1) reads:</P>
    <P>Every body specified in the First Schedule to this Act shall be a State-sponsored body for the purposes of this Act.</P>
    <P>Now, I look at the First Schedule which lists a number of State-sponsored bodies but some are omitted. There may be good reasons for their omission, but I am not sure about that.  I would like to know why AnCO, the Industrial Training Authority or the Youth Employment Agency are not listed.  I want the Minister in his reply to give me these reasons.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is one of the most important sections in the Bill and outlines the principal objects of the corporation.  There are many subsections to this section.  I want to warn Labour Deputies who may think they got what they were looking for that I suspect Fine Gael traditional members have succeeded in inserting a clause which will help their Minister for Finance to pull the plug whenever he wishes. Section 10 (1) (a) reads:</P>
    <P>to invest, in consultation, where appropriate, with State-sponsored bodies, in any enterprise (including any enterprise which is wholly or partly owned by a State-sponsored commercial enterprise) which, in the opinion of the Corporation, is profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient and has reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment;</P>
    <P>The final clause is a strong clause which is included in almost every paragraph. The Minister may say my question is hypothetical, but supposing this corporation had already been in existence, would he have been able to use it instead of appointing a receiver, as he did, to Irish Shipping?  Who decides on the &ldquo;reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment&rdquo;?  The reason <Col N="1224" /> I ask this question is as follows.  Many Deputies have experience of making representations to Fóir Teoranta on behalf of companies in their own area.  I accept that the remit of Fóir Teoranta is laid down by statute, but we have all experience of experts being brought in, and they differed as to the future profitability, viability or employment prospects of that company.  Are we going to have the same type of battle in this case as we have with Fóir Teoranta?  Admittedly they do their best and have helped many industries but there is no reason why, if a little flexibility were given to them and the statute amended, they could not carry out many of the functions we are discussing here today.</P>
    <P>Section 10 (1) (j) reads:</P>
    <P>to encourage investment (other than by financial inducement) in any enterprise in which the Corporation has assisted (financially or otherwise) and to encourage investment (other than by financial inducement) in any enterprise of which the Corporation is a holding company;</P>
    <P>How does one encourage investment?  To say that you should encourage investment but that there can be no financial inducement is contradictory.  Is it not true that if encouragement is being given to a hardheaded business investor he will expect that encouragement to be of a financial nature?  In my view that is a bit like Tweedledum and Tweedledee.  It reads well when drafted.  Well done draftsmen.</P>
    <P>Section 13 outlines the general duty of the corporation and reads:</P>
    <P>It shall be the general duty of the Corporation&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) to assist in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State, and</P>
    <P>(b) to carry out its objects, which shall include the realisation of investments made by it as soon as is financially and commercially prudent, in such a manner as to enable the Corporation to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by it and <Col N="1225" /> ensure that funds are available to the Revolving Investment Fund for Employment.</P>
    <P>I say that paragraphs (a) and (b) are contradictory although the Minister will say they are not.  This further strengthens my case that there was a deliberate effort made here to placate both sides by a good dose of verbiage.  The Minister and his advisers will say that this is not contradictory and, in theory, they may be right but in hard, practical and real terms, it is a contradiction and let nobody try to tell me otherwise.  The Minister and his advisers know what I am saying is true and the Labour Party will know it to their cost in time to come.</P>
    <P>Now we come to the real whipping boy, the real boss.  Who is the real boss?  He is still in Merrion Street because in section 20, which deals with temporary borrowings by the corporation, we are told:</P>
    <P>The Corporation may, with the consent of the Minister given with the approval of the Minister for Finance, borrow temporarily either by arrangements...</P>
    <P>I pointed out constraints earlier, but that is the biggest one of all.  If Merrion Street says one can borrow, one can, and that Bill might as well be not here at all.  That is the harsh reality.  There is no point in saying that it is in all legislation, because it is not.  This is a millstone around the hopes and aspirations of people like Deputy Skelly to whom I listened.  I am concerned, with good reason, about this further layer of bureaucracy.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Skelly's point that the Bill will help all parts of the country. I have a terrible feeling that Administrations are beginning to forget that there are regions outside of the capital and that is very serious.  What will this Bill be able to do, for example, for Verolme Dockyard?  The Minister will remember that closure which affected a fine workforce with very advanced skills in an already badly hit Cork region.  The yard and the workforce are still there but there has not been alternative employment and they still have the skills and equipment.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1226" /> Will the Minister give me some assurances on what the NDC can do for Verlome Dockyard and how does he see it within the strictures laid down in section 10?  We know that it was advertised for tender and that the response was not very encouraging.  I am concerned that the receiver was allowed to advertise in such a way that it could be sold off in lots.  I objected to that on the basis that being sold off in lots could mean the breaking up of the yard and the end of hope for future boatbuilding and boat repairing there.  How does the Minister visualise this corporation being able to resurrect work at Verolme Dockyard?</P>
    <P>It is three years since this Government took office and this idea has been floating around for ten or 12 years.  Why has it taken so long to introduce this legislation? What makes it more urgent now than the simple legislation for Cork free port which we were promised since May of last year?  The task force reported in May 1984 and we were told that we would have it almost immediately.  It is now November 1985.  If we are serious about unemployment and job creation, surely we should have introduced this legislation earlier, those agreed measures rather than controversial measures.</P>
    <P>We have several agencies, the IDA, the ICC, Fóir Teoranta, the National Manpower Service, AnCO, and the Youth Employment Agency, all filling a role.  This new corporation will also fill a role and their main function, we are given to understand, will be providing jobs. Despite all the agencies we already have, we are not providing the jobs; we are constantly losing jobs.  We spent £5 billion over six years and we are 50,000 manufacturing jobs worse off.  The establishment of another agency is no guarantee. However, we are setting up a new bureaucracy operating without an umbrella which we all accept is badly needed.  There is a need for incentives to encourage the profit motive, to give the businessman a chance.  We need jobs urgently.</P>
    <P>I accept that we want bigger enterprises but I do not agree with Deputy Skelly, as I know that small is wonderful. <Col N="1227" /> I am glad the Minister referred to small enterprises.  In the US, big though they are, they have made very big strides in the provision of jobs in small industries. We are setting up a new layer of bureaucracy and, at the same time, we are cutting back on education, agriculture, the health services and in many other areas. I would be all for it if I thought the end result would be good.  However, this is inspired purely by a combination of ideological nonsense and a PR exercise for an ailing Government.</P>
    <P>The food technology area needs to be developed.  There is no reason why the IDA working with other agencies could not do it provided needed amendments are made to give them more flexibility in their operations.  In relation to the timing of this legislation it is reported that we are to have a break up of CIE.  It might not happen in the way envisaged, but the cutdown of activity in CIE is frightening. In my constituency I frequently hear of bus services being cut off and numbers being reduced.  Basically we are seeing the break up of CIE.  We also hear of the selling off of our forests.  Thank God our party said no.  We liquidated Irish Shipping and allowed Verolme to close. Having done all that we are setting up a new bureaucracy, a panacea to cure all our future ills.  It is a very political exercise, very late in the life of this Government.</P>
    <P>The previous speaker referred to project identification.  There is no doubt that we have funds.  Bank managers tell us that they are depressed, that there are no applications for finance, that people have not the confidence to invest, to expand and to employ, but project identification is very important.  It is all very well to talk about starting a venture, but the problem of project identification is there. Whatever complaints we had about the IDA, they were excellent in the area of project identification.</P>
    <P>Only two weeks ago in the European Parliament we had a debate on counterfeit goods.  I participated in that debate. I drew to the attention of the European Parliament the fact that counterfeiters <Col N="1228" /> were doing a great deal of harm and were estimated to have cost many jobs in the Community.  I have no doubt that they have cost us jobs here too.  However, the fact that a product is counterfeited, illegal though it be and I must condemn it, is probably a tribute to the original producer of that product.</P>
    <P>I have referred to the way our Irish cream liqueurs have been counterfeited, in particular Baileys.  In a continental licensed premises I saw Baileys Irish cream and a little away from it was a bottle that was almost identical with it; from a distance it was absolutely identical. I wondered why two bottles of what appeared to be the same liqueur were on the same shelf but not together.  When I moved closer I found that one was an imitation, a counterfeit, with a slight change in the name of Baileys but everything else, the colour of the label, the shape of the bottle, identical.  I understand that a court case is pending.</P>
    <P>However, the point I wish to make is that here was a tremendous success.  Here was a project identified from our milk base followed by other excellent products from the many co-operatives.  They have all been very successful and it is tragic that they are being counterfeited.  If any solace is to be gained from this illegal practice, it is that it is a compliment to the people who are so successful in producing, marketing and exporting the products so extensively.  A major area of importance for any agency, existing or new, is the identification of projects and how the products can be produced, marketed and used beneficially for the good of the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the discussion with the banks.  I was amazed at how Deputy Skelly roamed all over the place from Bula Mines to Tara Mines and mines everywhere else, particularly when I noticed that my colleague and our spokesman on employment, Deputy Lyons, had tremendous difficulty and was interrupted constantly by the Ceann Comhairle when he quoted from various newspaper and magazine articles pointing out the arguments and the differences of opinion between the Minister for <Col N="1229" /> Energy and the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.  Apparently the two were quoted in many newspapers as having completely different ideologies and approaches to this measure. However, the draftsman succeeded in pacifying both of them but at the end of the day has found a product that is of no use, no benefit to the young people who need to benefit and need support very quickly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Skelly referred to the emigrants and the unemployed who have lost their jobs.  There is no doubt about the growth of illegal emigration to the US which at present is given as about 60,000 or 70,000 people.  There are two types of emigration.  We have the educated person with languages and marketing skills who is anxious to go abroad for a short period or longer, and that person is quite entitled to that freedom.  We must be concerned about the person who must emigrate because of economic circumstances. That is why jobs are needed urgently.  I suggest that this legislation contains no function that cannot be carried out by existing agencies.</P>
    <P>If a little flexibility is needed by Fóir Teoranta and possibly the IDA in certain respects, or maybe a coming together of the two, then by all means let that be done and amend the legislation suitably. It need not necessarily be a complete coming together; a co-ordinated working approach between the IDA, the ICC and Fóir Teoranta may meet the need.  My concern is that we have here another agency added to the plethora of agencies. I said the same thing about four years ago in this House regarding the employment agency and I was told then that part of their function would be to be the umbrella agency.  We all know now that they are not an umbrella.  They are all there standing side by side and complaining that they are going in different directions.</P>
    <P>I do not know over what period we are talking about in regard to the £300 million.  A figure of £5 billion was referred to.  That £300 million is needed, but let nobody run away with the idea that it will solve our problems.  Deputy Skelly <Col N="1230" /> mentioned the Canadian situation and referred to Edmonton and a neighbouring city.  I am glad he is a late convert. When our Leader and our party decided three and a half years ago to develop inner Dublin, and, having done that, to move to other cities, we were maligned and castigated for pulling strokes.  Now Deputy Skelly says it was a pity that we did not do what has been done in two cities in Canada and in Belfast.</P>
    <P>I have no more to say on the measure except that I support the views expressed by my colleagues.  This measure is a combination of ideological nonsense and a public relations exercise of an ailing Government and the agency can do nothing that is not being done by existing agencies.  It is constrained by the subsections of section 10.  It is contradictory in its content in many areas as a result of placating two sides.  Finally, it is tied and nailed down firmly by those in Merrion Street and by the Minister for Finance. This Bill can do nothing.  It will not help to provide the jobs our young people need to restore economic activity and, above all, it does nothing to generate or restore confidence in people who are losing it.</P>

      <P>In introducing this legislation the Minister indicated that its main purpose was the creation of the maximum number of viable jobs.  Deputy Fitzgerald started his contribution by saying that not a single job would be created.  I hope to indicate a number of areas where sizeable numbers of jobs can be created because this potential for investment exists, jobs which could not be created by any of the existing agencies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>The high ground which Fianna Fáil are attempting to take up in this area of job creation is not justified by their achievement in history.  Consider the job situation which the Government took over.  The numbers of jobless were rising alarmingly despite massive programmes of job creation in the public <Col N="1231" /> sector which were putting a burden on other sectors of our economy who were trying to provide real long-term jobs.  The rapid, escalating rise in the numbers of unemployed at the time we took over has been slowed down and, in four out of the past six months, we have recorded a drop in unemployment.  Obviously that is upsetting the Opposition so much that even today in the Dáil the Leader of the Opposition, Deputy Haughey, attempted to suggest that these figures were somehow misleading the public. Figures speak for themselves, and we can only wait and see.</P>
      <P>This new legislation setting up the NDC will have to stand the test of time and in time we will see whether it will succeed in creating the jobs we who are proposing and supporting it hope it will create, or whether it will end up with not a single job to its name as Deputy Fitzgerald suggested.  As a member of Fine Gael I feel that it is very much in the tradition and the history of Fine Gael since the establishment of this State that, at this time of job crisis, we should support the formation of an agency such as this.  When other major agencies were proposed, in the twenties the ESB, in the forties the IDA, many questions were raised about their potential.  Their success has written into history books the significance the continuing role semi-State organisation had for the development of a small country like ours that has a small industrial base.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Fitzgerald referred to the plethora of agencies involved in the training area.  His criticism in regard to that is broadly merited.  Certainly, there is a great need for overhaul and that has been recognised by the Government.  However, I was disappointed that he picked out the Youth Employment Agency as a target for criticism.  I do not know if the Deputy has been involved in many projects in his constituency but I can tell him that in my constituency where there is high unemployment and where many schemes were run by AnCO and Manpower, the old schemes proved inadequate to help job proposals to get under way. <Col N="1232" /> Those agencies have limited powers and are not permitted to invest in premises or equipment.  Their potential is limited. The Youth Employment Agency is one of the few organisations that has directly led to the creation of jobs and the training of young people.  That agency has a welcome flexibility.  The corporation will be able to fill many of the gaps that exist particularly in regard to the ability of State agencies to support potential industry.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the areas where I feel the corporation can do important work.  The Minister identified a wide range of activities in which it can get involved.  Contrary to what Deputy Fitzgerald said, a great deal of thought has been given to this matter and the experiences of other countries have been studied.  Many countries made mistakes with such an organisation.  The Minister has identified many of the areas where investment can take place and our natural resources have the greatest potential. The average schoolchild knows, as a matter of common understanding, that although we have tremendous natural resources they are not being developed. We are aware that their employment potential is not being realised and that there is no immediate prospect of that without a major initiative being taken.</P>
    <P>I am referring in particular to fisheries and forestry.  We are all aware that action is needed in those areas but investment is not coming from private concerns and to date the State sector has not invested to any great extent.  I am satisfied, as the Minister appears to be &mdash; Deputy Fitzgerald gave sneaking indications of approval when he lapsed in his contribution &mdash; that the corporation has potential in the areas of fisheries, forestry and food processing.  Deputy Fitzgerald allowed that approval to slip out on a few occasions when he forgot to maintain his party political stance of criticism and envisaged the corporation having one or two uses.</P>
    <P>The potential for the development of forestry was outlined as far back as 1980 by the Forestry and Wildlife Service in a booklet, <i>The Case for Forestry</i>.  That <Col N="1233" /> booklet indicated that we are uniquely placed to plant, process and invest further in our forests.  Such an industry is attractive because it is clear that in world terms the need for timber will increase.  It is estimated that, by the turn of the century, there will be a shortage of the product worldwide.  If we invest in that area now we are assured of a keen market.  It is estimated that the shortfall will be in the region of 8 per cent by the year 2000. Unlike many of our other resources, forestry is a renewable natural resource.</P>
    <P>We are uniquely placed to develop forestry because our land has potential for higher yields than anywhere else.  Land in the midlands and in poor counties has a potential for exceptional growth levels. Our cutaway bogs could also be used for timber planting.  All trends indicate that if we invest in the area of forestry there is a prospect of a substantial increase in prices up to the year 2025.  Our forests are an attraction for people from urban areas who visit them for recreation. Unlike Deputy Skelly I see this as a major experiment in leadership in job creation.</P>
    <P>The Bill is an acknowledgment that job creation is the primary problem facing us.  It is one of the package of initiatives in response to cries from Fine Gael backbenchers, and our Labour colleagues, who represent areas where there is high unemployment.  The problem must be tackled and we need initiatives other than those in our national plan.  We need to tailor all potential for investment in the national plan into the area of job creation. The corporation, allied with the initiative in the social employment scheme, the recent announcement of a major investment in Dublin City and the incentives to boost the construction industry, is one of a series of proposals to tackle the unemployment problem in a more intense way than has been done to date.</P>
    <P>The job issue is being put up front and the Government intend to tackle it.  It is not helpful when the Opposition treat this as a party political issue.  Their record in this area is not terribly exciting.  It would be more helpful if they put forward suggestions as to how they would tackle <Col N="1234" /> it.  Their approach appears to be to focus on political ideological differences.  The Bill is a finer piece of legislation than was envisaged in any of the debates about such an organisation that took place in the past ten years.</P>
    <P>The study on forestry I referred to pointed out that the least optimistic estimate of employment potential from investment in forestry was 13,000 jobs by the year 2000.  The most optimistic estimates were 16,000 and 21,000 jobs. That would be a significant contribution. The Minister said the focus will be on natural resources and that the corporation will be directed to invest funds in those areas.</P>
    <P>The second area touched on by Deputy Fitzgerald is that the food industry. Agriculture has been a major cornerstone of our economy but the environment in which our farmers are producing their goods is radically changing.  It is quite clear that the boom of the seventies is over for them also and that they must respond to the changing situation.  Their success in doing that is very much connected with the whole state of the economy in the future and with the potential for the creation of jobs in relation to industries. The Confederation of Irish Industry in their newsletter of September 1985 highlighted many needs if we are to succeed in developing a food industry. Again, Deputy Fitzgerald touched on one of our key successes in this area, the Baileys cream liquour product which was researched and developed in this country and involved major chemical discoveries. It has, of course, now been copied on a continental basis but is one of our greatest export successes.  It involved an exciting use of a basic natural resource in a new way.  The confederation have identified experiments such as this as helping us to develop the full potential of our food industry.  We are away behind all our European partners in realising the potential of the basic commodities which we possess in beef, fish and dairy products. We must learn from the success of Baileys as much as possible.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry identified one of the main weaknesses as <Col N="1235" /> the lack of research into those industries. That is one of the areas in which the Minister envisages the National Development Corporation being involved.  It is still a feature of shopping in an Irish supermarket that it is impossible to find Irish fishfingers, one of the most popular items in children's diets.  These are all foreign produced and made largely by multi-national companies.  There is no excuse for failing to enter into this market, particularly as a country which has the natural resources, probably in better condition than in many other countries.</P>
    <P>Similarly, many of our industries are showing an inability to respond imaginatively to changing markets.  One of the exceptions in the past number of years was Gateaux in Finglas which responded with great success to the potential market, particularly in Great Britain, where they have now taken up a sizeable new market.  It involved the production by them of items to a specialised standard. This led some months ago to the extraordinary situation of something in the order of 10,000 cakes being returned because the walnuts on the top were not all of the same size.  This is a very minor example of how we must identify products which meet the taste of the customers. I am glad to say that they were able quickly to organise themselves and get back into the market quickly.  That possibility exists only because of certain advances which have been made in the technological area by which the keeping of these products for long periods is possible, enabling a greater potential for export and resulting in the product remaining fresh and saleable for a longer period of time to get them to other markets. The whole area of the food industry is one in which the NDC could very usefully become involved.  I hope they will become involved in this as a matter of priority.  We cannot be happy at being able to point to only one or two successes. We must have a list of successful Irish products and one or two which have caught the headlines have indicated that that is possible.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1236" /> I look with much confidence to the future, based on the experience of countries such as Switzerland which 70 or 80 years ago had employment and industrial profiles very similar to ours and which in the intervening years changed to having excess employment necessitating their going abroad for industries because they had not an adequate workforce at home to maintain their industrial activity.  The transformation there has been total.  With sufficient investment, not overnight but over a number of decades, we could move towards that better balance between agriculture and industry, which would bring security to the producers and the urban dwellers who rely on industry for employment and for services.</P>
    <P>The other area of great potential is the tourist area.  As a member not only of this House but of Dublin City Council, and like Deputy Skelly, representing the capital city, I see a great future for the National Development Corporation in becoming involved in areas of commercial potential.  There are great possibilities in the area of joint ventures with local authorities.  In Dublin we have long identified the potential of a marina based around the Dublin port area.  This has been talked about but in these times the local authorities do not have the funds necessary to get that under way.  Most European cities situated on a port have successfully developed such an amenity. There is from it the double benefit of being recreational for the residents and very attractive for tourists.  Dublin &mdash; as indeed every corner of the country &mdash; wishes to develop the tourist market here.  There is no doubt that, as in the area of the food processing industry, many of our land and sea resources, unique among European cities for their cleaniness and appeal, are totally under-developed by comparison with, for example, the utilisation of the London canals or dockland.  We have huge strides to make here and I hope to see the corporation becoming involved in these areas of canal and water sports.</P>
    <P>The people of Dublin are totally under-provided for in terms of first-class leisure <Col N="1237" /> facilities.  Those available are only in private clubs, some of which are excellent, but there is room for joint venture with the local authority in the city area which has an enormous market of people in need of accessible recreation at a reasonable cost and of a high standard.  This area of sports complexes and leisure facilities has been moved into only at the lower end of the market referred to by Deputy Skelly, the gaming hall area, but has tremendous potential in the wider facilities which are provided at the moment only by private clubs and to a limited number of people.  This could be invested in in a major way on a city basis in joint enterprise.  Also, in Dublin there is a great demand for a street market, which is a feature of most European cities.  The acquiring of a site or premises seems again to be beyond the economic power of the local authority.  However, a joint enterprise or a totally independent privately owned venture could succeed.</P>
    <P>These are all potential areas for growth investment and employment.  There is the frustration in Dublin of turning away for lack of sites, people who want to set up as traders to sell fruit and vegetables.  We cannot cater for the demand from people in that area.  We have long identified the need for a market centre in the city, quite apart from the sites for casual trading. We have to turn away people who want to work because we cannot provide for them in a proper location.  There is much potential in this area.</P>
    <P>There is also potential in relation to road development.  We have had one joint enterprise in the building of the toll bridge at Ringsend which has provided a major new facility for the people of Dublin and the whole eastern region which would not have existed otherwise. It is a project which has not yet reached its full potential.  This type of enterprise should be looked at again with a view to providing important infrastructural elements in various parts of the country.</P>
    <P>Only a pessimist such as Deputy Gene Fitzgerald could anticipate that there would be absolutely no job creation resulting from the activities of this corporation. <Col N="1238" /> He referred to the amounts of money involved as being comparative peanuts in the light of the amounts which have been spent by other agencies.  Obviously the amount of money invested in this agency will quite rightly depend on how successful it is in providing jobs and operating on a successful commercial basis.  We are all very familiar with the Bills which regularly come before us increasing the sums available to the IDA and other semi-State bodies.  Should this corporation prove themselves in contributing to the resolution of the jobs crisis and developing the industrial base, I am sure the Government will be willing to extend their funds if their finances are inadequate to meet the aims they have proved their ability to achieve.  Many of the corporation's activities are intended to be on a revolving basis and this £300 million should be reutilised many times over, in theory at least.</P>
    <P>Some of the warnings which have been sounded are substantial and have to be written into this debate and the consciousness of every Deputy.  Agencies such as this in other countries have run into problems from politicians who have tried to use agencies set up on a commercial basis to answer any kind of political crisis which might affect their own constituency or their popularity.  The Minister has gone as far as he can in this Bill to indicate that it must not be used in that fashion.  We have a responsibility to ensure that this commitment is honoured. Where agencies in other countries have been used as I have described, they have ended up as a bigger burden on the taxpayers.  This whole problem was identified in an article in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> by Doctor R.S. Thompson. He discusses the prospects for a State investment company and outlines the pitfalls encountered in some other countries, while also indicating where it has been successful.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to hear Deputy Flynn worry about the power written into the Bill for the Minister and the possible politicisation of this corporation.  It is well to hear this from a party which arguably <Col N="1239" /> historically have been expert in the use of agencies to political advantage.  The examples are legion and every one of us can point to examples in our own constituencies where political considerations totally outweighed any kind of social responsibility or economic considerations. This led partly to the defeat of the then Government in 1981 and in November 1982.  It is an area which we must try to deal with in the Bill.  Obviously a series of cross checks and balances is needed in relation to the independence of the agency, the Minister and the Dáil. These checks are written into the Bill and I would be interested in teasing out on Committee Stage how they will work and whether they will ensure that the aims of the agency are followed so that it will not be used for political purposes, thereby adding to the burden of the taxpayer. The aim of the agency is to create jobs and to create wealth.  We must commit ourselves to be responsible as politicians and commit ourselves and our parties for the next two decades to allowing the corporation to succeed.</P>
    <P>A question has been raised about duplication with the IDA.  The Minister has indicated that an agreement will be drawn up between the two to avoid any duplication.  The new powers which will be given to the NDC over and above those of the IDA are very important. Any of us who have dealt with people who have ideas for new businesses will have come across the frustration of the confines within which the IDA operate. They have developed a specialist skill in the area of manufacturing industry.  The Fine Gael backbench group on employment felt there was a need for a corporation which could assist service industries.  In the United States this is the area which has provided most of the jobs which have kept their unemployment figures down during the past few years. Judicious investment here could also lead to the creation of many more jobs.</P>
    <P>In my constituency a community enterprise project was initiated through the maligned Youth Employment Agency to identify possible ideas for job creation <Col N="1240" /> from young people in the area.  Twenty projects emerged, of which four were of a manufacturing type capable of being assisted by the IDA.  No agency was empowered to assist the other 16 in starting up.  The powers given to the NDC should fill that gap.</P>
    <P>The corporation will contribute substantially to developing our natural resources and providing jobs in sizeable numbers for young people in the decades leading to the turn of the century.  I entirely accept that it cannot and will not be the total answer to the job creation problem and was never intended to be.</P>
    <P>It is extremely important to continue efforts to re-organise the tax structures. In his article in the <i>Irish Banking Review</i> Dr. Thompson states that one of the main reasons that industry hesitates to invest in this country is the penal level of taxation. I urge the Government to maintain their commitment to steady progress in reform to ease the burden on the individual and on industry.</P>
    <P>If we are to substantially improve the position, this corporation will be only part of our efforts.  However, it is a major commitment by the Government to job creation and the development of our natural resources.  This will lead to many new jobs and the maintenance of employment, with a steady downward movement of the numbers unemployed.  The work of the NDC will not be seen overnight but it will be a step forward in leadership, as Deputy Skelly said.  This is most important now for the country as a whole.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelAhern" hpid="Mr. M. Ahern Mr. M. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>At the beginning of her speech Deputy Flaherty accused the Opposition of opposing the Bill for opposition sake.  Not long afterwards she reversed that accusation.  Throughout her speech she supported the Bill wholeheartedly. I suppose she believed in what she was saying, and she should grant us on this side the benefit of the doubt, because we believe in what we are saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As everybody knows we have unemployment and emigration which have reached epidemic proportions and no <Col N="1241" /> sane person would oppose any proposition that would be likely to reduce these twin evils.  In my constituency of Cork East in the last number of years we lost some very fine industries, like Youghal Carpets, the Verlome Dockyard and East Cork Foods, and Irish Steel is suffering.  Today <i>The Cork Examiner</i> reported Deputies as going into hysterics because 27 new jobs had been created. Of course they should have been told that this is not the end of our unemployment problems.  Those jobs were grant-aided but it is not due to the NDC that those jobs were created.  The same Deputies in the past few weeks have been saying that the NDC will be the saviour of those on the unemployment lists.</P>
    <P>It is well known that there is a vast pool of educated and able talent in our society.  This is being referred to continually by Government spokesmen who all the time say that something must be done to utilise such talent.  What has been done?  To date we have got this Bill which, in the words of the Government, will give significant job creation to the profit of the taxpayers.  Such a Bill merits serious consideration and detailed examination, which will be done on Committee Stage.  Tonight I will refer to a number of the sections.</P>
    <P>The Minister responsible is known to have serious reservations regarding this measure.  For many years he has held out from bringing it forward.  The only reason we have the Bill before us today is to bolster the junior partners in the Coalition against a gathering and increasing storm of opposition from their supporters. Deputy John Bruton and other Fine Gael Cabinet members were pragmatic enough to realise that, unless they rowed in, their political role would be on this side of the House in the near future, which it still may well be.</P>
    <P>They know there is no need for this Bill and many of their Deputies have not shown any fight in their defence of the Bill.  They know that this Bill will only add to the efforts of other State aid agencies which have been doing a good job.  This corporation will only add to the many burdens from which taxpayers are <Col N="1242" /> already suffering.  The NDC will unnecessarily replace the very effective National Enterprise Agency which provided venture capital and a more effective and less political form of financial assistance.  If the Government had wanted to put more money into the economy and increase job opportunities they could have extended the NEA instead of bringing on a new layer of bureaucracy, because this Bill will bind the semi-State sector in another layer of red tape.  We will be at our wit's end trying to break through a further layer.</P>
    <P>In the economy we have a large amount of unused capital because of risks, the low interest return in business at the moment but particularly because of taxation, which is so oppressive that it is more profitable for people to invest in Government securities or send the money abroad rather than risk it in manufacturing enterprises.  This is seen and accepted by all economic commentators. Members of the Government appreciate this; but, due to political pressure, they come along with this Bill instead of doing something effective.</P>
    <P>Section 8 (2) refers to the share capital of £300 million.  The newspapers splashed this figure across their front pages when the Bill was issued and the general public were under the impression that the £300 million would be used to create jobs immediately.  This is not true.  The money is authorised share capital and it is only worth the paper it is written on because it is the issued share capital that is important.</P>
    <P>Where will the £300 million come from?  Will it come from the national lottery or will it be borrowed?  If so, it will increase further our national debt, which is about £20 billion.  This is being concealed from the public because of the way the repayments are being made and restructured by the Government.  This fact will become known in a couple of years and the newspapers will again be spreading big headlines about it.  One has only to look at similar State agencies in other countries to appreciate that in all cases they have been failures when compared with open market businesses.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1243" /> Looking at our history of employment and productivity one would need to be an almighty optimist to believe that we will experience significantly better results than those of other countries.  It could be done if the will existed but, judging from recent experience, it would appear that that will does not exist.</P>
    <P>The whole Bill reeks of political interference, and that by a Government committed &mdash; in word only I might add, as has been proved by events since their election &mdash; to all facets of life they can influence.  They are a government committed to using commercial criteria in relation to semi-State bodies and cost efficiency in the public sector.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 11 the Ministers for Finance and the Public Service have a veto over the appointment of an auditor to any of the companies set up under these provisions; the board of the NDC cannot appoint their own auditor. Surely this represents a vote of no confidence in the members of the initial board?  It does not augur well for the future of the corporation.  Any person appointed a member of the board who is not allowed to make such appointment must question the trust placed in him personally.</P>
    <P>Under the provisions of section 14 the Minister is to be informed in writing of each and every investment made by the corporation.  Does this mean that the corporation can go ahead with any prospective investment or must they await Ministerial approval?  If each investment must first be cleared, whether it be for an amount of £1,000, £2,000, or up to £1 million or £2 million, that will hold up the initiation or implementation of projects. Under the provisions of section 15 investments exceeding in the aggregate £1 million and not exceeding in the aggregate £2,500,000 must be approved by the Minister and the Government respectively. I have no objection whatsoever to there being controls.  I believe them to be necessary in ensuring that the taxpayer's money is used in a proper manner.  But these sections render a farce the day-to-day autonomy of operating decisions <Col N="1244" /> of the National Development Corporation. The Minister should re-examine them before Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>Section 10 is another section which would not appear to make much sense because, under its provisions, the National Development Corporation are allowed to invest in, to manage or assist financially any semi-State body.  That poses the question: does one need one semi-State body to assist another?  This proposal would be funny were it not serious and included in the provisions of the Bill.  That the Government should contemplate such a section calls into question their competency to remain in office. Over the years such semi-State companies as the ESB, Aer Rianta and CIE have been allowed to branch out into different projects.  One might well ask: why cannot such semi-State bodies be allowed to continue in that manner?  I know it is necessary that controls, rules and regulations should be laid down and be adhered to strictly.  But is there any guarantee that the involvement of the National Development Corporation in other semi-State bodies will improve the performance of those companies?</P>
    <P>There is then the question of the National Development Corporation being allowed to sell off their investments as soon as they are commercially and financially viable.  In principle that is a good idea but it will be dependent largely on those who take the decision as to when is the proper time to sell off any investment.  For example, if an investment is sold and subsequently becomes unprofitable, it will be contended that that was a good decision on the part of the corporation whereas, if another investment is sold which becomes more profitable for its purchaser, the people who took that decision will be castigated. Therefore they will be involved in a catch 22 situation.</P>
    <P>There is also the question of loss-makers. There is no guarantee in commercial life that some projects will be successful and others not.  Some may be less successful or downright disastrous. Under the provisions of section 14 the taxpayer will have to continue to fund <Col N="1245" /> such loss-makers, for how long being dependent on the Minister in that he is given power under this section to effect an extension of the time limit of the NDC's involvement in such loss-makers.</P>
    <P>We revert then to the whole question of public pressure on Ministers.  In recent years we have had the experience of much pressure being brought to bear on Ministers when many of our industries have been in jeopardy, pressure by the public for the Government to invest a few million pounds to keep a company going for another length of time.  Such pressure will continue, which will mean that the NDC will move away from the commercial criteria about which the Minister spoke.  It will be seen that we are deviating from the strictly commercial criteria which were to be applied by the NDC.</P>
    <P>There is a contradiction between what the Minister said the National Development Corporation should do and the provisions of the Bill.  If this Bill is to be enacted I believe that the weight to be given to non-commercial criteria should be detailed fully, when management would be accountable for departing from projected strategy.  There may be assembled the best management team but they should not be blamed if and when their plans are over-ruled by any Minister.  Their functions should be clearly spelled out.  Otherwise the whole question of the NDC being a commercial corporation is a farce.</P>
    <P>Principally this Bill sets out the objectives of the National Development Corporation, its administration methods and controls but I contend it does not represent a measure that will create jobs. Rather will it augment Government borrowing and increase taxation.  In the final analysis the Bill should be judged, in the words contained in the <i>Joint Programme for Government</i> published in December 1982, on whether it proves to be a major vehicle for job creation.  I believe the provisions of the Bill will do nothing for the 65,000 people who have since joined the dole queues or the thousands who have emigrated, that the only jobs to be <Col N="1246" /> created in the lifetime of this Government will be head office ones.  There are better ways of creating jobs than creating another white elephant, as I believe a prominent member of the Labour Party would christen it were Fianna Fáil proposing the Bill.</P>
    <P>Defects in the domestic capital market should be tackled, those which are impeding it in meeting the financial needs of Irish industry.  Furthermore, the venture capital market should be developed. On 23 October we saw a move on the part of the Government toward changing the present structure of incentives favouring the use of capital at the expense of employment.  I commend the decision removing RSI contributions in respect of newly engaged personnel.  Additional such measures would help employers enormously in engaging more people.</P>
    <P>There should also be a reduction in indirect taxes on employment.  Above all, the tax code should be reformed from top to bottom.  We have the last report of the Commission on Taxation and it is time that action was taken to implement the proposals contained therein because, unless the whole taxation system is reformed, we will continue to struggle from pillar to post trying to create jobs but the fundamental issue &mdash; taxation &mdash; must be acted on.  To keep their few remaining supporters happy the Labour Party insisted that this Bill should be pushed through the House now and Fine Gael, realising that their days are numbered, finally succumbed to the pressure like a drowning man clutching at any straw. I ask the Minister to be true to himself and to have this nonsense scrapped before it costs the taxpayers even more.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Is é mo thuairimse gurb é seo an Bille is tábhachtaí atá tagaithe os comhair na Parlaiminte ar feadh 30 bliain ó bunaíodh <Col N="1247" /> an Foras Tionscail sna caogaidí.  Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh leis an chorporáid na mílte jobanna a chur ar fáil.  Gan aon amhras is í an dí-fhostaíocht an fhadhb is mó atá le réiteach agus tá géar-ghá le Bille mar seo i láthair na huaire.</P>
    <P>As one who has been a consistent and enthusiastic advocate of the concept of a National Development Corporation for a long time, I sincerely welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on bringing it before the House.  I have been a Member of the House for 24 years and this Bill has had a longer gestation period than any other legislation I remember.</P>
    <P>The first Government which seriously considered the concept of a National Development Corporation was the Coalition Government led by Liam Cosgrave of which I had the honour to be a member.  The idea was floated in 1976 or 1977 but, unfortunately, there was no time to bring the Bill to fruition because there was a change of Government in 1977.</P>
    <P>The idea was again mooted in 1981 and at long last the Bill is before us.  I was not present for the opening debate on the Bill but I read with great interest the various contributions after the Minister, Deputy Bruton, introduced it a fortnight ago. Taking into account the enormous challenge facing us because of the magnitude of unemployment, I cannot understand why it has taken three years to bring the Bill before the House nor can I understand the attitude of the Fianna Fáil Party in their outright opposition to it.  Unemployment is a problem throughout the European Community and throughout the western world and it should be quite obvious that there is dire need for new thinking, new strategies and legislation to enable us to face up to the daunting challenge of tackling growing unemployment in a climate of international recession.</P>
    <P>This Bill has been the subject of much controversy, ideological conflict, academic argument and of most unfair criticism from the Opposition.  There are about 250,000 people unemployed. There has been a recession for three or <Col N="1248" /> four years and it is quite obvious to anyone who looks at the situation objectively and realistically that the employment creation agencies and strategies which have been in operation since the fifties when the IDA was established are no longer adequate to tackle the new challenge of employment creation.</P>
    <P>I have been reading the debates of the fifties whan the IDA was established and it is ironical to see that the same outright opposition which is now being shown towards the National Development Corporation was also expressed in regard to the establishment of the Industrial Development Authority.  Members of Fianna Fáil who do not like the Bill now before the House may, as some of their predecessors did, oppose the measure in the Dáil but subsequently find themselves in favour of it.  Unemployment is the most serious social problem facing us at present and it is generally agreed that it is an underlying and significant factor to many of the social ills confronting society today.</P>
    <P>With all due respect to the Government, finding answers to the problem of unemployment should receive a far greater priority than some of the controversial social legislation which has been brought before the House.  We must face the fact that we have the youngest population in the EC. They are well educated, highly skilled and competent.  We have an unprecedentedly high level of training and educational facilities.  However, when the training is over, the education completed and degrees are conferred, the grim prospect of unemployment still faces our young people.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Bill.  It is clear and distinct evidence of the priority the Government are according to the unemployment problem.  Much has been said and written about the concept of the National Development Corporation and much time has been wasted in ideological arguments regarding State and public enterprise versus private enterprise.  We are a small country and we do not have the wealth and the natural resources of more advanced European countries.  I have always held the view that the correct <Col N="1249" /> approach to national development and job creation was to have a realistic and proper mix of State enterprise and private enterprise.</P>
    <P>I was pleased to find that the Minister in his speech spelled out very clearly the aims and objectives of this legislation. It is not intended that the NDC should replace private enterprise.  I was pleased that the Minister spelled out the possibilities of involving the NDC in development of various kinds.  He spoke about the scope for joint ventures between public and private enterprise.  The private sector will have full opportunities to participate in the various projects that will be taken on board by the NDC.  This is as it should be.  Now that the legislation is before us and we are about to set up the NDC I hope we will have no more of this silly nonsense about public and private enterprise. We need the proper mix of both to create the new developments and the job opportunities that are so necessary.</P>
    <P>It has been said that we have too many job creation agencies.  We have the IDA, SFADCo, the National Manpower Service, AnCO and so on.  It is said that the NDC will duplicate some of the work of those agencies.  It has also been stated that there could be conflict between the IDA and the NDC but I see no reason why there should be any conflict.  I do not accept that the NDC will be a superfluous organisation.  They will meet a need and will fill a gap not catered for by existing State agencies or by private enterprise.</P>
    <P>The IDA was established 30 years ago. They have done a tremendous job and have made a valuable contribution to industrial development and job creation. The main thrust of their strategy throughout the sixties and seventies was in the attraction of foreign investment.  They succeeded admirably and many thousands of people are employed as a result of that strategy.  However, we must face the fact that because of the world recession that has existed for some years the task of attracting foreign investment has become almost impossible.  Those of us in the European Parliament who are familiar with the European scene are aware that the countries from which the <Col N="1250" /> IDA succeeded in attracting substantial investment throughout the sixties and the seventies have not been investing abroad in the past few years.  It is as simple as that.  Even West Germany which is an advanced industrial nation and a place from which we have been successful in attracting substantial industries has been in the process of consolidating because the recession has hit industry in that country also.  We cannot rely in the next decade on attracting foreign investment to solve our unemployment problem and to create jobs to the same degree that existed in the past two decades.  An alternative strategy must be devised and the obvious strategy is to look to our own resources.  We have to examine what natural resources we have, to what degree they can be developed and to what degree industries and jobs based on those resources can be created.  The purpose of the NDC is enshrined clearly in the Bill and it was spelled out clearly by the Minister when he introduced it.</P>
    <P>The NDC have exciting possibilities for substantial job creation.  Much of the criticism has been due to the fact that it offers a completely new dimension to the national job creation strategy.  It may be asked why I am so enthusiastic about the NDC.  I will give some practical examples of where State participation and private enterprise have been successful to a remarkable degree.  I refer to the ESB, to Bord na Móna and to the Irish Sugar Company, all of which have utilised our natural resources.</P>
    <P>When I was Minister for the Gaeltacht, Gaeltarra Éireann was the development authority for the Gaeltacht.  There has been talk about industries that failed in the Gaeltacht but many successful enterprises were established there.  We are an island country.  We have a fishing industry that is in a shambles because it has not been properly developed.  The only fish canning plant is in Dungloe in County Donegal.  It was established in 1975 in a joint partnership between the State and private enterprise.  Up to then there was no fish cannery in the country because private enterprise was not prepared to establish such a plant.  However, an <Col N="1251" /> entrepreneur in Donegal, a man who was successful in the fish processing business, put forward the proposal to establish a fish cannery and as Minister I sanctioned a substantial State investment.  The cannery has been very successful and other fish processing plants have been established.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the link between the universities and technology and industry and job creation.  This is a very important area and I see tremendous scope for the National Development Corporation here.  In 1974 I was invited to visit the Marine Biology Research Station in Carna, County Galway, which is run by University College, Galway, under the direction of Professor Ó Ciardha.  Professor Keady showed me the wonderful research work in the field of marine biology and the development of mariculture which is being carried out there.  He told me thay had perfected a technique to artifically grow oysters and mussels.  I asked him what would happen next and he replied that that depended on the Government.  I asked him what the problem was and he said that private enterprise would not develop and commercially apply their research.  I succeeded in getting from the Government an investment of £500,000 for that industry. To date fish farming has been developed to a remarkably successful degree in the Gaeltacht, to the extent that it is being advocated as a very good development project in non-Gaeltacht areas.  I have not seen the latest figures for the export of shellfish from the company set up in 1975, but I believe it runs into many millions of pounds.</P>
    <P>Professor Timoney, an outstanding example of an academic turned entrepreneur, was anxious to apply the results of his research in the mechanical engineering faculty, University College, Dublin, practically by establishing commercial companies and providing jobs. He developed the Timoney armoured car, which was a source of great amusement at the time.  We helped him to establish a business in the Meath Gaeltacht. That original concept has now been <Col N="1252" /> applied to armoured vehicles, fire engines and so on.  Converting this type of research into a commercial enterprise is a costly and slow business and private enterprise is not inclined to take it up.</P>
    <P>There is a massive horticultural industry in the Dingle Gaeltacht where there is a substantial area under glass.  This industry was established because a State agency had a mandate to invest State funds in projects of that kind.  I have already referred to the fishing industry, but I believe the NDC can play a major role in the development of the fishing industry, fish processing and added-value projects.</P>
    <P>I hope one of the first steps the National Development Corporation will take will be to examine the food processing industry.  It is often said that we do not have very many natural resources, but land is one of our major natural resources and our agricultural industry can and should be developed.  Many experts who examined the potential of the food processing industry said there is potential for the creation of 30,000 new jobs if the industry is developed and the products marketed properly.</P>
    <P>Our forests have been neglected since the foundation of the State.  We do not have a proper timber processing industry. We import an enormous amount of timber every year, running into many millions of pounds.  There is need for a new approach to the development of afforestation and a national timber processing industry.  There was a recent controversy about the proposal to sell off our forests.  The NDC could set up a holding company which would promote a more vigorous tree planting policy, organise our forests properly and establish a timber processing industry.</P>
    <P>I do not accept that the NDC is superfluous. As I said on a number of occasions, there are several projects in the pipeline which have not been able to get off the ground simply because private enterprise are not willing to get involved. One reason may be that research and development take a very long time and <Col N="1253" /> are very costly, but this is an area where the NDC can fruitfully intervene.</P>
    <P>The Minister also referred to the tourist industry and the possibility of the NDC participating in a new, imaginative, dynamic tourism development project. In recent years we have been successful in promoting small industry.  It is generally realised in the western world that small industry can make a major contribution to national job creation and has a vital role to play.  SFADCo have a special mandate to deal with the development of small industries and they have a lot of experience of the problems in this area, particularly in relation to marketing and exports.  The NDC can and should intervene in this field.  A special holding company should be able to provide venture and other types of capital for small industries and, most important, provide an umbrella export organisation where small companies could come together and form an export company in which the NDC could participate.</P>
    <P>These are some of the areas where I see great possibilities for the National Development Corporation.  I am disappointed at the attitude of the Opposition to this Bill.</P>

      <P>In this Bill I seek to remove the outright ban on divorce in the Constitution.  In its place I would substitute a provision for divorce in circumstances defined in the Marriage Bill, 1985, with a mechanism for popular consultation in the event that future change is desired by the Legislature.  There are two aspects to this popular consultation requirement.  The first is the practical one, that my proposals on popular consultation correspond more nearly with what we know are the people's wishes and it follows that, in any referendum, success is more likely where continuing consultation is assured to the people.  Of equal importance to this practical element is the importance of the principle itself, the principle of consultation with the people.  The marriage law is of such central importance in people's lives that they are entitled to a guarantee of continued democratic consultation if any reforms are contemplated by the Legislature.</P>
      <P>I seek a partnership between the Dáil and the people for such legislation.  That partnership is already acknowledged in Article 47 of the Constitution.  The consultation therein envisaged has never been invoked.  On appropriate occasions, when matters of fundamental importance which stand outside, or should stand outside, party controversy are to be decided, the people must be acknowledged as responsible partners in the legislative process rather than passive recipients of party plans at election time.  This is not to distrust the Legislature.  It is a fuller version of democratic decision making than the Westminster model.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that it is legally <Col N="1255" /> impossible to have The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 1985, and the Marriage Bill, 1985, decided on by the people on the same day.  I do not agree.  I accept that it may be that simple enabling legislation as happened in 1937 in the enactment of our present Constitution may be necessary.  Alternatively, it might be considered more simple that the provisions of Article 47 of the Constitution which allow for reference of Bills to the people need to be invoked.  Whilst in principle it is not essential that the process of popular consultation and the power to consult the people should be dealt with on the same day, for maximum clarity the people should know the terms of divorce legislation as they are asked to abolish the outright ban on divorce.</P>
    <P>Whether enabling legislation or amendment of The Tenth Amendment of the Constitution Bill to include a reference to the Article 47 procedure is required, I can see no insuperable difficulty in regard to the concept of popular consultation.  These points would be issues in the course of events, for a Second Stage debate.</P>
    <P>I commend the response of the Labour Party.  The weakness of what they propose is the lack of a mechanism for continuing popular consultation.  The guarantees they propose in relation to the grounds for dissolution of marriage are so vague that they would permit virtually any legislation in their wake.</P>

      <P>In opposing the introduction of the Bill I do not intend to discuss the merits or otherwise of the <Col N="1256" /> proposed legislation.  As former chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown I feel it is absolutely essential that the report produced by the committee should be given the maximum time for debate in this House. The committee, as the Chair will recall, met for more than 18 months.  We received 700 written submissions and heard 24 oral submissions.  Every member of that committee devoted himself to the study of this agonising problem of marriage breakdown.  Any of my colleagues on the committee can confirm the impact of the painfully disturbing information made available to us.  Many members of the committee changed their views and in many cases saw in a new light the suffering caused by marriage breakdown.</P>
      <P>Many of our colleagues in both Houses of the Oireachtas who were not members of the committee followed our work with interest and sympathy.  We had our problems, as was natural, by virtue of the fact that we were dealing with a very sensitive matter.  Some members from the different parties were violently opposed to divorce legislation, and other members were very much in favour of divorce legislation. There was a wide gap to bridge, but we found common ground on many issues, one of the issues being that our report should be debated in both Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am happy that Seanad Éireann are at present discussing this report.  I know I can speak for every member of the committee when I express my sincere thanks to the many Senators who made such fine contributions to this debate.  I am sure this House will have the opportunity in the near future to discuss this report at length in the broadest possible sense.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It would do the work of the committee and its members an injustice if the debate here were to be pre-empted by the Bill proposed tonight.  Any legislation that would pre-empt this report would not only destroy the true value of the report but would also destroy forever the concept of the committee system which has served this House so well.  It would also demean the House if an elected representative of <Col N="1257" /> the people were prevented from explaining fully all the aspects of this problem, instead taking up immediate positions on a limited Bill.</P>

      <P>All previous attempts made in Dáil Éireann on the matter of providing divorce legislation have been directed simply to the removal of the prohibition against the dissolution of marriage clause in our Constitution by means of a referendum.  It evidences a belief I hold that the advocate of reform in this area must discharge the onus of setting out in as detailed a manner as possible the circumstances in which divorce should apply.</P>
      <P>Included in the 65 sections of the Bill are the following proposals: the establishment of a national marriage advisory council to foster family life and to educate the public and conduct research into marriage breakdown; a complete reform of separation law; giving the court the right to grant dissolution of marriage orders on a no fault basis where the parties have been living apart for five years &mdash; or two if both consent &mdash; and reconciliation has failed; protecting the children in families involved in dispute by legal safeguards including the right to separate legal representation when necessary and the appointment of court family welfare officers.  No comparable Bill exists at present.</P>

I thought then as I do now that the party whip system should not apply to legislation in this area.  I also considered that my prospects of obtaining a free vote would be enhanced by such a course.  In my view it diminishes the stature of this <Col N="1259" /> national Assembly that the intrusion of the party whip and the discipline which accompanies it should be used to deprive Deputies of the initiative of their primary role as legislators.</P>

      <P>There has been sufficient indulgence in amateur psychoanalysis of my motive in introducing these measures.  Is it not sufficient to recognise that a real social problem exists in our country as experienced by the 70,000 people forced to live outside the law with their families?  Is there not sufficient challenge in this alone for a Member of this House to conclude that it was time to make a legislative response?  I thought so in 1981, and earlier.  I held that opinion when Tánaiste and gave an undertaking that legislative action would follow in the 22nd Dáil.  How long are these people expected to wait?</P>
      <P>The meaningless ritual of party drum-beating or empty point scoring is no longer seen by the people as an adequate response to their economic and social problems.  Many people outside this House hold our deliberations in low esteem.  The old ivy of party convention chokes any legislative vitality remaining in this assembly.</P>
      <P>In April of this year I set out to plough the furrow that would be non party in the area of divorce legislation.  I indicated in a speech the steps I intended to take as soon as these Bills were ready.  I wrote to every Member of this House, on the 2nd of last month, seeking support, enclosing the Bills with explanatory memoranda, and indicating the Standing Order I would utilise in coming before the House.</P>
      <P>If I failed in my effort to cross the party divide to obtain support for these measures it will only be because the party conventions are too strong.  The culture of this House has proved too resistant to this attempt to break down party divisions in a legislative area where none should exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I believe there are areas where progress is hampered and not assisted <Col N="1260" /> because of the literal application of party separateness.  I think people are impatient with the empty posturing of our adversarial system and the conscription of Deputies into the trench warfare of our weekly votes.  In the parliamentary democratic system we must easily hold the prize for being the most slavish imitator of the Westminister Parliament in every respect except the freedom of the Private Member.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that without the imposition of the system of party whips a measure along the lines I am proposing would be assured of a majority in the House. Despite their fate tonight I am confident that at some time in the future measures along the lines I have proposed will meet with approval.  It is a matter of regret also that the Leader of the Opposition who leads the largest party in the State should judge this legislation, and the problems it seeks to redress, to be of such little import as to afford no more than another opportunity of partisan opposition.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In moving this motion, I want to emphasise once again to this House, as I have done so many times in the past, the importance of agriculture to our economy. Indeed, we all realise that it is the real wealth of this country, a native industry using our natural resources, utilising <Col N="1262" /> mainly Irish inputs and employing nearly half of our working population, either directly or indirectly.  Also, agriculture is one of our greatest export earners, with as much as one-third of all our exports coming from that industry.</P>
    <P>We have only scratched the surface of the potential of this great industry.  With proper managment and leadership from Government it is capable of producing more, processing more, exporting more and, indeed, employing more.  Yet, incredibly the Government seem intent on depressing that industry.  They have taken away one subsidy after another. They have scrapped development programmes and supports and have cut back on investment in research and education. In little more than two years of Government, they have withdrawn an incredible £200 million from agriculture.  I say these things at this stage to highlight the magnitude of the problems facing not alone our farming community but also the whole economy.</P>
    <P>The recent Indian summer may have dulled the memory of the extremely bad weather conditions of June, July and August last, but for many farmers the memory of that period is very real and in some cases it is a living nightmare.  Crops were ruined, hay went uncut, budget plans were totally upset.  As a result, our farmers lost something in the region of £211 million.  These are figures estimated by the Irish Farmers' Association.</P>
    <P>Let me refresh the memory of the House on how bad our summer was.  The official weather forecasting service reports states that in many areas it was the coolest, wettest, and dullest summer in recent history.  Rainfall was well above normal, with rain falling on as many as 76 of the 92 days.  For an industry so dependent on good summer weather, that was nothing short of disastrous. Severe losses were also caused by lightning, hail and high humidity.  There are instances of severe losses of livestock due to lightning, while the unusually heavy hail that fell on 27 July last caused damage to grain and horticultural crops in a narrow corridor extending from County Kilkenny to County Louth.  The high <Col N="1263" /> humidity caused some serious high losses to potato crops, mainly in north Leinster and north County Dublin.</P>
    <P>The main result of the inclement weather, however, was in the loss of hay due to the heavy rainfall, this in turn leading to shortage in winter fodder. While most of the larger and more progressive farmers have turned in recent years to silage for winter feed, there is still a large number of farmers, particularly in the west, who adhere to hay making.  In the 12 western counties only about 20 per cent of the hay crop was secured and much of that was of very poor quality.  The problem was most acute in County Mayo, in Leitrim and in Donegal where weather conditions were particularly bad and where there is still a great dependency on hay as feed and as forage.  The lack of adequate fodder has resulted in farmers selling off stock at depressed prices, thus adding to the difficulties.  The sharp increase in the number of young cattle offered for sale in livestock marts is a matter for great concern in view of the consequences to the economy in the general running down of our breeding herds.</P>
    <P>So far, farmers affected by the weather crisis have received nothing but promises from the Government or the Minister for Agriculture, and many of those promises have not even been kept.  The Minister, Deputy Deasy, promised that the Government would match, £ for £, any aid given by the EC, but the EC have offered grain, not cash.  The Minister must now, even at this late stage, go back to Brussels and point out that it is money, not grain, that is needed to alleviate the problems affecting the farming community. I ask, what good is grain to a grain farmer who has lost all his crop? How will he find the money to buy seed for this coming year?  Is he to be allowed to go out of business and lose his only means of livelihood?  It seems that the Minister and the Government were fobbed off by Brussels with the offer of grain, or else they asked for grain on the understanding that they might not have <Col N="1264" /> to keep their promise and match the EC aid on a £ for £ basis.</P>
    <P>Despite the much publicised visit of the Taoiseach and the Minister to the worst affected areas, they still have no comprehension of the seriousness of the crisis.  It indicates the Taoiseach's attitude that he chose to fly over the Shannon Basin in a helicopter.  We all know that the problems are on the ground not in the air.  Although it is farmers who are suffering most now, the economic aspects of the disaster will soon be felt throughout the community in employment in processing factories, in co-operatives and in the retail trade.  It is no laughing matter, Deputy Farrelly.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> We have outlined in the terms of our motion what can and should be done immediately but the response of the Government has been slow, restrictive and ineffective.  The food voucher scheme, the so-called grain for rain scheme, was only announced this week.  No direct cash aid has been granted and no efforts have been made to halt the sale of livestock at depressed prices.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On 4 September last the agriculture <Col N="1265" /> committee of Fianna Fáil met to discuss the crisis and afterwards issued a statement outlining the measures that should be taken to alleviate the problems.  We felt it appropriate that the Government should declare an agriculture emergency in view of the economic impact of the crisis on the whole community.  It is a measure of the Government's interest and sincerity in matters relating to agriculture that we are seeking today virtually the same package of measures two and a half months later.  Although the recent spell of good weather has helped somewhat, there is still a grave winter fodder shortage.  There is still a huge problem for grain farmers because of the unharvested crops and low prices for higher moisture and lower quality grain.  There is still a serious cash problem, particularly for the western farmers who are being forced to sell off their livestock.</P>
    <P>It is significant that the Government failed to respond to the generous offer by the IFA for the continuation of the disease eradication levy for one more year on the condition that the proceeds be used in conjunction with the available EC funds to combat the problems caused by the recent weather crisis.  That offer was backed up by the other farm organisation, the ICMSA.  I will be very interested to hear the Minister's reasons for turning down this genuine offer of £7 million to the Exchequer.  Is it little wonder that the president of the IFA describes this as unprecedented stupidity? For the benefit of the House I will quote from <i>The Irish Press</i> of Saturday, 2 November where the president of the IFA described this as unprecedented stupidity:</P>
    <P>By diverting £7m. from the Feed Voucher Scheme allocation of £14m. to equal farmer contributions of£7m. matching EEC aid of £14m. would come, bringing a fund of £28m. for headage payments within the Disadvantaged Areas, the IFA said.</P>
    <P>But a spokesman for the Department of Agriculture said that the farmers' offer came too late, and the <Col N="1266" /> Department would not allow the implementation of such a fund during the current crisis.</P>
    <P>Mr. Rea said that by not pursuing the proposal, the Government has settled for a Brussels contribution of &ldquo;a meagre £6m.&rdquo;.  It is quite clear that we are very close to the whole matter being bungled in an extraordinary manner&rdquo;, said the IFA president.</P>
    <P>We know that the money is available in Brussels, first for the increase in the headage grants which does not need Brussels approval.  The money is available if the Minister will seek it and avail of this generous offer by the farmers. Indeed, there is also the availability of finance from Brussels for many of the schemes we suggested which would have been implemented had we been in Government.  The Minister has the information available.  ACOT identified the farms and farmers in each area who have been most badly affected by the weather. They have made reports and recommendations, many of which coincided with the measures we proposed on September 4 and are proposing here tonight.</P>
    <P>The one ACOT recommendation acted upon was in relation to silage making, but the grant of only £4 per tonne for first time silage making bears no relation to the cost of constructing a concrete silage pad of any consequence. To avail of a grant farmers already in financial difficulty would have to involve themselves in considerable new expenditure, again as a result of the Minister withdrawing the aid of the farm modernisation scheme.  These grants would have been available to put down concrete silage slabs in order to enable these farmers to make silage.  We were told there were to be cash payments of up to £500 based on livestock units for farms swamped in the Shannon valley.  My colleagues from that area will refer to that. Not one penny of that money has been paid.  This is not the way to restore confidence. If that money is an entitlement, it should be paid now.</P>
    <P>The cash flow problems affecting farmers cannot be left on the long finger. <Col N="1267" /> But apparently the Government intend to do that.  In September we advocated an increase in low interest credit as a means to improve cash flow without the need to sell off stock.  Even at this late stage we ask the Government to do this. We have asked them to extend headage grants to the newly designated disadvantaged areas and that payments be brought forward to this year instead of next year. These are all schemes that can be implemented with very little Exchequer funding.</P>
    <P>Crop farmers who want to buy seed for next year must be given immediate cash aid to ease their current difficulties which will be extended beyond next year.  Farmers whose crops and fodder have been destroyed need low interest loans.  This can be done through the European Investment Bank, and the loans could be related to the average cost of production per acre.  The banks and the ACC have a role to play to help farmers to overcome their difficulties.</P>
    <P>However, without Government leadership such schemes will not get off the ground and the financial difficulties of farmers will grow even worse because of a piling up of interest payments at penal rates.  There is a practical, humane way in which the Government can alleviate farmers' difficulties, particularly in the west.  There should be a smallholders' assistance scheme.  We all know that the CAP encourages such schemes because of their enormous social value in maintaining farmers' families on the land, but our own Department of Social Welfare, and that concerned socialist, Deputy Barry Desmond, have seen fit in recent years to reduce the effectiveness of that scheme by introducing a petty means test. It is because of the insecurity of farmers' livelihood as demonstrated by this summer's disaster that the farmers' dole was introduced.  It should never have been tampered with and I hope Deputy Desmond will stop his bureaucratic tampering in the light of the weather conditions this year.</P>
    <P>The Government cannot be proud of their overall reaction in this matter. <Col N="1268" /> Despite their much publicised helicopter trips over the Shannon Basin they seem to be totally unaware of the unfortunate farmers' problems.  The recent spell of good weather was a welcome break for the Government because it helped to take people's minds away from the disastrous summer.  Though the good weather recently has improved matters to some extent, most of the summer's problems are as great now as ever.  Farmers are frustrated at the lack of leadership, at the restricted nature of the relief schemes and the delaying tactics being employed. They want cash aid now, not promises or application forms.</P>
    <P>Looking ahead, there will always be the possibility that such disasters will recur, so we must look at the lessons learned this year.  First of all there has been over-reliance on hay as winter feed, particularly by small farmers in the west. Advice and assistance must be given to encourage collective silage and fodder production schemes.  A great deal remains to be done on drainage, particularly in the Shannon Basin.  An EC fund is available for this work which must be proceeded with vigorously.</P>
    <P>Even with the noises made by the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, in the past two or three years with regard to development in the western counties through the western drainage scheme, we see very little action &mdash; we hear noises but see no work on the ground.  Last week the Minister for the Environment announced a welcome move on improvement grants, something which we have been advocating for many years.  We should have had the same spirit of encouragement to provide winter housing for stock, particularly in the west where cattle are left out of doors during winter with consequent damage to spring grazing.  I hope the Minister will improve on this scheme in future.  Cheap housing is available and with a grant scheme farmers would be able to avail of it.</P>
    <P>Those are some of the problems, and we have suggested ways to alleviate them.  Farmers must have their confidence restored immediately, not later.  They look to the Government for leadership, <Col N="1269" /> particularly to the Minister for Agriculture. I hope they are not seeking that leadership in vain, but the Government's efforts to date do not offer room for optimism.  The amendment by the Government confirms my doubts that the farmers will get the leadership they require if their confidence is to be restored.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>In the short time available to me I will deal with the Government's amendment:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann expresses its support for the wide range of measures which the Government has taken to alleviate the difficulties encountered by many Irish farmers as a result of the bad weather during the summer months.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Our spokesman has set out clearly the positive steps the Minister should take.  I know of the widespread measures necessary in Offaly which illustrate the major problems of Irish farmers.  The Government knew of these problems as long ago as September.  We have the special scheme for the Shannon Valley farmers and the grain voucher scheme.  What do they mean?  There has been inexcusable delay in implementing those schemes and their restrictive nature ensures that at least one-third of the farmers in my county, in the Shannon Valley area, will not be eligible.  There is the fact that the scheme and its benefits are in no way related to the losses being incurred by farmers in the Shannon Valley and the other areas so badly affected.  Rather there are available the petty, insulting amounts under these schemes &mdash; a maximum of £500 under the Shannon Valley scheme and £400 under the grain voucher scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What has the Minister for Agriculture done since he was hauled down to the Midlands to see farming families on the verge of collapse?  Under the provisions of the Shannon Valley scheme a preliminary <Col N="1270" /> survey by ACOT officials in County Offaly established that there were some 300 families affected.  We learned this week that only 200 of them will be eligible. That is the type of response we have had from this Minister.  I might point out that the ratio of hay to silage as winter fodder in County Offaly is much higher than the national average, over 60 per cent being hay.  Under the Shannon Valley scheme there is the further restriction of a farmer having to have 60 livestock units.  I must admit that the farm development people are being flexible in relation to that requirement, that there are people being rendered eligible who would not normally be eligible were the 60 livestock units strictly adhered to. That is about the only aspect of that scheme to be welcomed as it affects the farmers I represent.</P>
    <P>One-third of the farming families which ACOT reckon are affected in the Shannon Valley in County Offaly &mdash; quite apart from the other counties &mdash; will not be eligible under this scheme.  One must ask what sort of a scheme is being implemented to assist farmers for what was a natural disaster which was declared only after a European came down to the area in a helicopter?  If it is established that only one-third of them will be eligible under its provisions what sort of scheme is that which was supposed to address itself to the real problems of people in south-west Offaly?  Can any bureaucrat, Minister, or Minister of State, explain to me &mdash; if the losses incurred by those families are not to be compensated &mdash; what is the point in proposing it as a scheme which is supposed to solve their problems?  The greatest insult of all is the £500 maximum.  The farm development scheme people are implementing the provisions of the scheme in two stages.  First, they must sift through all applications to establish eligibility or otherwise. Approximately 20 per cent of those applications have yet to be sifted through in County Offaly.  Then, having ascertained who is eligible, they must investigate each application in order to establish how much each will receive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1271" /> What every farmer in County Offaly wants to know is where did the Government get the figure of £500?  How can they contend that £500 is sufficient?  If they have not got the relevant data in relation to the various farming families eligible under the provisions of the scheme, where did they get the figure of £500?  The only assumption one can and is entitled to make is that this Government have just plucked a figure from the air, this representing the amount of money they will give Shannon Valley farmers; that is what they deem to be adequate before receiving data of the individual farming families affected.  If that is the price this Government place on the survival of farming families in south and west Offaly I would ask the Minister to return to see those fields when the water has receded, see the black ground remaining and demonstrate how £500 will do anything for such farmers.  It should be remembered that the provisions of the scheme are restricted to full time farmers, farmers whose source of income is derived mainly from farming.  What about the many part time farmers, those who are endeavouring to supplement their incomes, rear their families by way of seasonal work in Bord na Móna?  Will they receive no help under the charade of this scheme?  It represents a pathetic response, a national disgrace by way of response to a natural disaster.  This scheme is totally unacceptable to the people I represent.</P>
    <P>This grain voucher scheme represents the greatest facade, the greatest charade ever implemented.  Why do I contend that?  Once again the 60 livestock units represents a requirement for eligibility. In addition a farmer must establish less than 75 per cent adequacy of winter fodder supply.  Where did the Government get that figure?  The ACOT survey in County Offaly established that 1,000 farming families have a major problem with regard to winter fodder, the vast majority of whom will not be eligible under the provisions of the scheme because many will have fewer than the required 60 livestock units.  Such is the <Col N="1272" /> information I am receiving from the farm development people.  I cannot give a precise percentage because the scheme was announced only last Friday.  Yet the Minister was down in Offaly in August and September.  There was an advertisement in the Sunday newspapers, the application forms to be had from the relevant offices on Monday last.  In the first half day there were 50 applications received in the Birr office.  Yet the final date for receipt of applications is 20 November. We shall have to go through the whole bureaucratic charade again, sifting through the applications to ascertain how many farmers will be eligible.  What will be the maximum benefit they will receive?  Four hundred pounds after the worst summer in living memory.  It is simply not good enough for any Minister for Agriculture to come into this House and present these two schemes as representing in any way an adequate response to the major problems being faced by farming families.  Anybody who tries to defend the Minister is either being totally unreal or endeavouring to defend his own political philosophy.  I can tell the Minister that I have a constituent from the Galway side of the Shannon, the far side of Banagher, who has been told that he will receive £200 under the provisions of the scheme.  The Minister need not worry about him, he will be sending back the £200 because it represents an insult to him, he would not be bothered taking it&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cowen Mr. Cowen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cowen</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;compared with his problems.  Again we have the Coalition heckler.  I can tell the Deputy opposite that there may be a good few farmers in County Meath with 60 livestock units but the people whom I represent have not 60 livestock units.  They are entitled to remain in farming as much as are the people in the plush plains of County Meath.  The Deputy should remember that he has a good few supporters in south and west Offaly who will give him their <Col N="1273" /> answer when they next go to the polls. That is my response to that intervention.</P>
      <P>In the long term there must be a survey carried out of the Shannon area.  Let this Government say they will put up the £400,000 required to match the £400,000 from the EC.  If we are not to have a survey of the Shannon then let us swap, acre for acre, the land of the people who are endeavouring to make a full time living there from farming.  If one expects Shannon Valley farmers to derive a full time income from farming then either one must do something with the Shannon or one must swap acre for acre for other lands available in the area, and there are other lands available.  There are fulltime farmers coming to me and that is what they are saying.  &ldquo;If you are not going to drain it, let it flood for six months but give us somewhere we can make a living&rdquo;. They have a point.</P>
      <P>It has been brought to my attention that some townlands have been excluded from the provisions of the Shannon Valley scheme despite the fact that their distinct electoral division has been included.  The Minister might explain to me why it is, for example, that townlands like Ballymacoolaghan and Lusmagh, 100 yards from the Shannon, and which he was not far from when he visited that area, have not been included.  I can show him five needy farmers there who would even take the paltry sum of £500 as a token of recognition of their difficulties.</P>

    <P>I say to the Minister of State, Deputy Connaughton, who was quoted in our local newspaper as saying that it was not the purpose of the scheme fully to compensate farmers affected that that is simply a clear statement of Government policy.  If this Government are not prepared fully to compensate farmers who have suffered such exceptional losses as a result of this natural disaster, then I would ask them is it in their interests to leave those people aside?  Is it not in the national interest that those people be retained in farming?  Is it not also in the national interest to ensure that the sort of requirements they need are met by a responsible Minister for Agriculture?  Is it the case that the Minister for Agriculture <Col N="1274" /> has put the case to the Government but that there are unsympathetic Government members who will not implement the scheme?  Let the Minister tell the truth.  He should not pretend that these schemes are adequate.  They do not meet farmers' requirements and if a Minister or Government spokesman claim that they do they are telling an untruth.</P>
    <P>It is a dereliction of duty on the Minister's part if, having brought European bureaucrats to the west, he responds in this way to a natural disaster.  The Minister will receive very little thanks for the paltry sums to be put into the economy in my county.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 1:</P>
      <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;That&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dáil Éireann expresses its support for the wide range of measures which the Government has taken to alleviate the difficulties encountered by many Irish farmers as a result of the bad weather during the summer months.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see those Opposition Members back in town.  I was wondering where thay had been for the last six months as I had not heard a squeak from them.  There is no doubt that the appalling summer weather this year caused serious problems.  It would, however, be a mistake to suppose that every farmer was seriously affected by the weather or that any difficulties in recent months arose solely from this summer.  As regards the effects of the weather, the categories of farmers that were badly hit were those dependent on hay for winter feed and some tillage farmers, mainly cereal growers.  While there are significant numbers of farmers in these categories, there is also a substantial number in other categories who have not been seriously affected.  These would, for example, include many dairy farmers dependent on silage for winter feed, who have seen far more grass on their farms this year than last year &mdash; more indeed than in most years.  Also other grassland <Col N="1275" /> farmers producing drystock and dependent on silage for winter feed have been able to avoid the effects of the bad weather through good management of the exceptionally good growth of grass.</P>
    <P>I think it is also well to make the point that this year has been vastly different from 1974 when cattle prices collapsed. There have been some tremors in the beef market but generally prices have remained comparatively stable throughout recent months and there is no evidence at all to suggest that there has been panic selling of stock &mdash; in spite of the various forecasts that people would be panicked into selling.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the farm income problems this year have come from sources other than the weather.  The most obvious is the effect of the super-levy, as 1985-86 is the first year of the full impact of the EC constraints on milk production. In the beef sector problems in relation to intervention and to some external markets have adversely affected prices paid to farmers.  The effects of a very reduced period of intervention for full carcases this autumn, the impact of the decline in the value of the dollar on contracts denominated in dollars, and the level of export refunds set by the EC Commission for trade with third countries, have all affected prices paid this year for beef cattle.  In the case of sheep our presentation on export markets still leaves us commanding poorer prices than are possible, which in turn is reflected in the returns to producers.  These difficulties have been compounded by the prudent price policy that has been followed in Brussels, which has led to a low rate of farm price increases both this year, and indeed in recent years generally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When by late July there was no let up in the continuous period of bad weather, it was clear that many farmers, particularly those who were dependent on hay, were going to be faced with a very serious fodder problem in the coming winter <Col N="1276" /> months.  I, therefore, arranged for the launching on 8 August of a winter fodder scheme.  One element of this scheme was a nitrogen fertiliser subsidy at the rate of £35 per tonne of high nitrogen fertiliser and this was made available to farmers who purchased the fertiliser between 6 August and 31 August.  The only restriction in the scheme was to limit it to farmers with not more than 30 cows or 50 cattle.  The closing date for receipt of completed applications was later extended to 18 September to enable a number of farmers who had been deterred by the continuing bad weather to avail of it.  Despite gloomy prognostications some 24,000 applications for the subsidy were received and it is estimated that close on £1 million will be paid out in total.  Payments will commence this week.</P>
    <P>The second national measure was a silage subsidy at the rate of £4 per tonne subject to a maximum of 50 tonnes per farm in respect of silage made before 19 October, later extended to the end of October, on farms where silage had not previously been made.  This date has been further extended to 8 November.  The response to this scheme has exceeded all expectations with over 24,000 farmers applying for the subsidy so far.  The cost of this scheme, originally projected at £1½ million, will now be more than double that figure.  The drier weather from mid-September and during October coupled with good growing conditions enabled substantial quantities of silage to be made, and this will have a beneficial effect on the overall fodder position this winter.  Many people who had difficulties in relation to fodder should have learned their lesson in 1980 and 1981.  Far too many people depend on hay as a source of fodder.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Deasy</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of applicants for this scheme introduced in August illustrates that there is a tremendous capacity for a huge number of additional <Col N="1277" /> farmers to make silage.  It is gratifying to note that the bulk of the applications &mdash; over 70 per cent &mdash; for the silage subsidy came from the west and the north-west where the weather conditions and fodder shortage were most acute.  I hope this shows that farmers in those areas are now convinced of the advantages of silage as compared with hay which is so much at the mercy of weather conditions.  While this scheme was written off in some quarters as being of little consequence I now have no doubt at all but that it has contributed very substantially towards reducing the level of the winter fodder deficit.</P>
      <P>As a result of the continuous rain during August and earlier, extensive flooding occured in the valley of the river Shannon.  This was highlighted in dramatic pictures on our television screens. The floods resulted in many farmers in the area losing all or a substantial part of their winter fodder supplies.  In the view of the urgency of the situation and the severe losses incurred, the Government, at my request, agreed to provide a measure of assistance for the flooded area and, accordingly, on 6 September arrangements were announced for the payment to farmers in the Shannon Valley affected by the floods of the sum of £20 per livestock unit up to a maximum of 25 livestock units per farmer, that is, a maximum payment of £500.  Payments are confined to people mainly dependent on farming and with not more than 60 livestock units.  Deputy Cowen got his facts wrong.</P>

      <P>If Deputies opposite want <Col N="1279" /> to know about statistics let them ask some one on this side of the House, especially those of us in the Department of Agriculture. The severe hailstorm to which I referred affected a narrow corridor some five kilometeres wide from the southern part of Kilkenny north-east to the Ardee area of County Louth.  When it became clear that severe damage had been caused, my Department informed the EC Commission of our intention to lodge an application for an allocation from the Community's disaster relief fund as soon as details of the damage and loss caused could be ascertained.  Following a survey by ACOT, the Commission have since been given details of the losses and requested to regard them as meriting aid from the fund.  I must caution the House, however, that the fund amounts to only about £2 million in all to cover disaster situations in the entire Community.  It is not intended that the fund would provide for full compensation in the case of a disaster but rather a token of solidarity among member states.</P>
      <P>Throughout August and September, I kept in continuous touch with the situation and I visited many parts of the country, particularly in the west, to see for myself the effects of the weather at farm level.  For instance, I visited Galway late in July when the weather was not too bad.  In fact I was at the races for one day when the going was officially declared to be good.  However, the weather deteriorated and when I visited the Claremorris Agricultural Show on 11 August the rains had really set in.  On 14 August I visited the agricultural show at Ballina and at that stage the monsoons had set in.  On Thursday, 15 August I visited the agricultural show at Clifden, Ballinrobe and at Tullow, County Carlow.  That was quite a lot of travelling and I did not have a helicopter.</P>

I also met members of the National Executive of the ICMSA on the same day.  At that stage the weather was at its worst.  On Monday, 26 August, I visited the flooded Shannon Valley by helicopter.  On Tuesday, 27 August, I made a special trip to Brussels to see the Agricultural Commissioner, Mr. Andriesson, to apprise him of the situation.  I said we would match any aid we got from the EC, pound for pound and we did that.  The contribution from the EC was not huge as some people expected but it was considerably more than the aid given to other countries who were also in difficulties.  For instance, the mainland of Britain did not get any extra support from the EC.</P>

      <P>I do not have any complaints from County Wexford.  The number of cases that came to light in the course of the ACOT survey was exceptionally small.  I was in touch with the farming organisations and listened carefully to what they had to say about the situation.  In mid-August I had a special meeting with Commissioner Andriesson when I outlined to him the grave fodder situation facing our farmers and I sought EC aid to help to alleviate it.  Subsequently, Mr. Legras, Director General for Agriculture, and a colleague visited this country and they saw for themselves at first hand how bad the situation was for so many of our farmers.  Arising out of this visit and a further meeting which I had with Commissioner Andriesson, <Col N="1281" /> the Commission agreed to provide us with 125,000 tonnes of intervention grain at 25 per cent below the intervention price.  In money terms this concession is worth about £4,250,000 and is welcomed as a positive contribution towards meeting the difficulties confronting us.</P>
      <P>Throughout the crisis period a number of suggestions were made to me as to how I could help and many of these are included in the Opposition motion before us.  One of them was the earlier payment of headage grants.  In response I have made special arrangements this year to bring forward payments of headage and premium grants under the various 1985 sheep and cattle schemes.  Under these arrangements the following payments will be made between now and the end of 1985: (1) some 20,000 flockowners in the 1985 sheep headage scheme in the disadvantaged areas are now being paid £10 million at the rate of £9.50 per ewe on the first 150 and £6.50 on the next 50 ewes in a flock.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to you for allowing me to raise this matter.  In Lancaster Court in 1975 six Birmingham based Irishmen &mdash; I think it is as well to put their names on the record: Bill Power, Dick McIlkenny, Paddy Hill, Hugh Callaghan, Gerry Hunter and John Walker &mdash; were sentenced to life imprisonment for convictions in respect of the horrendous events in Birmingham on Thursday, 21 November 1974, when 21 people were killed and 161 maimed or seriously injured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is common cause in this House that even now, 11 years later, we are all united <Col N="1282" /> in our condemnation and abhorrence of those terrible events.  We repudiate the attempt by anyone to associate those events with Irish Republicanism, what it has represented over the years and what we hope it will develop into in the future.</P>
    <P>As a consequence of those convictions and the general attitude in Britain at the time, there was a perhaps understandable revulsion against the Irish community, and particularly very strong and bitter feelings were directed against those six convicted men.  The House will recall that, soon after that the then Home Secretary, Mr. Roy Jenkins, introduced what was described as the Temporary Prevention of Terrorism Act, which is still in force &mdash; I have had personal experience of that Act.  That was introduced as an expression of the revulsion of the British people and the determination of the British Government to deal with people like those six men who were convicted of those horrific events.  I want to give the background of this case because it is a major issue.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was to ask the Taoiseach if &ldquo;information&rdquo; and briefings recently conveyed to the media by the Government Press Secretary in relation to correspondence in November 1979 between former Ambassador Seán Donlon and US Congressman, Mr. Hamilton Fish, were issued with his knowledge or authority and if he will make a full and detailed statement on the matter in view of the very serious issues involved.  I am now dealing with the very serious issues involved and the implications particularly of the role I was alleged to have played in attempting to obstruct any inquiries into those very serious issues.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They were horrendous events and the consequences for the people maimed, injured or killed, and their families were very serious, and the same is true for <Col N="1283" /> these six men who were convicted.  This case was appealed and the appeal was dealt with in May 1976.  The same Lord Widgery, whose name is not unknown to us because of the very sad and tragic experience in Derry, in the Court of Appeal upheld the sentence, despite pleas that the confessions had been obtained because of beatings by warders and ill treatment of the accused men.</P>
    <P>I want to bring one other matter before the House because it is very important. Because of complaints of ill treatment in the court at that time, 14 prison officers were arraigned for trial.  The then Lord Denning in the course of his decision on the trial of the prison officers, who were acquitted, said:</P>
    <P>If the six men win it will mean that the police were guilty of perjury, violence and threats, that the confessions were involuntary and were improperly admitted and that the convictions were erroneous.  The Home Secretary would then have to recommend that they be pardoned or remit the case to the Court of Appeal.  This is such an appalling vista that every sensible person in the land would say &ldquo;It cannot be right that these actions would go any further. They should be struck out&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He was saying that the complaints of the Birmingham six should be struck out. Every Irish person, anyone conscious of the impact of those horrible events in 1974, the trial in 1975, the attitudes expressed by the judges, is aware of our obligations and would repudiate violence and ensure that justice would not only be done but be seen to be done.</P>
    <P>That was the climate which prevailed when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs. In my capacity as Minister for Foreign Affairs I recall talking to, among others, Father Raymond Murray, with whom I spent 90 minutes or two hours in this House in 1978.  We did not discuss the evidence because it had not surfaced at that time, but we did discuss treatment of Irish prisoners in British jails.  The only discussion I as a Fianna Fáil Minister or my officials on my behalf, but with my <Col N="1284" /> knowledge and authority, had about matters pertaining to the men convicted of the Birmingham bombings or others serving sentences in British jails, or in Long Kesh, was to raise more than once &mdash; I cannot recall the exact number of times but I know it was at least twice &mdash; with the then Secretary of State, Mr. Roy Mason at ministerial level, the treatment of Irish prisioners in British jails and our concern that basic justice would be done, and would be seen to be done.  That was the record until very recently.</P>
    <P>Because of very painstaking research carried out by the &ldquo;World in Action&rdquo; team very serious doubts were cast on the evidence and the basis on which the evidence against the Birmingham six was prepared and presented in court.  It is not my function or the function of this House to go into this matter in great detail, but I will summarise the main points very briefly.  Sufficient information emerged from that programme, which had not been previously available to any of us &mdash; I am not sure if it was available to the Minister or the Taoiseach, but I do not suppose it was &mdash; to at least raise the gravest doubts that the evidence on which the six men were convicted was evidence which would stand up in any court of law. These men were convicted on the basis of tests carried out for traces of nitro-glycerine. It emerged in the course of that television presentation that this could happen and there seems to be very good evidence to support this.</P>
    <P>The seriousness of all this raises the question of the conduct of the Government Press Secretary.  These people could have had traces of nitro-glycerine on their hands from something as simple as smoking or even card playing, which it is suggested they were engaged in on the night in question.  Understandably, there was a very strong feeling in this country, which was echoed in this House in questions to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, that we all had an obligation to do something to right the wrong, to ensure that the fullest possible investigation would be conducted and that justice would be done and seen to be done to the Birmingham six.  Deputy David <Col N="1285" /> Andrews raised the matter in the House and the Minister for Foreign Affairs indicated&mdash;</P>

      <P>The allegation in respect of my lack of concern is of little consequence by contrast with the issue itself.  The House and the nation were concerned when a very painstaking piece of journalism was undertaken by Kevin Dawson of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>.  The public and the press asked questions and when that happened the ever active Government Press Secretary decided it was time to put his version of who was responsible for certain events in Washington in 1979.  In the knowledge that this was now a matter of grave public concern he decided it was time to disseminate not information but misinformation.  This is from a paid servant of the Government selected by them to put their version of the story before the Irish people.  As a consequence of the detailed article by Kevin Dawson in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> it was clear that something had to be done and somebody had to be blamed.  Who was to be blamed?  The Government Press Secretary sees it as his job to engage in propaganda on behalf of the Government and to point the finger at the former Government, particularly the former Minister for Foreign Affairs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The correspondence in November 1979 between former Ambassador Seán Donlon and US Congressman Hamilton Fish has been the subject of widespread media and public interest and concern in recent days.  The Government Press Secretary, Mr. Peter Prendergast, is quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> of Monday, 4 November as saying that if the Irish Embassy in Washington had done anything it would have &ldquo;been on instructions from the Government in Dublin&rdquo;.  This is in relation to reports that the then Irish Ambassador, Seán Donlon, had communicated with Congressman Fish to the effect that he should have nothing to do with Fr. Raymond Murray in his attempts <Col N="1286" /> to raise the evidence on which the Birmingham six were convicted.  The ever-active disseminator of Government propaganda, Mr. Peter Prendergast, could not wait to give the impression that if this had been done by Ambassador Donlon it was on the instructions of the Government in Dublin.  The same report added:</P>
    <P>At the time of the allegations against Mr. Donlon Fianna Fáil was in power and the Minister for Foreign Affairs was Mr. Michael O'Kennedy.</P>
    <P>I want to make no comment on the fact that Ambassador Donlon, who is now Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, has chosen not to comment.  That is his right as a public servant.  It is a judgment he is entitled to make as of right.  However, I cannot leave implications on the record because of the actions of the Government Press Secretary, who is not earning a reputation for accuracy and respect from all sides of the House which he should have, that on my instructions Congressman Hamilton Fish was told by the then Ambassador not to inquire publicly in Congress behind the evidence on which the Birmingham six were convicted.  The very opposite is true.  The clear intention of Mr. Prendergast was to convey the impression that the letter in question was issued on my instructions.  There is no basis whatsoever for this impression.  I did not give any instructions to issue the letter in question nor was any approval sought from me for such a letter.</P>
    <P>From inquiries I have made in the Department of Foreign Affairs I can confirm that the only action I took as Minister for Foreign Affairs in relation to the people convicted of the Birmingham bombing was to raise the matter personally in ministerial discussions with the British Government and to authorise continuing discussions at official level on that and other related matters to do with the treatment of Irish prisoners in jails in Britain and the North of Ireland.</P>
    <P>On one occasion I remember having a very lengthy and detailed discussion with Fr. Raymond Murray in my office in this <Col N="1287" /> House.  It was a detailed, satisfactory and informative discussion.  I should like to pay tribute to Fr. Murray's consistent concern and to Fr. Denis Faul, who has also been a consistent promoter of justice and has never been afraid to criticise violence from whatever source, be it the institutionalised violence of the security forces in the North or of the IRA.  I have had the privilege of meeting and discussing those events with both those men.</P>
    <P>I am informed without any doubt by the Department of Foreign Affairs that in the past few days no statement or comment of any kind issued from that Department on these issues.  This was a deliberate decision which I do not criticise. Any &ldquo;information&rdquo; or briefing to the media in the past few days has emanated solely and exclusively from Mr. Peter Prendergast, Government Press Secretary and misinformation officer.  Some of the points made have been repudiated by a very honourable Member of this House, Deputy Professor John Kelly, regarding the role he was supposed to have played in these events.  It is time to stop that kind of propaganda on a matter as serious as this, not just for Deputy O'Kennedy, former Minister, but for the people concerned.  To imply that any former Minister was so ill-concerned for the fundamental issues involved as to instruct his ambassador to write a letter to ensure that it could not be raised in Congress is a major issue.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach is in the House, as well as the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  He should take the opportunity to put the record straight and repudiate the actions of the Government Press Secretary in this regard.  If there is a statement to be issued on behalf of the Department of Foreign Affairs, the current Secretary and a former Ambassador, that statement should come from people who know a little more about the facts and the history and who are much more aware of the procedures in foreign affairs, and not from a gentleman who has done little to promote truth and accuracy in political reporting.</P>

      <P>In reply to a Press query from Ella Shanahan in <i>The Irish Times</i> about a letter from the then Ambassador Donlon to Congressman Hamilton Fish on 6 November 1979 after consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs and with their authority the Government Press Secretary said:</P>
      <P>If the Irish Embassy in Washington had done anything it would have been on instructions from Dublin.  Fianna Fáil were in Government at the time.</P>
      <P>He gave no further information or briefings and initiated no contacts with the Press at any time on this matter.  I point out in saying this much that the Government Press Secretary was simply stating the general position in regard to the context in which Irish representatives abroad act.</P>
      <P>Ambassador Donlon's letter to Congressman Hamilton Fish did not &mdash; as Deputy O'Kennedy appeared to imply and I hope he will withdraw this fully as it was denied, as I will point out later, by a Minister of his Government &mdash; make representations to him about the Birmingham six, and Ambassador Donlon made that clear in a letter of 10 January 1980 to Father Raymond Murray in which he said: &ldquo;At no stage have I made representations to Congressman Fish in the matter of the six Irishmen convicted of the Birmingham bombings in 1974.&rdquo; His letter of 11 November 1979 was written in pursuance of a policy enunciated by the then Taoiseach, Deputy Jack Lynch, in a letter to Congressman Biaggi of 17 February 1978.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This letter from the then Taoiseach was written at the instance of Deputy O'Kennedy who proposed it in draft form to the then Taoiseach under cover of a letter of the same date.  The policy put forward by the then Taoiseach &mdash; it was consistent with that of the preceding Government &mdash; was one of opposing the Irish National Caucus which in this letter the then Taoiseach described as &ldquo;closely associated with the cause of violence in Northern Ireland&rdquo; and which the Leader of the Opposition today, Deputy Haughey, his successor as Taoiseach, <Col N="1289" /> referred to in a speech on 27 July 1980 in Cork in the following terms: &ldquo;The evidence available to us also of the associations that exist between NORAID and the Irish National Caucus casts grave suspicion on the latter organisation.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Subsequent to these events, on 11 January 1980 the then Minister for Foreign Affairs in the Government led by Deputy Haughey, that is Deputy Brian Lenihan, wrote to Father Murray and Father Faul in the following terms and I quote the letter in full:</P>
    <P>Dear Father Murray and Father Faul,</P>
    <P>I have received your letter and enclosure of 28 December last concerning your representations to the Ambassador in Washington.  The Ambassador is replying directly to the letter addressed to him by you and Father Brady.</P>
    <P>I have already quoted from that letter.  I continue to quote:</P>
    <P>I and the Government have full confidence in Ambassador Donlon and his staff.  His conversations with Congressman Fish have not touched on the case of those convicted of the Birmingham bombings of 1974.  They have been about the Congressman's interest in promoting contacts between elected representatives from both parts of Ireland and US elected representatives.</P>
    <P>The whole of what Deputy O'Kennedy has said, has been, therefore, on a false premise&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>Finally, I should tell the House that, following the most recent representations by the Government which follow a series of other representations by successive Governments that were initiated when I was Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1976, the Government have been informed by the British Government that the Home Secretary, who has been presented with <Col N="1291" /> new material about the case of the Birmingham six, is considering very carefully whether it would be appropriate to refer the case to the Court of Appeal and that the matter is being dealt with very urgently.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government's position on <Col N="1107" /> nuclear weapons in general and on nuclear weapons testing in particular is well known to the French Government, as indeed to the Governments of all the nuclear weapons States.  It was most recently reiterated by me in the course of my address to the 40th session of the United Nations General Assembly.  On that occasion I renewed my appeal to the nuclear weapon States to take the first step towards nuclear disarmament by working for the early conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty.  I also urged them to undertake a commitment to halt testing at the soonest possible date.</P>
      <P>As regards the specific incident of testing in the South Pacific raised by the Deputy, it is not our practice to convey our views to the Governments concerned regarding individual tests.</P>
      <P>With reference to the detention of an Irish citizen involved in the Greenpeace protest against the French testing, the Irish Embassy, Paris, contacted the French authorities upon receiving news of her detention.  The embassy was advised that she was being transported to Tahiti for deportation.  The embassy maintained contact with the French authorities until deportation had been effected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The main meetings in the last year or so, and the main forms of co-operation in the drugs area in which Ireland is involved are through our membership of the EC and other international organisations.</P>
      <P>Although the EC Treaties do not deal directly with the question of control of drug abuse or smuggling there is ongoing co-operation between Community countries. In addition the Irish Minister for Health, Deputy Barry Desmond, called a meeting of his European colleagues in Brussels during the Irish Persidency of the Community.  This took place in November 1984 and drug questions formed the main topic.  A subsequent meeting was held under the Italian Presidency in Venice in May 1985 at which Ireland was represented by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy John Donnellan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the Council of Europe context Ireland is a member of the &ldquo;Pompidou Group&rdquo;.  This is a co-operation group made up of 16 of the 21 member states and was set up to combat drug abuse and illicit trafficking in drugs.  The Ministers meet every two years.  Their most recent meeting was in September 1984 and Ireland was represented by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, <Col N="1109" /> Deputy John Donnellan, Senior officials known as the &ldquo;Permanent Correspondents&rdquo; meet twice yearly.</P>
    <P>The World Health Organisation (WHO) held a major seminar of officials on the world drug problem in September 1983 at which the Department of Health were represented.  This was an interregional workshop on drug dependence.</P>
    <P>The Garda, naturally, co-operate, through Interpol, with foreign law enforcement agencies in fighting drug offences and drug trafficking.  The Revenue Commissioners are also involved in international co-operation in the prevention of illegal drug trafficking.  Ireland acceded in 1974 to the Naples Convention which provides for mutual administrative assistance between customs administrations of EC member states and Turkey on matters relating to the illicit traffic in drugs.  Frequent meetings of the Mutual Assistance Group (MAG), at which all member states are represented, take place where matters of common concern such as drug trafficking are discussed and joint action decided upon.  The Naples Convention also provides for direct contact between the investigation services of customs administrations in the fight against the illicit traffic in drugs.</P>
    <P>International co-operation and the spontaneous exchange of information take place on an on-going basis.  Ireland is a member of the Customs Co-operation Council (CCC) which is an international organisation responsible for promoting co-operation between customs administrations in relation to, <i>inter alia,</i> smuggling, customs fraud and the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs.</P>
    <P>Ireland was one of the first countries to accede to the Nairobi Convention, an international instrument drawn up by the CCC which provides for mutual administrative assistance for the prevention, investigation and repression of customs offences.  Annex X of the convention deals exclusively with drug trafficking and Ireland has accepted this annex.</P>
    <P>Ireland is represented by customs officials at meetings of the Enforcement <Col N="1110" /> Committee of the CCC and drug trafficking is a major issue at these meetings. Agencies such as Interpol and United Nations Division of Narcotic Drugs attend these meetings so that there is full dissemination of information about drug trafficking and useful liaison is maintained. Ireland was also represented at the Multinational Conference on Trafficking in Narcotics, Rome, 1983 &mdash; jointly sponsored by the United States customs administration and Italian customs administration.</P>
    <P>In the United Nations context I have been somewhat heartened by the increased awareness of drug problems reflected in the debates and resolutions of the general assembly in recent years. These signs of increased awareness of the seriousness of the problem are helpful for the future of world co-operation in the area.  The Secretary General of the United Nations has proposed a world conference on drug questions to be held in 1987.  I welcome this initiative and support it.  I consider that it could be a major boost to international co-operation in the fight against drug trafficking and drug abuse.</P>

The British authorities have been made fully aware of the Government's policy and I have been given an assurance by the British authorities that no new closures will take place without prior consultations with me.</P>
      <P>I am keenly aware of the hardship which the closing of Border roads causes to the local communities on both sides of the Border and have repeatedly stressed this point in my contacts with the British authorities.  Among the particular cases which I have raised are the roads on the County Leitrim border with Northern Ireland.</P>
      <P>The British authorities have stated that they do not propose to open Border roads to vehicular traffic until the security situation allows.  Nonetheless, I am pressing the British authorities to have Border roads rephoned and discussion are continuing to this end.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, I have already taken action on this matter.  On 21 October, on my instructions, the British Ambassador was summoned to my Department and was received by the Secretary of the Department.  If I had not been absent from Dublin at that time I would, of course, have seen the Ambassador myself.  The Ambassador was left in no doubt that the remarks attributed to Sir John Hermon which were publicised in press reports in the <i>Toronto Sun</i> and the <i>Houston Post</i> on 17 October and which reflected upon the security policy of the Government were <Col N="1112" /> completely unfounded and damaging to Garda-RUC co-operation.  An immediate investigation of these reports was sought together with an explanation of the remarks attributed to Sir John Hermon.</P>
      <P>In response, the British Government have stated their view that Sir John Hermon's remarks to the conference in Houston were seriously misrepresented and have assured the Irish Government that they greatly appreciated the measures which have been taken in co-operation with the security forces in Northern Ireland to prevent acts of violence on both sides of the Border.</P>
      <P>On the basis of this statement I am satisfied that the news reports which have appeared on Sir John Hermon's remarks in Houston do not represent the views of the British Government &mdash; and I have been assured by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland that they do not represent the views of the head of the RUC &mdash; in relation to the Irish Government's security policy or the level of security co-operation with the Northern Ireland authorities.  The reports to which the Deputy refers, therefore, warrant no further action.</P>

      <P>The Conference on Confidence and Security-Building Measures and Disarmament in Europe (CDE) which has been in progress in Stockholm since January 1984 is today entering its eighth session.  The aim of the CDE is to seek agreement on a set of mutually complementary confidence and security building measures (CSBMs) which will reduce the risk of a military confrontation in Europe by bringing about openness and predictability in the use that is made of existing military forces.</P>
      <P>The general debate in plenary and in working groups in the course of 1985 has been constructive in tone and increasingly detailed in substance with delegations continuing to expound on and explore the proposals tabled.  At the close of the seventh session the conference agreed informal arrangements for discussions outside the official working structure.  It is hoped that these discussions will enable the issues to be clarified to the point that the drafting of a concluding document can soon begin.  If agreement can be reached on acceptable measures before the next CSCE followup meeting in Vienna in November 1986 this should open the way to a second stage of the conference dealing with concrete disarmament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There has been no change in our arrangements for consultation since my answer to Deputy Collins on 17 October last year.  The Stockholm conference is considered by the Ten &mdash; shortly to become the Twelve &mdash; within the framework of European political co-operation. We try to find a common position with our Ten partners on various aspects of the conference.  On a bilateral basis, we keep in contact with as many delegations as possible, in particular the delegations of other neutral participating States whose approach to arms control has traditionally been close to our own.  The <Col N="1114" /> basis of our contacts with other delegations is our national position set out by me at the outset of the conference and in subsequent interventions by the Irish delegation.</P>

      <P>The Government are deeply concerned at the continued imprisonment of Mr. Nelson Mandela in South Africa and Mr. Anatoli Sharansky in the Soviet Union.</P>
      <P>Our concern about Mr. Mandela has frequently been reflected in our public statements on South Africa.  Ireland has been closely associated in numerous moves by the Ten on behalf of Mr. Mandela and other detainees in South Africa. Indeed during the speech by the Luxembourg representative to the United Nations on the occasion of the Day of Solidarity with South African Political Prisoners, a fresh appeal was made on behalf of the Ten for the release of Mr. Mandela.  Foreign Ministers of the Ten also appealed for Mr. Mandela's release after their meetings of 22 July and 10 September.</P>

      <P>The Government have not considered establishing such a commission. The position regarding human rights in South Africa is, regrettably, all too clear and the position of the South African Government and of significant sectors of public opinion, white and non-white, in South Africa was investigated in late August-early September by a mission on behalf of the European Community member states, thus including Ireland, made up of the Foreign Ministers of Luxembourg, Italy and the Netherlands as well as the commissioner responsible for external relations.</P>

      <P>It is not correct to say that the Law Reform Commission have ceased to exist.  They are a body corporate, and their research and other staff are continuing their work on the current programme for law reform which was drawn up by the commission and approved by the Government.</P>
      <P>The Government, in consultation with the Attorney General, have been considering ways in which the contribution of the commission to the important question of continuing reform of the law can be made more effective.  The question of appointments to membership of the commission is also being considered in this context.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 35 and 36 together.  The agency with responsibility for extension to the natural gas grid are Bord Gáis Éireann.  In August 1984, I secured Government approval for the board to proceed with supply to Clonmel based on proposals submitted by Clonmel Corporation involving a corporation operated and financed project.</P>
      <P>In subsequent discussions with Bord Gáis, Clonmel Corporation made fundamental alterations to their proposals which would require the take-over by BGE of virtually all responsibility for the funding and operation of the project. BGE indicated that they were prepared to consider such an arrangement but only after their own independent investigations confirmed both the technical and economic viability of the project.</P>
      <P>It is understood from BGE that these investigations will be completed shortly and that BGE will them be in a position to revert to the corporation.  I do not feel that my intervention is appropriate in the circumstances.</P>

      <P>The Casual Trading Act, 1980, empowers local authorities to designate the places in their functional areas where casual trading may be carried on and, when they have designated casual trading areas, it is an offence to engage in casual trading elsewhere.  In addition to confining traders to specified places, local authorities can regulate such trading by means of by-laws (which the authorities are empowered to make) and conditions attached to casual trading permits granted by the local authorities to casual traders.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I am informed that Dublin County Council have only recently designated casual trading areas, it is not clear how <Col N="1121" /> illegal trading in the sense of the Casual Trading Act, 1980, could have been carried on in the Darndale area for the past seven or eight years.  I understand, however, that the council have made investigations in relation to trading at Darndale, which is not among the areas designated, and that the council are considering what action to take to secure compliance with the law.  I am satisfied that Dublin County Council have all the powers they need to deal with whatever problems exist.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware, the Government and the Dáil and Seanad Committees on Procedure and Privileges have agreed that radio broadcasting, in edited form, of Dáil, Seanad and Oireachtas Committee debates should commence as soon as possible.  In this regard the Government have made £100,000 available for the purchase of the necessary equipment.</P>

    <P>Over the past few months, difficulties were experienced in identifying suitable accommodation, in the vicinity of Leinster House, for the RTE broadcasting-taping facility.  It had originally been the intention to locate this facility in 28 Molesworth Street but following detailed technical evaluation, it emerged that this location was not suitable.  However, I am pleased to say that suitable accommodation has been identified in Frederick Building in the Setanta complex and the necessary adaptation-refurbishment is now being undertaken by OPW in consultation with RTE.  It now appears unlikely that broadcasting, in the form approved, can take place before the Christmas recess but it is the Government's intention <Col N="1122" /> that the broadcasting will commence at the beginning of the first Dáil Session in 1986</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 43 and 44 together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Over the past year I have been closely monitoring developments in the semi-conductor sector which, as Deputies will be aware, has been experiencing a severe downturn particularly in the area of commodity memory chips, the product which Mostek produced in Blanchardstown. This severe downturn in demand led to Mostek laying-off 140 of its workers here in May of this year and to substantial lay-offs and plant closures in Mostek's operations world-wide.  This deteriorating international situation obviously posed a threat to Mostek's operations here and the Industrial Development Authority, at my request, became involved in continuing contacts with the <Col N="1123" /> company and with its parent corporation, Mostek of Carrolton, Texas, to attempt to ensure the maintenance of employment at the Blanchardstown facility. These efforts continued following Mostek's announcement of the temporary closure of its plant on 4 October 1985.</P>
    <P>Regrettably, after detailed consideration the company did not consider it feasible to maintain employment in the Irish facility against the background of the decision by Mostek's parent company, United Technologies Corporation, to discontinue its semi-conductor business world-wide and announced permanent closure of the Blanchardstown plant on 18 October 1985.</P>
    <P>The decision to cease the production of semi-conductors by Mostek Corporation, including Mostek Ireland, was taken by United Technologies on commercial grounds i.e.</P>
    <P>&mdash; the current recession in the semi-conductor sector and in particular the severe downturn in the prices of commodity memory chips, Mostek's semi-conductor product, since 1984</P>
    <P>&mdash; substantial losses incurred by Mostek Corporation.</P>
    <P>Capital and training grants totalling £5.4 million have been paid by the IDA to Mostek but United Technologies have agreed to meet all outstanding liabilities to the IDA and the authority expects repayment of a substantial proportion of its outlay on the project.</P>
    <P>Obviously I am very concerned over the loss of over 400 jobs in Blanchardstown. Immediately following the closure announcement IDA commenced active promotion of the Blanchardstown <Col N="1124" /> facility, through its overseas offices, to procure an alternative suitable project and while no proposals are to hand at present the facility is being vigorously marketed.  Last month I announced that a leading American high technology corporation EG&amp;G is to establish a plant at Blanchardstown with a job potential of 240.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he will make a statement (1) outlining the Government's policy with regard to air-pollution legislation including smokeless zones; and (2) in relation to the harmful effects and dangerous toxins associated with fuels which do not emit smoke, but could in fact be more harmful to the environment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>In August 1985 the Government gave approval to the drafting of a Bill to update and extend existing legislation on the control of air pollution.  It is intended that the Bill will permit the full implementation of EC legislation and will provide local authorities with all necessary powers to ensure good air quality in their areas.  Drafting of the Bill is now in progress.</P>
      <P>The information available in regard to urban air quality generally, and in Dublin in particular, indicates that the pollutant giving most cause for concern is smoke arising from the combustion of solid fuels.  Various options for dealing with smoke pollution, and the costs and other implications of different solutions, including smokeless zones, are being examined in my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1130" /> All fuels, depending on their intrinsic qualities, emit pollutants such as sulphur oxides, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons in varying quantities. These pollutants, above certain concentrations, can have harmful effects but I am not aware that they give rise to any general problems in this country.</P>
    <P>The most commonly used smokeless fuel at the moment is natural gas.  While combustion of natural gas gives rise to emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons, the levels of such emissions are no greater than emissions of these pollutants from smoke-emitting fuels such as coal.  The same situation obtains for smokeless solid fuels.  As regards sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, EC limit values for the protection of health and the environment have already been provided and will be enforced, in this country, under the new air pollution legislation.</P>
    <P>In so far as emissions from fuel used in motor vehicles are concerned, work is being finalised at EC level on stringent new standards for emissions of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons. For petrol driven engines, a recent EC directive requires unleaded petrol to be available by October 1989 at the latest and invites member states to reduce the lead content of leaded petrol from 0.4 to 0.15 grammes per litre as soon as appropriate.  I intend to make regulations shortly to provide for such a reduction in this country in 1986.</P>

Grant instalments of £5,300 and £1,650 were paid to the group on 31 January and 29 March 1985 respectively, based on the local inspector's certificates of expenditure incurred on the scheme.

      <P>The Civil Service superannuation code is designed to provide for officers who retire on grounds of age or ill-health.  The compulsory retiring age for civil servants is normally 65 but they may retire with immediate pension from age 60, if they so wish.  The conditions governing early voluntary retirement have, in fact, been made more attractive in recent years.  For example, the qualifying service for maximum lump sum has been reduced from 45 to 40 years and pensions are now revised annually in line with current salaries.  In addition, persons who resign before age 60 can, provided they have at least five years' service, have their accrued entitlement to pension and lump sum preserved and paid at age 60 on an uprated basis.  Furthermore, the arrangements for the transfer of pensionable service, which are now being operated by a large number of public sector bodies, allow civil servants, subject to certain conditions, to reckon earlier service given in other areas of the public sector.  Following these improvements, the number of civil servants retiring voluntarily before the compulsory retiring age has tended to increase.  In view of these improvements and having regard to cost factors, no further measures to make early retirement more attractive are envisaged at present.</P>

    <P>(a) Includes a substantial proportion of land which for various reasons e.g. subject to grazing or turbary rights or sale/exchange proceedings is not immediately available for planting.</P>
    <P>(b) Generally unsuitable for planting but with some potential for wildlife, amenity development, etc.  The planting in future years will be carried o ut on the plantable reserve and on newly acquired land.</P>
    <P>(c) My Department do not employ part time workers; temporary workers are employed full time for a limited period.  Temporary workers are employed for seasonal work or to meet short term needs.  Some workers were employed in County Donegal earlier in the year and their term of employment has expired.  The numbers given above relate only to those currently employed.  Equally the requirement for permanent workers at forests may vary from year to year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Communication (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>It is presumed that the Deputy's question relates to commercial harbours subject to the Harbours Act, 1946.</P>
      <P>Grants of up to 50 per cent are available from the European Regional Development Fund in respect of infrastructural development, including harbour development, subject to a national quota.  In the period 1981 to 1985, grants totalling £6.301 million were awarded in respect of the development of Cork Harbour. Grants from the ERDF are paid to the Exchequer and are used to increase the overall level of resources available for development through the public capital programme.</P>
      <P>The only other source of EC financing for port development is the European Investment Bank which provides long term loans at commercial interest rates. A loan of almost £8.5 million in two instalments, the second being in March 1981, was made available by the EIB to the Exchequer for the Cork Harbour Development Project.  Loans from the Bank are not allocated on a quota type basis so that the term &ldquo;obtainable&rdquo; has no real relevance where these loans are concerned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>State grants exceeding 50 per cent of total capital cost have been paid to various harbours over the years.  A capital development programme at Dublin Port, begun in 1978, has recently been completed at a cost in excess of £17 million. The Government decided this year to make available to the board State grant assistance of £9 million spread equally over the period 1985-87, of which £3 million has already been paid this year. <Col N="1150" /> The general policy with regard to harbour grants for all commercial harbours is that they should be provided only where improvements are essential to meet well-defined commercial needs and where a harbour authority's own resources are insufficient.  A review of this is in progress in connection with the forthcoming Green Paper on Transport Policy.</P>

I am satisfied that an equally high, and in some respects, higher standard of care could be provided with less use of drugs.  However, it is the prescribing patterns of doctors which give rise to the costs involved.  The payments made to pharmacists for dispensing the items prescribed by doctors are not unreasonable. I understand from the General Medical Services (Payments) Board that they have recently reiterated the instructions to pharmacists regarding the way in which prescriptions which do not specify a brand name are to be dispensed.  Pharmacists are obliged to dispense from <Col N="1154" /> among the lower, if not the lowest cost version of generically-prescribed drugs where it is reasonable to expect them to be able to do so.

      <P>The unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned was disallowed on the grounds that his means derived from the profit from his holding exceeded the statutory limit.  He appealed against the decision but an appeals officer, on 16 April 1985 also decided that his means exceeded the statutory limit.  He has recently made a supplementary claim at his local office and arrangements are being made to have <Col N="1155" /> his means reinvestigated by a social welfare officer.  When these inquiries are completed his means will be assessed by a deciding officer and his entitlement to unemployment assistance will be reviewed in the light of the amount of means assessed against him.  If he is dissatisfied with the decision in his case it will then be open to him, under new arrangements introduced some months ago, to request an oral hearing of his appeal.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must have at least 26 contributions paid at a class which provides cover against unemployment. According to the Department's records the person concerned entered insurable employment on 17 September 1984 and has only 17 contributions paid on his behalf up to the date he claimed unemployment benefit on 22 January 1985. The claimant contends that he commenced employment in September 1983 but the employer's records show that employment did not in fact commence until September 1984.  Further inquiries are being made at present to establish the correct date on which the employment commenced and if the employment was insurable at a contribution class providing cover against unemployment.  His entitlement to unemployment benefit will be determined in the light of the outcome of this investigation.  He is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £21 weekly being the appropriate rate in his case of £31.75 less means of £10.75 assessed against him.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason unemployment benefit has been reduced in the case of a person (details supplied) in County Tipperary; when his payments will be <Col N="1156" /> increased to their normal level; and the amount which will be paid.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 8 October 1984, and his claim was allowed at £37.25 weekly being the maximum flat rate unemployment benefit payable to a single person.  In addition he was entitled to pay-related benefit of £16.01 weekly. On 20 March 1985 he entered the second, lower phase of pay-related benefit and payment of this benefit was reduced from £16.01 weekly to £12.81.  The rate of unemployment benefit payable to him increased to £39.50 from 4 July 1985 and his combined payment of £50.06 increased to £52.31 weekly.  This payment will continue until his entitlement of 390 days unemployment benefit is exhausted.</P>
      <P>He also applied for a qualification certificate and a deciding officer assessed his means at £36 weekly derived from the value of capital and board and lodgings on his mother's holding.  His means exceed the statutory limit and accordingly he is not entitled to unemployment assistance following the exhaustion of his unemployment benefit claim.</P>

      <P>The appeal of the person concerned against the assessment of means of £50 weekly, derived from benefit from his wife's earnings, has been submitted to an appeals officer for determination. The granting of an oral hearing is a matter for the appeals officer as regulations provide that if he is of the opinion that the case is of such a nature that it can be determined without a hearing he may determine it summarily.  The rate of unemployment assistance payable will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.</P>
      <P>The person concerned is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £50.05 weekly, the appropriate rate in his case of £100.05 less means of £50.</P>

She appealed against the disallowance and following an oral hearing of her case on 16 October 1985 an appeals officer also decided that she was not available for employment.  She has continued to sign the unemployed register and inquiries are being made at present to establish if she now satisfied the required conditions for receipt of unemployment benefit.

      <P>Following a recent investigation of his unemployment assistance claim the means of the person concerned were assessed at £59.85 weekly derived from the value of capital and from profit from his holding.  His means exceeded the statutory limit and accordingly his claim to unemployment assistance was disallowed.  He was recently issued with <Col N="1159" /> an appeal form but to date he has not returned it.  He ceased signing at his local office on 15 October 1985.</P>

      <P>The entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment assistance could not be determined until inquiries regarding his means were completed by a social welfare officer.  The inquiries were recently completed and a deciding officer assessed his means at £7.05 weekly, derived from the value of board and lodgings in his parents home.  He is accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the weekly rate of £22.90 from 7 June 1985 being the appropriate rate in his case of £29.95 less means of £7.05, increased to £24.70 from 3 July 1985 being the appropriate rate of £31.75 less means of £7.05.  He is a postal applicant for unemployment assistance and an order for encashment at his local post office, in respect of arrears due, amounting to £393.62, was issued to him last week.  The arrears cover the period from 7 June 1985 to 1 October 1985 when he ceased to sign.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned is entitled to a weekly rate of benefit of £97.09 made up of £85 by way of unemployment benefit and £12.09 pay-related benefit.  He signs for benefit five days a week and is accordingly paid at five-sixths of the weekly rate.  The weekly rate of pay-related benefit was calculated by reference to the 85 per cent limit which provides that the sum of unemployment benefit, pay-related benefit and income tax refunds may not exceed 85 per cent of the average net weekly earnings of the claimant since the beginning of the income tax year in which the claim is made.  The position is that the person concerned changed employment in January 1985 to one at a lower rate of earnings. However, as the benefit claim was made in the current tax year, the 85 per cent limit properly fell to be calculated by reference to earnings between April 1985 and the date of the claim for benefit as the limit is designed to limit total benefit entitlement by reference to pre-unemployment earnings.  The fact that benefit did not commence until September means that because there is a limit on the length of the period of entitlement, the person concerned can continue <Col N="1164" /> to receive benefit beyond the point at which it would have been paid had the claim begun earlier in the year.</P>

He is accordingly entitled to unemployment assistance at £84.15 weekly being the appropriate rate of £94.15 less means of £10.

      <P>A claim to dental benefit was received from the person concerned on 8 July 1985.  The treatment involved included the provision of a special bite appliance, a fee for which is not included in the Department's scale of fees.  It was necessary to establish a complete dental treatment history of the claimant and to have the dental chart submitted to the chief dental adviser to determine if a contribution towards this treatment would be appropriate.  The claim has now been approved on this basis and both the dentist and the claimant have been notified.</P>

      <P>A claim for retirement pension in respect of the person concerned was received from the British Department of Health and Social Security on 12 March 1985.  One of the qualifying conditions for receipt of a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts requires him to have a yearly average of at least 24 reckonable contributions over the period from 5 January 1953 to April 1984, i.e. the end of the last complete contribution year before he reached age 65.  He does not satisfy this condition as the Department's records show that he had a total of only 16 Irish contributions in the required period.  This is equal to a yearly average of less than 1.  Neither does he qualify for an old age contributory pension at age 66 for which he needs a yearly average of at least 20 reckonable contributions from 5 January 1953 to 5 April 1985.</P>
      <P>Where a person has been employed in another EC country his insurance in that country may be combined with his Irish record to enable him to qualify for a <i>pro rata</i> pension, calculated on the basis of the number of his Irish contributions in proportion to the combined total in the relevant period.  The person concerned had 1,610 British contributions in addition to his 16 Irish and this entitles him to a <i>pro rata</i> retirement pension at the current rate of £0.85 per week.  He will be transferred to a <i>pro rata</i> old age contributory pension when he reaches age 66 on 22 December 1985 and his weekly rate of that pension will be £1.55 per week. Where the rate of retirement pension payable is less than £1 per week, payment is normally made on a yearly basis.  In this case the first payment of retirement pension will be issued to the person concerned in mid-December 1985.  He is in receipt of a British retirement pension.</P>

      <P>The application for a free telephone rental allowance from the person concerned was approved with effect from 5 August 1983, the date of receipt of her application.  It has since come to light that her sister, with whom she resides, was in receipt of the allowance, until her death in August 1982.  Arrangements have therefore been made with Telecom Éireann to have the allowance backdated in the case of the person concerned to 1 September 1982 and a credit of £108 will appear on her telephone account which will issue in the next three weeks.</P>

      <P>The free telephone rental allowance scheme is intended to benefit those pensioners for whom a telephone is the only means of summoning aid should they require it.  To qualify for the allowance, therefore, a person in receipt of a qualifying payment must be living alone or only with children under 15 years of age or other persons who are so permanently incapacitated as to be unable to summon aid in an emergency.  The person concerned is in receipt of a qualifying payment and is residing with his wife and their nine children, seven of whom are aged 15 years or over.  Neither his wife nor these children are from the information furnished permanently incapacitated as required by the scheme. Accordingly, a free telephone rental allowance cannot be granted in this case.</P>

      <P>The benefits to which the Deputy refers were introduced to provide, subject to the fulfilment of qualifying conditions appropriate to each scheme, additional assistance to persons aged 66 years and over and to persons under that age who are permanently incapacitated. On the death of a qualified pensioner, the surviving widow's entitlement to these benefits is determined under the same conditions as apply to other categories of beneficiaries.  To grant these benefits to widows who do not meet the qualifying conditions in their own right in their circumstances indicated by the Deputy would remove a basic requirement of the scheme (i.e. age or permanent incapacity) and would, therefore, have wide ranging and costly implications. There are no proposals for such a change at this time.</P>

      <P>The person concerned was assessed with means of £28.50 weekly derived from the value of board and lodging on his brother's holding.  He was in receipt of unemployment assistance at £3.25 weekly being the rate which was applied to him, £31.75 less means of £28.50.  However, he should have been paid at £5.30 weekly, being the appropriate higher rate of £33.80 less means of £28.50.  All adjusting arrears due to him will be paid this week.  Following a recent examination of his claim it has come to light that his means were under assessed by £0.40 and his means have been reassessed to £28.90 weekly, effective from 30 October 1985.  He is accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £4.90 weekly being the appropriate rate of £33.80 less means of £28.90.  Payments at this new rate will commence this week and will continue to be made as they become due.

      <P>It is proposed to answer Questions Nos. 167-169, inclusive, together.  The Department of Agriculture has never sent intervention beef to the south of France. However, intervention beef is sold to purchasers who may have customers in any part of the world.  Such beef when sold is made available to the purchaser at the loading bay of the cold store where the beef is stored.  It is then the purchaser's own responsibility to arrange onward transport.</P>

      <P>Representations have been received in respect of this school.  The position is that the staffing of a national school is <Col N="1192" /> regulated by the number of pupils enrolled.  There has been a considerable decline in enrolments at the school in question in recent years resulting in a reduction in the staffing levels.</P>
      <P>In order to retain the current staffing an average enrolment of 465 is required. The average for the September quarter was 439 only.  In the circumstances it would not be open to me to allow any additional teaching assistance, apart from the special class teacher and the remedial teacher which have already been sanctioned, for this school.</P>

I am satisfied that, in general, the accommodation in these schools is of a good standard and cannot justifiably be classed as outmoded or antiquated.  I have no specific plans at present for the provision of any new second level school in Limerick city, but my Department have under examination an application from Limerick City VEC for such a school; this examination is still at a preliminary stage.</P>
      <P>I do not expect that any boys leaving primary school next summer will be unable to go into second level education because of lack of accommodation in second level schools.</P>
