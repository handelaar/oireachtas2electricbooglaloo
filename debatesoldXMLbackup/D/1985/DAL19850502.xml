      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 47:</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 48:</P>
      <P>In page 28, to delete lines 4 to 11 and substitute the following:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(b)  Whenever a casual vacancy occurs among the members of the Board appointed by election, the Board shall co-opt the person who received the next highest number of votes in the previous election for the category in which the casual vacancy occurs.  The person so co-opted shall serve as a member of the Board for such period as is unexpired of the term of office of the person whom he replaces.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is very difficult to get back into the swing of things on this debate because it has been up and down so often in the last year.  It is a number of months since we debated the matter before.  The amendment relates to appointments by election to the board and the position that will occur in the event of a vacancy arising out of a resignation, a death, illness and so on among the membership of the board.  Our proposal is that the person co-opted should not be just anybody but the next in line from the original election. Those next in line should be listed in the order of the number of votes they received and in the event of vacancies occurring the person co-opted should be the next one who received the next highest number of votes.  The term of office of the person co-opted should be the term of office remaining unexpired at the time of the co-option.  I am not certain about the Minister's proposal in regard to filling casual vacancies but by opinion is that the proposal in the amendment is the fairest method for dealing with casual vacancies.  The purpose of the Bill is to give the nurses charge of An Bord Altranais.  They will be elected by members of their own profession, but if casual vacancies meant co-option other than on <Col N="2445" /> the basis of the original election it would be evading the main point of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Bill, in regard to casual vacancies states:</P>
    <P>6. (a)  Whenever a casual vacancy occurs among the members of the Board other than those appointed by election, the Board shall forthwith notify the Minister who, following consultation with such body or organisation as he considers suitable to advise him shall, as soon as is convenient, appoint a person to fill such vacancy.</P>
    <P>In other words, any nurse in any category will be eligible for co-option by the Minister. The Bill also states that any person so co-opted shall serve as a member of the board for the unexpired period of the term of office of the person being replaced.</P>
    <P>It would be worthwhile if the Chair would ask Members at the back for some order.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be simple and straightforward if on the election of the original board a list of those next in line was kept and that the co-options be on the basis of the people the nurses want to be next in line rather than having ministerial co-options.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Basically, I am in sympathy with the views expressed by the Deputy but I have difficulty in going along with the proposed amendment.  It would be expected that the board in the normal course of events would follow the procedure envisaged by the Deputy, that they would co-opt the person who received the next highest number of votes in the previous election for the category in which the casual vacancy occurred. Certainly, it would be fair that they should look at the election results for the category and co-opt a member on that basis.  However, a number of factors <Col N="2446" /> could conspire to make such a procedure unworkable.  For example, if a considerable amount of time had elapsed between the time of the election and the co-option it could happen that the next person in the category might no longer be available.  I have seen that happen.  That is one of the considerable difficulties involved.  It could also happen that the person with the next highest number of votes would no longer be eligible to fill that category vacancy.</P>
      <P>In those circumstances if I were to accept the Deputy's amendment it could happen that the filling of a casual vacancy would not be done in accordance with the provision in the Bill.  That is why I have left the provision open enough to allow the board a direct discretion to either adopt the procedures suggested by the Deputy &mdash; I hope they would adopt them &mdash; or, if they could not do so, to co-opt another eligible and suitable person.  If it is tied down rigidly over a period of five years the board could finish up being minus one member quite rapidly.  This could happen when rigidity of that nature is inserted in the Bill.  That is why I have made that point at this stage.  In these circumstances it would be unwise to accept the amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why is it necessary for the board to consult with the Minister before they would appoint a member to fill a casual vacancy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no hard view on that aspect.  If the Deputy wishes and if it would strengthen the section the provision that it would be necessary for the board to consult with the Minister could be removed on Report Stage.  In the matter of boards co-opting to fill casual vacancies sometimes disputes develop in the boards.  One would ask them to consult with the Minister and he might express a view, and it is only consulting, it is not a mandatory role for the filling of a casual vacancy.  I have no hard view on it and if the Deputies feel that the section could be strengthened by the deletion of the consultation I would be easy on it.  On the other hand, sometimes <Col N="2447" /> in boards all hell breaks loose on the co-option and they may refer to the Minister for his view on the matter of whether a person is eligible or what exactly occurred in terms of the election.  He might express a view but it is no more than consultation. They still have the power to make the co-option.  I take the steps necessary to secure the appointment of members of the first board.  Section 10 provides that:</P>
      <P>...the board shall take all steps necessary to secure the appointment of members to any subsequent Board.</P>
      <P>Therefore, the board themselves could decide in accordance with section 10 of the Bill on a co-option procedure.  Presumably it could be open to them to decide what procedure they might follow for the filling of casual vacancies.  In that framework they might decide as a matter of principle to co-opt the next person under that election in accordance with section 10 and they might consult the Minister of the day about that procedure, saying as a general principle that they will follow that line.  The flexibility is there. I, and I am sure subsequent Ministers, would follow that in relation to, for example, casual vacancies in the health boards. I have rigorously followed the principle of appointing the next elected person in those categories and appointed him straightforwardly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>We are on the final schedule on Committee Stage and I do not want to hold up the Bill any further. I accept the points made by the Minister in regard to the possibility of the next in line not being eligible or available, but I would like to see some guidelines given to the board to adhere to this principle that in co-options they should first go to the next highest on the list.  If the Minister accepts that principle on the health boards it would be worth while, if it is not necessarily in the legislation, at least to have some guidelines for the board indicating that this principle would be the best to adhere to.  It would prevent the usual controversy that might arise within the nursing profession about a co-option <Col N="2448" /> when somebody might allege that it was for such-and-such a reason.  I would be happy if something on that line could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the point of consultation with the Minister, while I have no strong views one way or another on it, it is hardly necessary to have it in the Bill because when it is in the Bill it puts an obligation on the board to consult with the Minister and the board might have a very definite and a very good view.  The consultation with the Minister might cause the confusion that the Minister referred to earlier.  I am sure the board would consult with the Minister of the day if they were in difficulty and felt that he could help them in any way.  On the question of casual vacancies amongst the Minister's nominees the section states that the Minister would take advice from various organisations.  Is the Minister obliged to follow that advice?</P>

      <P>On the last occasion Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn addressed a question to the Minister as to why it was necessary to have the consent of the Minister for Health and the Minister for the Public Service in order to pay an officer or servant of the council.  This has not appeared in other legislation and I was wondering if since we debated this last the Minister has found any answer to that question.</P>

      <P>As to why it was necessary to have the consent of the Minister for the Public Service as well as the Minister for Health in order that an officer or a servant of the council shall be paid out of funds at the disposal of the council. The approval for such an allowance must be the approval of the Minister for Health and also of the Minister for the Public Service.  Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn asked the Minister why it was necessary to have the approval of the Minister for the Public Service as well, because this does not appear in other legislation of a similar nature.</P>

      <P>In the case of the Dentists Bill the Government decided that there should be provision for joint ministerial control of staff and pay conditions. I said that on the last day when we were dealing with section 17.  This decision was taken subsequent to consideration of the Nurses Bill, and it is the intention to continue to apply the principle of joint ministerial control of pay and conditions in future legislation of this type in the interests of control over the uniformity of such conditions for comparable types of posts throughout the public service generally.</P>

      <Col N="2450" /> SECTION 18.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a relatively small point and I do not think in the whole Dentists Bill the Minister has conceded anything whatever on any issue.  I hope he will concede this.  Section 18 states:</P>
      <P>A person who is a permanent officer of the Council shall cease to be a permanent officer on his attaining the age of 65 years or, in a case where a higher age is fixed by order of the Minister made under this section, on his attaining that age.</P>
      <P>I understand from this that the Minister's intention is that only males will be permanent officers of the council.  I ask the Minister to alter this Bill to ensure that it is open to females also.</P>
      <P>This section is confined to male members. Maybe the permanent officer who is female can continue until any age she wishes, but only males are covered by this section on attaining the age of 65 years. What is the Minister's intention in this regard?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The word &ldquo;his&rdquo; does not apply to females and no lawyer would attempt to argue the point that &ldquo;his&rdquo; covers &ldquo;her&rdquo;, because it does not. If one reads the section there is no need for the words &ldquo;his&rdquo; or &ldquo;her&rdquo;.  I suggest that &ldquo;his&rdquo;, which occurs twice, be withdrawn and the section will read &ldquo;a permanent officer on attaining the age of 65 years or, in the case where a higher age is fixed by order of the Minister made under this section, on attaining that age&rdquo;. If the Minister consults the draftsman he will see there is no need for the words &ldquo;his&rdquo; or &ldquo;her&rdquo;.  I ask the Minister to delete those words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed by the <Col N="2451" /> experts that when the word &ldquo;his&rdquo; is used in legislation like this it covers &ldquo;his&rdquo; or &ldquo;her&rdquo;.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Thomás Mac Giolla Thomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Thomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>The experts may have informed the Minister of that but if the Minister with responsibility for Women's Affairs hears of this the experts will have to very quickly change their minds, and I would be surprised if she adopted any other attitude.  If the experts adopt the attitude that women do not exist, that is out of date and from now on our legislation must alter that attitude and tell the experts that &ldquo;his&rdquo; is not the same as &ldquo;her&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Social Welfare does not regard &ldquo;his&rdquo; the same as &ldquo;her&rdquo; attaining the age of 65 years or 60 years because the pension rights are granted at different ages.  Most legislation, particularly in the social welfare area, has different limits and ages.  When you come to the age of 65 years it could be argued that in the case of &ldquo;her&rdquo; attaining that age it must be different, because in all other areas the female age limit is lower than the male age limit.  It would be much clearer in this legislation, and also from the women's point of view, if the Minister put in &ldquo;his or her&rdquo; or deleted &ldquo;his&rdquo; altogether.  Perhaps the Minister would explain the need for keeping that word in the legislation when there is no need for it.  Why is this word necessary?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already explained why it is inserted.  When &ldquo;his&rdquo; is in this type of legislation it covers both male and female.  We could talk about this for some time saying that this Government do not recognise women. However, this Government have done more to recognise the rights of women than any other Government.  I remember hearing an expression, &ldquo;What's hers is mine and what's mine is my own.&rdquo;  That is a rather greedy attitude.</P>

There is a case before the courts at this time trying to get equality for women under social welfare legislation which should have been introduced last December.</P>

      <P>Section 25 (f) states: &ldquo;the giving to any person of a certificate of registration, and&rdquo;.  The council may charge for that.  I do not understand why that is inserted in the section.  Presumably the dentist who is registered will receive a certificate when he or she pays the registration fee.  To whom might a certificate of registration be given other than to a dentist?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>

      <P>(a)  the registration of a person in any register maintained by the Council,</P>
      <P>That is fair enough, but it appears that there is a second fee for the giving to any person of a certificate of registration. That is wrong.  If a person applies to be placed on the register of dentists and if that person is fully qualified, presumably he or she will pay a fee and should be entitled to a certificate at that time without being obliged to pay another fee for a certificate.</P>

      <P>That is not what the section states.  The section states that the council has the power to charge a fee for registration and power to charge a fee for giving a certificate.  That is two fees. Surely when a dentist registers on the dental register he or she is entitled to a receipt, if nothing else, to say he or she is registered and should not have to pay a second fee for a certificate of registration.</P>

      <P>Any fees being charged by the Dental Council are subject to the approval of the National Prices Commission and the Minister may have a role to play in that as well.  We anticipate that the council will not charge fees which will be exorbitant.  I will give the Deputy the fees charged by the Dental Board at present.  The original registration fee is £22.50.  Retention of a person on the register is £30.  For restoration of a person removed for non-payment of a retention fee and restored under section 24 (2) of the Dental Act, 1928, the fee is £60.</P>

Now he says there are a number of fees. Was he suggesting that the registration and retention fee should be a single fee or will there be an annual retention fee as well?  If so, is it the intention to have any control over that?</P>

      <P>It enables the new council to introduce registration of dental specialists subject to the consent of the Minister.  This would be a higher register than the basic register which covers all dentists.  Dental specialities are rapidly developing and gaining acceptance within the dental profession and it is desirable that the council should have powers to register appropriately qualified persons in well established areas such as orthondontics and oral surgery.  Such registration would be indicative of special qualifications and it would be of interest to the general public.  It already exists in France, West Germany and Holland. There are also registers of dental specialists in the USA and Canada.</P>

We should be given some idea as to why it is necessary in this section to have the Minister's consent.  Much time was spent in the Seanad and in this House discussing the composition of the Dental Council. Surely we should have confidence in the council to decide what specialities should be included in the specialist register.  My concern is that a Minister could veto the decision of the council.

      <P>The Minister must be consulted.  In fact, he must give his consent to the determination of the particular speciality that will be registered in the specialist register.  Our contention is that that is not necessary.  On Deputy Owen's point, there is nothing in the section which gives the Minister power to direct the council to register any speciality. There is provision that if the council want to withdraw recognition from a speciality, they have to have the consent of the Minister.  I do not understand why it is necessary to give the Minister this power of veto over who shall be registered in this specialist register.  I believe and the Dental Council believe that orthodontists or oral surgeons should be registered. They should have the power to set up a specialist register.  I do not understand why the Minister's consent is necessary.</P>

The committee <Col N="2468" /> is empowered to summon witnesses to attend in the same manner as if it were the High Court.  The person who is the subject of the inquiry and his representative, if any, shall be given the opportunity of being present at the hearing.  These latter provisions are already contained in the 1928 Act.  The committee present their report to the council.  The power to act in the case of a dentist who is considered unfit to practise for reasons of ill-health follows a similar provision in the Medical Practitioners Act which was recommended by representatives of the medical organisations who reported to the Minister in December 1975.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to ask two questions on section 38.  Where a member of the council and in particular where a member of the public requests the Fitness to Practise Committee to inquire into the fitness of a dentist, the council can overrule the Fitness to Practise Committee.  Is that correct?  Am I interpreting that correctly? If the Fitness to Practise Committee decide not to hold an inquiry the council can overrule them or, <i>vice versa,</i> if the Fitness to Practise Committee decide to hold an inquiry the council can overrule that decision also.  The section says that <Col N="2470" /> where an application is made and the Fitness to Practise Committee, after consideration of the application, is of the opinion that there is not sufficient cause to hold an inquiry, it shall so inform the council and the council may decide that no further action shall be taken, or direct the committee to hold an inquiry.  I wonder if the reverse is also true.  If the Fitness to Practise Committee decided to hold an inquiry could the council overrule it?  Is there any further recourse for a member of the public who is unhappy about the fact that the council will not allow an inquiry?  Can that person go to the court?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>Subsection (1) enables the council to hold an inquiry into the fitness of a registered dentist to practise by reason of his or her ill-health or alleged professional misconduct.  Subsection (2) enables the Fitness to Practise Committee to decide whether there is sufficient cause for holding an inquiry and advise the council accordingly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>But the point is, can the council overrule in any case they wish, and does the person have any further recourse to demand an inquiry into somebody's professional competence?  Does the person have to like it or lump it if the committee decide there are not sufficient grounds?  Can he not take the matter to the court?</P>

      <P>Section 38 (9) states;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Fitness to Practise Committee requires the dental records of a patient of any registered dentist to be produced for the purpose of any inquiry conducted by that Committee, such records shall not be made available to the Fitness to Practise Committee without the consent of the patient concerned, <Col N="2471" /> unless that Committee specifically directs the registered dentist concerned to produce such records.</P>
    <P>Does that latter phrase waive the right of the patient concerned?  It appears to be a contradictory statement.  Perhaps I am not interpreting it correctly.  If the dental records are required, the permission of the patient must be given and if they direct that these be supplied they do not have to go near the patient.  Is that what this section means?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>This prevents the production of a patient's dental record without his consent except where the committee specifically direct the production of such record.

      <P>To get back to my initial point on section 38 (1), (a) and (b), there is a whale of a difference between one being declared unfit to practise by virtue of being involved in professional misconduct, for instance being a drug addict, and one who has been involved in a road traffic accident and has lost his right hand. As things stand, both these people will be declared unfit to practise.  This is unjust. Some provision must be made to differentiate between the two cases.</P>

      <P>I would agree with my colleague, Deputy Ormonde.  Professional misconduct in one thing and certainly we would all agree that the Fitness to Practise Committee should operate with all the power and force available to them to ensure that anybody guilty of professional misconduct would be declared unfit to practise.  We all agree that that should be well provided for in this legislation.  The point Deputy Ormonde is making is that it appears a little harsh that somebody who through no fault of his or her own, through physical illness or mental disability should be put before the Fitness to Practise Committee in the same way as somebody guilty of professional misconduct.  Would the Minister look into this matter?  When we were discussing the Nurses Bill there was great concern about this.  In the United Kingdom there is a different procedure altogether for dealing with nurses who are unfit to work because of a physical or mental disability.  These cases are dealt with with a lot more privacy and sympathy than going before what, effectively is a court of law.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The person who suffers a physical disability during the course of his life would not be suitable to practise and the council would not approve them as suitable to practise dentistry.  Anyone with such disability would not try to get into the profession.  It is basically for the council to determine these cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>That would only arise in the event of an individual wanting to continue to practise dentistry with one of the disabilities which have been referred to.  If the individual stopped practising, the question would not arise.  The natural thing to do would be not to continue to practise dentistry.  The safeguard is there. It is up to the Fitness to Practise Committee to judge an individual who may want to continue to practise in his profession but perhaps in the Deputy's, or my view, or the view of the general public, is not fit to do so.  That is the only reason for that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>It is up to the council or a person to make a complaint about a dentist before the dentist comes before the Fitness to Practise Committee.  Do the committee have the discretion, like the Planning Appeals Board, to decide that the complaint is a spurious one, not properly brought before that committee?  If somebody decided that he did not like the way the dentist carried on, not paying his taxes for instance, he might decide to get at the dentist by reporting him to the Fitness to Practise Committee.  Would that be dealt with under subsection (2), where the committee would say there was not sufficient cause to warrant the holding of an inquiry?</P>

      <P>I really wanted to know if the Minister could give us an idea of what is meant by &ldquo;unduly&rdquo;.  Does he mean three months, six months or a year?  If a dentist was found guilty of professional misconduct but was away from the country at the time and if he returned a year later and decided he wanted to clear his name, would that be considered an undue delay?</P>

      <P>Basically that would be up to the council.  If a decision is given by the council against an individual that person has the right to appeal to the court within 21 days.  If the person does not do that, the council can proceed to the court to get their decision confirmed by the court.  There is no timescale put on that, but I presume that within a matter of a few months the council would proceed to the courts to get their decision confirmed.</P>

      <P>Section 39 (1) (b) sets out that where a registered dentist has failed to pay his retention fee within two months his name will be erased from the register.  Will the Minister not agree this is a very short period?  Having regard to extended holidays and leave of absence, a two-month period away from one's home is not unusual.  When that person comes back he may find his name has been erased from the register.  Is a prepaid letter a registered letter?  Surely it is just an ordinary stamped letter.</P>

For example, if a dentist went to work in the Third World for a year he would not want his name fo be removed from the register in his absence.  The point was raised on the Nurses Bill and debated with the Minister.  The Minister recognised that probably the period was too short and said he would come back to it on Report Stage.</P>

      <P>I would ask the Minister of State to consider what the Minister himself has already agreed, that is, to look at this before Report Stage, because it is of fundamental importance.  We are talking about the right of a dental surgeon to practise, to pursue his or her career. A dental surgeon might well go off to work, say, in the Third World or, as Deputy Ormonde said, might go on an extended holiday, returning after two months to find that his right to pursue his career had been taken from him.  I believe the period is too short and I see no merit in having that short a period.  Six months would be equally effective and would mean that within the year he was due to pay his retention fee he would lose his right to practise.  We must be careful to ensure that we do not take away the right to practise from a dentist for failure to pay his fee, particularly if it is not through any fault of his that he happened to be out of the country for an extended period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole section hinges on a person's right to appeal a decision. If in the first place he did not receive notice that his name is to be removed from the register then he cannot take the successive steps thereafter.  By virtue of the fact that he has not received the letter notifying him that his name has been taken off the register, he cannot appeal within the 21 days.  The whole matter hinges on the fact that the people to whom such letters are sent actually receive them.  I am satisfied if the Minister can assure us that the council <Col N="2482" /> will be able to guarantee that the message gets to the dentist in question.  I would not agree with the usage of the words &ldquo;prepaid post&rdquo;.  In a number of other Bills there is reference to registered post which means that somebody must sign for such a registered letter, when one would know that it was received by the person or a member of his or her family. If the Minister can tighten up on this provision of prepaid post that would ensure that at a later stage somebody who had been out of the country for a year would not have a claim that he was unaware his name had been removed from the register.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>If a letter was registered it would be returned if somebody had not signed for it.  But if it is prepaid, or any other type of post, all one can do is send it to last known address.  Basically the council are not under an obligation to trace the whereabouts of dentists who have gone here, there, or elsewhere. What can they do but send the letter to the last known address and, if there is nobody at that address, then it is not the duty of the council.  The onus should rest more on the dentist himself to let the council know of his whereabouts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not disagree with what the Minister says.  All I am concerned about is the time given to the dentist in order to fulfil his obligation to pay his retention fee.  I believe two months is too short a period in certain cases where a dentist might be out of the country, when he might be working somewhere for a year or be on an extended holiday, or for some other reason might be unable to receive that letter.  I do not think it is the duty of the Dental Council to find out where he is. It is up to him to notify them of his change of address.  But if they do write to his home address, say, in this State and he happens to be working in, say, the Third World, he should be given sufficient time to receive that correspondence and deal with it.  In those circumstances I believe two months is too short and it should be extended.  I do not think the Dental <Col N="2483" /> Council or the Bill would lose anything by having that period amended to, say, six months.</P>

      <P>In order to speed up proceedings would the Minister consult the Irish Dental Association and the Dental Board before Report Stage and establish whether they are satisfied that two months is a sufficient period of time? If they are satisfied we will be satisfied. The Minister has laid much emphasis on the fact that he believes that it is their wish that it should be two months.  I would respect their wish, but I still believe two months is much too short.  As the Minister himself says, it is a small number of persons only involved, which is all the more reason we should cater for that small number by extending it to six months.  I do not think it will make any difference to the income of the Dental Council or lead to more people failing to pay their fee.  I would ask the Minister to consult with them because he has laid much emphasis on his belief that this is what the Dental Board and the Irish Dental Association want.  They seem to be generally satisfied.  Because we have a relatively small number of dentists they would be well aware of what is in this legislation.  Nobody will acquaint themselves with the contents of this Bill faster <Col N="2484" /> than the members of the dental profession.</P>

The most outstanding example I can give the House is the case of an individual who, in the course <Col N="2488" /> of his work or following an accident suffered a physical disability which in the view of members of his own profession would prevent him practising dentistry in a manner they considered appropriate. Naturally enough, that individual may be considered suitable for lecturing or other purposes but would not be suitable for practising dentistry.  Any decision in relation to conditions laid down in regard to a dentist may be appealed.  If an individual is not satisfied with a decision of the council he or she may appeal to the court and, in the event of the individual failing to appeal to the court, the council goes to the court to have its decision confirmed.</P>

      <P>The section empowers the council to advise, admonish or censure a person who has been the subject of report by the Fitness to Practise Committe. I presume the words mean that the council will talk to the individual concerned. The words used are a matter for the committee and the individual involved. Is the Deputy asking me if the individual will be asked to hold out his hand for the administering of some type of punishment?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I was interested in the words advise, admonish or censure and I wondered how much they meant.  Do they simply mean a dressing down of the dentist, saying to him or her that having been found guilty of some professional <Col N="2489" /> misconduct he or she would be admonished? Will the Minister explain the reason for section 2, which seems to give the council power to do away with the recommendation of the Fitness to Practise Committee that a dentist should be censured by the removal of his or her name from the register?  Does the section under discussion mean that the council can substitute such a strong censure by a dressing down, an admonishment or advice to the dentist?  Obviously, it gives the council an overriding power even if it receives a strong report from the Fitness to Practise Committee.  Is that a correct interpretation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very hard to put into words what is meant by admonishing or censuring a person.  We must remember that it will be a question of one crowd of dentists judging another member of the profession.  The powers are additional to those that the dental board have under existing legislation.  At present the dental board is only empowered to erase a dentist's name from the register.  That has the effect of debarring a dentist from engaging in the practise of his profession. That rather drastic measure is in itself inadequate in dealing with minor transgressions, and hence the need to introduce a range of lesser penalties than removing from the register the name of the dentist.</P>

      <P>On section 38 the Minister told us that the council was obliged to refer cases, where the Fitness to Practise Committee had found somebody guilty of an offence and imposed a penalty, to the High Court for confirmation. Section 42 deals with this problem.  It appears under subsection (4) that the council has the power to apply if they so wish, if the dentist does not use his or <Col N="2490" /> her right of appeal within 21 days, for confirmation of the decision.  There does not appear to be any obligation on them, as the Minister told us earlier in the debate on section 38.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>The section basically provides that the council may decide to erase from the register the name of a dentist who has been convicted of an indictable offence.  The person concerned must be notified of the decision and he or she may appeal within 21 days to the High Court.  If the dentist does not appeal, or delays in proceeding with the appeal, the council may apply to the court to have its decision confirmed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>That is my point. Earlier the Minister told us that the council was obliged to have the decision confirmed by the High Court.  We were referring specifically to the power of the Fitness to Practise Committee to try somebody and, on summary conviction, to fine that person £1,000.  We were told that that decision would have to be confirmed by the High Court, but it appears from this section that the council has the discretion of whether to apply or not to the High Court to have the decision confirmed.</P>

      <P>In the case of action in respect of conviction for a crime it is not considered necessary that a hearing by the Fitness to Practise Committee should be held to establish the facts of the case, since the person has already been convicted by the courts.  The council has to satisfy itself that the seriousness of the crime is sufficient to warrant erasure or the imposition of a lesser penalty.  The council's decision is also subject to review by the High Court.</P>

If the High Court rules that the decision of the council that the person's name be erased stands, subsection (7) seems to give the council power, without having to go back to the court, to restore the name to the register.  Is that a correct interpretation: that the name of the person which has been erased under this section may be restored to the register without any action back to the court?</P>

Does this Bill provide anywhere a safeguard to ensure that a member of the public who is paying for private dental treatment will be appraised of the fact that somebody is no longer competent to practise as a dentist?  Is there any obligation on the Minister to put a notice in the newspapers after being notified of this? Such a safeguard may be somewhere else in the Bill.

      <P>There is no question of putting into the newspapers a notice to the effect that a person has been knocked off the register, but his name would be erased from the register of the Dental Council.  Also under this legislation it would be necessary for the dentist to show the relevant certificate and have it on display at his place of work.  If a dentist was found guilty of misconduct and his name taken off the register, he would not be allowed to display his certificate of competence and so forth, but in the event of his displaying the certificate action can be taken against him by the Dental Council.</P>

      <P>We are talking about a very small number of people in a country where seemingly more than in any other country everybody knows what the other fellow is doing or at least makes an attempt to know.  If a dentist's name was erased from the register that would become generally known.  If he appealed to the High Court against the decision a great deal of publicity would emanate from that and as a result it would be common knowledge that this individual was found guilty of an offence and that he was no longer allowed to practice dentistry. There is no problem in relation to letting the public know that an individual in the opinion of the Dental Council is not entitled to practise.  News travels fast in this country and people tend to talk about such things.  I am sure there will be no problems.</P>

      <P>Surely the Minister is not suggesting that people might be fortunate to hear about it from their next door neighbour.  That is not what Bills in this House should be about.  By virtue of the fact that the Minister has said that we are dealing with a very small number of people, why is he not prepared to notify those other than the Minister?  Surely it is important that the employer concerned should be notified that their employee has been erased from the register.</P>
      <P>I accept that the Minister is doing a good job in piloting this Bill through the House, but on a couple of issues he is being too rigid.  He should be prepared to give in and this is one area in which he could give in.  I do not see any problem in the Minister taking another look at this and saying that as well as the Minister, the CEO of the health board, the employing authority, the CEO of the dental hospital or the boss of a dental practice, should be notified.  There are only a small group involved so it should not be difficult to tell more than the Minister what is going on.</P>

      <P>My view is that we should write into all legislation of this nature that the employer or the employing authority would be notified where a professional person is removed from the register and the right to practise is taken from him.  That should be fundamental in legislation of this type.  We had an amendment down on the Nurses Bill and I quote from the Official Report, 6 March <Col N="2497" /> 1985, column 1730, where the Minister for Health said:</P>
      <P>I will prepare an amendment for Report Stage whereby the employing authority will be notified in the event of there being an employer in existence. We can get agreement on a drafting formula.</P>
      <P>The Minister recognised the same problem which the Minister of State recognised this morning but the only difference was that the Minister was prepared to do something about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I recognise that there would not always be an employing authority in existence, but the Minister told us that where there was an employer in existence he would prepare an amendment for Report Stage to ensure that the employer would be notified.  I believe this is in the public interest because we wish to protect the public in this legislation. Therefore, it would be very important that an employer be notified that a dentist's name had been removed from the register.  It would be very serious if the Minister was notified of this but through an error did not notify the health board and they continued to allow the dentist to practise.  It is in the interest of the public, the dental profession and the Minister that an amendment be prepared to ensure that an employer, where there is one, would be notified of the decision to remove the name of a dentist from the register.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the concern expressed by Deputy O'Hanlon and Deputy Ormonde but I do not think their suggested amendment would solve my problem. As a private individual I am an employer of a dentist.  How do I know if I should continue to send my children to a certain dentist for treatment?  Section 51 says it is an offence to continue to practise, but there is nothing in the Bill which will enable an individual to ensure that such a dentist will not continue to practise.  I <Col N="2498" /> accept what the Minister said about the publicity attaching to a High Court case where a dentist has been struck off for professional misconduct because that would be big news, but if somebody is struck off because he has not paid his retention fee, that will not get into the papers.  If I go to such a dentist for treatment and if I have a complaint to make the council will say there is nothing they can do because that dentist was not registered and I should not have gone to him for treatment.  There is a gap here and there should be some way for the public to know when a dentist has been struck off the register.  When I look into a dentist's eyes I will not know if he is registered, he may still have his registration form hanging in his surgery.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of notification of the erasure of a dentist's name from the register to the dentist's employer as well as to the Minister, this is unnecessary and would not be practicable in many instances.  The Dental Council would not have up-to-the-minute information on the employment of all dentists on the register, and dentists tend to move around a bit, particularly in the early part of their careers.  The erasure of a dentist's name from the register in a country such as ours would scarcely go unnoticed by those connected with the profession.</P>
      <P>Does Deputy Owen expect the Minister or the Dental Council to write to everybody on the register of electors?  Most of these cases would get a certain amount of publicity because the case would be brought to court.  Does the Deputy expect the Minister to write to everybody on the register saying that a certain dentist is not entitled to practise dentistry because of such and such?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course I do not expect the Minister to write to everybody on the register of electors but would it not be realistic to expect the council to implement some service whereby they would attend at the dental practice and perhaps post a notice to the effect that the dentist <Col N="2499" /> is no longer a registered dentist.  It may be up to the council to make that kind of rule, and if it is I am satisfied that the council have the freedom to do that.  I do not expect any Minister to write to 65,000 people on a register who might be attending a dentist in a particular area, but there should be an onus in this legislation to ensure that the information is transmitted to the people who will continue to attend a dentist who is struck off the register. The only valid way is perhaps by displaying a notice at the surgery.</P>

      <P>The most dangerous part of this Bill is Part VI.  Most people assumed when this Bill was first mooted that its purpose was radically to alter the 1928 Act and to end the dentists' monopoly on the profession of dentistry, including denturists, dental technicians and auxiliary workers of all kinds.  This was recommended by the Restrictive Practices Commission in 1982 when they held a sworn public inquiry into the dentist's monopoly and issued a report.  Part VI of the Bill includes sections 49 to 52.</P>

I understood that the Bill was to end most of these restrictions but Part VI reinforces everything and contravenes the recommendations of the Restrictive <Col N="2500" /> Practices Commission.

      <P>Subsection (1) of section 49 provides that a registered dentist may use the titles &ldquo;dentist&rdquo;, &ldquo;dental surgeon&rdquo; or &ldquo;dental practitioner&rdquo;.  While there is no legislative basis or special status for the title &ldquo;dental surgeon&rdquo; under the Dentists Act, 1928, it is in common use.  Subsection (2) contains provisions which are found in the Dentists Act, 1928, which require a dentist to use the name by which he is registered and preventing the use of titles or descriptions which would suggest that he is more highly qualified than he is.  It is particularly relevant with the proposed establishment of a register for dental specialists.  Subsection (3) provides that a person who contravenes subsection (2) shall be guilty of an offence.  Subsection (4) provides that the council may specify that those qualified in a particular dental speciality may use a particular title to <Col N="2501" /> indicate their higher qualifications.

      <P>It is very vague.  If a person uses a title such as &ldquo;denturist&rdquo; it could be taken as implying that the person is a registered dentist.

He could put &ldquo;denturist&rdquo; or something other than the title of dentist which would imply that he is a registered dentist.

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 4:</P>
      <P>In page 28, subsection (2), between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(e)  a recognised dental technician (who can satisfy the Department of Health that he has been providing dentures direct to the public for at least five years) from providing dentures to a person of 18 years or over, and which provision does not involve any treatment of work being done on living tissues, from the operative date of this Act.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 51 refers to the practice of dentistry. In an earlier section the practice of dentistry is defined as &ldquo;the performance of any operation and the giving of any treatment, advice, opinion or attendance which is usually performed or given by a dentist and includes the performance of any operation or the giving of any treatment, advice or attendance on or to any <Col N="2504" /> person preparatory to, for the purpose of, or in connection with, the fitting, insertion or fixing of artificial teeth&rdquo;. That is the definition of the practice of dentistry and that is where the problems arise.  Under this section, dentists have monopolised everything.  It was said in earlier sections that members of the dental profession are people of high standing and that we expect and generally get good standards from them.</P>
    <P>I know two or three dentists and I have the highest regard for them &mdash; I certainly have the highest regard for my own dentist &mdash; but that does not mean that dentists are better than any other profession, trade or group.  However, that is not the point.  The point is that they are the only profession who are given the total monopoly over everything to do with the mouth, whereas opticians are selling glasses all over town for a much more sensitive instrument &mdash; the eye.  They are not qualified ophthalmic surgeons and they have not monopolised the sale of glasses and frames in the way that dentists monopolise the sale of artificial teeth. There are bonesetters in the medical profession who are entitled to practise without being liable to a fine of £1,000 and 12 months in jail.  They are not regarded as criminals.  People fit artificial limbs and doctors do not monopolise this trade to try to make a profit out of the sale, manufacture or fitting of artificial limbs.  The mind can be affected by people who practise hypnotism but they are not liable to a fine of £1,000 or 12 months in jail for fiddling about with a person's mind.</P>
    <P>This is one area where a monopoly is held despite the very specific recommendations after the sworn public inquiry by the Restrictive Practices Commission that non-dentists should be allowed to supply dentures to persons over 18 years of age so long as such provision did not involve work being done on living tissue. That is the only specific recommendation the commission made.  Dental technicians are not just people who start to mess around with a person's mouth.  A dental technician has a five year apprenticeship before qualifying.  They are <Col N="2505" /> people of the highest skill and are very capable.  They do the work of dentists in any case.  They make teeth for the dentists.  The dentists put them in a person's mouth and charge double the price. Dental technicians supply artificial teeth at half the price a dentist charges.  In the sworn public inquiry the dental profession admitted that 51 per cent of artificial teeth were sold directly to the public.</P>
    <P>We are here to defend the interests of the public but we are not protecting their interests in this section, rather we are protecting profit for the dentists.  If the section is passed in its present form it will be in total opposition to the recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission.</P>
    <P>There are portions of the Bill which could be considered unconstitutional. Dental prosthesists, denturists, call them what you will, are highly skilled and highly qualified people.  They operate publicly and openly, some with their name plates over their door.  Now they are being denied their livelihood after serving five years in an apprenticeship. Now they are being told they are criminals and can be fined £1,000 or be sentensed to 12 months in prison if they fit a denture.  This is extraordinary, and this section illustrates just how extraordinary it is.  It does not deal with the major problems that have arisen as a result of the 1928 Act not only for dental technicians but also for dental nurses, who are also tied in under the Dental Council. The Dental Council has total control of dental technicians, denturists, dental prosthesists, dental therapists, dental hygienists and everyone in the dental profession. It is as if the Medical Council had total control over all nurses.  Paramedics are not regarded as paramedics at all but rather as clerks or receptionists and are paid accordingly.</P>
    <P>I oppose this section.  We wish to delete from our amendment the words &ldquo;prior to the date of the passing of this Act&rdquo; so that the amendment is now to insert in subsection (2) a paragraph (e) which reads:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2506" /> a recognised dental technician (who can satisfy the Department of Health that he has been providing dentures direct to the public for at least five years) from providing dentures to a person of 18 years or over, and which provision does not involve any treatment or work being done on living tissues, from the operative date of this Act.</P>
    <P>The intention is to insert the recommendation made by the Restrictive Practices Commission in 1982.  If our amendment is accepted or if a similar amendment is put forward by the Minister it could get over the enormous difficulties which will arise after the passing of the Bill if it is passed in its present form.  I do not understand how the Minister could accept a Bill drafted in this form knowing the very specific recommendation made by the Restrictive Practices Commission. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment in the light of the inquiry which has been held and in the light of the large number of people whose jobs will be at risk and who, instead of being allowed to practise their profession, will be regarded as illegal operators.  Those are the words the Minister used when he spoke about them.</P>

      <P>With regard to the amendment I know that Deputy Mac Giolla has received the same kind of representations as I have.  The whole area of ancillary activity to the dental profession could be dealt with by this amendment, but <Col N="2507" /> perhaps the work these people do could be dealt with under a separate Bill.  If the Minister does not accept this amendment I urge him to ensure that in the appointment to the Dental Council there is a voice to represent this element of the dental profession.  I do not know whether the Minister will accept the amendment, but if he does not he should take the sentiment of it into consideration and ensure that there is someone to speak for these people on the Dental Council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is provision in the Bill for the establishment by the Dental Council of a class of auxiliary dental workers who will be fully trained and competent to supply dentures direct to persons of 18 years of age and over.  It will be a matter for the Dental Council to decide on the training and qualifications for the grade of denturist, but any scheme put forward by the council must be approved by the Minister.  The Minister has power to direct the council to establish a particular class of auxiliary dental workers, and he can refuse to approve of any scheme put forward by the council which he regards as containing unreasonable provisions.  The provisions in the Bill are regarded as adequate to ensure that a grade of denturist will be established by the Dental Council.</P>
      <P>The amendemnt put forward by Deputy Mac Giolla and Deputy De Rossa would give recognition as denturists to those dental technicians who have been illegally providing dentures direct to the public for more than five years without those technicians having to undergo any special courses of education or training.  Dental technicians do not undergo any clinical training at present, and it is certain that some element of clinical training will be required for persons wishing to become denturists.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission, in the report on their inquiry in 1982 into the restrictions on the supply of dentures to the public, said that having regard to the dangers to the public which could result from the supply of dentures to the public by people not fully trained for the <Col N="2508" /> purpose, they could not recommend that any short cut to recognition should be adopted or that this trade should be facilitated in any way.  They also said that the supply of dentures to the public by unqualified persons must be vigorously discouraged.</P>
    <P>In the course of the Restrictive Practices Commission's inquiry, the Irish Association for Dental Prosthesis, which represents those technicians who wish to supply dentures direct to the public, offered in evidence an estimate of 15 dental technicians throughout the country who were solely or mainly engaged in dealing direct with the public.  The remainder of the 200 or so dental technicians work in dental laboratories and hospitals, or work independently for dentists in private practice.  It is considered that it would be totally inappropriate that those technicians who have been acting illegally should be given preferential treatment in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The decision to introduce fully trained denturists rather than to provide a free for all in relation to the supply of dentures, as would have been the case if the majority recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission was adopted, was taken by the Government following long and detailed consideration of the position.  The Minister is not prepared to make any amendment to the Bill which would permit unqualified persons to supply dentures direct to the public.  It is possible that the Dental Council may make some concessions to those who have already attained a degree of proficiency in the trade when drawing up the educational and training requirements for denturists.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the reasoning behind Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.  As the Minister pointed out, there are 15 dental mechanics who are solely or mainly engaged in dealing with the public and providing dentures direct to them.  That was in the Report of the Restrictive Practices Commission after their inquiry into the statutory restrictions on the provision of dental <Col N="2509" /> prosthesis in 1982 at page 21.  The Irish Association for Dental Prosthesis offered that number themselves.  Having spoken this morning about people's right to earn their livelihood, it is appropriate that we should be concerned about people who make their livelihood in this manner. They make their livelihood illegally as the law stands at present and naturally we cannot condone anybody working outside the law.  These people have provided a service over the years and, in that context, I understand Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.</P>
      <P>We must ensure that we maintain a very high level of dental care.  Section 53 gives power to the Dental Council to establish a scheme for denturists and dental craftsmen.  That caters adequately for any situation which may arise.  Dentists undergo very special training in the care of the mouth, the gums, and so on. It is important that we should maintain a very high standard of dental care.  Section 53 which gives the council the power to set up a scheme also gives the Minister power to direct the council to set up such a scheme.  That caters adequately for the problem.  If such a scheme is set up it should be controlled and monitored by the Dental Council.  They would be the appropriate people to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>The obvious weakness of the amendment which, I assume, is guided by the concern for people who had been practising in this business for some years is that it does not ensure that people engaged in this form of dental craftsmanship would be competent or trained.  Minimum standards of ability, competence and training must apply in this area.  As Deputy O'Hanlon said, there is provision in section 53 for the introduction of such a training scheme to which, I presume, access would be readily available for people who may feel themselves offended in some way by the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla's references to monopolies and so on exaggerate the true position.  We are trying to bring a sense of order and modern training and discipline to what up to now unfortunately in <Col N="2510" /> some cases, has been an illegal practice although in many cases there was a very high standard of craftmanship.  This cannot be allowed to continue as it happened in the past.  We are talking about a very small number of people.</P>
    <P>The omission of any reference to training in the amendment means that it is not acceptable to anybody because it would still allow an extremely bad dental technician to continue to practise.  Nobody wants that.  The principle underlying the concern in the amendment is to ensure that people have an opportunity to continue to earn their livelihood.  The standards and the norms should be laid down in accordance with modern practice and the best standards of training available. The Dental Council have the capacity to introduce such a scheme and I have no doubt they will in due course.  I do not think this amendment is acceptable. While I would describe it as being well motivated, in its presentation and its content it is inadequate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the last speaker and with my colleague, Dr. O'Hanlon.  This section of people will be adequately catered for under Part VII, section 53, with regard to the auxiliary dental workers' association.  I totally accept Deputy Mac Giolla's feeling towards these people.  They have been providing a service for many years.  However, Deputy Keating put his finger on it in saying that no training period or qualifications were mentioned in Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment.  There are only 15 people in the IADB about whom we are talking.  I understand that the Minister suggested that the council look favourably at applications from these 15 people to be included as auxiliary dental workers when the time was right.  Perhaps this is the solution Deputy Mac Giolla is looking for.  A number of these people have provided very excellent service and I have no doubt that that excellent service will be recognised by the Dental Council when it comes to registering the auxiliary dental groups.</P>

      <P>The whole question of training was dealt with earlier in the Bill and is a separate matter.  This amendment is based merely on one section of the Bill.  There is not sufficient argument on that basis.  I am not talking about 15 people.  There are 15 people who are publicly and openly operating illegally, as the Minister says, since 1928 because prior to that Act their work was quite legal.  The 1928 Act made it illegal and gave the monopoly to the dentists that only they could stick dentures into patients' mouths.  Some of these people existed before 1928 and gave a service to the public which the public want and demand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Restrictive Practices Commission refered to that matter.  If there were free market conditions a very large number of people would choose to obtain their dentures from dental technicians.  The commission recognise that, because people cannot afford to go to dentists for dentures.  If there were not a monopoly established by legislation the people would go to these technicians.  The commission also went into the whole area of health care and the dangers that the dentists said would arise and the Restrictive Practices Commission found there was no evidence to substantiate these allegations of mouth cancer and various other ills which the dentists said would occur.  The Minister and the Deputies are missing the point of this.  If it were not illegal, the remaining 250 or so would also be able to use their trade, or profession, or whatever you wish to call it, to better themselves and to their advantage to give a service to the public. They would put plates on their doors and give that service to the public.  At present they can only operate under a dentist's control.  They provide a service only to dentists, not to the public.  That is the point that I am making.  I did not know <Col N="2512" /> until the Minister mentioned that fact that 15 people were involved who are operating publicly illegally.  Many of the others are operating illegally privately.</P>
    <P>If you know the dental technician who lives down the road from you, you can go to him and he will fix you up, even though he does not belong to these 15. This is being done regularly all over the country.  These people are skilled in their job and know it and if you ask them to provide dentures, they provide them. They provide them for your dentist anyway.  They will provide them for you for half the price.</P>
    <P>It is not sufficient to say that section 53 will make everything all right.  It will not. That section states that the council may do this and may do that and the Minister may recommend this, that, or the other. The council may not do anything.  As far as the dentists are concerned, once they have got their monopoly they will not do anything.  It is not a question of being permitted to do something, they will retain their monopoly.  If these dental technicians are given anything, it will be some benevolent gesture of giving special training perhaps, but they will still maintain these people under their control, saying that they only operate for the dentists and not for themselves.  There is not a free market, and that is what it is all about.</P>
    <P>Here we are talking to the free market society on both sides of the House and I have been fighting against them on various other issues.  The free market society in this instance want to establish a monopoly for dentists only and do not want the free market forces to operate at all.  The majority of people, certainly in my constituency, will go to the dental mechanic, as they call him, to get their false teeth, rather than to the dentist. Whether it is put into the Bill or not, these people will operate illegally.</P>
    <P>Is it not dreadful that these highly skilled and very respectable people must operate illegally?  They must now operate under a ten times worse penalty.  The fine was only £100 under the 1928 Act.  It is now £1,000 under this new Bill.  This Bill does not improve anything.  It is keeping <Col N="2513" /> us in the same position as 50 years ago, with dentists' monopoly.  That does not exist in any other area, medical or otherwise. People are not given monopolies. The Restrictive Practices Commission also made the point that there was no longer need to protect the public by penal legislation.  That is what we are talking of doing, protecting the public by penal legislation.  In fact, this would not protect the public at all.  It would protect the dentists.  There is no need for this penal legislation and illegality.</P>
    <P>If my amendment is accepted, it will be recognising the existence, status and rights of the dental technician to operate and provide dentures for people over 18 years of age, not dealing with living tissues. If that is accepted in this section, then the whole question of training and everything else can be dealt with.  Their existence is not recognised until you come to Part VII, where it is said that the council may, if they wish, recognise their existence and may, if they wish, establish classes of dental workers.  This is still not giving these people their rights to carry out their own job and give a service to the public which they wish to give.  The acceptance of my amendment would save the Minister many problems in the future.  There will be many battles over this and the Restrictive Practices Commission will again be operating as far as dentists are concerned.  There is exactly the same procedure here as in the 1982 case, when they were operating under the 1928 Act.  The Government have not changed matters one bit.  In fact, they have defied the commission by putting this Bill, three years later, before the House.  What the Government are saying is that they are not interested in the Restrictive Practices Commission and are insulting them by putting the same Bill in, despite their simple recommendation which is incorporated in this amendment. Would the Minister reconsider this amendment and accept it, thus avoiding many problems in the future?</P>

      <P>I do not know who the Deputy is trying to impress by using words of that nature.  There is provision in the Bill for the establishment, by the Dental Council, of a class of auxiliary dental workers who will be fully trained and competent to supply dentures direct to those of 18 years of age and over.  In the Deputy's amendment he mentions &ldquo;a recognised dental technician (who can satisfy the Department of Health that he has been providing dentures direct to the public for at least five years prior to the date of the passing of this Act)&rdquo;.  No such person is recognised at the moment.  Any of these persons supplying dentures to the public are acting illegally and until a few years ago a number of fines were imposed.  Out of the 200 in the country at the moment, we calculate that approximately 12 are acting in this fashion.</P>
      <P>The Government and the Opposition are fully in agreement with what we are trying to do here.  The decision to introduce fully trained denturists rather than to provide for a free-for all situation in relation to the supply of dentures, as would have been the case if the majority recommendation of the Restrictive Practices Commission was adopted, was taken by the Government following a long and detailed consideration of the position.  The Minister was not prepared to make any amendment to the Bill that would permit unqualified persons to operate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy wants to allow unqualified persons to supply dentures direct to the general public, but we are saying that there can be auxiliary workers who will be trained and qualified.  It is possible the Dental Council may make some concessions, as we hope they will, to those who have already attained a degree of proficiency in the trade when the council are drawing up the educational and training requirements for denturists.  If the new council will not go ahead and establish this kind of auxiliary dental worker, they will be directed to do so by the Minister. These auxiliary dental workers will be <Col N="2515" /> trained and competent to supply dentures to persons of 18 years and over.  We are trying to regulate the dental profession. There has not been any Bill to deal with these matters since 1928.  This Bill will go a long way to meet the spirit of the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what are the qualifications for a dental technician but there are dental technicians who supply dentures to dentists and the dentists must be satisfied regarding their training and qualifications.  They have been there for years, ever since dentures were invented: probably they invented dentures before dentists ever thought of them.  I do not know what are their educational qualifications, but a gentleman who approached me told me he did a five years apprenticeship before he was accepted as a dental technician in the trade with other dental technicians. These people have had some kind of training &mdash; and up to now it was regarded as satisfactory.  The dentists who use the services of these technicians have been quite satisfied, but once the technicians start providing the dentures direct to the public they become unsatisfactory and untrained.  They become illegal operators.</P>

Deputy Keating also spoke about their lack of training.  The training is there.  Will someone please tell me what is unsatisfactory about the training of dental technicians who supply dentures to the Eastern Health Board, to the dentists, to me and to many other people?  I am talking of people who are qualified and trained in the existing sense of the term.  Some of them have been operating publicly providing their services to the public and others have been operating <Col N="2517" /> privately.  However, now they are being attacked as illegal operators and untrained people.  All I am asking the Minister is to show me where it will appear in the Bill that qualified trained denturists, dental prosthesists, dental technicians or whatever the Minister wishes to call them will be able to provide a service directly to people of 18 years.  The Minister says that provision is in the Bill, but I do not see it.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla has stated that dental mechanics have a training that is acceptable to the dentists.  I have no doubt it is correct that they have a training that is acceptable to the dentists to carry out a particular function, but I could not accept that dental mechanics have a training that is acceptable to dentists to fit dentures to persons under 18 years or over 18 years.  I believe that in section 55 (1) the Bill makes it clear that the Minister has got the power to direct the Dental Council to set up a particular scheme providing for auxiliary dental workers.</P>
      <P>That should be adequate.  But we would become very confused if we took it that the dental profession and the dental mechanics work included fitting dentures to the public, because the dentists themselves would not accept that.  They do accept them to carry out a particular function which I have no doubt the dental mechanics do extremely well.  But that function does not include what Deputy Mac Giolla is asking us to do in this amendment.</P>

      <P>There is provision in the Bill for the establishment by the Dental Council of a class of auxiliary dental worker who would be fully trained and competent to supply dentures direct to persons aged 18 years and over.  Some of these people have some type of qualification at present and are supplying dentures to the public.  No fines have been imposed since 1975.  One was talking about a fine of £5 or something like <Col N="2518" /> that, and they had no regard to that whatsoever. We are here attempting to act in the interests of the public ar large in that we are preventing anybody from supplying dentures to persons over 18 years of age &mdash; provided they are not working on live tissue &mdash; if they are not qualified to do so.  The qualification to do so would be enshrined in certain educational and training specifications laid down by the Dental Council.  If the people to whom Deputies Mac Giolla and O'Hanlon are at present referring have a certain type of training and are in need of additional training, that can be given to them.  I presume that the Dental Council will make concessions to people with a certain amount of training in a given direction at present.  They could arrange a type of educational and training programme that would not take too long.  Presumbly that would allow these people who are providing dentures to the public at present illegally to set up and provide them legally.</P>

      <P>The nub of this amendment relates to some extent to the question of training.  Perhaps the Minister would be kind enough to answer a specific question in this regard.  He mentions that the Dental Council can establish classes of auxiliary dental workers from ancillary grades within the dental field whose work would not perhaps amount to the practice of dentistry as defined in the Bill.  In this context would the Minister consider asking the council to examine, as a matter of priority, the question of training generally, particularly of training arrangements for dental craftsmen and technicians simply to ensure that the standard is raised to acceptable levels? My information is that there is an outflow of laboratory work &mdash; precisely on account of the lack of training &mdash; to the United Kingdom and to the United States, to the extent of some £2 million a year, indicating a clear vote of no confidence or lack of confidence in present standards of training in this area.  Perhaps the council could be asked by the Minister to have this area of training examined as a matter of urgency in order to ensure that standards are acceptable and, on an <Col N="2519" /> auxiliary basis, to ensure that there are job opportunities for people in Ireland. It would benefit the whole field of health care, the economy and might do a great deal to bring into line training standards here with acceptable standards abroad. The Minister might ask the Dental Council to consider that request.</P>

      <P>From the information we have it appears that what Deputy Keating says is quite true, that there is a great deal of work that dentists require to be done at present that our dental technicians cannot deliver to them because of their inability to supply what the dentists want.  As a result there are technicians elsewhere who avail of this opportunity and seemingly it is lucrative for them.  I have no doubt but that the Dental Council will set up these educational and training programmes so that technicians here will be able to undertake the type of work now going abroad.  It should be of great benefit to the technicians who are operating here at present and who cannot supply what is needed by the profession.</P>

    <P>I do not want to go through it all again, but the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; is enough for me to wipe out the whole section and ask what is the point.  The council may do all sorts of things and, if they do not, then the whole section is a waste of time.  There is the phrase &ldquo;The Council may, with the consent of the Minister, make a scheme for establishing classes&mdash;&mdash;.&rdquo; but the council may decide to leave things as they have been for the last 50 years.  It is more likely that that is what they will decide, particularly as it is totally monopolised by dentists.</P>
    <P>On an earlier section, in regard to the election of people onto the council, I endeavoured to put down an amendment which sought a place on the council for dental workers.  Subparagraph (f) of my amendment to section 9 read:</P>
    <P>Four representatives of auxiliary dental workers nominated by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, two of whom shall be dental technicians, and two dental nurses;</P>
    <P>That amendment was not accepted, which means that they are not represented at all on the council.

When one is drafting legislation one does not say we will have confidence in them, so we will leave the legislation sloppy.  If something has to go before the courts it is decided on the words in the Act, not on whether one has confidence in a council or whatever else. That has nothing to do with the legislation before the House.  I would ask the Minister not to come up with that sort of thing, <Col N="2522" /> saying that I have no confidence in them. If the Minister has every confidence in them, he would not have to put in a section saying that the Minister will direct them.  The Government obviously have no confidence in them, so they are giving the Minister power over them.  Why not insert the power in the Bill?  Obviously it is the Minister's desire that all the things listed in the section be done, so he should accept our amendment.  I recall that the Minister for Health made similar amendments in relation to the Nurses Council in altering &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.

      <P>It seems to me that Deputy Mac Giolla's argument is contradicting what he said a few minutes ago.  I understood him, ten or 15 minutes ago, to be arguing against regulations or for <Col N="2523" /> minimal regulations.  Here, in a section that affords the council the opportunity to order their affairs consistent with the public interest, he seems to believe that they should be bound hand and foot.  The following section gives the Minister the opportunity to compel the council if he is not satisfied.  It seems to me that we are getting the best of both worlds in the way the section is presented.  This is a very standard type of drafting phrase in many Bills and it has not wrought havoc in any other analogous area of legislation.</P>
      <P>The last Bill introduced in this respect was in 1928.  It is very difficult to see the requirements of medical care, in the broader sense, over the next 30 or 40 years.  It could be that if we changed the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; to &ldquo;shall&rdquo; we could compel a council to introduce a scheme for establishing classes of auxiliary dental workers and so on which might not be appropriate, depending on the revolution in medicine and in health care that could come about.  As presented, when taken with section 54, section 53 gives us the best of both worlds in that it gives the council the respect and freedom to introduce a proper system of training, control and so on and yet gives the Minister a capacity to compel them to do something if he is not satisfied with what is happening in that area.

One issue is what is called the President's awards scheme which was announced recently.  In the budget the Minister for Finance announced that £150,000 was being granted to the International Youth Year Committee.  Since that announcement £50,000 has been pilfered from it and handed over to some group or other &mdash; the name is not yet available &mdash; to establish a President's <Col N="2525" /> award scheme.  The only name mentioned so far in relation to it, apart from the President's, is that of Dr. A. J. F. O'Reilly who I think has something to do with the <i>Irish Independent.</i> I understand that an advertisement has been placed in newspapers looking for a director for the scheme.  If we are serious in dealing with youth problems and establishing confidence with the youth we cannot, on the one hand, announce £150,000 to be spent in International Youth Year by youth organisations and, on the other hand, take one-third of it back and allocate it for a different purpose.  Will the Minister explain what is going on in regard to that scheme?  I am sure the Minister is aware that the National Youth Council are very upset about the way they were treated in regard to the scheme.  The Minister should ensure that the £50,000 is restored to the International Youth Year Committee.</P>
      <P>A section of the report deals with juvenile offenders and makes clear that there is a close relationship between disadvantaged youths and the fact that many of them appear in our courts.  There were recent moves to deal in a panic fashion with those found guilty of offences committed primarily by young people.  There has been a lot of hysteria, built up to a large extent by newspaper headlines, concerning so-called joyriding and the opening of Spike Island as a prison.  Juvenile prisoners have been transferred to adult prisons and education facilities in Cork prison and Arbour Hill have been closed down.  There is little point in spending our time discussing the fine report of the National Youth Policy Committee and referring to how well we are going to treat our youth while at the same time the Minister for Justice makes decisions which are completely contrary to the most enlightened information, knowledge and experience as to how youth offenders should be dealt with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has to answer for what is going on in the Government.  Panic measures are being taken to deal with young people who come before our courts.  They are being treated in a way <Col N="2526" /> which can only be described as vengeful, seeking revenge against those who are guilty of various offences, without much effort being made to rehabilitate the offenders.  One step that has been taken is the transfer of juveniles to adult prisons, and that is a wrong move.</P>

      <P>The national fuel scheme provides fuel allowances to certain elderly persons and persons depending on long-term social welfare type payments who fulfil certain conditions.  The scheme is administered by the health boards, and I am satisfied that the boards are carrying out their functions under this scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The proportion of people in any particular area who qualify for an allowance under the national fuel scheme will depend on a number of factors, such as the number of elderly persons in the area who cannot provide for their fuel needs and whether a scheme of allowances under the urban fuel schemes exists in this area.  There is no evidence that the criteria for eligibility for an allowance under the national fuel scheme are <Col N="2527" /> applied differently in different health board areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me draw the Minister of State's attention to the variation in some of the areas.  In the community care area of Kerry 6,763 vouchers were issued in 1984-85 and in the area in Donegal with approximately 100,000 people 6,155 vouchers were issued.  Coming to my constituency and taking Counties Cavan and Monaghan with a population of over 100,000 only 2,489 vouchers were issued. I would also like to ask the Minister of State if he considers that a more appropriate appeals system might be introduced so that the person who would hear the appeal against the decision not to allow free fuel vouchers would be different from the person who made the decision in the first place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>An analysis has been carried out on the number of recipients in each county by reference to the total population and also of the number of people over 65 in each of the planning regions.  From that analysis it would appear that the number of recipients appears to be influenced by the number of aged persons.  Another factor accounting for the higher numbers in certain areas is the absence of any towns with urban fuel schemes.  Therefore, the presence or absence of such schemes as well as demographic conditions would, accordingly, appear to account to a great extent for variations in the number of recipients rather than any differences in the application of the criteria for eligibility.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The examples that I gave to the Minister of State were three very similar areas in that they are rural with a very high percentage of elderly living there and none of them has towns that would qualify for the 1945 fuel scheme.  Surely the Minister of State will accept that there is a very large variation in the examples I gave him.  Perhaps he will explain why the number of vouchers issued in Monaghan dropped by 200 over the last two years at a time of rising <Col N="2528" /> unemployment and most severe recession.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>In Deputy O'Hanlon's constituency it will be seen that County Monaghan shows the lowest number of recipients at 829.  That is the lowest in the country as well as the lowest proportion at 16 per 1,000 population.  In the course of inquiries from the health board for a possible reason for this it came to light that the figures supplied for County Monaghan do not include part of the county which is dealt with by the Louth community care area.  The figure for County Monaghan as a whole in 1983-84 was 1,232 representing 24 per 1,000 population of the county.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister of State aware of the type of advertising campaign that was used recently for the launch of the new teamwork on social and employment schemes?  These were very effective communicating messages about the new schemes which led to streams of inquiries at various local employment exchanges. Given the low level of take-up on this scheme can something of that nature aimed through the media that are most available to the greatest number of people in the greatest variety of households not be employed, rather than the printing only of one form or another? Will he not consider a scheme of that sort <Col N="2530" /> which I am satisfied would be successful in reaching the people who should be taking up this scheme, the many people who should be in receipt of perhaps £5 to £15 subsidy weekly from the State and who have not applied for it for some reason.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I assure the Deputy that every effort is being made and will continue to be made to make known the terms of the scheme and to get people who may be entitled to it to apply.  Every effort will be made within the resources available.  Certain forms of national advertising are quite expensive, and quite an amount has already been spent on advertising since the scheme commenced, but the Department's aim is to make the scheme as well known as possible and to use every means possible to advertise the scheme within certain cost limits.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryFlaherty" hpid="Miss Flaherty Miss Flaherty">
      <NameTxt>Miss Flaherty</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State detail exactly the nature of the advertising campaign carried out on the first occasion and the second occasion? Also, if such effort has been made, why does the Minister of State think that the take-up of this benefit has been so unsatisfactory? This offers a cash bonus to families, so why have families not taken it up?  If the Department are anxious to ensure the maximum take-up, as I am sure they are, would they not consider the proposal I have outlined in relation to the type of advertising programme undertaken in the new employment scheme?</P>

The budget changes will be publicised in July next and these will include changes in the income limits appropriate to the FIS scheme.  These income limit changes could result in more people coming within the ambit of the scheme.  The second campaign carried out during March was the advertising in the national press.  Advertisements appeared in the Sunday newspapers on 17 March, in the evening papers on 20 and <Col N="2531" /> 26 March, in the provincial papers on 23 March and in the Dublin free sheets, as they are described, on 27 March.

      <P>I believe so; but if for some reason it does not, I can assure the House that further steps will be taken to avoid this type of problem.  On the occasion to which the Deputy referred, there were some circumstances which gave rise to the long delay.  The manager of the employment exchange reported that there was no delay in signing at the credits hatch in the morning, but delays occurred in the afternoon mainly because a number of claimants who attended in the afternoon were due to attend that morning.  In addition, there were a large number of inquiries from claimants about their position under the equality of treatment legislation and the new benefits year which commenced on 7 January 1985. Obviously when the people signed the previous month the new benefits year had not commenced and all the inquiries had accumulated for that day.  Immediately the manager was notified that claimants were being delayed, he re-deployed staff from other areas to the credits hatch.  The matter has been resolved and hopefully there will be no undue delays again; but, if it does happen, we will have another look at the situation.</P>

I refer to a report in <i>The Wexford People</i> which said that in evidence in an application for a renewal of a moneylender's licence the postmistress concerned refused to pay the moneylender because he was not the correct person to receive the money.  Clearly the book was valid and money was due on it.</P>

      <P>Taking an allowance book or pension book in pawn or as security for a loan is an offence under the Social Welfare Acts.  Where cases come to light they are investigated and prosecutions are taken where appropriate.  The Department were not aware of the case outlined by the Deputy until the parliamentary question was raised.  However, the matter has been fully investigated and the circumstances were fully examined. On the evidence available the allowance book was not taken as collateral for a loan and, therefore, there is not sufficient evidence available to support a prosecution in the case against him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>We seem to be at cross purposes here.  The report in <i>The Wexford People</i> clearly states that the woman in whose name the allowance book was said in court, presumably under oath, that she had given the allowance book to the moneylender for him to collect the money against a loan he had advanced to her, and that the postmistress on the last occasion on which he had tendered the book had refused to pay the money to him because she considered he was not the person who was entitled to the money.  In summing up the case the judge said that the only unsavoury aspect of the man's conduct was the taking of a children's allowance book from a customer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, on the evidence available the allowance book was not taken as collateral for a loan by the person described as a moneylender.  The matter came before the courts by way of the application of the person concerned for renewal of the moneylender's licence. The application was granted.  The social <Col N="2535" /> welfare officer established that the holder of the children's allowance book worked for the moneylender but that she did not borrow money or seek a loan from him. The claimant did obtain money from this gentleman's wife and at some stage gave her book to her to effect repayment.  This was an informal private arrangement and the book has since been returned to the claimant, who has continued to draw the allowance since then.</P>
      <P>There have also been media reports alleging moneylending offences in Galway but no specific complaints have been made which would enable action to be taken in the matter.</P>

Is the Minister satisfied that the Department are acting responsibly in allowing this type of practice to continue?  They are in effect allowing these people to get into the clutches of moneylenders.  Does he not feel that some effective action should be taken to ensure that people are not caught up in this way and that bland replies which contradict sworn evidence in court are not adequate?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wyse</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 8 and 9 together.  The free travel scheme applies to all persons aged 66 and over, to blind persons aged 18 and over and to persons receiving social welfare-type payments as permanently incapacitated persons.  In addition, the spouses of married pass-holders may travel free when accompanying the holder of a free travel pass.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no provision in the scheme whereby a person other than a spouse may travel free when accompanying the pass-holder and there are no proposals for extension of the scheme in this respect. It would not be possible to extend <Col N="2537" /> the scheme in the manner suggested without at the same time considering the position of other persons in similar situations. This would have considerable financial implications.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what the Minister means by his reference to similar situations.  Is he aware that most mentally handicapped persons are single people who cannot travel alone and that the free travel pass is almost useless to them? Many of them are kept at home rather than in institutions, at great saving to the State.  Surely there should be some way around this problem.  Would the Minister investigate further and come back with an early reply by way of a private letter to the three people involved?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>There are always a number of requests for extensions of particular schemes.  In relation to the free travel scheme there are requests from various categories who consider themselves deserving of it.  For example, the widows of former holders of travel passes, if they are under 66 years of age, lose something which they may have enjoyed for many years.  There is also the question of the physically handicapped. The original concept was to give free travel to pensioners and certain other categories.  It was subsequently enlarged to include spouses.  There is no objection in principle to a further enlargement but the cost implications of all extensions must be considered.  If an exception were to be made for this category the other groups would also have to be considered. There would be serious cost implications.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister would agree that a mentally handicapped person, could not, because of the nature of his condition, avail of the facility of free travel.  They must be considered a special case.  Would the Minister inform the House of the cost implications of extending this facility to mentally handicapped persons as a category on their own?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Administratively it would be very difficult to extend the scheme in the way the Deputy suggests. Certain other categories would have just as strong a case for inclusion in the scheme.  I refer, for example, to single people over 80 years of age and widowed people who have no spouse to accompany them on journeys.  It could be argued that some very elderly people are quite senile. The matter could only be considered in the context of widening the scheme to include all single recipients under 66 years of age, of whom there are approximately 32,000.  The number of single recipients over 80 years of age is 47,000. It would cost an extra £5 million.</P>
      <P>The case which the Deputy is making is very deserving and one which would merit consideration when resources become available. However, it would administratively be very difficult to apply it solely to mentally handicapped persons when so many other categories could make the same argument.  I refer in particular to senile people whose mental capacity is very limited.  If they are single or widowed they cannot be accompanied by a travelling companion who is not liable to pay the fare unless he or she qualifies in their own right.</P>

However, I would not like to raise hopes in this regard because this question has been examined fairly thoroughly from time to time with a view to trying to assist this particular category but the conclusions have always been that it would be impossible to assist this category without assisting all single people who at present qualify for free travel.</P>

      <P>I agree that the scheme of its nature is restrictive but it is intended to ensure that the resources provided under it are directed to the right areas and that is the reason for the restrictive nature of the conditions.  I am sure that the commission are considering this aspect of the scheme because the system is not totally satisfactory.

      <P>There is a provision in the supplementary welfare allowances scheme which enables a health board, in any case where they consider it reasonable, to make a single payment to meet an exceptional need.

      <P>Because of service charges and connection fees for a water supply, it could cost a social welfare recipient anything up to £700 to have these services installed.  It could cost anything up to £2,000 to have an ESB service installed.  The income of social welfare recipients is not sufficient to enable them to pay for those charges.  The Minister should make some money available for those people.  In rural areas the supply is a long distance away and the charges are greater than they are in other areas.  Will the Minister notify the councils that they should give special consideration to those people?</P>

      <P>We have the house improvement grant scheme and schemes are also operated by the local authorities for people who are partially disabled. These schemes have been administered excellently by the various local authorities in conjunction with the health boards <Col N="2543" /> who make the recommendations.  Generally speaking, people in receipt of social welfare disability payments of a permenent nature would fall to be considered, provided other conditions are satisfied.  Other schemes are operated for the elderly, but there is no special grant available for general social welfare recipients such as an unemployed person in receipt of unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance from this Department.  It would take a major kind of scheme to make such a grant available and to administer it, and it would be very difficult to establish the eligibility of people.</P>

This is an unemployment benefit claim.  People must be available for the normal hours of work. It is not sufficient for someone to say he is available for work at certain times.  It is all right if they coincide with what is regarded as normal working hours.  If someone says he is not available for work until 10 o'clock in the morning and he must be able to leave at 5 o'clock in the evening, he is limiting his availability. People who unreasonably limit their availability for employment are not entitled under the Social Welfare Acts to be compensated for being unemployed.

      <P>The assessment of the value of free board and lodgings is the main item of means assessed in the case of single applicants for unemployment assistance living with their parents.  The legislation does not specify the method by which the value of the board and lodgings should be calculated and each case is decided on its merits having regard to the standard of living of the household and the circumstances of the applicant.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the case of wage earning families the method of calculation is to deduct from net parental income, that is gross income less income tax, PRSI and health contributions, an amount to cover rent or mortgage repayments and also a set parental allowance.  The remainder is then divided among the non-earning members of the household, including the applicant, and the result is taken as the <Col N="2547" /> value of the applicant's board and lodgings. However, there is a maximum limit of 12½ per cent of the net income.</P>

      <P>The requirement to take account of the value of the board and lodging has been a feature of the unemployment assistance scheme since its inception.  Its purpose is to achieve a degree of equity as between applicants whose parents are well to do and those parents who are in poor circumstances. Otherwise, persons living in affluent circumstances would be entitled to the same level of assistance as those whose circumstances are poor.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In 1980, the question of benefit and privilege assessment was examined by the Department of Finance and it was calculated that the abolition of the assessment would increase the register by 18,000, at an annual cost of £21.5 million. The number and cost could now be expected to be much higher.  The whole question of benefit and privilege assessment is one of the matters which the Commission on Social Welfare are including in their examination of the social welfare system.  As I have said many times before, that commission are to report this October.  This is a big question as regards cost.  It is obvious that if resources were available and were to be used to abolish the board and lodging assessment, those who are worst off would not benefit that much, because <Col N="2548" /> single unemployed people living on their own in flats are much worse off than unemployed people living at home, generally speaking.  In the cases where unemployed people are living at home and the circumstances at home are bad, they get the full employment assistance. Their means are assessed against them in the circumstances I have outlined. Obviously, in such cases these people are not quite as badly off as those who are living away from home, having to pay for a flat, a room or digs.  The problem is the enormous resources that would be required in order to ignore the board and lodging assessment.  This is only a very small part of the problem, compared with the fact that if those resources were to be provided one would be assisting people who would not be the worst off &mdash; in other words, the people getting the assistance would not be on the bottom rung of the social welfare system.  I agree however, that most would be badly off.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to family income supplement is determined by reference to the weekly average of earnings in the period immediately prior to the date of the claim.  The most recent earnings records available to the Revenue Commissioners would be in respect of the 1983-84 tax year and so no information would be available regarding changes of circumstances in the meantime.  This data would not be suitable for identifying potential beneficiaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A further extensive newspaper advertising campaign was recently undertaken <Col N="2551" /> with a view to bringing the scheme to the attention of those who might be eligible. The situation is being kept under review and any further measures considered necessary to publicise the scheme will be undertaken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister indicated in a previous question that the estimate of those who might take up the scheme had been gleaned from the Revenue Commissioners.  Does it not make sense then that the application forms and information should be sent out through the Revenue Commissioners to those in the income bracket covered by the family income supplement?  This would avoid the extensive and expensive media advertising involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem in that regard is that the most recent earnings records available to the Revenue Commissioners are in respect of the April 1983-April 1984 tax year.  The P60 forms are now being issued but not all workers will have got them as yet.  Therefore, the correct information would not be available to the Revenue Commissioners because more up-to-date information is required for identifying potential beneficiaries of the family income supplement scheme.  The figure of 35,000 was based on the previous year's tax returns.  It would not be correct to assume that the beneficiaries would be confined to that figure because people who were not in the returns for that year might qualify.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That is accepted, but surely the vast majority of those entitled to the benefit could be reached in this way.  Given that the present system of making people aware of the scheme has failed in that only 5,000 people have taken up the scheme, does the Minister not think he should again look at the question as I am suggesting and send out information and application forms with the tax-free allowance certificates that are being distributed at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>That is possibly something that can be looked at eventually. <Col N="2552" /> As the Deputy is aware, the Revenue Commissioners are overworked in trying to get in outstanding taxes and if we were to request them to go through their files and locate the 35,000 people and send them forms it would mean a diversion from more important work.  The Deputy has rightly complained that there is not sufficient personnel in the Revenue Commissioners office.  At this stage it might not be productive to divert them from their own work to do what the Deputy is suggesting, particularly when there is far more urgent and necessary work for them.  However, it is a suggestion that can be looked at again.  As I have said, posters will be displayed in all health centres and in the Department's offices throughout the country.  I doubt if the Revenue Commissioners would look kindly on a request to do this additional work.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:</P>
    <P>That Dail Éireann takes note of the Final Report of the National Youth Policy Committee which was laid before the House on 10 October 1984.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister of State at the Department of Labour.)</P>
    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I said there was a contradiction between this Government making all kinds of fancy declarations about their concern for youth and what they would do in relation to youth policy and, at the same time, pursuing, through the Minister for Justice, a policy of simply locking away young people with problems.  The report of the National Youth Policy Committee states there is a clear link between disadvantaged youth and the number of <Col N="2601" /> young people who come before our courts.</P>
      <P>In the Estimates a sum of £165,000 out of an Estimate of £300 million for the Department of Justice was set aside for educational facilities in our prisons, that is something slightly more than 0.05 per cent of the total Estimate for the Department of Justice.  Now the Minister turns around and closes down the educational facilities in Cork and in Arbour Hill without any discussion beforehand and without making adequate alternative arrangements to ensure that the education and rehabilitative process that is involved in education in prisons can be pursued.  It is a fact that between 30 per cent and 40 per cent of the inmates of our prisoners are illiterate and the vast majority of the prison population are young people.  Thus, there is a clear contradiction of objective between what the Minister here will presumably be talking about and what the Minister for Justice is doing.</P>
      <P>There has been a hue and cry for what can only be described as revenge against those who engaged in joyriding.  While I can sympathise with those who feel anger against the young people, it has to be said by responsible people in this House that anger and revenge against young people involved in these activities is not the answer and the report we are discussing today makes that clear.  Even if action has been taken to take the young people who are at present engaged in these activities off the streets, what is being done by this Minister, the Minister for Justice or any other Minister to ensure that the next generation, the 12, 13 and 14 year olds, will not in the next six months or a year emulate their older brothers in pursuing their activities?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am involved in a project in the Finglas area called the motor project and I have met the Minister in that connection.  He has very kindly sanctioned the expenditure of money in relation to the project, but unfortunately we can find no one who will accept responsibility for it.  The Department of Justice say they are not interested, that it is not of their concern because the young people with whom <Col N="2602" /> we will be dealing have not yet come in contact with the law.  We have been in touch with AnCO.  While at first they said they would be interested in assisting, they say now that they are not concerned with this project in which we are involved because it is not training for work.</P>
    <P>The project is an attempt to get young people between the ages of 14 and 18, who have an interest in cars, who clearly have demonstrated that interest in cars in various ways, into a controlled environment in which not only will their interest in cars be fulfilled in that they will be allowed to strip them, rebuild them and race them on stock car tracks and so on, but will also be engaged in courses for personal development.  I endeavoured to contact the Minister yesterday to arrange a meeting with him about this.  Perhaps at this point he would make a note of the fact that I am endeavouring to meet him, to discuss this project with him, to try to get some movement on this project in Finglas.  It is my view and that of a lot of people concerned in the area that it could have beneficial effects in really reducing the problem of car stealing and joyriding in a practical way.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand this is a fairly limited debate and I shall be brief.  As this House will be aware, we were due to speak some months ago on this matter. This report has been hanging around a long time and I suppose, through pressures on Dáil time, delay has arisen. Taking up Deputy De Rossa's last point, it is very important that the Oireachtas have a contribution in relation to national youth policy.  I would hope that Dáil procedures and time problems would not be advanced as an excuse for delay in responding.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Costello Committee Report.  It is important that it be endorsed by this House.  There have been many clichés about 1985 being International Youth Year.  It is significantly important in Ireland, when one looks at our demographic situation and spread of population, that we should be particularly interested in young people.  Forty eight per cent of our population is under 25 and that must be viewed in the context that the EC average for under 25 population is 36 per cent.  If we study these figures even further we will see that the population between the ages of 15 and 24 comprises 18 per cent of the total.  If one goes further one will see that the percentage of population under 14 years of age is diminishing because of the diminishing birth rate.  It looks as though we have more young adults who are changing the future shape of Irish society.  It is very important that there be a political response to these changes if we are to avoid the type of alienation about which Deputy De Rossa spoke.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Young people today &mdash; and I can say it as one of them at 25 years of age, although ageing rapidly &mdash; are abused in many ways.  They are abused by politicians in the sense of being given lip service only.  They are alleged to be our greatest national asset and so on.  To some extent this is inaccurate and unfair.  If the challenge that young people in their numbers represent is not harnessed in a constructive and positive way they will not then constitute a national asset.  Young people today are subjected to pressures to which <Col N="2604" /> no previous generation were subjected. They are subject to pressures in the work place because of displacement of employment through technology.  We have seen, and will continue to see, a whole series of white collar jobs, clerical and administrative posts, abolished and disintegrated because of information technology and automation.</P>
    <P>Similarly we can see that young people are totally forgotten about.  I might give a specific example.  Let us take the banks. The banks are introducing new technology which involves displacement of jobs. What do the banks do?  Their trade unions negotiate a specific deal to protect their members, to get bonuses and so on, and at what price?  The price is an embargo on recruitment.  Therefore the people in a job are all right but the people who really pay the price, through lack of recruitment, are the young people, who have no voice.  The fact that they have no representation &mdash; and the same applies to the public service embargo &mdash; means that the existing trade unions and employers do not take account of young people as far as that goes.</P>
    <P>Then there are new pressures in regard to the points system in the leaving certificate and the huge numbers of applicants for places in third level educational establishments of any kind.  There is also parental pressure in that parents always want the next generation to do better than they did.  I remember listening to one middle class lady who said she would make all her sons and daughters professionals if it killed her.  That places enormous pressure on young people, pressure based purely on a fallacious social stigma. Young people are also exposed more to foreign cultures than were previous generation.  These are not all bad foreign cultures &mdash; whether that be drugs, the beat music and so on, some of which is terrific.  But there are new dangers to which young people are exposed as never before.</P>
    <P>When we politicians and political parties generally come to weigh up this report we must be alarmed to see, in <Col N="2605" /> chapter 6 of the MRBI poll taken in February 1984, that, of all the different groups to which young people look to understand them or to listen to them, politicians rated low, showing 1 per cent only active involvement in politics.  Of all the people, clergy, teachers or whoever, politicians ranked lowest.  There is a sense of alienation from the system.  That is the challenge we face.</P>
    <P>It was interesting to note that two members only of a committee of 23 were young people.  I am not saying that the membership of the committee was not of the finest calibre and so on.  But there is often a patronising attitude to young people, the feeling that older people only know best.  The first change we must effect is not merely to look at young people as social partners in the cliché sense but to go the whole hog.  This means that, whether one is setting up an advisory committee to deal with drugs abuse, a committee to deal with super-levy problems, whether it be Taoiseach's nominees to the Seanad, setting up taxation commissions or whatever, we must appoint young people.  I am not advocating that we should first make token appointments merely appointing someone from the Students Union, someone else from the National Youth Council of Ireland or from the National Federation.  There are young people with bright ideas who are alleged not to have a head on their shoulders, to be inexperienced, who are put down because they are young.  I would contend that those people are more innovative, have more to offer society than could be ever recognised.  In our overall selection procedures and appointments we should try to involve young farmers from, say, Macra na Féirme in the super-levy committees, likewise young accountants with new ideas to taxation committees. Perhaps they have just graduated, are faced with a supply and demand situation and find themselves on the wrong side.  Young people do not accept the <i>status quo;</i> they look for new ideas and new developments.  There must be political participation at the highest level through the appointment of young people, while at the same time avoiding <Col N="2606" /> youth politics and tokenism.  There are young people in every profession who could fill this criteria.</P>
    <P>This report regrettably does not deal to any great extent with youth, youth employment and unemployment.  There are 15,000 young school leavers going on to the jobs market each year and our society has never had to deal with that on such a large scale before.  The report does not have a full analysis of the existing training and placement schemes of AnCO, CERT, the YEA and the NMS. This is of major concern to young people. It was unfortunate that the opportunity was missed to point out the huge number of young people with nothing to do. Young people do not fit into the category of those who do not want to work.  They are independent, well-educated and ambitious.  They do not want to be discarded.  A dual social and employment programme should have been drawn up in that report so that we could pick out voluntary bodies to do valuable social work or pick out social needs.</P>
    <P>For instance, we could have said that by 1985 it is reasonable that every person would have a toilet in their house, or some such social equivalent, and that young people would be recruited to enlist with the St. Vincent De Paul Society or with local community groups who are starved of manpower resources to provide that sort of sanitary facility.  I accept that the teamwork scheme helps voluntary organisations but there is union resistance in the construction sector to drawing up a scheme whereby young people would be involved, for instance, in helping elderly people with house renovations and so on.  This is the same as my previous story about the banks and the recruitment embargo.  It is not right that unions can stop defenceless young people from getting employment and providing a dual social need simply because it will affect the union membership. Even though one could say that YEA funding comes from those members, it must be remembered that we have obligations to young people that extends a way beyond lip service.  The Minister of State, Deputy Birmingham, is very committed <Col N="2607" /> in this area and I would like to see him taking responsibility in the Department to deal with union resistance.</P>
    <P>The best part of the report is the recommendation in relation to the National Youth Service.  I welcome the establishment by the Government of a National Youth Service.  Such a service must be community based; it must be based at parish level; it must focus on the 16 to 21 year age group; and it must have the necessary financial resources to provide facilities equipment and people. If it does not have the resources it will not work.  Voluntary enthusiasm goes 90 per cent of the way but without the resources the other 10 per cent will not be attained.  To date we owe a great debt of gratitude to the voluntary organisations who have done so much for our youth.  They have stood almost alone in providing youth services.  We must harness the voluntary and State efforts nationally and locally, not with elaborate structures, not by nationalising youth services, but by providing the back-up assistance and co-ordination to the voluntary bodies in an organised way.</P>
    <P>We must also involve parents and post-primary schools.  It is important that before young people are independent they are encouraged to participate in youth services at school level.  The National Youth Service must promote awareness in the social, political, economic and cultural context.  There is a great weakness in young people in terms of their inexperience when leaving school.  Many of them do not know how PRSI works and do not know how to get involved in anything.  They are not taught commonsense.  They do not know how the &ldquo;Yellow pages&rdquo; work for instance. There are simple things which they do not know.  That sort of weakness is overcome with experience.  Combatting this weakness must be one of the aims of the National Youth Service and another must be to encourage participation in the community, in social action and in sporting and other activities that have an effect in relation to socialising and developing <Col N="2608" /> one's character.  The National Youth Service must also cater for the special needs in the area of drug or alcohol abuse, deprivation and the needs of the handicapped and the disabled.</P>
    <P>I welcome the structures of the National Youth Service as set out in this report, but the emphasis must be on a voluntary youth service with a State back-up as opposed to nationalising the youth service.  I disagree with the committee: the advisory committee should be dropped. The best feedback one can get is from the local committees to the central structure at national level.  We do not need a further advisory committee on top of that.  The more layers we apply to these structures the more cumbersome the service will be.</P>
    <P>Basically young people go through three phases in adolescence.  First is a separation from their parents, the second is a transition in which they are no longer children but are not accepted as adults, and the third phase is when they reach majority and are in a position to get a mortgage, a job and so on.  The National Youth Service must take account of all these aspects of development.  I would ask the Minister to study the work done by the Ferns Diocesan Youth Service. They drew up a report on the needs of young people in County Wexford on a non-denominational basis.  They went into all the aspects of the needs of young people and what needs to be done on the ground.</P>
    <P>When talking about youth service we tend to get into nebulous and intangible areas where the jargon takes over from reality.  I would hope for clear guidelines in terms of the <i>modus operandi</i> of the National Youth Service and its local committees, that would revolve around youth association, personal development and active participation.  The Government should consult with the youth committee and give it the teeth to operate and implement its wishes by providing the cash and personnel resources.  A clear time table should be established for the development of a national youth policy.  There should not be a recurrence of the trend where surplus funding for the Youth <Col N="2609" /> Employment Agency is returned to the Exchequer.  It should be clearly earmarked for national youth services.</P>
    <P>In relation to the educational system, our post-primary educational system is very weak in that it does not educate for life.  In certain areas there is also a lack of remedial education for disadvantaged people.  We have noted that the developments in terms of the revision of the curriculum and exam board.  As part of youth policy development there should be compulsory civics education in the same category as career guidance.  The need for it is understated and, as I stated before, there is an awareness of life that goes beyond where the Amazon runs in Brazil and the history of Europe.  This needs to be developed.  By drawing in the schools we will establish a strong link between them and the youth services.  I notice that there is a strong emphasis in the Report on the role of the VECs.  I do not think that the primary emphasis of youth policy at local level should be under the VECs.  It should be on the voluntary membership of the local youth committees.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State should pursue with his colleagues in Government another failing of the post primary education system in terms of career guidance and jobs.  Everybody is encouraged to follow a profession or a career.  Nobody encourages young people to start their own business or become self-employed. I would like to see a simple incentive system introduced whereby young people between 16 and 24 years of age who registered as self-employed be included under Schedule D and be tax free.  The career guidance teachers could tell such people that if they set up a business of their own, if they become chimney sweeps, set up creche facilities or a small business of any type they would be encouraged to get started by being exempt from taxation.</P>
    <P>I should like to welcome the national forum established and the introduction of the Presidential awards.  It is important <Col N="2610" /> that we get private sector funding involved in youth activity.  I note that one of the projects has been launched and the other is in the process of being launched. They serve separate functions and are to be commended.  I hope the State gives them the necessary back-up.  The response of the Government to previous reports, not only in the youth area, has been fairly negative and reports have been allowed to gather dust.  We had the O'Sullivan report on youth affairs in 1980 under a previous Government but we do not have a Minister for youth affairs yet. I am not saying that such an appointment is desirable but the failure to appoint such a Minister is symptomatic of the response in relation to the overall needs of young people.  It is because they are not a vested interest as such that they lose out.  I should like to make three requests: that the Government establish the national youth service in 1985, that the Government seek to reform the post primary education system to ensure it caters for and is more attuned to young people's needs in the youth area, and that the Government look at direct youth job schemes as well as youth training and placement schemes specifically meeting dual social needs at the same time.</P>

      <P>I will start, where the last two speakers finished, by expressing my concern that the report should not be allowed to sit on a shelf.  Its recommendations should be implemented immediately.  The narrowest of political motives are there for any Irish political party to adopt that attitude but the spirit of the report is very impressive and demands a response of depth and immediacy as is contained in its own expression of commitment and portrayal of young people in Ireland being ready and waiting to be directed.  Young people are waiting to be channelled in a direction which will be of benefit to themselves and to the community as a whole.  The report is a useful document and I should like to comment on three areas of emphasis in it. The importance of training for democracy permeates every section of the report.  That is an important area.  We are <Col N="2611" /> at a juncture where, despite the pressures on young people, they have confidence in the future and are resilient in the face of such challenges as unemployment and drugs.  Young people emerge from this close study as people who will face the future with confidence.</P>
      <P>On the other hand, the report emphasises that, while young people have a commitment to democracy, they are deeply concerned about the area of employment in particular.  It is vitally important that politicians who rate so low on the list of those young people consider capable of listening and responding to their needs should respond to those deep concerns lest that confidence, trust and co-operation is lost.  It will be lost if we fail to respond to the priorities they have clearly outlined.  There is an interesting comment in the report which indicates that, while young people are committed to democracy, they do not have a deep understanding of what democracy is.  In that context there is a need to ensure that we respond to the legitimately expressed and deeply felt concerns they have.  We must do so in a way that alleviates frustration and does not encourage them to turn to other ways to relieve that frustration. We must respond if we are to ensure that optimism, co-operation and confidence is retained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>How do we achieve that?  Action is needed on many fronts.  I have great confidence in the commitment and ability of the Minister of State in this area.  He has an important role to play in liaising with other Departments.  Every chapter of the report requests that all Departments get involved, in particular the Departments of Education and Justice.  It is important that from the moment a young person is open to socialising in school certain policies, approaches and principles about how they are treated are put forward their development should be encouraged. In the report the young people identified the lack of opportunities for participation as one of their biggest problems in influencing their own environment.  That is true in particular of schools.  A clear need is expressed in the report for school <Col N="2612" /> authorities who have inadequately responded to the need for young people to participate to establish school committees on which young people can participate and begin to share in the process of controlling their own lives.  Young people should at an early age be encouraged to make decisions and, by taking responsibility, be helped to develop an understanding of the complexity of problems and issues that face them to the benefit of school and society.  It is important, as the report stresses, that young people learn to cope with the media and the massive role it plays in their lives.</P>
    <P>A good deal has been achieved at Government level.  The Taoiseach made an offer of social partnership at an early stage after being elected to the office of Taoiseach and he has lived up to that offer to a great extent.  The way that commitment will be finally tested will be on the practical outcome from the publication of the report and the debate that followed it.  We must include young people at all levels of political decision-making. We must include suitably qualified young people on all boards.  I welcome the appointment of such a suitably qualified young person on the local radio board which will prepare the way for local radio.  It is appropriate that a young person should be appointed to that board because it is a medium which has a great influence on their lives.</P>
    <P>I was heartened by the emphasis in the report on disadvantaged young people. Deputy De Rossa also identified that area and related it to the current intense debate on young offenders who engage in so-called joyriding.  It is of great relevance to that matter.  It is no accident that almost half of the report is devoted to identifying this group and emphasising it.  While the vast bulk of Irish young people feel that they have a reasonable opportunity of controlling and being involved in their future and will have a reasonably satisfactory life, a large minority have not that optimism about their future or that expectation about a quality of life or control over their environment that might lead them to <Col N="2613" /> have respect or confidence in their community. While that continues we must realise that we have within our system an injustice which will inevitably cause continuing problems in youth crime and alienation.</P>
    <P>The action emphasised and requested by the report in that area which is particularly valuable is the extension of the school attendance officer scheme.  That scheme as applied in limited areas apparently needs to be expanded because it provides a useful early warning mechanism for young people who are likely to be disaffected or get into trouble.  Dropouts from school have been identified as those most likely to come into serious difficulty. Urban and suburban areas where crime is largely to be found and concentrated should have this service available as a useful early warning mechanism for young people.  However, there is no point in having an early warning mechanism unless some alternative educational unit or training project designed to involve such young people is provided, and if the school attendance officer is involved, then clearly it involves the young person who has dropped out of the conventional educational system.  We must accept that there are young people for whom that system is totally unacceptable and who are not at home in even the most experimental main line secondary educational centres and for such people there is a great need of alternative types of school.</P>
    <P>The report identifies a couple of experiments with which I am very familiar. One is the youth encounter project in the Finglas area which is a second level schooling system for early dropouts.  This provides fulltime training in education and personal development courses for perhaps 20 young people in a year who are referred to the school by a variety of agencies.  This project has proved to be very successful in stabilising these young people and helping them to form attachments and preventing them from moving into areas of crime.  This youth employment project is experimental on a pilot basis and its future has been in question for perhaps two years at this stage.  The final assessment on this project was done <Col N="2614" /> over 12 months ago and a decision on its future was to be made, yet it hangs in limbo getting an extension every six months.  The report here in two or three sections dealing particularly with disadvantaged young people identifies the importance of such local experiments tailored to such local needs and comes out strongly in favour of them.  The Minister of State should use his good offices with the Department of Education to ensure that this scheme is retained and extended.  I have pressed in the Dáil for the extension of this scheme to other areas in my constituency, including Ballymun where a need for such a project has been identified by local people involved in education dealing with young people who are not at home in any of the more traditional schooling situations.  I make a strong appeal to the Minister of State in his capacity as Minister for Youth affairs, Deputy Birmingham, to do what he can to outline to the Department of Education the importance given in this report to these experiments by many people concerned with our youth.</P>
    <P>Deputy De Rossa referred to the motor project also in the Finglas area which has run into difficulty.  This project is aimed at finding young people who might be at risk.  It would not be suitable for the hardened offender but it might be suitable for young people who could be identified as being at risk, and it offers them a year's training in mechanics and also personal development and educational training.  This project got the green light from Deputy Birmingham eight or nine months ago yet it has run into bureaucratic difficulties in finding an adopting agency.  AnCO, the Department of Justice and the Youth Employment Agency cannot see that this type of project should be taken on by them. The Minister has agreed to meet that group again, and I welcome that commitment. I hope a way around this difficulty can be found.  Such projects as these have proved successful in Britain and in Belfast and have been identified by people working and living in the local areas, as being a desirable preventive programme. Whether it would be more appropriately <Col N="2615" /> the responsibility of the Department of Justice is difficult to say, but the Minister of State could concern himself with it. His support in seeing this project to a successful conclusion &mdash; perhaps I should say commencement &mdash; would be very valuable.</P>
    <P>Another development which occurred since the Minister of State took office was the establishment on a formal basis of the youth officer scheme in local areas. Initially this occurred in a very <i>ad hoc</i> fashion and as moneys became available it depended on what community was best organised and had the most effective programme ready which frequently was not the area of greatest need.  This report emphasises again and again that, whatever resources we have at our disposal in the development of youth services, priority should be given to areas of identified disadvantage.  I was very heartened by the early decision of the Minister of State when extra funds for this scheme became available and were allocated with these priorities in mind.  Areas of particular need were identified and were allocated these funds for the appointment of youth officers there.  This is a desirable development which needs to be implemented throughout the youth services as called for in the youth report.</P>
    <P>The role of the mainline services &mdash; this is jargon which I have in my vocabulary for the first time &mdash; is extremely important.  All our young people currently, not just those at disadvantage, are facing unusual pressure.  The biggest problem facing them is unemployment, jobs and the question mark that hangs over that ticket to adult life for them in the future.</P>
    <P>In that context in the short term it is important that such mainline youth services as are there should be developed on a comprehensive basis throughout the country and should be well planned.  This need for a comprehensive service properly planned is underlined again and again throughout the report.  From my experience of the needs of individual <Col N="2616" /> communities I feel it is absolutely essential that the establishment of such a service must be a statutory obligation on some sponsor agency within each community. It is not good enough that, as happens in so many cases and so many services, the better organised and more articulate get the lion's share of whatever service or scheme is going while the scheme might be aimed in another direction or at another target group.</P>
    <P>Like others I was very interested in the section on values and attitudes.  There is no great consolation in it for politicians who are at the end of the league, but as a teacher who was second highest in the league, it is extraordinary how in a general election one can go from the top to the bottom of a league, even though as far as you know you have not changed significantly.  Obviously this is something to do with the general role perception rather than the individual.</P>
    <P>It is very important that we listen, and that we learn to listen, to young people. This is very important to those who are seriously committed to democracy and to retaining an organisation of society which we value and which we believe is the best way to run society, taking into account all the political options.  If we fail young people we may predispose them to turn from the democratic system and move in another direction.  In this report and the studies on which it was based the biggest worry has been identified as unemployment and the need for young people to find a useful way of fulfilling themselves and contributing to society.  In that they reflect a national concern.  With our age pattern, it is an even bigger problem for our young people and for the future.</P>
    <P>There has been progress in this area with the development of the team work scheme and the social employment scheme but I am certain that this is not enough.  These schemes are helpful and beneficial but, as a Government, we must look at ways to create jobs.  We cannot tolerate a situation in which so many young people have identified employment as a major priority but are left facing the prospect of unemployment in the immediate future.  We must come <Col N="2617" /> up with further new policies in this area which will radically alter the prospects for young people.  This will mean difficult choices and people making sacrifices but this must be done as a matter of urgency. The greatest message from this report is that young people want action and they want changes made and this has been spelled out very clearly as one of their main priorities.</P>
    <P>I take some encouragement from the fact that today in Dublin the Minister for Justice is announcing the details of a Bill to abolish the status of illegitimacy.  The Government identified early in their term of office the ideal of social partnership and involving young people.  They have struggled in recent months to respond to another priority of young people, social justice, by bringing in legislation which was controversial and difficult and, more than any other government, they have succeeded in doing this.  I am very happy that today marks another milestone with the publication of this Bill which will abolish the legal status of illegitimacy, and henceforth that word will be abolished from Irish law and all future legislation.</P>
    <P>This is an act of faith in the political organisation to which I belong, Young Fine Gael.  This is an act of faith in their existence and will be a great encouragement to them because they will feel that their political involvement and identification of this issue which was one of the first they sponsored, has been successful, has had an impact, has been heard and will be seen to be affecting a change in the lives of thousands of children and their families.  I hope young people will feel that we are learning to respond to the priorities they establish.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this very comprehensive and detailed report which is a sound basis for any Government to set up a constructive youth policy.  Deputy Flaherty spoke about young people's attitude towards politicians.  I find they have a very cynical attitude towards politicians and political parties.  They see us as living in ivory towers, unaware of what is happening <Col N="2618" /> to them.  They also see us as well paid people who could not care about the youth.  They see us as doing a lot of talking and paying lip service but not taking action by coming up with solutions to the problems they face.  Young people are looking for guidance and leadership. While I appreciate that the Minister is doing his best, as far as I am concerned he is not getting the financial help he deserves to bring about long term solutions to our unemployment problems.</P>
      <P>Unemployment is a major problem. This is one topic about which we come into this House week after week.  We say we must create jobs for our young people and do something about the unemployment problem.  This is leading to many social problems.  I believe many social problems relating to young people are linked to unemployment.  There are 70,000 young people unemployed, most of them highly educated, talented and looking for a future.  They would like to play a part in developing the Ireland they want in the future.  Unfortunately, politicians and political parties over the past number of years have not come up with any sound solutions to these problems.</P>
      <P>We have youth schemes, the YEA, AnCO, CERT, Manpower teamwork, social employment schemes and so on, all tied up with bureaucracy and red tape but under different Departments.  There is confusion among young people about these schemes.  If the Minister can sort out these schemes and bring them under one umbrella, even his own control, he will be doing a good job.  Then he can say which schemes are the most valuable or essential to tackle the unemployment problems.  Some of these schemes come under the Department of Education, others under the Department of Labour and so on.  I agree with Deputy Yates that if there were one Minister in charge of youth he might find a solution to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of those schemes are welcome, particularly the teamwork scheme.  I hope the Minister will develop it and encourage local organisations to participate. There is a tendency to say that it must be operated by the county council <Col N="2619" /> or the urban council but I do not think this was the initial idea.  Voluntary organisations in parishes and towns should be asked to suggest schemes.  It seems that the money is available and that the Minister is prepared to cut out bureaucracy and red tape.  I hope he will embark on a programme to encourage organisations to become involved and provide jobs for young people.</P>
    <P>Voluntary organisations have not been given sufficient support.  Many people see the GAA as a well-heeled, rich organisation. That may be so at top level in Dublin but in the rural parishes most of the GAA organisations have built their own community and social centres and developed their own pitches, in many cases funded 100 per cent by voluntary subscriptions from local people.  The greatest social workers we have are the people who look after the juveniles and the minors in GAA clubs throughout the country.  If the GAA disappeared in the morning it would take millions of pounds to replace them in the area of voluntary social work.</P>
    <P>The GAA have asked successive Governments to remove VAT on hurleys. Perhaps I am putting too great an onus on the Minister but I would ask him to use his influence to have VAT removed from hurleys.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am reminding the Minister of the essentials and I am sure he has influence with the Department of Finance.  The voluntary organisations are deeply involved in youth work and there is a need for qualified youth officers to assist them.  It is essential to educate these officers to play a positive role, particularly in urban areas.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a need for radical change in the education system.  This is an era of rapid technological development, coupled with shifting patterns of job expectation and mobility.  Education, in addition to its traditional task of preparation for life, must increasingly prepare people for work.  There should be closer links <Col N="2620" /> between the schools and the world of work at all stages in the curriculum, based on the idea of the school and the community as a integrated whole.  The schools have a more positive role to play in relation to young people who are trying to find jobs.  There should be more cooperation between teachers and young people after they have left school because they find it very difficult to acclimatise to the outside world where, in many cases, they are unable to find a job or a way to spend their time.</P>
    <P>Idleness must eventually lead to a breakdown in our democratic system. crime, vandalism and lawlessness among young people are all related to unemployment. We talk about Spike Island and building more jails but that is not the answer.  I hope that the Minister for Justice does not intend to put young people into those jails.  If they get into trouble they should be made to serve their sentences within the community by working for the local authority or local voluntary organisations.  They should not be put into the company of hardened criminals.  They should be assisted to readjust by looking after senior citizens or doing other voluntary work on the streets or in community centres in the locality.</P>
    <P>Blame is often put on politicians and those involved in voluntary work.  My opinion is that parents have become too soft and easy going with their children. They should play a far more positive role instead of leaving the responsibility to voluntary organisations and political parties, particularly in these times of recession and high unemployment.</P>
    <P>Teachers in schools cannot lay a finger on children because of the ban on corporal punishment &mdash; a disastrous mistake.  In many cases teachers are afraid to discipline young people.  It does not do them any harm to be severely punished when they deserve it.  It did not do us any harm and I do not see any reason why today's young people should not be properly dealt with.  Teachers and parents should take a tougher stand with young people who step out of line.</P>
    <P>This is the third report since 1977 but <Col N="2621" /> no Government have seen fit to implement the recommendations and develop a constructive policy for the benefit of young people.  The previous speaker spoke about dust gathering on the reports.  I hope this report will not be left on the shelf but will be used as the basis of a comprehensive youth policy.  Time is running out and young people are becoming impatient and frustrated, demanding effective action by those in high places. We have a duty to encourage our young people and provide a way forward.  They want hope for the future and the dignity of a job which is the right of any citizen. It is difficult to provide jobs for all but we should be able to provide some long-term jobs and utilise the vast talent which is available.</P>
    <P>In the mid-sixties a comprehensive educational system was introduced whereby every young person, regardless of class or creed, would have the right to a second and third level education.  We should now be reaping the benefits of that policy but unfortunately those highly educated people are unable to find jobs and make a contribution to society.  If we are to protect the democratic system we must find a solution.  I hope that the Minister during whatever time in office remains to him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I know it is difficult for him because he is being penalised by not getting the money essential to tackle the problem of drug abuse, crime, vandalism, education and unemployment, which is our greatest problem.  Unless these problems are tackled, we will continue to have social problems related to unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is International Youth Year, I hope that the Government will come up with something definite and positive in relation to establishing a youth policy which is relevant to young people.  We cannot afford to fail our young people <Col N="2622" /> any longer because at present they are frustrated and disillusioned with political parties.  Politicians should be honest with them and offer a comprehensive policy for the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to mention the importance of the report in the context of the vast number of young people and we should take a special interest in their affairs.  From reading the report, one cannot but be struck by the fact that young people have certain attitudes towards institutions and politicians.  Perhaps it is our fault, perhaps it is theirs, but it is a fact that young people today do not have a great deal of confidence in the system.  One of the reasons for this is that, in terms of youth, a person's life is very short.  Young people tend to look back over a couple of years and to look forward a couple of years and to judge the institutions of the State on the basis of what they see during this time.  Older people have the ability to look further ahead and further back and judge on all performances and factors relating to the young, middleaged and elderly.</P>
      <P>It is up to the institutions of State, Members of this House and all those in public life to try to engender in the young a sense of acknowledgement of their position and also, as the last speaker said, to try to ensure that young people accept that what is done is for the best.  How can we do this?  Perhaps our performances in this House are not a great example but it is up to us to change that because young people in general are sincere and they take people at their word.  Having given them our word, they are quickly disillusioned if what should naturally follow does not take place.  We must address ourselves to this problem because, although there are flaws in all systems and perhaps ours is not ideal, it should be pointed out that there are worse systems than the democratic one.  Young people need the inspiration and the indication from us that this is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The major problem facing young people today is securing employment. There are a vast number of schemes available <Col N="2623" /> at present and I ask the Minister to take a special interest this year to ensure there is maximum utilisation of all schemes in order to provide as many job opportunities as possible.  If young people are often highly educated, competent and intelligent, it automatically follows that we cannot condemn them for too long to the unemployment queues.  If we do that we break their spirit and undermine their confidence, not only in themselves but in the institutions of State and ourselves.</P>
    <P>Further improvements in the area of job opportunities will and must have a vast impact on the crime rate.  I always maintain that if there is something positive to be done, young people will not sit back.  They normally want to be involved and, if they are occupied, they will not have time to be involved in lawlessness or vandalism.  We as the major institution of the State, have a duty to ensure, in so far as we can, that every young person coming out of school has some form of employment, even if temporary, so that they will not have time on their hands with nothing to do.</P>
    <P>We should be wary of giving young people the impression that they are the first generation to be young.  We sometimes seem to forget that there have been countless generations of young people and each generation feels that they are the first to throw new light on the problems. That may be true up to a point but everything is relevant and other generations have felt exactly the same.  It is not the first time there has been a youth problem, here or elsewhere, or that large numbers of young people are looking for inspiration, jobs and leadership.  This has always been the case and if we do our job of inspiring, giving them leadership and doing our utmost not to con them with political waffle, that is the single biggest contribution we can make to the young. It would instill in them the confidence which they should and must have in the system.</P>

      <P>I should like to thank all those who contributed to the <Col N="2624" /> debate.  It has been somewhat fragmented but, notwithstanding that, it has been very helpful and healthy and the quality of contributions was extraordinarily high.  It is of some interest that the debate lacked the partisanship which sometimes dominates proceedings in this House.  It was also interesting to see a number of Members drawing on their personal experiences of different youth organisations active in their home areas. Deputy Allen mentioned the work of Ógra Corcaigh and Deputy Yates and Deputy Browne clearly were conscious of the activities of the Ferns Diocesan Service.  That indicates the extent of the impact which the voluntary youth sector is having on the life of the community it serves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased that all contributors welcomed the report, although I am not surprised. At the start of the debate there was some confusion when Deputies Fahey and De Rossa expressed disappointment that I did not say that I had a response &mdash; the tablets of stone regarding what we are going to do.  That was never intended to be the nature of this debate. When the Government entered office we did so on the basis of a pre-set timetable which indicated the steps we would take in preparing a national youth policy.  That involved responding to a number of particular and specific needs which were then facing youth organisations.  In particular one remembers their underfunding at the time and the threat hanging over the development officer scheme.  It was essential, in order to win the trust and confidence of youth organisations, to participate in this process.  That was done. We promised that we would then begin the process by publishing a discussion paper which would simply ask questions. We did that.  Then we said we would establish a high-ranking committee.  We had indicated what the approximate composition would be, drawn from young people, various Departments which serve young people and the various bodies which relate to young people.  That was done.  It is their work that we have been considering over the two days of this debate.  I want to assure Members of the <Col N="2625" /> House that the Government are on target and will be publishing their report sooner rather than later.</P>
    <P>A number of Members, perhaps drawing on the experience of some other Administrations and some other reports, expressed concern about the possibility that this report might sit on the shelf. They went on to say it would have company on the shelf.  I want to assure Deputies that that is not the intention, and that that will not happen.  As evidence of that, I point to the fact that, to a very substantial extent, the Government have already responded to the thrust of this report and, in many instances, anticipated the contents of this report.  I instance the reintroduction of capital grants for recreational and community facilities.  I instance the extended funding which will be available this year to support youth work and, in particular, the emphasis which has been placed, in accordance with the whole philosophy and ethos of this report, by the Government on the needs of the disadvantaged.</P>
    <P>One slightly unfortunate aspect of this debate has been some tendency on the part of people to blame the committee for not doing something they were never asked to do.  A number of Members of the House began their contributions by asking the most important problem facing young people is employment.  That is unquestionably the case.  It was recognised in a most specific and stark manner by the National Youth Policy Committee. They then went on to express disappointment that the committee did not address that subject in any great detail and did not suggest a solution.  It is a little unfair to blame the group for not doing something they were never expected to do, nor could they have been expected to do it.  By their very composition that should have been always apparent.</P>
    <P>The report says in the clearest and most chilling terms what our responsibilities are.  The report points to the real danger of our emerging into a two-class society: those who are in employment, professional classes and bureaucrats; and then <Col N="2626" /> it paints the picture of another class emerging living in the newer outer suburbs, permanently cut off from the prospect of participation in the paid economy.</P>
    <P>A number of Members then went on to talk about the role of a number of the youth employment schemes.  I was very pleased to hear the general welcome given to the operation of the teamwork scheme so recently introduced.  I have been gratified, not to say astounded, by the flood of applications received by my Department following its launching.  It testifies to the strength of community spirit that so many groups are prepared to come forward with proposals of benefit to their community and, at the same time, providing worthwhile employment even if temporary employment for young people.</P>
    <P>Deputy Yates invited me to address the question of trade union resistance and he suggested I should do this head on. That may be due to the impetuousity of his youth and it may be that my advancing middle age disinclines me from taking people head on.  On the basis of two years' experience in the Department of Labour, I do not think that is the way to make progress.  Of course it varies from one part of the country to another but, in general, the response of the trade union movement has been very sympathetic and very understanding to the various special measures which have been announced.</P>
    <P>There was a difficulty with regard to the construction area.  Given the difficulties that sector has faced in recent years, perhaps that is understandable.  In any event, it was the area where the difficulties in monitoring and ensuring that the young people participating received valuable experience were greatest.  The solution which has now been arrived at whereby any activity in that area is conducted under the auspices of AnCO is a very reasonable compromise.  There remains an enormous range of activity which is available.  Members of this House have a role to play in drawing it to the attention of any groups in their community who might be potential beneficiaries.</P>

      <P>On the basis that I have only five minutes it is not possible for me to respond to all the points raised. I will respond to some of them on an individual basis later in writing if necessary. One comment made by Deputy Fahey struck me as being significant.  It was the first public call of this nature.  I should like to endorse it.  He expressed the hope that all youth organisations would come together and work in harmony under the National Youth Council. I welcome that call.  I think it was Brendan Behan who commented that the first item on the agenda of any Irish grouping was always a split.  It would be a fine example for those involved in the whole area of youth work if they were to come together under one umbrella in harmony. That would be a very appropriate response during International Youth Year.  In saying that, I am aware of the fact that many of the organisations inside the council and some of those outside it have their own ethos, their own traditions and their own sensitivities.  With goodwill and a spirit of compromise on all sides, it should be possible to achieve what Deputy Fahey desired and what I would like to see happening.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another constant theme &mdash; and I suppose it would be easy to sit back and be flattered by it &mdash; was a suggestion from a number of Deputies: &ldquo;There he is.  He is doing his best and trying very hard, but no one is backing him.  The big bad Taoiseach, the big bad Minister for Finance and the rest of the Government are leaving him there high and dry.&rdquo;  That is not so.  One thing which has constantly strengthened me over the past two and a half years is the unfailing support which has been given to me by all my colleagues and more specifically by the Taoiseach whose personal commitment in this area is second to none.  The most cogent and compelling evidence of that is in the pounds, shillings and pence, the extent <Col N="2628" /> to which the Government have honoured their commitment to regard the voluntary youth service as a priority.  They have increased funding very substantially. Since this debate was so lacking in partisanship, it would be quite invidious to try to draw comparisons.  I will restrain myself from the temptation.</P>
    <P>On the question of pounds, shillings and pence, I want to say one thing about a comment made by Deputy De Rossa in a fine contribution.  He deviated a little when he addressed himself to the question of the President's award scheme.  He suggested that some money which had been promised in the budget had been pilfered, a most extraordinary suggestion. The committee established to promote International Youth Year approached me with two requests.  One was that they should get an extra £100,000 for their activities.  The second was that this year the Government should establish the President's award scheme. The establishment of such a scheme has been the policy objective of successive administrations for many years.  Successive administrations have been anxious that we should join with some 30 or 40 other countries throughout the world in having such a scheme.  One of the reasons why we regard it as a priority is that the experience elsewhere has been that such a scheme recognising and challenging young people as individuals reaches out to those who do not at the moment join the established youth organisations.  We see it as a very valuable way of reaching out to young people who at the moment are not involved in any of the structured organisations.</P>
    <P>The question of inviting young people to participate in various State boards and Government committees was raised by umpteen people.  It is happening all over the place.  This Government have appointed young people to NESC, last week to the local radio board, to the Youth Employment Agency, to the Prison Visiting Committees, to the curriculum examination board and a number <Col N="2629" /> of others.  I welcome the fact that there is a consensus in the House.  I thank Deputies on all sides for the welcome they have given this report.  I assure them that it will not find a place on any shelf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>In support of the objective outlined by President Delors in his statement to the European Parliament in January, the European Council on 29 and 30 March laid particular emphasis on action to achieve a single large market by 1992, thereby creating a more favourable environment for stimulating enterprise, competition and trade.  It called upon the Commission to draw up a detailed programme with a specific timetable before the European Council's next <Col N="2554" /> meeting.  The Government strongly supports priority action in this area and will continue to work actively within the Council of Ministers for the final achievement of a full internal market by 1992.</P>

      <P>Certainly, a renewed and reinvigorated European Community, as envisaged by President Delors in his address to the European Parliament on 14 January, and to which there is now within the Community a discernibly greater awareness and commitment, will be much better placed to assume a role in world affairs, and not least in the promotion of peace, commensurate with its enhanced international authority and standing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The Community's Annual Economic Report 1984-85 adopted by the Council of Ministers last December recommended that &ldquo;Europe and Japan should seek to assure that their own economic recoveries prove self-sustainable as and when the United States moves, presumably in 1985, to reduce its balance of payments and budget deficits, possibly with a co-operative set of policy adjustments on all sides and a more positive management of exchange rate relations between the three parties.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government fully subscribes to this need for a co-operative approach to promote better international economic balance.  Accordingly at Community, OECD and GATT Council meetings and other international fora the Government have consistently argued that co-ordinated action by EC member states, including exploiting the potentialities of the Community acting as a single economic unit, could permit the Community to have a greater role than heretofore in world economic recovery.  In this respect, the conclusions of the European Council on 29-30 March last stressed the importance of completing the implementation of the economic strategy set out in the Community's Annual Economic Report and the determination of all the member Governments of the Community to pursue in a concerted manner all the measures and policies which go to make up that strategy.  The Community is taking an active part in the present international discussions on how the international monetary system might be improved.  The Irish Government's representatives, at ministerial and official levels, will continue to play a forward and constructive role in these discussions.</P>

      <P>(b) encouragement of the creation and development of small and medium-sized enterprises;</P>

      <Col N="2560" /> Substantial resources have been devoted to encouraging research and entrepreneurship in the food industry.  In 1984 alone, the Industrial Development Authority, as agent of the Government, approved 100 feasibility grants towards studies investigating the potential of various products in the food processing sector.  The Authority has, in addition, approved 80 research and development grants in 1984 to encourage the development of new products and processes in the industry.</P>
    <P>The IDA have carried out a number of detailed studies into the most efficient method of utilising our resources.  These studies include &ldquo;A Strategy for the Development of the Agricultural Processing Industry in Ireland&rdquo; published in June 1982 and &ldquo;Consumer Foods: Ideas for Development&rdquo; which was published in January 1984.  These reports indicate that the food processing industry should concentrate on a move to the production of higher value-added goods, the raising of hygiene and technical standards, maximise the potential for import substitution and call for a more committed approach to both market and product development.</P>
    <P>Implementation of Government policy is achieved through the provision of assistance by the State agencies.  The IDA, in 1984, supported 115 new investment projects.

      <P>The application in this case was in respect of the installation of sewerage facilities and the provision of a bathroom and extra bedroom.  A grant in respect of the bedroom could not be allowed because contrary to a statutory condition of the scheme work had commenced prior to an inspection of the <Col N="2564" /> house.  A bathroom grant of £480 together with a sewerage grant of £200 was paid in this case in February 1984. No further amounts are payable.</P>

      <P>The European Communities environment action programmes lay down the objectives and principles of Community environment policy and specific measures in relation to matters such as air and water pollution and waste <Col N="2569" /> have been adopted by the Council within this framework.  The relevant directives, etc., have been given effect in Ireland by legislation, regulations or administrative action, as appropriate.</P>
      <P>Action at Community level in the recent past has focussed attention on the air pollution problem.  I have already announced my intention to introduce a comprehensive Bill on air pollution.

It is my belief that such an investment programme can make a significant contribution towards the development of a Common Transport Policy and can be of benefit to the entire Community.  Ireland is well disposed towards the proposal but on the understanding that factors such as economic convergence and integration, as embodied in the Treaty of Rome, are taken into account in the eventual Community instrument.  It would also be important that any assistance provided for this purpose would not be at the expense of other sources of Community aid and that airport and seaport projects, as well as land transport projects, would be entitled to compete for the available funds.  The Deputy will be aware that under the Irish Presidency a package of common policy measures was adopted which included infrastructure elements of importance to the Community and to Ireland.</P>

The underpayment arose because the taxpayer had been granted allowances and reliefs in excess of her entitlement for those years.  To avoid hardship, collection of the tax underpaid was spread over a period of four years by restricting her tax-free allowances under PAYE for the years 1983-84 to 1986-87, inclusive.

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of a deserted wife's payment is that a claimant must make reasonable efforts within the means available to her to trace her husband and to prevail on him to contribute to her support and that of her children.  The deciding officer held that this condition was not satisfied by the person concerned and has disallowed her claim.  She has been notified to this effect and of her right to appeal if dissatisfied with it.</P>
      <P>However, to qualify for a deserted wife's allowance a claimant must not have means exceeding a certain statutory limit, in this case £78 per week (for a wife and three children).  The claimant was not prepared however to fully disclose her income from a shop and in these circumstances did not show that she met with this requirement.  Neither she nor her husband had any employment record in this country and accordingly the question of entitlement under the insurance-based deserted wife's benefit scheme does not arise.</P>

While the content and implementation of advisory programmes are matters for ACOT, I understand that emphasis is placed, especially in disadvantaged areas, on simple, low cost systems with satisfactory profit margins.</P>

      <P>The question of extending the status of mountain areas to certain disadvantaged areas in the West of Ireland under EC Directive 75/268 has been the subject of separate and specific representations <Col N="2593" /> over a number of years to the EC Commission. The matter was also raised during the recent consideration by the Council of Ministers of the Commission's proposals on agricultural structures.  In spite of the considerable effort that has been made, however, the Commission have not put forward any proposal in the matter to the Council.</P>

      <P>The Horticultural Development Group was appointed in April 1980, for a period of three years, to examine and make recommendations on the development of the horticultural industry.  During that period it presented reports on tomatoes, apples and processed vegetables.  The group was reappointed in May 1983 and subsequently presented reports on other commodity sectors of horticulture and on the question of an organisational structure for the industry.  Having fulfilled its terms of reference the group was wound up in December 1984.</P>
      <P>The reports and recommendations of the group are a valuable contribution towards the development of the horticultural industry, including the replacement of imports, by home production.  A number of its recommendations have been implemented already and others are being considered in consultation with the industry interests concerned.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> Security arrangments for events of the kind referred to in the Question are an operational Garda matter.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that full account will be taken of the incidents that occured at the rock concert in Slane in 1984, when arrangements are being made for policing the village and surrounding areas in the event of a similar concert being held there again this year. They have assured me that should the proposed concert take place there will be a substantially increased number of gardaí on duty at Slane before, during and after the concert and all reasonable steps will be taken to safeguard the residents of Slane and their property during the period of the event.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot give any further information for the obvious reason that it is not in the public interest to disclose the precise <Col N="2595" /> arrangements for any operational policing matter.  There is also the consideration that it is rarely possible for the Garda authorities to be able to implement a predetermined plan since the essence of good policing on occasions such as this is the adoption of a flexible approach involving a preparedeness to change tactics at any time to suit developments.</P>

        <i>Limerick East):</i> I am aware that there has recently been some increase in the time taken to issue grants by the Probate Office.  In the case of personal applications I am informed that there is a delay of approximately eight weeks in getting an appointment with the personal applications officer.  However, thereafter the grant normally issues in less than three weeks.  In the case of an application made by a solicitor, the grant normally issues in seven to eight weeks.  There are, however, special arrangements for dealing with cases where hardship might be caused by delay.  The reason for the disimprovement is an increase in the volume of business against a background of restrictions on recruitment to the Civil Service.  In an effort to improve the situation the records of the Probate Office are being computerised and it is hoped that this will lead to a reduction in the time taken to issue grants.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is already a large degree of <Col N="2600" /> decentralisation of training and employment services with AnCO, CERT and the National Manpower Service operating on a regional basis.  Their regional operations have enabled them to respond specifically to local and community needs and the extensive use of community based programmes in recent years is clearly evident.  These programmes include AnCO's community youth training programme, community training workshops and LINC; the COMTEC initiatives of the YEA; the social employment scheme administered by NMS; and the recently developed Team Work administered by my Department.</P>
    <P>I am generally satisfied that given the commitment of the agencies involved to improving co-operation with other state services and local interests the need for decentralisation is being catered for adequately.  The question of the administrative arrangements for implementing training and employment programmes wil however be considered in the broad context of the forthcoming White Paper on Manpower Policy.</P>
