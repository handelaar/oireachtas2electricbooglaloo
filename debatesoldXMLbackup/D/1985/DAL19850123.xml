    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The question has to go before the Government in the light of consideration of various proposals which have been put forward.  Obviously, the Government will have to consider those proposals first and take a decision on them before legislation can be drafted. They will be before the Government fairly soon but legislation will have to follow after that.</P>

    <Title>Nurses Bill, 1984: Committee Stage (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 16:</P>
    <P Just="Center">
      <Col N="340" /> SECTION 25</P>
    <P>In page 14, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following subsection:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;(2) Any fee which may be charged by the Board pursuant to paragraph (b) shall increase by a percentage of not more than the percentage increase in nurses' salaries during the preceding year.&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">(Deputy O'Hanlon.)&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the amendment withdrawn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  We debated this amendment on the last day but I want to ask the Minister if he has given any further thought to the matter and, if so, what arrangements he proposes to ensure that the retention fee will not rise by an astronomical figure each year or if he has any ideas on this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The new board will decide the level of fee but, and this is the critically important point, it will require the approval of the Minister for Health of the day and it will be subject to the approval of the National Prices Commission.  I have already elaborated on the position at some length.  I do not want to tie the hands of the new board unduly but I envisage they will be very sensitive in deciding on the level of fees.  In my view this is a major improvement on the fifties situation when An Bord Altranais were not empowered to charge retention fees, that is an annual fee for renewing registration.  It will be for the board to decide if the retention fee will be charged annually.  They may consider it desirable to do this to raise the funds necessary to cover the day-to-day administration costs of the board.  In that context this Bill is no different from the Medical Practitioners Act or the Dentists Act.  I would be glad to answer any other queries on this point but we have already had a debate on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Minister said but in the debate the last day there was general agreement on both <Col N="341" /> sides.  A number of Government Deputies spoke on this, but while they were not satisfied with the wording of my amendment they agreed with the spirit of it.  In view of that, I thought the Minister might have looked at this during the recess and written something into the legislation to ensure that the fee would not rise by an astronomic amount.  Four years ago the fee charged by the Medical Council was £14; it is now £38 and last year they were looking for a fee of £120. We would not like to see this happening with An Bord Altranais.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Medical Council's approach was strongly resisted by the medical profession.  I have no doubt that this body, being administered predominantly by members of the nursing profession will be very sensitive about the level of fee set.  I am very reluctant to limit the fee to a percentage of nurses' income because that could be more than we would want and it might not be necessary to increase fees in a particular year. I have no doubt but that the fees will be modest.  The most important thing at the moment is to have some kind of fee which will provide the board with an income, of which they are starved at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I support Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment which is intended to ensure that the registration fee would not escalate in future years.  As I said last day, if it was felt that the wording of the amendment was deficient, we would be willing to consider any amendment the Minister might bring in which would incorporate the spirit of this amendment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the previous discussion on the amendment, the Minister said that registration for nurses who were not working and who were unable to get employment, other than short term or temporary employment, but who wished to keep their names on the register, would be lower than the fee charged for nurses in full time employment.  I said I could not find any section in the Bill which would permit this.  Perhaps the <Col N="342" /> Minister would explain how the new board could vary the fee.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 25 is an enabling section and states that the board may charge such fees as they may determine. My understanding is that there can be a variation of the fees and the board already have absolute power in that regard.  I did not want to lengthen the section which has eight different types of fees which could be charged for registration, retention, restoration, certificate of registration, registration of candidates, examination fees, applications to undergo nurses training and any other service.  Within that framework it should be possible for the board to have a live registration fee and for nurses who are unemployed, working abroad or taking career breaks, to have different levels of fees.  There is nothing to stop the board doing this and after the new board are set up I hope to have detailed discussions with them on the need for such variations. That is my intention.  The board are very sensitive about this matter and I am sure they will act reasonably.  To try to write a series of variations into a section would be impossible because of the exigencies that can develop from time to time in a particular profession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that what the Minister said is his intention but he will agree that the interpretation of this Bill when it becomes an Act will be a matter for the courts.  At that stage I wonder if it will be possible for the board to have other than a single fee for registration. Will there be different fees at different levels for the retention of names and for registration of persons?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will examine the situation &mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PadraigFaulkner" hpid="Mr. Faulkner Mr. Faulkner">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Faulkner</NameTxt>
      <P>This matter is perturbing the nursing profession because obviously nurses who are unemployed &mdash; there are quite a considerable number of young nurses in this position at present <Col N="343" />&mdash; would find it difficult to pay any registration fee.  The nursing profession generally are very anxious that there should be some type of assurance that the registration fee will be at a nominal level in respect of those who are unemployed or in short term employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Faulkner in regard to this point.  Following the debate in the last session, I got the impression that the Minister had given a guarantee in relation to this point and that he accepted our case.  It was reported in the newspapers last week that out of 50 nurses qualified in a Dublin city hospital in the last few weeks, only six have got jobs.  I worry because this variation is not included in the Bill and the Bill could be strengthened in this regard.  I ask the Minister to include a variation in the fee to cater for unemployed nurses and those in temporary and part-time employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can assure the Deputies that I gave particular consideration to the points raised by Deputy O'Hanlon, Deputy Faulkner and others who spoke on 5 December last.  Under section 25, there is nothing to inhibit the board from waiving or reducing a fee on a purely administrative basis.  The Medical Council can waive a fee if they so desire under a similar structure of payments and that is already in operation.  An Bord Altranais would have similar powers. However, I will examine the situation between now and Report Stage to see if any more definitive insertion can be made.  I will consult the board, my officers and the parliamentary draftsman to see if any more precision can be given. The trouble about precision is that it may tie down the board excessively.  I had difficulty in accepting the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Hanlon because, even to say that I accepted its spirit, would be tying the fee to the increases in nurses' salaries, which might not be necessary.</P>

      <P>With regard to the benefits to be derived from fees, the overall problem is that I do not see An Bord Altranais providing an enhanced level of training, education and a professional role unless the board have the basic resources to do so.  Therefore, these are the benefits which will inevitably accrue <Col N="345" /> from an increase in revenue arising out of the change in the fee structure.</P>

      <P>The Minister will appreciate that, up to the present time, nurses were only required to register once, when they were trained and took up employment for the first time.  As I said, they feel that the changes in the Bill will not affect them.  Therefore, I am asking the Minister to give a clear indication as to the benefits which will result from this change.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There will be far better and more improved training opportunities for nurses who are already qualified and registered by virtue of the development of the work of An Bord Altranais.  As a result of the system of retention, there will be a prospect of far better manpower planning in the services. We are talking about 25,000 people spread throughout all services.  To have an effective role we need much better manpower planning within the health services, as at present we do not have any. The fees would enable a far better system of selection of trainee nurses.  It is now generally acknowledged that there is a need to streamline the general selection of students.  The examination system can also be streamlined including that for existing nurses who wish to do further study.  It will also give a higher professional standing when a fee is paid.  I am at a loss to understand some of the objections to this section.  Those involved in the training of nurses on the lay, religious and professional side have been very supportive of the concept and see great merit in it.</P>

      <P>We have made our views known on the various subsections. The last time we debated this the Minister told us that on report stage he would look at the question of nurses having to pay a number of fees for essential services &mdash; for example, a fee for registration, a fee for retention of their name on the register and a fee for obtaining a certificate of <Col N="346" /> registration.  That is unnecessary.  If they pay a retention fee they should automatically get a certification of registration and if they register for the first time they should certainly get a certificate of registration.  We hope the Minister will come up with something worthwhile on Report Stage.  Perhaps he might look at the other issues which were raised by myself and my colleagues, Deputies Faulkner and Ormonde, before Report Stage.</P>

      <P>Question put and agreed to.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The board is being given permission to make rules for the establishment, membership, functions an procedures of committees.  I should like the Minister to relate this section to section 24 which has been agreed by the House. That section deals with expenses.  The Minister is a member of a Government which quite rightly have their eye on trying to control the incurring of expenditure. I should like the Minister to clear with the House whether it is envisaged that these committees are entitled to run up expenses.  There is a case for the board having their necessary expenses paid for them but I would not be in favour of a proliferation of committees each of which in turn would be entitled to the same thing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Bill stands, I am not sure it would empower the board to defray the expenses of separate organisms such as these committees will be.  As it stands <Col N="347" /> section 24 could not be interpreted as meaning that all expenses incurred by the board will include all expenses incurred by committees established in pursuance of the board's regulations.  I hope I am right in thinking that.  I should like the Minister and the House to be clear about it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no doubt but that under section 26 in the event of the board establishing a committee it would have to meet in full the cost of such a committee provided the committee was generally drawn from the membership of the board.  Even if it were to appoint outside working parties or study groups inevitably the board would have to meet the cost of that structure as well.</P>
      <P>The funds available to the board will be rather limited.  It is not in receipt of a grant in aid from the Department of Health as such.  It will be obliged to present to the Minister of the day and to the Department an annual report and statement of accounts.  To that extent there will be a very clear overall review of any expenses incurred by the board. We cannot inhibit the board from setting up committees.</P>
      <P>The board will be a large one with about 29 members.  As such it may decide to set up internal committees.  Inevitably it must do so under fitness to practise, for example.  It would have to meet the cost of so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister would be right in his reading of the Bill as it stands if it was intended under the expression &ldquo;committee&rdquo; to mean only committees of the board; in other words, if it was intended that the word &ldquo;committee&rdquo; would include only a membership all of which was drawn from members of the board.  If there was a suggestion that it meant the board had a free hand to establish outside committees, including consultants and the devil knows what, the Minister would be opening the door to expense which he cannot now foresee.  I do not think expenses incurred by the board under section 24 as it stands &mdash; it is only an off <Col N="348" /> the cuff reading of it &mdash; would cover expenses incurred by committees not consisting of board members or consisting partially of people who are not board members.</P>
      <P>I do not suggest that in the context of the Nurses' Bill there is the wildest likelihood of such a thing happening but it may be that some committee, not necessarily under this Bill, would decide to go on a fact finding mission to Tokyo. Public representatives are quite capable of doing that in other areas, as we know. I am just drawing the attention of the Minister to the fact that if he interprets the Bill this way and if it can be legally so interpreted, he is leaving the door open to more expense than he may think.</P>
      <P>It is true that the Minister will put only a limited sum of money at the disposal of the board to start with.  Once the system of committees is established he will find in the board's budget allocation for the following year items included relating to the operation of committees.  I have no apprehension that the nursing profession or anyone connected with it is likely to do any of these things but I am drawing the Minister's attention to the inherent capacity and tendency to all public bodies to proliferate their functions.  I should like the Minister to nail this down in such a way that he will not find himself presented with bills for the operation of committees whose membership is not drawn from members of the board.</P>
      <P>The board is so largely representative that I am not sure what kind of function the Minister has in mind for a possible committee.  I am so much a layman in these matters that I do not want to pontificate about it but this very elaborate and comprehensive board, as the Minister rightly said, is larger than any board which hitherto existed in this area, but surely there will be sufficient expertise on that board to help it in the discharge of its duties without going to outsiders.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I share the criticism made by Deputy Kelly that some statutory bodies have a propensity for expenditure and a proliferation of committees which needs to be examined.  There have <Col N="349" /> been instances of questionable proliferation and cost in a number of cases.  But I would make the point that Bord Altranais are a self-funding body.  Admittedly they must discharge accountability for fees collected from the nursing profession but there is provision in section 13 for an elaborate procedure for the setting up of committees.  That procedure is very clearly laid down to enable the board to carry out their functions.  For example, the board will be obliged to set out a fitness to practise committee and I can envisage there being a need for the setting up by the board of a number of subcommittees. It may well be that, for instance, for the purpose of giving approval to training hospitals and institutions, there would be a small committee of perhaps six or so members.  These would decide on the procedures for examinations and so on.  One could hardly envisage up to 30 members going around to every training hospital.  It may well be that a small number of expert members of the board will oversee the conduct of those examinations. There is a whole range of issues in respect of which a number of committees could be established.  From my knowledge of the board I do not think there will be scope for any profligate expenditure or esoteric activities that are not fully encompassed within the board but if there should be I am sure Deputy Kelly would be the first to bring that to our attention.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister to outline the purpose of this section but he has not done so.  There is an elaborate procedure being provided under section 13 for the setting up of various sub-committees. This section gives the Minister more power in that the board will need his approval in making rules for any of these committees but I do not understand the need for the section.  There is no similar requirement in similar legislation, such as the Medical Practitioners Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The section basically is a carry-over from the 1950 Nurses Act. The current rather elaborate rules for nurses were drawn up by the board in <Col N="350" /> 1953 but I believe there is a need to improve on those rules made in those rather contentious days.  There is a need for an on-going approval of rules for the purpose of the operation of the Act.  That is regarded as standard procedure.  It is in line with the general advice available to me.  I would be reluctant not to have that authority as distinct from the setting up of committees.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>

      <P>Subsection (8) of section 13 provides that:</P>
      <P>The board may, subject to the provisions of this Act, regulate the procedures of committees....</P>
      <P>Section 26 provides that the board may, with the approval of the Minister make rules for the purpose of the operation of the Act.  This may sound a circumscription of the activities of the board but it is desirable that there be overall ministerial approval of the number of committees and the way in which they are operated. Otherwise the board could maintain exclusive authority to set up committees and lay down rules without any reference back to the Minister thereby vitiating the whole purpose of the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to justify ministerial interference with the workings of the board.  Surely we spent long enough discussing section 9 which concerned the composition of the board to be reasonably satisfied that the board will be broadly representative, that those elected to it will be responsible people. It is hardly necessary to provide for ministerial approval for a committee.  We should have enough confidence in the board to allow them draw up their own rules for commitees which is the case in respect of the Medical Practitioners Act. The inclusion of the Provision for ministerial approval in the 1950 Act is hardly <Col N="351" /> a reason for such inclusion here.  I would have hoped that the Bill would have taken account of today's situation instead of there being a dependence on the earlier Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Minister is right. It is normal to give to any statutory body the power to make rules for their own functions and usually these need to be in acordance with the agreement of the Minister.  It is salutary to so provide because at least even if the board lay down their own rules, there will be something they will be obliged to adhere to.  It is better to have it this way than to have the board wandering at large, changing their minds in an <i>ad hoc</i> fashion regarding any of their functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>What are the Minister's intentions with regard to the frequency with which the register is to be maintained? The reason I was briefed in regard to putting this point is that nurses, particularly early in their career, go to distant places such as the Persian Gulf in order to gain experience, or for some other reason.  Therefore, because of distance and the problem of unreliable communications it might be very easy for them to miss a registration date.  In such cases annual registration might be too much to ask.  Equally, the necessity of keeping up registration might not be present in their minds.  There could also be such problems as changes of address and difficulty generally in communications. No representations have been made to me in regard to the question of <Col N="352" /> general frequency of registration but I would ask the Minister to have regard to the question of nurses who are working abroad and for whom the requirement of annual registration might be burdensome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In such circumstances I am sure the board would make a very special effort.  I would envisage a computerised register which would facilitate enormously the work of the board in that regard.  It is a matter of some concern and of regret that it has been suggested that up to two-thirds of those nurses whose names appear on the current register may not be practising for one reason or another.  It is essential in this day and age that we keep in close touch with the people in the profession.  I have no doubt that Mr. Daly, the very competent chief executive officer of the board, will make every possible effort to facilitate the nurses who are working in the Gulf or in other countries such as Iraq or America so that Irish nurses will be fully registered with complete details in respect of each nurse.  This is essential, and it can be done.</P>

They will make every effort to facilitate nurses in that regard; otherwise there would be a danger of a person not fully registered being put off the register and medical, social and legal problems could arise.  Great care will be exercised in maintaining contact.  I will be keeping in close touch with the board as soon as the board is established.</P>

      <P>This is basically a protective measure in terms of administrative proof that the certificate is a bona fide certificate.  As the Deputy may know, under court rules there is a certification of each document and this gives a formal authenticity to these certificates so that there can be no legal doubt that the person who is a holder of the certificate has due legal entitlement to have it and it will not require automatic signing and formal written endorsement of each certificate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very serious and important section.  While I would be reluctant to have a limit written in formally, there is no doubt that the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; carries a very emphatic edict and this devolves on the board.  The board will have to write by registered post to the individual concerned, stating the reasons for their decision.  They may be permitted some time to get the reasons into formal legal form but the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo; is most emphatic.  The person concerned will also have to be told the date on which the board took the decision. If there was any excessive delay on the part of the board there could be an action for damages for imputation.  The section will have to be implemented with great care.  In the event of the High Court finding in favour of the individual it would be a matter for the court to determine damages if they were claimed and it would be entitled to arrange for the payment of costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unquestionably An Bord Altranais will act with the greatest of care and the greatest of legal sensitivity when they are dealing with this section.  They will be well aware that otherwise they could find themselves in queer street.

There is no doubt that they have to have power and, basically, this relates to the unfitness of a person to engage in nursing but if one is to allege unfitness one had better be prepared to prove it.  In relation to the teaching, nursing or medical professions the prospect of litigation has cured many an insensitive decision.  There are some well established case laws in existence <Col N="357" /> that will stand on the side of the individual on issues with regard to matters of natural justice.</P>

      <P>Subsection (4) raises the whole controversial question of fitness to practise that will be coming up on section 5, which refers to a fitness to practise committee.  Section 28 (4) states simply that the board may refuse to register somebody on the grounds of the unfitness of that person to practise.  There is no reference whatever to whether that has to go before a fitness to practise committee, nor does it say, as is provided under section 5, that not alone members of the board but any person, any member of the public, may apply to the fitness to practise committee alleging grounds of unfitness to practise by some person. There is nothing in this subsection to say who is going to make the allegation of the unfitness of that person to practise. Is it some outside person who gets on to somebody in the board and says that so and so is unfit to practise and makes those allegations, and that the board do not have to go before the committee?  Do the board make the decision on the information given to them etc.?  There is nothing in this section to show with any clarity how they are supposed to arrive at their decision.  It is set out in section 5.  Controversial as the whole thing is, it sets out procedure.  There is no procedure whatever in this.  They just may make decisions not to register the person on that basis.  In view of the possibility of false information and a false allegation being made etc., is it not a pity that the Minister when making his amendment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I was referring to Part V which deals with this question of unfitness to practise.  This is the only reference to it in the Bill outside Part V as far as I can recall.  That is why I am raising the question as to why the procedures outlined in Part V are not referred to in section 28 (4).  In view of the possibilities which I see under section 28 (4) I am asking the Minister if he would not consider it to be better to have some type of appeals procedure within the nursing profession, within An Bord Altranais, before the person can take it to the High Court?  At the moment the person's only recourse is within two months to go publicly to the High Court, making a whole public issue of the question.  By all means it is important that the persons have that right eventually, but surely there should be a procedure in between whereby they can appeal against this allegation or against whatever has been put before them, within the nursing organisation without having to go publicly to the High Court as soon as somebody makes an allegation.  Whether the allegation is justified or not, whether the person is wrong or innocent, the mud will stick once that person has to go to the High Court.  I am asking the Minister if he will not allow some appeals procedure within An Bord Altranais before the matter is taken to the High Court to overcome a wrong ruling or decision by the board on an allegation made about unfitness to practise.</P>

      <P>I must admit that I had not noticed this point, but at first blush I think there is a good deal of substance in what Deputy Mac Giolla says.  Unless I have missed something here I do not understand why there was no reference in section 28 to the procedure provided for in Part V.  Even without that reference I would imagine that a court would interpret section 28 as being required to be construed in the light of Part V.  Even without an express provision I think that a court would take the line that since the Oireachtas has set up a fitness to practise committee, and since the criterion of fitness to practise was mentioned specifically in the section which empowers the board effectively to deprive someone of his or her livelihood, it must have been the intention of the Oireachtas that a decision in the first place as to fitness to practise should be taken by the special committee.  If that is Deputy Mac Giolla's point then probably he is right, but even without a reference in section 28 I imagine that that is how a court would look at it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I cannot understand why the matter should not be put beyond all doubt by the Minister, unless I have missed something. It would be as well if he would put a further subsection in to section 28 making it clear that the judgment of the board on the question of fitness to practise must depend on a finding of the committee to that effect.  Whether it is before the fitness to practise committee or before the board themselves, there is no doubt in the light of the whole string of decisions of the courts in the last 15 years or even more, that any procedure set up by the Oireachtas, even though it does not contain explicit provisions about how it is to be performed or conducted, must be conducted in accordance with the rules of natural justice.  That means that any allegation or threat or, in short, anything which either the board, the committee or anybody else have against the nurse must be communicated properly to her or him in advance and he or she must have a proper chance to understand what is being alleged against him or her, a proper chance to prepare a case in reply and a <Col N="360" /> proper chance to present that case.  There is no necessity to spell that out here because it is now well understood and I am sure the board which will emerge from this Bill will understand it.  If, for example, a board were to come to a conclusion about a nurse's fitness to practise without hearing the nurse, without explaining exactly what the board had against her, that proceeding on the board's part would be a complete nullity and undoubtedly the board would be certioraried by the nurse and would be obliged to pay her costs.  Subject to that, I would like to know why the Minister feels it is not necessary to include a reference to the fitness to practise committee in section 28.</P>
    <P>In the last intervention the Minister spoke about delay.  The fact that delay in registering a nurse, which could be very injurious to her, is not mentioned in this section does not mean that she is deprived of a remedy.  Any statutory body who fail to do their job with reasonable expedition, can be judicially compelled to do it by means of an order of <i>mandamus.</i> However, even though that is so, there would be a case for including in the procedure which the Minister has outlined in section 28 (6) as amended by his proposed amendment the possibility for an application to be made by a nurse whose application has been pending for, let us say, three months, six months, and who has not yet had a decision, to compel the board to reach a decision immediately.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly the Deputies have raised a very serious issue and the touchstone of our response must be, does the section operate in accordance with natural justice?  I would point out to Deputy Mac Giolla that where the board takes a decision not to register or to refuse to register the name of any person they must, in accordance with section 28 (5), communicate that decision. They must state precisely the reasons there for the decision and they must be extraordinarily careful in so doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A nurse may have worked abroad for many years and on her return to Ireland <Col N="361" /> may wish to apply for the first time for registration here, but may never have qualified in Ireland.  The board cannot be inhibited in inquiring, perhaps from another nursing registration board outside the country, as to her record.  If, for example, it is found that that nurse had been guilty of grave professional misconduct, the board would have to advise the applicant that, in their view, the assessment was such that it would not warrant registering her to engage in the practice of nursing in the Republic of Ireland. There is nothing to preclude the board from seeking the views of the Fitness to Practise Committee on that particular development.  It is stated that the board, or any person, may apply to the Fitness to Practise Board to make an inquiry into the fitness of a nurse to practise, on the grounds of alleged professional misconduct. They may well obtain information which would warrant a reference.  They would then come to a conclusion and communicate that to the applicant.</P>
    <P>There must be a provision, one way or the other, for a person starting to seek registration with the board.  There must also be an opportunity for the applicant to appeal to the High Court.  I do not know what else we could do to give basic protection to the applicant against any capricious decision on the part of the board.  A nurse may have been struck off the register in another country. That would have to be taken into account and advanced as a reason, if it is the reason, for refusal to register.  Other examples may be that a nurse may apply for registration and be entirely open for registration in the normal course of events but may have come into serious conflict with the law &mdash; for example on issues relating to drug addiction, to give a typical example. The board would have to judge, on a subjective basis, whether that warranted entitlement to, or disbarring from, registration.  One must be very careful about such assessments.  The board must exercise the power of registration and I should imagine that they would take very careful cognisance of the findings of the Fitness to Practise Committee of the board in arriving at such a decision.</P>

      <P>I did not see the significance of this at first but, according to the Minister's explanation, the whole matter appears to be unilateral until one arrives at an appeal to the High Court. That is rather extreme.  Surely there must be some machinery within the section which will allow the person being refused registration to appear before the board long before the matter comes to the High Court.  It is ridiculous that the only recourse of a rejected person is appeal to the High Court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Ormonde is quite right.  The point that the Minister was making and that I was trying to make myself is that, even though this is not explicity stated in the Bill, the law will impute a duty to the board to behave with natural justice. I listened to the Minister carefully, but he did not say something that I think he ought to have said, namely, that before the board make an adverse decision&mdash;certainly about somebody who already is in the profession&mdash; under ordinary law, even though it is not spelt out in the Bill, the board will be obliged to give that person notice of the fact that they propose to make an adverse order and give that person a chance to make her case. The courts treat these matters, even though it is not spelt out in the Act, by assuming that an authority set up by these Houses will respect natural justice but, even though that is so, the Minister would be wise to make a resolution now that whatever regulations the board make under section 26 will specifically include a procedure which will keep them right in matters like that. There have been many Irish cases, since the State was founded, on questions of natural justice. In the Law Reports alone there must be 60 or 70 and probably as many again which have not got into the Law Reports. Most of these cases happened, not because any authority were malignant, malicious, or deliberately trying to do somebody out of a livelihood but because, being lay people and not perhaps having a perception of what the law required of them, they took a shortcut, did what they, no doubt, thought was <Col N="363" /> fair but which did not measure up to the standards of what the law demands in terms of fairness.</P>
      <P>This board will consist of lay people in the legal sense and, to save them from pitfalls of this kind, I think the Minister should put it up to the board that their regulations should contain a procedure which will do as Deputy Ormonde advocates, namely give people a chance, at any rate in the case of those already in the profession, to be advised of what is held against them before decisions not to register them are made.</P>
      <P>In the case of a brand new applicant, I am not so sure that the same would be true.  For example, if I were to have a brain storm and apply for registration as a nurse, the board would presumably be within their rights in refusing me and, as my application would be patently unfounded, I do not think that it would be obliged to give me a hearing.  However, people in the profession who have fallen out of it or above whose heads hangs a question mark in the ways which the Minister instanced must be told, before an adverse decision is made, what the board have against them and not be left only with the remedy of applying afterwards to the High Court.</P>

      <P>Refusal to register somebody is just the same as taking somebody off the register.  If it is those persons' livelihoods; they are unable to practise their profession.  A whole procedure has been set up for removing somebody from the register but there are only a few words on refusal to register.  The Minister should incorporate in subsection 4, 5 and 6 that this be done under the procedures outlined in Part V, or some simple wording like that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is also another aspect which I happen to have noticed.  In the procedure of the Fitness to Practise Committee there is a specific subsection setting out that they must maintain confidentiality, that the findings may not be made public without the consent of the person.  There is nothing in this subsection to say that the board may not make their findings <Col N="364" /> public without the consent of the person. There are a number of protections outlined in Part V which are not incorporated in the procedure outlined here.  I hope some wording can be formulated to remedy this.  I would not know the legal way to phrase it.</P>
    <P>The Minister has said there is nothing to preclude the board from consulting the Fitness to Practise Committee, which is quite true. Probably most reasonable boards would feel like doing that.  On the other hand, there is nothing to compel them to consult the Fitness to Practise Committee before taking their decision. There is nothing to compel them to maintain the procedures set out in Part V in regard to confidentiality and various other aspects.  I would hope that the Minister would insert that wording here, that the same procedure would have to be adopted in refusing to enter somebody on the register as is adopted for removing somebody from the register, that the Fitness to Practise committee procedure etc. be adopted.</P>
    <P>The other point I raised already is in regard to having some type of appeals procedure or method of discussing a case without a person immediately having to go to the High Court, which is the only recourse open to them here.  That is most unfair to the individual and constitues a very costly procedure for the individual and the board, which may eventually be necessary, but which should constitute their last resort only.  There should be some procedure in between which would allow them to have their case thrashed out, discussed, possibly having their union representative present in order to resolve it within the board's structures rather than having to go to the public High Court where there is no confidentiality. Once one goes there everything is publicised.  It is most important under the provisions of this section that the procedure be constrained by those contained in Part V.  Also there should be some method by which an applicant can go back to the board with their union representative, or for that matter their <Col N="365" /> solicitor, whoever they wish to have present with them, to appeal the decision taken.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputies who have spoken on this section.  I do not understand why it is necessary to remove this function from the Fitness to Practise Committee.  Under section 13 there is an obligation on the board to set up a Fitness to Practise Committee, which committee presumably will develop a certain amount of experience in dealing with cases for removal from the register.  Surely the same procedure should be followed where somebody applies for entry on the register and when the board wish to refuse them?</P>
      <P>Under the provisions of section 39 &mdash; where there is an application for removal of a name &mdash; the CEO of the board is obliged to write to that person notifying them that a hearing will be held, the reason for the application to have their name removed, informing them that they are entitled to be present at that hearing and, if they so desire, to be represented by another party.  I do not see any reason under the provisions of this section that the whole authority in deciding whether an application should be accepted for registration should not be vested in the Fitness to Practise Committee initially, that they would take the decision and convey it to the board.</P>
      <P>The Minister spoke earlier, in regard to subsection (5), of the urgency implied in the word &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;.  If one is notifying somebody of something as fundamental as their right to practise their profession there should be a specified time written in.  The Minister did say that the board might find it necessary to investigate a person's record, for example, that of a person who had worked abroad.  But surely that is giving the board power to delay conveying such a decision to the applicant?  I believe that a specified time should be written in.  If it has to be a reasonable time, so be it, but I do not think we should leave that subsection in such a form that there could be a long delay or certainly one longer than is necessary.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say a few words about the appeals procedure. Under the provisions here the position will be that a decision will be conveyed which will take account of the fact that one is not being registered, when the appeals procedure is then open to one. In regard to many other boards or bodies in the country, there is, if you like, a middle appeal body or court.  A person, having received a letter notifying them of the decision taken that they will not be registered has one course of action only open to them after that, which is that to be taken in the High Court which we know can be a lengthy procedure.  Could there not be some middle ground in regard to appeals, whether through the Fitness to Practise Committee or some type of tribunal with a representative body, when a person would be afforded an opportunity of discussing their case at that level, of having it explained to them, when they could be furnished with additional information in relation to that decision and reasons given for that decision having been taken.  A bland letter being issued is insufficient for a person who is being told that a decision has been taken to deprive them of their livelihood and that they cannot glean any further information until they institute court proceedings. I hope boards will take that decision as a last resort only.  Unfortunately, however, in these times, there will be cases of persons being unable to be registered.  Such a middle ground in regard to appeals might save much time, trouble and expense, when any such decision could be evaluated by the applicant. We know from experiences in other walks of life, even, say, in the case of a simple planning appeal, that reasons given are often not understood and applicants go back and question them.  However, one must join the queue for the High court in order to glean a little more information. While presumably the board will exercise great care and discretion before reaching such a decision, possibly it will happen that the reasons for that decision given on the notice will not be fully explained or developed to an extent that the applicant <Col N="367" /> can understand, when their only recourse then is to the High Court.</P>
      <P>I know of a number of bodies, including the law society, where there is some disciplinary committee or tribunal to which a person can resort to have their case further explained, when they may then be convinced that they should take their case further to the High Court.  On the other hand, if they are not so convinced, it may save them much trouble, time and expense, if and when the worst has come about and their livelihood is about to be removed from them.</P>

      <P>I should like to support the views of various Deputies on this section, particularly that the nurses concerned should have the right to make their cases before the board reaches any decision.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon in his amendments to section 30 suggests that instead of saying &ldquo;Whenever the board takes any action&rdquo; should be changed to read &ldquo;Before the board takes any action&rdquo;, which more or less makes the point.  If those amendments are adopted then I take it we could assume that such would afford a nurse the right to present his or her case before a decision was taken by the board.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I might make a general point first, that is that strictly speaking under the provisions of this section a person does not receive the protection of the Bill until they are registered.  A person is not a nurse until the person is registered as a nurse.  We are talking basically about persons who apply.  On seeking information about the person seeking registration, where the board comes into the possession of information which suggests that the person might be unfit, most likely they will seek the view of the Fitness to Practise Committee for a general opinion.  It is important to bear in mind that the Fitness to Practise Committee proposal relates to existing registered nurses, nurses who are registered and practising.  The committee would not have a formal function under section 28 (4).  They deal only with registered <Col N="368" /> nurses.  Section 28 (4) deals with refusing to register for the first time for reasons which would be stated and would have to be stated.</P>
      <P>The point made by Deputy Kelly applies to the rules for registration.  These rules will have to be approved by me or by the Minister of the day.  It would be wise and sensible to incorporate in those rules a provision that the person would be informed in advance of the intention of the board not to register.  Persons would be given an opportunity to make any submissions they might wish to make directly to the board.</P>
      <P>Unquestionably it would be a breach of natural justice not to so do.  It did not take a former Garda commissioner to prove that to the legislators of the day. One has to be extraordinarily careful about such developments.  In relation to the rules under sections 28 and 26 I would insist that the board should set out that procedure.  I am reluctant to put a formal time limit on the work &ldquo;forthwith&rdquo;.  It may be necessary for the board to make inquiries.  They may have to write to a registration board in Australia or some other country asking for information. There may be a gap in an application. Frequently detailed inquiries would have to be made.</P>
      <P>The board would have to maintain a substantial degree of confidentiality and, in contacting other parties, the degree of that confidentiality might be reduced.  In seeking information they may have difficulty in giving absolute protection to the question of confidentiality.  In publishing or making letters available, or communications which are defamatory, the board could be in dire trouble.  They would be in dire trouble if they made allegations against a person as grounds for unfitness to engage in the practice of nursing and for registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The suggestion that we should incorporate particular procedures in the rules is a very good suggestion.  I do not think it is possible to lay it all down formally in a fitness to practise committee structure within the framework of the Bill.  The rules for registration can provide for that. I would be prepared to do that and to <Col N="369" /> give that assurance to the House.  For example, there could be prior notification of the intention not to register and then to seek submissions.  We would have to do that anyway.</P>
    <P>I cannot see us departing from the role of the High Court.  There must be the prospect of an appeal.  I have often wondered about other professions where committees take decisions not to issue a membership card.  The right of appeal under trade union rules frequently is very circumscribed.  This is a statutory body and, as such, we would have to expect a very exceptional level of concern that people would not have their professional entitlements withdrawn from them. Great care would have to be exercised.  I have no doubt that the board will do that.</P>
    <P>The rules to be drawn up will lay down that structure with considerable precision. It is not possible to have massive insertions of new procedures in the Bill on the basis of registration.  We have put in the fundamental protections.  A decision must be made.  It must be in writing, and it must be communicated to the applicant.  That must be done forthwith. The reasons must be stated and there is the option of going to the High Court within two months to get that decision reversed.  That is a fairly comprehensive protection but, under the rules, it may require further development.</P>

      <P>I accept that the Minister may not wish to insert into section 28 the comprehensive procedures which appear in section 39 of the Bill.  It is stated in section 39 that the board or any person may apply to the Fitness to Practise Committee for an inquiry into the fitness of a nurse to practise nursing on the grounds of alleged professional misconduct or alleged fitness to engage in such practice by reason of physical or mental disability. It does not state that it must be a nurse whose name is already on the register.  In the first part of subsection (1) there is no reason why the Fitness to Practise Committee should not investigate or inquire into whether a person should be registered.  I would accept that in section 39, dealing with the penalties which may <Col N="370" /> be imposed by the board, there could be a dificulty.  I do not see any reason why the Minister could not amend section 39 to give the board power to censure, or admonish, or attach conditions, or to refuse to register a person after investigation by the committee.</P>

      <P>I endorse what Deputy O'Hanlon has said.  I am glad the Minister made the point that the person would be advised in advance.  People can then go before the board and presumably have somebody with them if they wish, go through the whole case, hear what the board have to say, and make their reply. That is good.</P>
      <P>A range of things is outlined in Part V. Unfitness to practise can be on professional grounds.  It can also be on social grounds.  The person may be cohabiting with someone else or may be divorced. Unfitness to practise can also be on physical grounds or there can be an incapacity which is referred to in section 39.  Procedures are outlined in section 39 in regard to physical or mental incapacity.</P>
      <P>Those procedures do not come into this section.  That is what we are saying.  I do not think the Minister's reply was satisfactory when he said the procedures begin to operate only when the person is actually registered.  Registration is a very important part of the whole procedure. Some people may succeed in becoming registered but there may be many who would not be registered in the beginning who should not be excluded from the fairly tight procedures provided in section 39.  I do not see why the Minister would not introduce a simple amendment.  The reasons for striking people from the register will be professional misconduct or physical or mental incapacity.  The same procedure should be followed in relation to refusal to put people on the register. It would satisfy Deputies if procedures under this section were directly related to those in section 39.</P>

      <P>It would be extremely difficult.  In this section we deal with a person who is not a registered nurse, a person with certain educational qualifications which would enable him or her to become eligible for application for registration.  He or she might be registered in another country but might not be qualified here because we would not recognise the qualifications in the other country.  The board would inquire into the professional qualifications of the applicant for registration and decide whether the person was entitled to be registered.  Section 39 relates exclusively to people who have been registered.</P>
      <P>However, I will have a look at the matter between now and Report Stage. The assurances I have given of fairly rigorous procedures in relation to registration as a nurse will be implemented by the incorporation of these procedures in the Bill, so it will not be necessary to have a formal revision of the Bill.  If applicants for registration are turned down it will be in accordance with criteria.  People may be qualified in another country but we may not recognise those qualifications. It would be a matter for subjective professional assessment by the board, and in relation to applicants from EC countries the matter would be subject to EC law.</P>

      <P>Applications from people in other EC countries will be subject to directives which the EC have adopted.  We may have qualifications which may not be recognised elsewhere, particularly in relation to particular specialities.  Therefore, there is a wide variety of circumstances which would not warrant the registration of the person in the Republic and it is not possible to lay them all down.  Deputy Kelly's proposal is a good one and I think we should incorporate the safeguards he suggested <Col N="372" /> in the procedures.  I would be prepared to do that.</P>
      <P>If the board turn down an application for registration because they are not satisfied, the applicant can go to the High Court, and there all the papers would have to be presented.  Consequently, everybody would have to be especially careful.  The High Court application is the only way, finally, to arbitrate.</P>

      <P>The Minister has been missing our point completely, I trust not deliberately.  He has been talking about new applicants and about applicants from abroad who have completed their education.  In fact, no nurse is registered yet.  Once the Bill is passed all nurses, the 20,000 people involved in the nursing profession, must register.  We are not talking about one or two people coming from abroad but the registration of all nurses in the State.  The board can refuse to register any of the nurses.</P>

      <P>Under the Bill the board can refuse to register the name of any person who is otherwise entitled to be registered on the grounds of the unfitness of that person to engage in the practice of nursing.  It is wide open to the board to refuse to register any person. Nurses from the start should have the full protection of the provisions in Part V, together with any further amendments the House may wish to make to section 39.  I cannot understand why the Minister is digging his heels in so much on this. What is he protesting about?  What is the difficulty about saying that the registration should be done in the same way as suggested under Part V?  I do not see any <Col N="373" /> difficulty about that.  I accept that the people concerned will be advised in advance and can argue their case before the board.  That is a good thing.  Nurses should have the benefit of the procedures outlined in other parts of the Bill to protect them in regard to registration.  It may be that the board may not wish to register a person who has been nursing for years and that person can be refused registration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  I am talking about new applicants, persons applying <i>de novom.</i> The new board will lay down examinations and qualifications needed by people to be registered as nurses.  If a person does not have the required qualifications that person will not be registered. That is the main purport of the section and I do not think any Member can assume anything else.  I do not think one should extend fitness to practise procedures to fitness for registration.  If a board <Col N="374" /> lays down basic qualifications for registration it cannot stray away from them and adopt arbitrary qualifications as it goes along.  The board will lay down the required qualifications before certification. If a board laid down a whole series of other qualifications that would become obvious very quickly and be open to ministerial intervention.</P>
      <P>The High Court will not allow any board of whatever composition to capriciously change its qualifications as it goes along.  They will be set down for a specified period.  I do not think there will be a massive problem in that regard.</P>
      <P>I should like to point out to Deputy Ormonde that members of the fitness to practise committee are members of the board and, as such, will be laying down qualifications for entry in the register.  I undertake to have a look at this matter between now and Report Stage but the fears of Deputies are unnecessary.  The protection I proposed to give in the rules to be followed will be comprehensive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a certain substance, even if it is only a verbal substance, in Deputy Mac Giolla's case.  As I understand it, his point is that, while subsection (3) states that every person shall be registered in the register, the following subsection states that nothing in this section shall operate to prevent the board from refusing to register the name of any person, who is otherwise entitled to be registered, including those entitled under subsection (3), on the grounds of the unfitness of that person to engage in the practice of nursing.  An answer to Deputy Mac Giolla&mdash;it might not be an adequate one&mdash;is that there is no likelihood of the board being faced with what otherwise would be the automatic operation of subsection (3) doing a fine comb operation on 20,000 nurses to see if it could discover personal unfitness in any of them.  I do not think that is what the Bill intends or that the Minister intends it.  At the same time there is a certain verbal substance in Deputy Mac Giolla's point.  The sequence of the subsection suggests, with particular reference to subsection (3), that the operation of that subsection, <Col N="375" /> which otherwise would be automatic, is made subject to the capacity of the board to refuse to register a nurse even though she had been on a previous register.</P>
      <P>The unclarity could be avoided if the Minister made a small amendment to subsection (3) to clear up this point.  Is it intended that the operation of subsection (3) should be automatic?  Is it intended that the words &ldquo;shall be registered in the register&rdquo; means that any nurse maintained on the register under the 1950 Act will go straight to the new register by operation of law or does it mean that the board is under a qualified obligation to register the nurse, qualified only by its permission under subsection (4)?  It seems to me that the wording of subsection (3) leaves both interpretations open. If the Minister was to make it clear that the intention in subsection (3) was that the registration was to be automatic and by operation of law without any interposition of the board's activities then the reason for Deputy Mac Giolla's concern would disappear.  If, on the other hand, subsection (3) means that the board is required to register every nurse, that it is through the instrumentality, even if only a notional one, of the board that the nurses registered in the new register, then he has a point.  I do not think there is a lot. of substance in it in reality because I do not expect that the board will fine comb 20,000 persons. However, I believe that is the substance of Deputy Mac Giolla's point and the Minister could clear it up by a small change in subsection (3).</P>

      <P>Do the Department feel obliged to omit from section 29 a similar provision to that in section 28?  It seems that a nurse who is a national in another member state is entitled to be registered and so avoid the personal fitness hurdle. There does not appeart to be any provision for subjecting foreigners to the personal fitness test to which our nurses are being subjected.  I hope I have not misread that.  It appears that there is at least a strong case for including in section 29 a subsection similar to section 28 (4).</P>

      <P>This arises in the context of initial registration.  The board have an entitlement to determine fitness to practise.  For example, if an individual from a member state had the desired qualifications he or she would have to make application to An Bord Altranais for registration.  That board would and could be empowered under their prescribed registration procedure to make inquiries to the member state and, on obtaining the information, may decide not to register that nurse.  The board would still have that residual power but it would have to be exercised under Community law or Deputy Kelly and Senator Robinson would make us the topic of conversation at breakfast tables all over Europe.  The national of the Irish Republic would be on a par with the citizen of the member state.  I gather this is a <Col N="378" /> standard section in relation to registration of professional bodies and we do not have much option.  I cannot qualify this any further.</P>

If the board hear that she has a string of convictions I cannot see where it is made explicit in section 29 that the board can decline to register her whereas with the bringing up to date of the register in the case of Irish nurses, that would be a black mark and the board would be entitled to refuse to register her on grounds of personal unfitness.  Perhaps I have overlooked something, but I am not sure if foreigners should be put in a situation of privilege compared with Irish citizens.</P>

    <P>Arising out of the discussion on section 28, the need for such an amendment becomes more obvious.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that where it is proposed to remove a person's name from the register that such person should be notified in writing before that action is taken.  I know section 30 (1) gives various examples of persons whose names would be removed from the register and, presumably, they will have been before the Fitness to Practise Committee.  The section also deals with the registration of names in the register but, for the safety of the nurse whose livelihood is at stake, every safeguard should be taken and, rather than wait until after a change is made in the register, the person should be notified before such change is made. If the amendment is accepted, the next amendment in my name is to insert the words &ldquo;proposed to be&rdquo; after &ldquo;actions&rdquo;.</P>

However, in relation to this, how often does the Minister envisage this happening? An outdated register is not much use to the board, the profession or to hospitals.

      <P>As Deputies are aware, this section obliges the board to ensure that the register is kept in a correct and proper manner.  There have been some inquiries about the meaning of verbal and clerical errors.  They are as stated in section 1.  Verbal errors may be interpreted as those which are recorded on foot of incorrect verbal or written information supplied and clerical errors occur when correct information is incorrectly recorded.  We have taken cognisance of those two prospects but I regret that I am unable to accept the amendment suggested by Deputy O'Hanlon because the use of the word &ldquo;whenever&rdquo; would leave it to the board's discretion to notify the person either before or after they take any action to correct the register. For example, where an entry is procured by fraud or misrepresentation, it is incumbent on the board to correct the register as a matter of urgency.  Such a person would, in any event, be notified under section 50 of intention to prosecute. Immediate action would be required in that regard because there could be serious medico social and legal problems arising in such cases.  For these reasons, I am reluctant to accept the amendment suggested by Deputy O'Hanlon because the particular requirements are very rigid.  Keeping the register correct will be enormously facilitated by the retention situation and it is of the utmost importance that we have an up to date, correct as possible, register in existence at all times.  Therefore, I do not propose to accept the two amendments as they would substantially weaken the section.</P>

However, this is a very important section in that it can result in a unilateral decision to have someone erased from the register.  Our amendment should be taken in that context.  We are asking that the person concerned has some recourse to the board before a decision is made. We talked about unilateral action in relation to section 28 and it applies here also. <Col N="381" /> This section can result in erasure from the board and, because of that, it is important that a person should have recourse to the board before a decision is taken.

      <P>Having one's name on the register is of fundamental importance to the practice of their profession.  It is possible that a name might be removed through an error on the part of the board. I cannot see any reason why the Minister will not accept our amendment and notify persons that it is intended to remove their name from the register within 21 days unless the board hears from them to the contrary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the board hears from someone that a nurse has died they will remove the name from the register and notify the next of kin. Having done that they could find out that the person in question had not died.  What safeguard is there to ensure that the board would be correct in assuming that a nurse had died? If the Minister accepted our amendment the board could inform the next of kin that <Col N="382" /> the name would be erased from the register within 21 days.  If a mistake was made the person could then write to the board and point that out.  That would be a safeguard to protect the interest of nurses.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The only basis on which a name would be erased from a register is in the event of death or in the case of fraud or misrepresentation.  Fraud and misrepresentation are clearly defined in section 50 and there is the prospect of immediate prosecution.  If a person has fraudulently succeeded in getting their name put on the register the quicker they are taken off the register the better rather than waiting to take them to court.  The board would be loath to initiate a prosecution unless it was clearly evident that fraud or misrepresentation had taken place.</P>
      <P>As regards the compilation of the register, people are notoriously slow about replying and one could be writing to people <i>ad nauseam.</i> They do not notify a change of address and if the board writes to a person and receives the letter back marked &ldquo;not known at this address&rdquo; they could not change the register.  Health boards and hospitals keep up to date information regarding the addresses of their staff.  In that way the board could obtain the correct address and write to the person to tell them that they have not sent in their correct address to the board. People are notorious as regards their personal administration and keeping themselves, one might say, alive professionally.  That is why the section is there.  It has no other purpose.  The board will keep writing to people until they find out where they are, otherwise an up to date register could not be kept.  I am sure the records will be computerised and I envisage warnings being issued to people to alert them that they cannot be contacted at the address which they gave to the board.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Minister that section 30 is very confined. It mentions the various instances in which a name can be removed from the register. The board can remove from the register <Col N="383" /> the names of persons whose deaths have been notified or come to the knowledge of the board.  If somebody reads of a death in the newspaper column will that be accepted as coming to the knowledge of the board? What I propose would not increase the workload of the board because they are obliged to notify the next of kin after taking the action.  I am suggesting that they notify them before taking the action to say that action will be taken within 21 days.</P>
      <P>The Minister does not appreciate the importance to a professional person of maintaining their name on the register. We must put as many safeguards as possible into the Bill to ensure that names will not be erased incorrectly from the register.  I see no reason why the Minister cannot accept this amendment.</P>

      <P>I have strong reservations about the matter.  Surely it is not suggested that where the board becomes aware that fraud or misrepresentation has been perpetrated, the board should write to the person? If one wants to refer a matter to the DPP one keeps one's mouth shut and one compiles all the necessary information.  In the case of the board discovering a fraud or misrepresentation they will take action first and then proceed to prosecute.  The DPP will take it from there.  With due respect to the medical profession, people who are not doctors have performed operations. Under the medical and dentistry Acts there is such a provision whereby a name can be summarily withdrawn from the register.</P>
      <P>I will have a look at it before Report Stage but I have some doubts about it particularly in cases of fraud and misrepresentation. They are serious charges. The board might be preparing an action against someone and that person could continue to practise for a few months.</P>

      <P>I agree with the amendment put forward by Deputy O'Hanlon.  The Minister is referring to fraud as if a person had embezzled money or done something of that kind.  What is involved is that the person procured his representation by fraudulent methods. The person has not forged any cheques or committed all kinds of fraud.  Once the board have evidence of fraud or misrepresentation and it is discovered, I do not see why it cannot tell the person that and tell them that the board intend to strike him off the register.  In all of this the Minister is assuming that the board will act in the most reasonable and sensible manner but if every board or every manager or trade union official acted in the most sensible and reasonable manner, we would not have any problems, industrial or otherwise.  We must assume that some board at some stage, as can be the case of a Minister or Deputy, for instance, will not act in the most reasonable fashion. That is why we must provide in legislation for the protection of people against these types of possibilities.  Consequently, I would have expected the Minister to accept the amendment immediately.  I do not follow his point regarding fraud or misrepresentation.  What we are talking about is merely procuring registration by fraudulent methods or by misrepresentation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <P>Fraudulent misrepresentation in this context means basically the use of the titles, &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; or &ldquo;midwife&rdquo; without the person concerned being qualified in that respect.  We all know that can happen even with the best possible organised structure.  We have all heard of cases of people wearing nursing <Col N="385" /> badges purporting to indicate qualification in another country when they have never been qualified.  There are people who would go to any lengths in terms of making false declarations or misrepresentation for the purpose of obtaining registration.</P>
      <P>All we are providing in this section is that where the board become aware of such circumstances, they are empowered to remove from their register the entry concerned.  My problem with Deputy O'Hanlon's amendment is that where that action is contemplated it is proposed that the person be given advance notification. That is not provided for in the Medical Practitioners Act or in the legislation dealing with dentists, so I do not see why we should place the nursing profession at a lesser advantage.</P>

      <P>I cannot envisage how An Bord Altranais would come to such a decision.  Would ordinary justice not dictate that a person would be notified that his professional registration was to be taken from him and that he be given the reasons for that action? I do not follow the Minister's argument about fraud and about the danger of someone absconding.  In referring to fraud he drew an analogy with the medical profession but what he had in mind were people who were not qualified.  These would not have been on the medical register in the first place.  Consequently, the removal of their names would not arise.  Likewise, the question of someone donning a nurse's uniform and purporting to be a nurse would not arise within the terms of the Bill because such a person would not be on the register.  I could not envisage the board striking a person's name from the register without giving that person any opportunity of proving that he was properly qualified.  From what the Minister has said I am more convinced now of the need for the amendment.</P>

      <P>I will consider the amendment between now and Report Stage but I do not accept the arguments being put forward.  Section 50 has been <Col N="386" /> carefully drafted.  We are talking about a situation in which a person might use the title, &ldquo;nurse&rdquo;, thereby implying that she was registered as a nurse without having been qualified.  I have come across that sort of situation in a nursing home.  In that context the board should be given power to determine whether a person was registered on the basis of fraud or misrepresentation and, also, to remove the person's name from the register.  It is not our intention to impose some kind of penalty as a result of an error on the part of the board because to do that would lead immediately to the board finding themselves in trouble, but where it is evident that a name should not be on the register, whether because the registration was obtained by fraud or misrepresentation or because a person had died in the meantime, the board should have the right to remove that name.  I think any court interpretation of such an issue would be on those lines.  However, I will consider the matter before Report Stage with a view to ascertaining whether there are any separate circumstances which require attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Section 50 refers to persons who were never registered but in section 30 we are referring to persons who have been through the rigorous procedure of having their names entered on the register.  We spent a good deal of time on section 28 debating the various powers the board have in reaching a decision as to whether a person should be registered. We are talking now about removing from the register the name of a person who has gone through the procedure of being registered.  In those circumstances ordinary justice would dictate that the person be notified in advance.  Apart from the various reasons outlined in section 30, I have in mind in particular the board receiving knowledge that someone had died when that was not the case.  Acceptance of the amendment would neither be lessening the power of the board nor doing any injustice to the nursing profession. It is merely a further safeguard to <Col N="387" /> ensure that a person's professional standing would not be taken from him because of error.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will give an extreme analogy here.  If for the sake of argument an employee of the board accepted a bribe to register somebody wrongly and issued a certificate, the board on discovery of that should have automatic entitlement to act there and then to remove the person.  No matter how careful the procedures of registration are that sort of thing can happen.  In the medical profession in America where there are all sorts of protective devices in the health insurance schemes because of the prospects of litigation there is no end to the chancers who will get a registration.  There will always be the one person who will beat the system.  In that situation it can be of critical importance that the person be removed straightaway.  If a person is fooling the system under that section the board will have to have manifest evidence and will have to refer the matter immediately to the DPP and prosecute and remove him.  This might well be somebody who is installed in a hospital, a health agency or a nursing home purporting to practice as a nurse.  What does one do? Do we send him a nice letter saying that it has come to our attention that he is not who he purports to be? The person would disappear overnight.  He might be wanted by the Garda for malpractice in terms of activities which could have resulted in the death or injury of patients. That would give the person an alert so that he could disappear.  Admittedly I am giving ultra extreme cases, but operations have taken place in Ireland by people who represented themselves to be doctors but who were not doctors.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>No, but they managed to have documentation and certification saying that they were doctors.  It is not unknown for people who are not nurses to wear nurses badges.  I see the point the Deputy is making in terms of <Col N="388" /> the need to counter-balance any prospect of injustice to people.  At the moment I would have great difficulty in accepting the amendment as it stands but between now and Report Stage we will discuss it to see if we can resolve the issue.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In effect what the Minister is doing is justifying a power to the board to erase the name of somebody at short notice in the interests of the public and the nursing profession generally. I accept that in an extreme case it might be necessary to ensure that a person might not practise as a nurse but if what the Minister is saying on this section is justified surely he cannot accept Part V of the Bill at all, where there is rigorous and complex procedure for erasing a name following allegations of professional misconduct.  Surely what the Minister is saying in relation to section 30 would have to apply in relation to section 39.  If somebody was guilty of serious professional misconduct the Minister is saying that that person's name should be erased immediately to protect the public and the nursing profession, but that is not the case according to this Bill because in it there is a very elaborate procedure whereby the rights of every person whose name is on the register will be protected. Surely if a person is practising as a nurse and since that person has his or her name on the register by fraud or otherwise, there are other procedures whereby he or she may be dealt with.  Such people could be suspended from duty and possibly court proceedings could follow.  If we accept what the Minister is now saying in relation to section 30, it would be even more important where there were allegations of professional misconduct and where the board were satisfied that these could be substantiated without the elaborate investigation under section 39.  It is a very dangerous area.  It is necessary to include that safeguard to ensure that names would not be erased very rapidly in error.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>This section is of fundamental importance.  I will read it out because of its importance.</P>
      <P>The Board may, with the consent of the Minister, or shall, whenever the Minister so requests, register in a register maintained for that purpose, the names of persons who are engaged in a profession or calling which is ancillary to nursing, and the provisions of this Act, subject to such modifications as may be specified in rules made by the Board, with the approval of the Minister, shall apply to any such registration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The board will have the power to register persons who are not nurses and the Minister will have the power to direct the board to register persons who are not fully qualified nurses.  We consider it fundamental that a register of nurses should only contain the names of fully qualified nurses.  In various professions registers only contain the names of fully qualified members of the profession.  For instance, the General Nursing Council in the UK say that a profession cannot be defined by any one of its several features, that its practise needs to be based on a recognised body of learning and an independent organisation must be responsible for its development and control and that admission to a profession is based on standards of competence attested by examinations and attested by experience.  To register persons who are not fully qualified nurses would cause chaos in the profession. There are ancillary grades of nursing who <Col N="390" /> make a very valuable contribution to the care of persons.  UK state-enrolled nurses are not recognised as being fully qualified by the health services here, nonetheless some of them are employed and make a valuable contribution to the care of patients.  If the Minister believes, as he has said in this House as far back as February 1983, that ancillary professions should have their own registration body, I support him fully but the ancillary professions should not be registered in a register for nurses.  We feel very strongly that only fully qualified nurses should be in a nurses register.  It is a fundamental principle of all professions that there can be only one standard of qualification for that profession.  We oppose this section with vigour.  The Minister should delete that section altogether in the interests of the general public and of the nursing profession.</P>

      <P>It has been the policy of all Governments for a considerable time now not to take part in any alliances.  It has also been the policy of all Governments, when matters relating to defence or military security outside economics security are discussed in the Council of Ministers in Europe, that we do not take part in those discussions because we would consider that to be in breach of our neutrality.  It is also our policy not to join the Western European Union.  That has been subscribed to by all Governments over the last 30 years.  If a debate was to take place on this matter in this House and if the decision of the House was that we should take part in such discussions, then it would be a matter for the Government of the day to implement that decision of this House. But such a debate has not yet taken place here.  Therefore I do not feel free to comment one way or the other as to whether we should or should not take part in the debate.</P>

      <P>This country has long supported and worked for a convention to outlaw chemical weapons.  When I addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations on behalf of the Ten member states of the European Community on 25 September of last year, I said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Ten will continue to support realistic and concrete disarmament <Col N="397" /> efforts at the sole multilateral negotiating body &mdash; the Geneva Conference on Disarmament.  We attach particular importance to the successful conclusion of negotiations taking place at the conference on a convention to prohibit chemical weapons.  Member states of the European Community have contributed actively to this work.  In this connection we welcome positive developments which have taken place this year: the United States has tabled a draft convention to outlaw these weapons and the Soviet Union has accepted the principle of on-site inspection of destruction of stocks of chemical weapons.  Although important differences remain to be resolved, the Ten hope that it will be possible to move towards the conclusion at an early date of a convention to eliminate chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>In referring, in the course of the same statement, to the use of chemical weapons in the conflict between Iran and Iraq, I said the following:</P>
    <P>Of particular concern was the report in March of this year by an expert team dispatched by the Secretary-General which ascertained that chemical weapons had been used in areas inspected in Iran.  The Ten condemn without qualification any use of chemical weapons and earnestly hope that they will not be used again in this or any other conflict.</P>
    <P>Following the use of chemical weapons in the war between Iran and Iraq, all Ten member states of the European Community have taken measures to control the export of certain chemical substances which could be used for the production of chemical weapons.</P>

      <P>Ireland is a party to the 1972 Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, Production and Stockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxic Weapons and on their Destruction. We participated in the First Review Conference of the States Parties to the Convention in March 1980.  We have consistently supported the absolute and universal prohibition of the use of these weapons.</P>
      <P>Ireland has supported efforts at the United Nations towards the improvement of the complaints procedure provided for under the convention.  The complaints procedure provided for under the convention operates through the United Nations Security Council and is subject to the Security Council's voting procedures.  We, together with Sweden, Austria, Columbia, Mexico, Pakistan, Uruguay and Yugoslavia, co-sponsored a United Nations Resolution adopted by majority vote in 1982 which sought to have a special conference convened to establish a flexible, objective and nondiscriminatory procedure to deal with issues concerning compliance with the convention.  This initiative was opposed by the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries and it has not so far proved possible to secure agreement to the convening of a special conference.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>Successive Irish Governments have voiced their concern at the dangers inherent in the continued growth of armaments, both nuclear and conventional.  The Government see reliance on nuclear weapons as a poor foundation for maintaining international peace and security.</P>
      <P>The Government are committed to working, through practical steps, towards the goal of general and complete disarmament which the United Nations General Assembly adopted in 1961 as a desirable one.  They consider that it is in the interest of the international community to do everything possible to move towards this goal.</P>
      <P>Ireland, like those other countries in Europe which are outside military alliances, is neither directly nor indirectly involved in the negotiations between the Soviet Union and the US, suspended at the end of last year, on intermediate-range and strategic nuclear forces.  Nonetheless, this country has an evident interest in seeing negotiations on these weapons resumed and brought to a successful conclusion.  As Minister for Foreign Affairs, therefore, I have urged not only that these negotiations be resumed but that negotiations be initiated with a view to effectively averting the danger of an arms race in outer space.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For that reason, the Government welcome the outcome of the recent meeting in Geneva between US Secretary of State Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko at which the two sides agreed that the objective of the forthcoming US/Soviet negotiations on nuclear and <Col N="401" /> space arms would be &ldquo;to work out effective agreements aimed at preventing an arms race in outer space and terminating it on earth, at limiting and reducing arms, and at strengthening strategic stability.&rdquo; They hope that these negotiations will bring agreement not alone on controlling the growth of nuclear arms but on substantial reductions of nuclear weapons to the lowest possible level.</P>
    <P>In this regard the Government welcome the aspiration in the joint statement issued after the meeting that &ldquo;the sides believe that ultimately the forthcoming negotiations, just as efforts in general to limit and reduce arms, should lead to the complete elimination of nuclear arms everywhere.&rdquo;  These sentiments have been repeated this week by President Reagan in his inaugural address.  They represent a welcome re-statement of American aims.</P>
    <P>If they are seriously to set about controlling and substantially reducing nuclear weapons, nuclear weapon states, in our view, must make efforts to cease refining and upgrading the elements which make up these weapons.  It is this reasoning which has led the Government to support calls made at the United Nations for a comprehensive approach to halting and reversing the growth of nuclear weapons including the testing, production and deployment of these weapons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>May I ask the Minister two questions?  Is the Minister aware that in the known, declared nuclear arsenal held by the two major super powers there is the equivalent of three tonnes of TNT per man, woman and child on the face of this planet?  Is he aware that in the known arsenal that is the figure?  In view of the incident in Scandinavia when a Russian weapon was set off by &ldquo;accident&rdquo;, and in view of the reported weapon or some form of missile in Donegal last year, is the Minister concerned that this very large arsenal of nuclear weapons can be controlled by computer? Is he concerned about the accidental dangers of such control?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On every occasion on which I have spoken on this subject I have referred to the fact that both nuclear states possess sufficient weapons on each side to eliminate the world ten times over.  This is a cause of grave concern not only to this Government but to peace loving people all over the world and peace loving people in both countries concerned.  That is why I very much welcome the meeting which took place early this month in Geneva between the American Foreign Secretary and the Soviet Foreign Minister.  I would welcome and encourage anything that can be done to enable the two super powers to talk seriously about lowering the level of arms which they hold and eliminating nuclear weapons entirely.  I would welcome and encourage that and I will do anything I can to see that other people do the same.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister share my concern about the lack of control which the super powers are exercising and the accidental dangers there may be because of the way these weapons are controlled?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be very concerned if what the Deputy says is correct, that the supervision and control of these weapons are not fail proof.  The greatest protection we can all have from a nuclear war is the elimination of nuclear weapons, and that is what I should like to see.</P>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Minister will agree with me that these are undoubtedly the most important talks which are taking place in the modern world.  We all wish them every success.  It is very encouraging that they have got off to such a hopeful start.  Does the Minister see any role for the Community in regard to these talks? Is there any encouragement the Community could give, or is it the view in the Community that it is better to let the two main super powers try to come to an agreement without any undue interference from anybody else?  Is there an honest broker or goodwill role which the <Col N="403" /> Community could play in regard to these talks in view of their absolutely essential importance?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that at the moment there is a role for an honest broker.  That does not mean that such a role might not arise in the future.  The role of the Community as a Community and as individual member states should be to encourage both sides to continue those talks in as open, constructive and positive a manner as possible.  The greatest hope for disarmament in the world is the building up of confidence between the two holders of nuclear weapons to the extent that they would not feel it was necessary to hold stock piles of weapons and that they would gradually begin to dismantle their stocks of nuclear weapons and in time, perhaps, eliminate them.  I have an open mind as to whether at some stage in the future we might play some sort of an honest broker role.  I do not think now is the time to do it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 10 together.</P>
      <P>Under the British legislation on prevention of terrorism, any person who lands in Britain on the way to or from Ireland may be required to fill in an embarkation or a landing card.  The measures to be taken against terrorism in Britain are a matter for the British Government.  So far as the treatment of Irish citizens is concerned, I attach the highest priority to efforts to ensure that the legislation is applied in an equitable and sympathetic manner, consistent with established civil liberties and that abuses are avoided.</P>
      <P>I can confirm that the specific issue of landing (`pink') cards has been raised with the British authorities on a number of occasions.  My Department have been informed by the British authorities that the use of landing cards is discretionary to local police forces.  That is why passengers may be asked to fill in cards at some ports or airports and not others, or at certain periods and not others.</P>
      <P>The British authorities recently assured my Department that, whether or not all passengers on a particular flight or sailing are `carded', there is no question of discrimination against Irish citizens, and that British passport holders are as likely to be requested to fill in cards as anyone else.</P>
      <P>My Department will continue to monitor the use of the landing card system and will raise any aspects of it which may have a discriminatory effect against Irish citizens or which may cause unnecessary inconvenience or embarrassment.</P>

      <P>This card system was introduced in an Act which originally related to Northern Ireland in 1974.  The Act was changed last year and it is now applicable to anybody landing or leaving Britain.  It is a matter for the British Government how they choose to protect themselves from terrorism.  There is great concern about it and I have been watching events very carefully, particularly in the last six weeks in case the system is being used in an unfair or discriminatory manner or that it is being used against the civil liberties of those involved, Irish people.</P>

Therefore, the fact that it would be used in one area and not in another has no significance.  It is a matter for a police chief as to whether he wants people on ships or aircraft to fill in the card.</P>

      <P>The Minister did not answer my question.  In the case of a Euro flight, whether to Manchester, Birmingham, Heathrow or any other airport in Britain, carrying passengers from the mainland of Europe, those passengers are not asked to fill in the card.  Therefore, there is discrimination against Irish citizens.</P>

Will the Minister indicate that in this whole area the situation is not entirely one-sided, that we have reciprocal arrangements with the British authorities whereby we operate a system which is of very considerable help to them in regard to the detention of international terrorists and subversives, and would he remind the British authorities that we make this contribution to the security of both these islands, and therefore, when they start to operate some procedure unilaterally which is prejudicial, inconvenient and unhelpful to our citizens, they should bear the other aspect of these arrangements in mind?  Will the Minister advert to the fact that apparently when the B &amp; I ship calls at the British port it is a matter of routine, for British security people to go on board and arrest two, three or four members of the crew, as Deputy Mitchell is inferring, almost capriciously, These matters are causing grave concern to Irish people generally.</P>

      <P>The United Kingdom authorities are well aware of that.  They have been reminded of that fact on numerous occasions in contacts between the two Governments.  I believe it is an exaggeration to say, as Deputy Haughey has stated, that they almost as a matter of routine raid Irish ships.  They have done so twice in the last few weeks.  On one of those occasions, the night before last, two people were detained and they were released last night.

    </Speaker>
    <P>Because of my concern at the delay <Col N="413" /> that had occurred in ratifying these international instruments, I supported the establishment, in July 1983, of an interdepartmental committee, under the chairmanship of the former Attorney General, to examine Ireland's ratification of international covenants and conventions with particular reference to human rights.  The committee produced their first report in December 1984 on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights including the Optional Protocol to the Covenant.  The report contains an examination of the obstacles in Irish law to Ireland's ratifying the two UN Covenants and details the domestic legislation that may be required to enable Ireland to comply fully with all the obligations it would assume under the terms of the Covenants.</P>
    <P>I intend to present a memorandum to Government within the coming weeks seeking approval for the necessary steps to be taken to remove these obstacles and for work to commence on the preparation of necessary legislation.</P>
    <P>It was the intention of the interdepartmental committee to consider the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination in its first report. However, because the necessary detailed consideration of the Convention would have delayed unduly the committee's report, the committee decided to postpone their consideration of the Convention and concentrate on the Covenants. I hope that the committee will commence soon their consideration of the Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination and will report on the requirements necessary for Ireland to comply fully with the obligations it would assume on becoming party to this Convention.</P>

      <P>I have made inquiries into this matter and I have been informed by the Medical Missionaries of Mary, under whose auspices these people were travelling to Ethiopia, that none of them has been refused visas by the Ethiopian authorities.  One of them, a lay nurse, received her visa at the end of November and travelled to Ethiopia on 22 December. The four nursing sisters applied for their visas in early December and their applications are currently being processed by the Ethiopian authorities.  I am informed by the Medical Missionaries of Mary that there has been no undue delay in the processing of these applications and that they have no reason to believe that the visas will not be issued in the near future.</P>
      <P>I am also informed that the Medical Missionaries of Mary were given to understand that the visas for the four sisters might be issued before Christmas. On the basis of this information, the Medical Missionaries made provisional bookings for the four sisters to travel on 22 December.  When it became clear that the visas would not be available before Christmas, those bookings were cancelled. This may have given rise to the misunderstanding that the visas were refused or unnecessarily delayed but, as I have said, this is not the case.</P>

      <P>I understand that a private civilian &ldquo;think tank&rdquo;, the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, provided unsolicited views to the US Department of Defence on the importance of European neutral countries to NATO.  It is a matter of public record that in March 1984 testimony was given to a subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations of the US House of Representatives on completed, on-going, and proposed US Department of Defence policy studies.  One of several examples cited as a proposal for the US fiscal year 1985 concerned the relationship of US and NATO defence policy to the neutral countries of western Europe, including Ireland.  I understand, however, that the study was not approved and was not proceeded with.  I have also been informed that no study of this scope and nature is contemplated.</P>

In the case of 1980 in section 2 of the report; 1981 &mdash; sections 5 and 6; 1982 &mdash; sections 4 and 5 and 1983 &mdash; sections 4 and 5.  Full details of factory completions during 1984 will be given in the IDA's annual report for 1984 which will be published this year.  Approximately 20,700 sq. metres of advance factory space was completed by the IDA during 1984 with an additional 44,600 sq. metres of special factories.</P>
      <P>The White Paper on Industrial Policy recognises that in recent years the supply of IDA land and factories has outstripped demand.  Accordingly the Government have decided on revised guidelines&mdash;set out in paragraph 5.42 of the White Paper on Industrial Policy &mdash; for land acquisition and advance factory construction by the IDA.  These guidelines are designed to ensure that the IDA's future building operations are confined to specifically identified priority needs.</P>

The conventional type of speculative factory, which was built in the hope that an industry could be attracted to a particular area, is not being built at the moment.  At present they are building factories for identified needs for individual firms or types of enterprise not adequately provided for elsewhere.</P>

      <P>Apart from the normal activities of the IDA, do the Department have any particular plans in mind that would lead to the putting to use of some of the surplus factories?  Having regard to the exceptional nature of the surplus now on hands, are there any extraordinary plans in train?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the surplus is diminishing because we are more successful in attracting projects than we were.  It is an integral part of the overall industrial programme and it would not be sensible to separate the filling of advance factories from other aspects of industrial development. This is one of the instruments used in attracting industrial development.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>In the normal course of events it would be for the industrial promoter to acquire an empty premises direct from the present owner rather than for the IDA to be an intermediary.  That is a better arrangement.  We will promote with equal vigour empty factories that may exist in the private sectors in such towns as we promote existing IDA advance factories.  It is important to bear in mind that there are many towns of high unemployment which do not have advance factories but which have other available space which we should aim to fill as quickly as possible.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be hard for the IDA to promote with equal vigour factories which are not the property of the IDA?  Surely they must fill their own factories first?

      <P>I would be very concerned if the IDA were forcing companies into sites which did not suit them and, if the Deputy has evidence to that effect, I would require the IDA not to do that because clearly industries should locate where they will do their job best. I am concerned about the statements which the Deputy has made.  However, I had already answered the first part of his question in response to a question from Deputy Taylor.  The IDA are not building speculative advance factories at present in the hope that they will get clients.  They are only building for specific needs, either for an individual industry or for a type of space which is not available in the existing advance factories stock.  The advance factories to which I referred are available in diminishing quantities because, I am glad to say, there is an upturn in industrial investment and I hope that the remaining advance factories will be filled reasonably quickly because things are moving quite well in industrial promotion.</P>

      <P>Before the sos, I was giving some of the reasons for opposing this section.  Indeed, when the Minister of State was introducing this Bill he told us that the Minister was very much influenced by the working party on general nursing in 1980.  It is significant that in this instance he is not taking the advice of that working party who made no reference to giving power to the board or the Minister to register persons ancillary to nursing in a register for nurses.</P>
      <P>The grade of State Enrolled Nurse was very common in the United Kingdom but, even there, it has been phased out. I am sure the Minister has had many representations from the nurses' organisations in this country who are particularly concerned about this section.  The Minister may tell us that section 57 of the Nurses Act, 1950, gave somewhat similar powers to An Bord Altranais but I do not believe that that section was ever used to register persons who were not fully qualified nurses.  I appeal to the Minister to withdraw that section from the Bill.  It would be in the interests of the public and of the nurses to do so because it is fundamental to any profession that only persons with the required qualifications should be on a register.  In this case we believe that a nurses' register should only contain the names of persons who are fully qualified nurses.</P>

      <P>I am not sure that I see the trend of Deputy O'Hanlon's opposition to this section.  It may be that the nursing profession are not willing to see the creation of a kind of second class category of nurses.  If that is what the Deputy means it would correspond with advice which I have received from the profession.  I have a couple of independent points I should like to put to the Minister regarding this section.  What is the object of the register? What is the register intended to certify? What is exclusion from the register intended to indicate?  Does the Minister intend that the board should exercise the same kind of control, criteria and discipline in admitting people to this ancillary register as it will exercise in regard to the main register?  I know the Minister's advisers are hard pressed, in particular in the drafting office but, with respect, it seems to be a rather slapdash piece of drafting that we should get this application by analogy to a whole new range of people of provisions of a very detailed kind applicable to the nursing profession itself.  Does the Minister really intend &mdash; if we are going to apply the provisions applicable to nurses properly so called &mdash; that the ancillary register should be updated every now and then, that there should be a fee charged for including people in it, that there should be a discretion on the board to exclude people from it and that the Fitness to Practise Committee should adjudicate on the fitness of someone like a physiotherapist, a theatre technician or an orderly?  I assume these are categories which might be in the ancillary class.  It seems to be a somewhat slapdash way of doing it and is likely to be unsatisfactory because of the doubt which surrounds it.  I wonder what the object is and whether the Minister will get a result from this section proportionate not so much to the opposition to it on the other side of the House but proportionate to the doubt and uncertainty which I suspect the section will create.</P>

      <P>I fully support this amendment.  Those of us who visit hospitals regularly recognise the exceptional care and attention given by nurses <Col N="451" /> to those who are ill and the same can be said of nurses in other areas of the health services.  That is as it should be.  We all agree that we have a duty to ensure that the highest quality of nursing care must be available to those who are ill.  We are equally agreed that this level of care can only be provided by fully qualified nurses. For the nursing profession, this is a matter of fundamental importance and I am surprised that the Minister proposes to take action which would dilute this level of care.  The Minister may point to a list of services which could be carried out by people who are not qualified nurses.  However, if we accept anything less than the highest quality of training for those who look after old and infirm people we are on a slippery slope which will end up in our having different types of nursing training, as has already been mentioned by Deputy O'Hanlon, such as they had in the UK which were found wanting and were phased out.  It would be a retrograde step for this section to be left in the Bill.</P>
      <P>When I asked the Minister earlier today what value nurses would get from this Bill and from paying fees to register each year he said it would enhance the whole nursing profession.  That may be so but this section goes in the opposite direction.  On the purely practical side, it is difficult to understand why at a time when large numbers of fully qualified nurses are unemployed the Minister should suggest accepting people who are not fully qualified.  There are many well educated boys and girls who are eager to train as nurses but who cannot get an opportunity to do so.  Until relatively recently nurses who qualified in training schools were assured of employment. However, this is no longer the case.  We have reached a stage where relatively few young people who qualify as nurses are retained in the hospital in which they trained nor can they get employment in other hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I would object at any time to the introduction of people who are not fully qualified, it is incredible that the Minister <Col N="452" /> should attempt to include them at present.  I ask him to reconsider the position and accept the amendment put forward by Deputy O'Hanlon.</P>

      <P>I was a bit late arriving so it was as well to give me time to get my breath.  There is great unanimity about this section.  Everyone clearly says this section should be deleted.  That is what was said by the national nursing council of the Irish Transport and General Workers' Union and the association of nurse teachers.  They said they would strongly oppose any provision which would make possible the registration of those in ancillary professions on the grounds that it would detract from and dilute the uniqueness and professionalism of nursing.</P>
      <P>The Irish Nurses' Organisation proposed that this section be deleted.  They stated that this was a Nurses Bill and should be confined to nurses.  There are 2,500 registered nurses unemployed.  The Eastern Health Board took a serious view of this.  There was a special meeting of the board in June 1981 to consider the Bill.  They decided to set up a working party to report on section 31.  The working party met on four occasions and they reported to the Eastern Health Board last November.  They stated precisely the same thing: section 31 should be deleted.</P>
      <P>In their report they state that this section should be totally deleted and that a health services ancillary personnel council be established by the Minister and that it be jointly representative of the Department of Health, health boards and the associated professional regulatory body.  In other words they put forward a proposal under which people ancillary to nursing would be organised separately. By that they mean separately from this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They pointed out that nursing is a profession and in common with all professions has prescribed standards of <Col N="453" /> experience, training and qualification to achieve inclusion on a professional register. They said that the net effect of section 31 was to introduce an intermediate grade for people who had not reached the required standard of entry to the nursing profession and to make An Bord Altranais responsible for maintaining a register of such persons.  They said this was in breach of the fundamental principle of all professions, namely that there is only one standard qualification.  The committee, therefore, recommended that section 31 be deleted.  They recognised there was a problem for the Minister in terms of the various occupations which are ancillary to nursing.  They listed them.</P>
    <P>In the Bill the phrase &ldquo;ancillary to nursing&rdquo; is used but no list is given.  The working party gave examples of ancillary personnel comprising a number of grades such as attendants, orderlies, dental assistants, SENs and nursery nurses totalling nationally 6,000 people approximately compared with 20,000 registered nurses.  They referred to the fact that there is another group which should also be organised professionally and they felt it was time for a statutory professional licensing and regulatory body to be introduced for all the associated professional groups in health care such as social workers, occupational therapists, psychologists, speech therapists, radiographers, physiotherapists and so on.  They spoke to the Minister for Health about this and he told them in February 1983 that the position was that his Department drew up draft proposals for legislation to provide for registration of certain paramedical professions not provided for under existing legislation.  They were also told that an outline of these proposals had been sent to the professions concerned for their views.  Having considered the working party report the Eastern Health Board felt that the Nurses Bill provided for the registration of nurses and should be confined to that.  The Minister has responsibility to organise other ancillary professions in the nursing and health care areas but these are not the responsibility <Col N="454" /> of An Bord Altranais, the board established under this Bill.  It takes from the professionalism of this body to give it responsibility for dealing with various other groups such as attendants, orderlies, dental assistants, SENs, nursery nurses and so on.  Perhaps the Minister does not intend such groups when he says &ldquo;ancillary to nursing&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>On Second Stage I asked him about this and about what the section meant. I asked what was a calling ancillary to nursing.  I asked had they been listed by him and if he meant it as a general phrase or if he would tell us whom he was talking about.  To date the Minister has given no indication of what he was talking about. In the explanatory memorandum it is stated that it is envisaged that this provision could be invoked in the event of the development of some new profession or new calling in the future.  Has the Minister some idea about developing some new profession or calling for which he will use the provisions of section 31? He should explain to us what the purpose of the section is and also what is the purpose of the explanatory memorandum sentence referred to.  Why is it considered necessary to include in a Bill dealing with the nursing profession provision for the keeping of a register of people who are not nurses?  A Nurses Bill should deal only with nurses.  It should reflect that profession.</P>

      <P>Section 31 is one of the most contentious in the Bill.  I was chairman of the Eastern Health Board at the time the working party referred to by Deputy Mac Giolla carried out their task. I can claim responsibility for putting the working party into being.  I compliment the Deputy on the adequate way in which he has outlined the findings of that working party.  Their report was presented to a meeting of the health board and was adopted unanimously.  We are gravely concerned about the proposal in this section. As anyone who has listened to the deliberations of the House today will realise, the nursing profession is a highly organised body of learning.  Those who <Col N="455" /> become entitled to be part of that profession will have undergone long years of study and great scrutiny.  It is incongruous to suggest, as is being suggested in the Bill, that these people in regard to the setting up of a council to administer the profession should be expected to take on board also ancillary nursing services. Deputy Mac Giolla has outlined the various ancillary services all of which play a very important role in the care of those who must avail of them.  One complements another, but we are speaking about a Nurses Bill and we are placing great stress on the responsibility of the board. It is not practical to expect them, in addition to administering their own profession, to assume responsibility for ancillary bodies.  I do not see how such an arrangement could work.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mac Giolla has mentioned, there are about 20,000 nurses in the country. The Eastern Health Board are the largest employer of nurses but there are also 6,000 persons engaged in ancillary services.  The board will have enough to do to cater for their own members.  I, too, should like the Minister to explain his difficulty regarding different degrees of nursing.  I sympathise with him on that difficulty but it can be resolved only if those who wish to be accepted for registration as nurses attain the required standard.</P>
      <P>There is a need for the licensing of other professional groups in the nursing area such as physiotherapists, occupational and speech therapists.  Such groups should have an organisation to administer to their needs.  I join with other speakers in requesting that the Minister delete section 31.  Its provisions could not work.</P>

      <P>In common with Members on both sides of the House, I am totally opposed to this section and I support fully our amendment.  I am at a loss to understand the Minister wishing to include such a section in the Nurses Bill. It is only right that we should ask what is the object of providing for the keeping of another register.  We are talking about <Col N="456" /> the registration of fully qualified nurses and it is with that in mind that we have set various requirements in respect of training, examinations and qualifications.</P>
      <P>Perhaps it is my suspicious nature that leads me to speculate whether the bringing in of these ancillary groups is an effort to avail of a form of cheap labour.  We all know the problems the health boards are experiencing because of inadequate financing.  Is it possible that the Minister hopes to achieve additional savings in this area by the inclusion in the Bill of these ancillary groups?</P>
      <P>As Deputy Mac Giolla as well as some Members of this side of the House have pointed out, there are about 2,550 registered nurses out of work.  A report in the media during the week revealed that of 50 people who qualified recently in, I think, the Mater Hospital, only six had succeeded in gaining employment.  In these circumstances the Minister must realise that there is no need for the ancillary groups.  We have more than enough qualified nurses to fulfil our requirements for many years to come.  I am glad to note that colleagues on all sides of the House are united in this matter and I trust that when we put our amendment to a vote that unity will stand the test.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise mainly to add to the words of wisdom that have been expressed in relation to this section. There are many sections in the Bill which I regard as objectionable but, in addition to being objectionable, this section must have been motivated by some sinister reasons.  It is a reflection on the high standard of training of nurses.  Of all the various professions which require high standards, I doubt if there is another that requires the extremely high standard that applies to the nursing profession.  This recognition has been accorded them not alone by the highest medical authorities here but by the World Health Organisation who have recognised the excellence of service performed by Irish nurses throughout the world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is this an effort to reduce the standards of efficiency and excellence of our <Col N="457" /> nurses?  The nursing profession in the UK are moving away from that kind of development. Our nurses pass examinations which are not easy.  Our nurses undergo training in medicine and the dispensation of drugs as rigorous as that of doctors. Year after year the nursing examinations become more difficult.  Qualified nurses are obliged to take on refresher courses to keep them up to date on the modern techniques of administering drugs and medicines and treating patients.  Everybody interested in the nursing profession would like to know the purpose of this register.  What does it mean?  What is it likely to mean in view of the fact that there are 2,500 nurses unemployed? Many of them are working as waitresses, despite all their training.  Most of the UK hospitals are staffed by Irish nurses.  A lot of State finances have gone into the training of nurses many of whom are emigrating and the Department of Health are compiling a register which will not be in the interests of the nursing profession.</P>
    <P>Everybody has spoken against section 31 and one Deputy spoke very strongly against it.  Can the Minister give a justifiable reason as to why it is necessary to establish this register?  When this register is established will there be a complete list of persons who will be readily available to take up nursing posts?  If a register were compiled in relation to teachers, barristers, solicitors, economists and other professions there would be an immediate uproar.  This will be a register listing people who will not have passed examinations in medicine.  Will the Minister put these people in charge of dangerously sick people?  Will it mean that we will eventually have a Green Shield section of the nursing profession who can be called upon to work at a cheap rate in order that the health boards and the Department may economise at the expense of the public?</P>
    <P>This Bill should uphold the dignity of the nursing profession.  Who will be eligible to go on this register?  There was once a lady called Biddy Early who had a knowledge of all forms of cures.  Would <Col N="458" /> the late Biddy Early with her knowledge of medicines qualify for inclusion in this register?  Who could deny her the right to be registered?  Will we have a register of 1985 Biddy Earlys?  Will we have a register of medical quacks?</P>
    <P>Is is not correct to say that there is some degree of comparison between nurses and fully qualified Red Cross personnel who are not nurses.  They have not done the nurses' examinations.  They are not fully qualified in nursing but can put on a bandage.  They can look after a wound or stop the free flow of blood. They have certain knowledge in relation to care of the ill and the disabled and can deal with emergencies.  May I take it that if section 31 is passed we will have in this register everybody who has a knowledge of Red Cross activities?</P>
    <P>In Civil Defence there are certain ladies fully trained to meet emergencies in the event of a disaster.  Will these people be entitled to be registered?  As regards the quack who has all manner of medical remedies and excels in his own form of nursing, but who has not received training, would he be entitled to register?</P>
    <P>I object to section 31 because it will take from the high standard of nursing and there is no need for a register of what I would describe as the modern Biddy Earlys.  There should be no question of keeping a register of those willing to work for low wages in hospitals or elsewhere caring for the sick.  Have we not a duty first to our sick people, those deprived of the great blessing of good health?  Are we going to make provision for people with fewer qualifications to look after those who are in hospital?</P>
    <P>The motives behind section 31 of this Bill have never been explained to me. The only indication is that all connected with health in the nursing profession, all grades, will be registered.  Every Member of this House sees something seriously wrong with this section.  I put it to the House that there are sinister and evil motives behind the inclusion of such a section and the establishment of a register to include the names of people who may be called upon to perform nursing duties but are not fully qualified.  Why <Col N="459" /> should a person become fully qualified in the nursing profession when she can be registered without being fully qualified and obtain employment in our hospitals, our health boards and with those charged with caring for the sick?</P>
    <P>This is a very serious matter.  Hospital services throughout the world can boast, with a high degree of credibility, about their standard of nursing.  Are we going to be one of the first to make it more difficult for our nurses to become fully qualified to the highest possible medical standards?  Will those on this register be employed where it is thought wise or prudent by those in authority who have no responsibility to health boards, no mandate from the people and no right to be put in charge of the sick?</P>
    <P>I join with others in asking the Minister to delete this section.  Everybody except himself is opposed to it.  He should be aware of the reasons why he should be opposed to this section.  A Nurses Bill must always be in the interest of the nursing profession, but section 31 is not in that interest.  Everyone, particularly senior medical people in our hospitals, agrees that Ireland can produce the best and most fully qualified nurses.  Should we not be careful to preserve that record, to ensure that it is carried on by those who are coming into the profession and will keep up the high standard which our Irish nurses in the four corners of the world have attained with credit and distinction?  Their record has brought admiration for all our nurse training institutions. We should be slow to take any steps which would lower the high standards of Irish nursing.  Section 31 is not helpful in maintaining these extreme standards of efficiency, care, courtesy and medical knowledge.  No reason or justification has been given for the inclusion of section 31.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the nurses' organisations will be reading this debate.  In the event of the establishment of such a register, which may not happen today or tomorrow, I want to warn the nurses' organisations that it will prove to be disastrous for the future qualification of nurses to <Col N="460" /> the very high standard of their profession. In this country we want the best possible care of our sick, to have the best trained people possible.  We do not want a group either of Green Shield nurses or of pretending Biddy Earlys to take over our hospital wards.  The establishment of such a register will not lead to the production of the best possible type of nurse and nursing care in our hospitals in general and emergency wards.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider the plea being made by all sides inside and outside this House, indeed by everybody who has had a comment to make on this Bill.  I have yet to see one word of praise for the inclusion of section 31 and this most suspicious register about to be established. Irish nurses will regret the day such a register was compiled.  Because of the united opposition to this section outside the House I add my voice in the interest of preservation of the perfection of Irish nurses, their standards and skills and I ask that it be deleted.  It can serve no purpose, no good, and there is no comparison between any ancillary profession and that of the real profession of nursing.  One cannot have two grades or degrees.  One must have one highly satisfactory, fully qualified standard.  One cannot have a Green Shield list from which to draw in the event of having to acquire cheap labour.</P>
    <P>Is there any trade union in Ireland with a list of tradesmen who would also have a list of those who are supposed to be tradesmen who will be called in the event of tradesmen not being available?  I think of the Stonemasons' and Bricklayers' Union in past days in Cuffe Street when only a fully qualified stonemason or bricklayer was allowed go on a list for a union card.  I can think of the Amalgamated Society of Woodworkers in respect of which indentures had to be produced and investigation of completion of apprenticeship recorded before one's name could be inscribed.  I doubt if the Incorporated Law Society would compile a list or register of legal quacks that administer hob law &mdash; and, God knows, this country has its fair share of them too. Then there is the Painters' Union.  Would <Col N="461" /> they grant membership of their union to those who can take up a paint brush and use it at will?  This is a most serious matter.  We expect the obligations of all professions, trades and trade unions to be fulfilled.  But in regard to the nursing profession there is to be a register compiled of people akin to nurses but who will never possess the same full qualifications.</P>
    <P>On reconsideration I ask that this section be deleted from the Bill.  I have been longer in this House than any other Member present and I have not seen a similar section in any other Bill that passed through this House.  As was customary on the part of Deputies many years ago, I have carried out certain research before making my speech in order to ascertain if I could find a similar section dealing with any profession or trade.  With all the help and assistance available to me, together with my fair share of commonsense and intelligence in relation to procedure in this House, I have not found anything similar to section 31.  Why do the Department of Health not tell us what they mean?  What is at the back of this section?  What is hidden in this?  What is the purpose of the register? If there is silence on this there must be some strange reason therefor.  I believe that section 31 is not in the interests of the production of the best most highly qualified nurses.  I foresee difficulties. I see no need for such a register and for that reason I ask that this section be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall be brief.  I want to add my voice to those of others who have spoken on section 31.  Unlike the previous speaker, I do not see anything sinister or subversive in the intentions of the Minister in putting this forward. Perhaps it was put forward in the mistaken idea of achieving egalitarianism of some kind or another, or that the Minister felt this was the proper thing to do.  Lest it be construed that what I am saying is elitist of nature, from my experience as a teacher I would have to echo what Deputy O.J. Flanagan has said.  If one is a member of a profession there are standards to be adhered to and there <Col N="462" /> should be only one examination or test of competence laid down for somebody wanting to enter that profession.  That is the reason I feel the Minister should delete section 31.  I say that from a practical point of view.  The only way in which the public at large and the medical and nursing professions will have confidence in the nurses in our hospitals will be through their full awareness that each man or woman has passed one examination, one assessment or test of competence so that there are not within the one hospital nurses with varying degrees of qualifications.</P>
      <P>If the Minister really thinks about it he will agree that that would constitute quite an impossible situation and one which would give rise to many anomalies.  I am thinking of patients going into any hospital being upset or worried about their state of health, or their families being worried about them, and then it being put into their mind that whatever person is in charge of them is not what would be called a fully qualified or registered nurse in the real meaning of the term.  I do not want to see that happen.  I do not see anything sinister in what the Minister is proposing or any such imputation but I do say it constitutes a very unwise move.  I fail to see the reason for it.  Professionally speaking, there is no rationale at all for having degrees of competency, of examinations for various types of nurses. There should be one examination only, a national standard, an applicant passes and is then deemed competent to go into any hospital ward and nurse.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am particularly pleased that Deputy Flanagan said there was united opposition to this section.  He said he added his voice &mdash; and I presume his vote &mdash; to the proposal to delete this section.  There was such passion and conviction in what he said that I know he means to carry it through to the final stage, which is the vote.  Bearing that in mind and the wisdom of the various Deputies who have spoken on the issue, in a practical sense there can be room for one national examination only and one national register, one degree of competence in the nursing <Col N="463" /> profession.  I ask the Minister to please delete this section.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to disassociate myself from some of the remarks made by Deputy Flanagan.  I recognise that he is the most senior Member here.  I have not spoken on this section of the Bill and I do not know who gave him the authority to imply that every Deputy in this House is in favour of deleting this section.  I object to that and I want to disassociate myself from what he said.</P>
      <P>Like other Deputies I am well aware of the amount of opposition to this section. Perhaps I am reading it in a totally different light from everybody else but, rather than anything sinister or damaging or dangerous to the nursing profession, I saw in it a certain element of protection for those members of the nursing profession who are fully qualified nurses.  If we have a register of fully qualified nurses and a register of people who are not fully qualified nurses, employers seeking nurses or nursing aides or attendants, or whatever we want to call them, will have in black and white those who are qualified and will not have to take somebody's word.  I see that as a protection for qualified nurses.  They will be on register A and the others will be on register B, or whatever annotation we want to give to those registers.  That is my reading of the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My understanding is that there is provision for such a register in the existing legislation.  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that in his reply.  I understood that, although the register was never set up, the provision was there.  This is not a sinister section.  It is not something which the Minister put into this Bill for some terrible reason.  The existence of a register does not give anyone the right to a job.  In his lengthy submission on this section Deputy Flanagan implied that, once your name was on the register, you would take the job of another nurse.  He more or less said that once the register was set up the management of the hospitals had no choice, that they could not hold interviews and employ the people <Col N="464" /> they wanted, that automatically because the register was there they would have to take on some unqualified quack or some Nurse Biddy Early or an equivalent type person.  That is utter nonsense.</P>
    <P>It is not the same as the panel which exists for national school teachers who find themselves without a job and can be offered a job at the top of the panel.  That is not what this register is, or if it is, I should like the Minister to clarify it.  That is not implied in the Bill.  This is not a way in which hospitals can get cheap labour.  The personnel who employ hospital staff are not so irresponsible that, once the register is set up, they will start to replace all their fully qualified nurses with half qualified quacks or people who did a six weeks Red Cross course and know how to put on a Figure 8 bandage.</P>
    <P>If I thought the hospitals would resort to that in order to get cheap labour, I would despair for the future of our hospital system.  I do not have that kind of lack of confidence in our hospital management. They will continue to employ the best qualified people to look after the sick.  It is a red herring to suggest that because there will be a register there will be a serious threat to the very high quality of nursing we have in Ireland.  I find it impossible to understand how people can see the section in that way.</P>
    <P>The section has attracted a great deal of opposition and a feeling of threat.  I said to the nurses who lobbied me about the section that as a non-nursing person I seemed to have more confidence in the proposed board than the nursing profession. The great percentage of the membership of the board will be made up of nurses.  I get a little worried when I hear all this opposition.  It is more or less implied that nurses do not trust the nurses who will be on the board.  The section says that the board may with the consent of the Minister register names in a register maintained for that purpose.  They are not obliged to set it up.  If the Minister requests them to do it they are obliged to, but I am quite sure the Minister will take into account the worries and the fears which have been expressed.</P>
    <P>If the board when established do not <Col N="465" /> feel it is appropriate to have this register, they do not have to set it up.  To allay some of the fears the Minister might consider leaving out this section for the moment on the understanding that, if there is still a problem about unqualified people passing themselves off as qualified people, the register will be set up.  That would be a protection for the nurses of Ireland.</P>
    <P>I find it difficult to understand why the section is seen as such a terrible threat. Deputy Flanagan raised the dilemma in which I find myself in trying to interpret what this Bill is about.  Great play has been made in the hand written and photocopied literature we all got from various organisations about the fact that this is a Nurses Bill and should deal only with things applicable to nurses.  In the explanatory memorandum with the Bill it is stated that it is a Bill to provide for a nursing board which shall provide for the registration, control and education of nurses.  It did not stop there.  It went on to say, &ldquo;and to provide for other matters relating to the practice of nursing and the persons engaged in such practice&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>In his submission Deputy Flanagan showed the dilemma.  &ldquo;Nursing&rdquo; is a very broad term.  If people are taking away bed pans or doing some general work, that is part of nursing.  It was suggested that the register would provide cheap labour for the hospitals and that a low standard of nursing would be accepted. If people refer to what they are doing as a low standard of nursing this Bill is the place to talk about it because it is supposed to provide for other matters relating to the practice of nursing.</P>
    <P>I will be interested to hear the Minister's answer to the question about the provision already being in existence.  For some reason it has not brought about all the aggro, upset and concern in the nursing profession.  Was it that because it was not implemented, everyone thought it would die away?  I should like the Minister to refute the suggestion that once the register was set up it would force hospital management automatically to employ people on the register.  They will still have the freedom to employ whomever they <Col N="466" /> wish to employ at whatever standard they wish.</P>

      <P>I regret that I was not here for the earlier contributions on this section.  I gather from what has been said that most of the areas of concern have been dealt with.  I should like to put my concern in relation to this section to the Minister for the purpose of receiving his reassurance.  I was interested in the concept to which Deputy Owen referred. Like many other Deputies I was approached by large groups of nurses involved in nursing schools and practising in rural areas.  There is no doubt they are very concerned about this section.</P>
      <P>I am merely putting to the Minister questions that have been put to me by members of the profession on this section, and if there is substance in the fears of nurses I would urge the Minister, by legislative amendment or otherwise to allay those fears.  Deputy Owens has told us that this exists in the 1950 Act and that it has not led to a diminution of the status of nurses.  Deputy Flanagan suggested that this is a mechanism by which to introduce cheap labour to hospitals.  I would not have that fear.  Lower grade nurses have been tried in Britain and the US but both countries have turned back.</P>
      <P>However, nurses have been displaying a genuine instinctive reaction to the section, mainly out of self interest and particularly to ensure that nursing jobs will not be reduced in times of recession. There is concern also about the maintenance of nursing standards but, as I have said, they have returned to the previous position in other countries and decided that nurses required extra training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Quite often, due to lack of full training, accidents have occurred and mistakes in regard to medical care.  A careful line must be drawn between the lesser trained nurses and those who are fully trained. In the major registration section of the Bill there is provision for a minimum of three years training.  I am sure that nurses would be satisfied if we made the separation quite clear.  This section will be administered by the nurses board who will decide as to the desirability of some <Col N="467" /> other form of registration.  I hope the Minister will allay the fears that exist in regard to maintenance of nursing standards.</P>

      <P>As Deputies have put it, the section has created dismay in the minds of nurses.  I have had approaches from many to try to establish the thinking behind the section.  When I first read the section I did not read in it any of the charges made by Deputy Flanagan or Members opposite.  However, the Minister must convince the House that the section will not create two types of registered nurse.  I agree with Deputy Flanagan that no other profession would accept that.  Nobody wants to see a register of what could be seen to be second class nurses.  This is the Nurses Bill and it would be dangerous to attempt to do that.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will explain what he has in mind and unless I am satisfied that what he has in mind is in the best intersts of the profession and general health I seriously will have to consider putting down an amendment to this section.</P>

      <P>I never cease to be amazed at the ability of Members to disturb themselves about nothing in particular. We get great enjoyment out of this, particularly Deputy Flanagan who voted for this section in the 1950 Nurses Act when he was a member of the Government side.  All I have done here is to tidy things up, and we should therefore rid ourselves of those hyper-suspicions. All I have done is to redraft in a tidier fashion section 57 of the 1950 Act which went through the House then without objection.  That provision has existed for 35 years and there has not been a whimper about the evil intent behind that section by any Deputy, including Deputy Flanagan.  Not a nurse in the country has lost a night's sleep over section 57 of the 1950 Act, which I will read:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(1) Where the Minister is satisfied <Col N="468" /> that any profession or calling is ancillary to nursing, he may by order provide that the register of nurses may be extended to the profession or calling and may by such order require the Board to appoint a committee in respect of the profession or calling.</P>
    <P>(2) Where an order is made under this section&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a) the Board may by rules maintain a division of the register in respect of the profession or calling to which the order relates, and</P>
    <P>(b) the provisions of this Part of this Act shall apply in relation to such profession or calling with such (if any) modifications as may be specified in such rules.</P>
    <P>
    </P>
    <P>That has been reiterated more tidily in a form recommended by the parliamentary draftsman.  That is all that is in it.  If a separate register is to be kept under the auspices of An Bord Altranais that decision would be taken by the nursing profession, not by the Minister of the day. It must be remembered that of the 30 members on An Bord Altranais 19 will be nurses.  It will be up to the board to make the decision.  The nursing profession may wish to have ancillary grades registered on a separate register.  They may want to have in their area of activity ancillary grades who will be properly regulated, properly controlled and properly supervised working to nurses.  There is nothing unusual in that.  It is no more unusual than having the large number of para-medical staff who work to members of the medical profession and there is not a whimper from that profession about the dilution, diminution or destruction of the beloved medical profession.  They are all happy as a lark working away in the national interest, and, understandably, in their own interest also.  I do not know what the objections are about.  I am introducing an enabling provision and no more.  I have great regard for Deputy O'Hanlon &mdash; it may be considered the kiss of death to say so &mdash; and for his preoccupation with health issues.</P>

      <P>There has been no opposition, for example, from the Fianna Fáil Party to auxiliary dental workers. The Dentists Bill, 1984, sailed through the Seanad and it contained a similar type of enabling provision.  There was no objection to Second Stage of that Bill here.  Section 53 of that Bill states:</P>
      <P>The Council may, with the consent of the Minister, make a scheme for establishing classes of auxiliary dental workers who may undertake such class or classes of dental work as shall be specified by the Council notwithstanding that the doing of such work would constitute the practice of dentistry within the meaning of this Act.</P>
      <P>That is much more upfront than one would dare to presume in this area.</P>
      <P>I know that the working party were not particularly preoccupied about continuing with the section but it is true to say that they held that the position should be monitored constantly, especially in the light of the extended role of nurses into various specialist clinical areas.  We are aware of such areas as the chemotherapy, haemodialysis, coronary care and the general intravenous area.  Specialities may develop in those areas and, logically separate registers may be opened.</P>
      <P>I hope the legislation will last to the year 2000 and there will be free movement of labour within the Community during that time.  Separate registers may be required during that period and I am including a provision for that.  It does not constitute a precedent, a threat or an attack on the employment conditions of nurses.  There are 19,800 qualified nurses here and 6,500 student nurses.  That represents about 9,000 more than we had ten years ago.  That should be borne in mind before screaming about unemployment. There is a limit to the number of nurses who can be employed here and the nursing profession, and others, acknowledge that by their observations on nurse training centres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to refute the suggestion <Col N="470" /> that there is any cheap labour in Irish hospitals or the health services.  As a member of the Council of Europe between 1973 and 1981 I visited hospitals in all European countries and I learned that Irish medical staff are among the highest paid in the world, apart from being the best qualified in many respects. There is no cheap labour, not even in terms of paramedical or ancillary staffs here.  In excess of £700 million is paid out annually in salaries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no intention to encourage a system of cheap labour. There is a view in the Department that the provision under discussion will prove useful in the years ahead.  I am not proposing that such registration should be established but it seems to be prudent to provide a mechanism to enable An Bord Altranais to deal with the developments as they may arise.  I have been asked why this issue will be dealt with by the registration body for nurses and not through some other registration body. There is the simple argument that it is reasonable to suppose that the persons concerned would work under the supervision and direction of nurses.  The best form of any separate register would be under the general aegis of An Bord Altranais.  It is a desirable provision and a reasonable power to devolve on the board.</P>
      <P>If I may turn the argument on its head, I believe it is in the national interest and in the interest of the nursing profession that control be kept in this area rather than have it slip out into a non-registered and very diffused area of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention to have all professions <Col N="471" /> in the health service properly and professionally registered and run by themselves before I cease my term of office as Minister. Currently a separate Bill is being drafted to provide separate registration professional provisions for paramedical grades such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, chiropodists and social workers to give them the statutory right of formal registration and authority to run their own professional bodies.  I have been trying to set up a new Dental Council and that Bill has received a reasonable welcome, although there are contentious issues in it.</P>
    <P>For the first time since 1950 I am trying to provide a modern Bord Altranais, which the staff of that board and the nursing profession welcome.  In that framework I want to provide for as many contingencies as possible which could arise in the years ahead.  Since ancillary staff to the nursing profession could be employed at some future date, it follows that the board should have a real involvement in the registration of such staff, even if they are registered separately. That is a reasonable and logical relationship. That is all that is in this section.</P>
    <P>I am grateful to Deputies for raising this issue but I can assure Deputy Flanagan that his misgivings are unfounded. He has been, if I may so in the politest of terms, ballyragging me around the country in relation to sections 31 and 52. It is the old story of people rushing in and coming to conclusions and then I have to work backwards to convince people of the bona fides of our intention.  I made the point that this section has been in existence since 1950.  Deputy Flanagan has a long and distinguished career in this House and that legislation was enacted while he was a Member of this House. There has been no objection to this section in the existing nursing legislation and I do not recall any objections about it from the professions over the years.</P>
    <P>If Deputies want to fight battles on this Bill I would urge that the ground be better chosen.  I will look at this section <Col N="472" /> between now and Report Stage if Deputies wish.  I do not intend to withdraw the section but I will look at it again to ensure that any evil designs Deputies think I might have will not bear fruit but that proper legislative controls will be provided. I can assure Deputies that their objections are being carefully noted and I will not take any precipitous action in this matter.  In any event, An Board Altranais will be running the show when the board have been elected.  I will not be running the show because I want to devolve responsibility on the profession. I have no doubt that this will dispel a number of preconceptions held by members of this profession and that the profession will embrace this legislation quite happily.  This applies to all who will come in contact with this legislation, including Ministers of the day.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Having listened to the Minister's comments on the statements made by Members on all sides, I can see no reason why we should diminish our opposition to this section.  The Minister said that section 31 seemed to be controversial in other legislation as well as in this Bill and referred to the Posts and Telecommunications Act.  He could also have referred to the Health Act, section 21 of which is also controversial.</P>
      <P>On a number of occasions the Minister said An Bord Altranais would decide whether ancillary grades would be registered on the nursing register but the section clearly states that the Minister requests that a register will be maintained for this purpose.  The Minister will have the power to direct the board to register persons in ancillary grades.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Two Government Deputies suggested that the Minister had a sinister motive and that the same allegation had been made on this side.  I want to dissociate every Fianna Fáil Deputy from such allegation.  I would not, nor would any Deputy on this side of the House, suggest that the Minister has anything sinister in mind.  We are concerned about this legislation.  The last Nursing Act has been law for 34 years and if this Bill lasts as long we will be into the next century.  We <Col N="473" /> must ensure that the legislation we pass is in the best interests of the general public and the nurses and that it will be something of which we as legislators can be proud.  That is why we are examining this legislation and opposing this section. As I said, we are not applying anything sinister to the Minister's motive in including this section in the Bill.</P>
    <P>There is a similar section in the 1950 Act.  I do not want to compare this section with the section in the 1950 Act because I am opposed to this section and I do not know why it was included in the 1950 Act.  It states clearly in the 1950 Act that there would be a division of the register between ancillary grades and nursing.  It said that where an order is made under the section the board may by rules maintain a division of the register in respect of the profession or calling to which the order relates.  That is a very big difference but it would not satisfy us because we believe this section should be deleted. We hold the view that a register of nurses should contain only fully qualified nurses.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the Dentists Bill which has not passed through this House yet.  He said the Dental Council can set up a scheme for denturists, but it does not say that they will be registered on the dentists' register.  He referred to the fact that doctors worked in hospitals with paramedical staff, and it is true that they work in harmony, but none of the paramedical staff is registered on the medical register, which is confined exclusively to doctors who have reached a certain standard through examination. Clearly this register contains only the names of those who have reached that standard.  That is in the interests of the public and the profession.</P>
    <P>It is not acceptable to give ministerial power to register persons ancillary to nursing particularly in view of the suggestion in the Explanatory Memorandum that there may be new grades we have not yet thought of.  Neither I nor any Fianna Fáil Deputy has suggested that the Minister has anything in particular in mind, but we do not know what the Ministers will have on their minds in the <Col N="474" /> year 2000 and it is giving too much power to a Minister if he can direct An Bord Altranais in the year 2000 to register an ancillary grade of nursing.  As I said, it may be a grade nobody has yet thought of, it could be entirely against the interests of the general public to include them on the register.</P>
    <P>In a time of recession it would pose a dilemma for health boards, hospitals and anybody who has to employ nursing staff if the register contained an ancillary grade which could be employed at a cheaper rate.  This would not be in the interest of the general public.  We want to ensure that our nurses are trained to the highest capacity and that they have qualifications which will compare with and be as good as, if not better than in any other country.  We are satisfied that they are dedicated and, in terms of educational attainment, we want to ensure that they have the highest qualifications possible.  Our register of nurses should contain the names of those who have attained that high level of education. We are opposing this section because we believed that there should be a register of nurses similar to the medical register which would contain the names of nurses who have the basic qualification.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AliceGlenn" hpid="Mrs. Glenn Mrs. Glenn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Glenn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not support the cheap labour theory and I do not believe that that was the intention of those who framed this legislation.  Neither do I accept that a section in a Bill which was acceptable 35 years ago is necessarily appropriate to the needs of today.  The instance that comes to mind to elaborate on that point is that 35 years ago the psychiatric service was in the dark ages compared with the enlightened approach today to the care and treatment of those in need of psychiatric care.  At that time, those who were employed to look after those people needed no nursing qualifications although they were usually compassionate people and had to be very healthy because there were no drugs then to tranquilise difficult patients.  Legislation which was appropriate and acceptable then bears no relationship to what is needed today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="475" /> I am sure the Minister will agree that we still have that kind of personnel on our psychiatric services today.  They are marvellous people doing an excellent job. However, there is now an attempt to introduce into that service people with general nursing qualifications together with a specialist qualification in psychiatric care.  This is presenting problems in the workforce but they could and should be resolved without trying to perpetuate a situation which is no longer relevant. As chairman of the health board I am aware of problems which exist in that area and the only conclusion I can come to is that this is an effort to come to terms with what is a difficult problem.  Years ago those people were used as a cheap workforce but that is not true today.  I do not think there is any difference in the remuneration of the general trained nurse and the people who gave such a great service when qualifications were not a requirement.  If that has any bearing on the Minister's insistence on keeping this section, it is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.</P>
    <P>I do not understand or accept what the Minister said about this matter.  There is no need to keep that section in, particularly when all indications are that we will not face a shortage of young men and women coming into the nursing service for the foreseeable future.  There is no need to go outside the realm of properly trained nurses.  I reiterate that it should be deleted.  I hope this legislation will stand the test of time and I am asking the Minister to treat the nursing profession in the same way as he treated the medical profession.  He did not ask them to take on ancillaries.  The nurses have enough to do in looking after their own profession and I am not satisfied with what the Minister said about it.  That section should be deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not impressed by the Minister's scathing comments on all the opposition to this section.  Everyone, including the nursing profession, is out of step except our Barry.  If, as he says, there is no need for the nursing <Col N="476" /> profession to be perturbed in any way by this why has he not been able to persuade them that this is so?  He refers to a section from the Nurses Act, 1950 but, as Deputies have pointed out, 1950 is light years away.  At that time jobs now being done by attendants and orderlies were done by trainee nurses.  Not alone were they not paid for doing so, they actually paid to do the job of trainee nurses and orderlies.</P>
      <P>I understood that one of the primary purposes of the Bill &mdash; and this was the understanding of the nurses also &mdash; is to upgrade their job to professional status to give them a higher status in the community. It is because the Nurses Act, 1950, is defective that this new Bill is needed.  We are now in 1985 so let us forget 1950.  Perhaps the Minister does not see that one of the purposes of the Bill is to raise the status of the nursing profession and that the register of nurses will be a symbol of their high profession and calling.</P>
      <P>As Deputy O'Hanlon pointed out, under this section they can be instructed by the Minister to keep this register of ancillaries.  The Minister, after quite a long dissertation, did not give even one example of whom he is talking about.  Until he tells us, we must assume that he is talking about unqualified people such as orderlies, attendants and so on in hospitals who are giving a hand ancillary to nursing.  What is the purpose of having a register of unqualified people?  What would be the criteria for registering an unqualified person?  The fact that they are actually working on the job?  Are the nursing profession supposed to register everyone who is there?  Even if they are employed by somebody else must they still be on this register?  Why should they be doing this?  Is it purely for staffing and manning purposes in the hospitals?  Are they to keep a register of who is on the job so that when they are on call people can telephone them?  What is this register about?  Why should hospitals not keep a register of the various people on their staff?  Why should the nursing profession have to do this?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This has nothing to do with the day-to-day running of hospitals and why should <Col N="477" /> the nurses keep a register of ancillary staff with no particular qualifications? There is no method of deciding who should be on the register unless they are told by the hospital that someone took up duty that morning and should now be put on the register.  If that is not the case, would the Minister clarify it?  Are they to keep a record of the ancillary professional services, psychologists, speech therapists, radiographers and so on?  It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us the purpose of the register and stop referring to the 1950 Act.  What is the purpose of the register?  The Minister should not tell us that something or other was in the 1950 Act.  We are talking about a completely different Bill.  Why should it be in this Bill?  It does not seem to have any relationship to it.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to name the type of people involved.  The Eastern Health Board working party of which Deputy Glenn was a member gave examples of ancillary personnel &mdash; presumably they did not list them all &mdash; as attendants, orderlies, dental assistants, SENs and nursery nurses.  The Minister said that dental assistants were included in the Dental Bill.  Ancillary dental workers are mostly employed by dentists.  It is a completely different kettle of fish with nurses. They are employees and not employers. It is the hospitals who employ these people.</P>
    <P>If the Minister is talking about the other professional register, the Eastern Health Board list the type of people covered in that as social workers, occupational therapists, speech therapists, psychiatrists and so on.  The Minister spoke to the Eastern Health Board about a register for them.</P>
    <P>Who is the Minister talking about now? The unions involved, the Irish Nurses' Organisation, the ITGWU and the association of nurse teachers want this section deleted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no desire to prolong the discussion but I want to be as helpful as possible.  This is a complex and very large Bill.  We made considerable progress today on Committee Stage. <Col N="478" /> Deputy O'Hanlon raised two points.  One was the lack of precision in terms of a separate division of the register relative to the section of the 1950 Act.  I am prepared to consider that issue on Report Stage.</P>
      <P>The Deputy also understandably and correctly made a point about preoccupation with ministerial direction in relation to this section, namely &ldquo;whenever the Minister so requests&rdquo;.  I am prepared to examine that provision.  As regards the generality of the amendment I want to devolve power on An Bord Altranais to set up such a structure if they so wish.</P>
      <P>I find it quite extraordinary that Deputy Mac Giolla should deny to the great unrecognised of the health services the prospect of some future registration. So much for the introverted élitism of The Workers' Party.</P>

      <P>I assure my colleagues that my purpose in coming to grips with trying to work for the 63,000 people who service our health services, be they hospital attendants or senior consultants, was to ensure that what was done for one was done for all.  In so far as their educational attainments, training capacities and work modules merit the registration of particular grades, I will endeavour to bring that about.  I will do it in terms of paramedical grades and wish to do it in terms of ancillary grades to nursing in order to regularise and give status, which some might deny, to those who merit status, are entitled to it and who, above all, I would remind the Deputy, are entitled to protection in terms of their conditions of employment, be they with a health board or a nursing home.  Many of them work in nursing <Col N="479" /> homes as substandard, cheap labour.  We are trying to do something about that by having a register of nursing homes and private hospitals.  That is also being opposed by some of my colleagues as another evil machination on my part in terms of the destruction of the health services.  I happen to be the largest employer in the public service and as far as I am concerned, whether it is a person driving an ambulance or a highly specialised nurse working in a cardiac unit, they will get parity of recognition from me.  I will not bend on that issue.</P>
      <P>I had to take into account the 1950 Act.  I tried to carry over, as any sensible Minister would do, as much of that Act as was desirable in modern industrial terms. One does not discard lightly what is there for many decades.  I carried over the provision in a modified form.  Unfortunately, mal-intent was read into it.  I carried it over bearing in mind that the working party have pointed out that in the decades ahead we cannot be sure precisely how many of the nursing specialities will evolve, given the tremendous change in technology which is occurring in medicine and within our health services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have been aware of this as a member of the House for the past 15 years.  I would have been remiss if I had not provided that kind of legislative framework for the broad registration of all of the health disciplines in the years ahead.  It is no more than sensible to utilise this Bill to provide such a framework for those whose work is related to and is ancillary to nursing.  That gives them protection. It gives the nursing profession basic protection and it unifies the system.  There is a problem in the area of the delivery of services.  There is an enormous specialisation and enormous unitary preoccupation but some degree of cross relationship on occasion is not a bad idea.  It may well be that there is already a case for a separate register under the general aegis of the board.  The board, as a body of nurses, are the most reasonable body to deal with this area.  If I as Minister had dared to unilaterally announce a separate structure for the setting up of an ancillary <Col N="480" /> nursing body, I can imagine the howls of outrage that would have come from the nursing profession.  They would say that their profession was being mutilated. I am simply saying to them that if they so wish they may set up a register of people involved in these ancillary services, that is, if they consider such a move to be desirable professionally.  Within the framework of the European Community and having regard to a changing pattern of nursing in the years ahead, the board may well decide to set up such a register.</P>
    <P>I stress that this is a matter which the board should be in a position to examine. I am sorry if I have talked excessively on this aspect but from the contributions that have been made it would seem to be a crucial part of the Bill.  I do not regard it as being of momentous importance in the sense that by and large our nursing structures are established.  I am prepared to consider a phrase which does not give clarity in relation to the words, &ldquo;register in a register maintained for that purpose&rdquo;. I am prepared to accept that the Minister for Health should divest himself of the directive provision that is written into the section.  The wording is, &ldquo;the board may with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;. Having regard to the preoccupation of Members, I am prepared to delete the phrase, &ldquo;whenever the Minister so requests&rdquo; but I will have to make the decision in the context of the Report Stage.  I have gone as far as I can go without making further change in that regard.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to deny the right of basic recognition, of some form of separate basis associated perhaps with those who might be regarded, for want of a better term, as ancillary to the nursing profession. I hope the House will appreciate that I have gone as far as I can in meeting the wishes expressed.</P>

      <P>I am reasonably happy with the assurances given by the Minister in respect of matters I raised.  I can understand the Minister's attitude and that he has in mind giving control to the nurses who will be on the board to decide whether they require this additional register, but what is causing concern and confusion to a number of my constituents is the phrase, &ldquo;the board shall, whenever the Minister so requests&rdquo;.  That is interpreted as being a direction from the Minister and which would therefore oblige the board to establish this register. However, I accept the Minister's assurance to reconsider the matter between now and Report Stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The section is a re-enactment of section 50 of the 1950 Act. It empowers the board, in accordance with their rules, to provide directly, or make provision for, training examinations for student nurses.  The term &ldquo;may&rdquo; is an enabling provision &mdash; no more and no less.  I would point out that the working paper recommended in relation to educational training programmes generally that the board, as a policy-making <Col N="485" /> body, should not be directly involved in the day-to-day running of programmes and courses.  That overall recommendation is very sound.  It is envisaged that the majority of training programme courses would be run by agencies other than the board, within the parameters, of course, set by the board.  That is the latest information I have on the matter, that the term &ldquo;may&rdquo; is simply an enabling provision.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>In subsection (2) of this section, it is stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The examiners (none of whom shall be a member of the Board) at every examination held under this section shall be appointed by the Board, shall hold such qualifications and have such experience in relation to nursing as the Board thinks proper, and shall be <Col N="486" /> remunerated in accordance with a scale fixed by the Board with the approval of the Minister.</P>
    <P>Should it not be written into the legislation that these people would be actually engaged in teaching, rather than leave the wording as broad as it is?  I presume that the board will select people who are engaged in teaching, but I question whether that discretion should be left to the board or whether we should write it into the legislation that the people who would be carrying out the examinations would be themselves engaged in teaching?</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The main point I would make is that they would not necessarily all be teachers.  One could envisage matron staff, non-teaching, or service staff or medical staff, equally non-teaching. Certainly, they would have to be suitably qualified examiners as determined by the board.  That section is broad enough and flexible enough to enable the board to set up an appropriate structure.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>On those sections which deal with the education and post-graduate education of nurses, does the Minister envisage the board having the responsibility of conducting a continuous review and evaluation of current courses on offer or available both to trainee nurses and post-graduate nurses and also of providing a continuous assessment and updating of the various types of courses available for nurses?  In this way they would be enabled to keep pace with the complex and constant changes in nursing techniques and care.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some anticipation there because further on, section 37 (1) deals with the general question of suitability and adequacy of all courses of nurse training and education, both at preregistration and post-registration levels. I would point out to the Deputy, as she correctly wishes it to be, that it will be a new provision.  The Deputy's point will be met.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 20:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (4), line 14, after &ldquo;may&rdquo; to delete &ldquo;, with the consent of the Minister,&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>There are two amendments in my name. Amendment No. 20 would change subsection (4) to:</P>
      <P>The Board may withdraw an approval under this section of a hospital or an institution.</P>
      <P>If we have confidence in the board, the Minister should leave the decision to the board.  The whole of section 35 is very important because it deals with the approval by the board of hospitals and institutions suitable for training purposes. We should give the board authority and there should not be ministerial interference in the decisions of the board. I ask the Minister to consider withdrawing the phrase dealing with ministerial consent.  I would ask the Minister to consider withdrawing ministerial consent where the board wish to withdraw an approval from a training hospital or institution.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have considerable difficulty in accepting the amendments proposed to this section by Deputy O'Hanlon and by Deputies Mac Giolla and De Rossa.  I still think that the import of the point can be met generally, the difficulty being that there has been an inordinate preoccupation with the very conventional phrase used throughout this Bill &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;. Other phrases such as &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister for Health,&rdquo;&ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister for the Public Service&rdquo; or &ldquo;subject to the approval of the Minister for Finance&rdquo;&mdash; all of these provisions are entirely conventional. Unquestionably the parliamentary draftsman is adamant that there must be, if it is to be law, a ministerial <Col N="488" /> power.  Otherwise there is no prospect of enforcement and one would simply be setting up a series of general vacuums.  I have difficulty in understanding the proposal to delete the phrase &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>I might point out that it is another provision carried over from the Nurses Act 1950, section 53 thereof, and that an approval has never been withdrawn by An Bord Altranais, which means that the relevant subsection has never been invoked.</P>
      <P>I might also point out that withdrawal of approval for training of nurses from a hospital or similar institution naturally would have extremely serious consequences for that hospital from the point of view of service and indeed of status. In the future it may be we will have to face up to these kinds of situations.  The working party saw the need for rationalisation of training schools.  I might point out additionally that it is now five years since the working party proposed that there should be no more than 15 schools in the country, each school to embrace a group of hospitals and institutions, providing the full range of nursing services together with facilities for theoretical instruction.  It is amazing how time slips past.  In 1980 the working party made comprehensive, specific recommendations about the composition, size and teaching complement of nurse training schools.  It would be remiss of me not to point out that I will be requesting the new board to work towards the implementation of the recommendations of the working party.  I know that the present board are preparing the ground in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately health is so emotional an area, so preoccupied with local issues and involvements that, in accordance with the working party report, there may well be need to close some of the schools and to amalgamate others into group schools.  I am only too well aware of how unpopular that kind of decision can be, the unpopularity it can provoke.  Therefore, the provision, as it stands, is a necessary one.  I would envisage that nine times out of ten the consent of the Minister <Col N="489" /> would be given, but in the one time out of ten it may be necessary for the Minister of the day and for all concerned to retain the protection afforded by the consent clause in this section.  That is my explanation of the situation as I see it at this stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I rise in support of our amendment to have the words &ldquo;with the consent of the Minister&rdquo; deleted.  In this respect I should have thought we were doing the Minister a favour &mdash; why employ a dog if the Minister himself is going to bark?  Throughout this Bill we see the phrase &ldquo;with reference to the Minister.&rdquo;  I have a letter here from the branch secretary of the Waterford Branch of the Irish Nurses' Organisation who points out that &ldquo;reference to the Minister&rdquo; occurs something like 46 times in this Bill.  We would have expected the new board to carry some responsibility. Indeed, in fairness to the Minister himself in these kinds of situations, if he is setting up a board as far reaching as will be this one, I would suggest that we give them some teeth to take decisions themselves and not thwart them at every hand's turn.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps we could have more clarification of what the Minister has in mind in the whole section.  We must separate this amendment from the overall section because there seems to be a contradiction here in that on the one hand, the Minister is saying the board will take decisions while, on the other, he seems to be reserving the power to himself to override their decisions and decide cases without any consultation with the board. Perhaps the Minister would give us some indication of what he had in mind when the section was drafted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>In legislation there must be a form of appeal.  In the event of the board withdrawing approval of a hospital or institution under the section, they can do a number of things, they can go to the Minister of the day.  Constitutionally one could not deny a hospital or institution that entitlement.  Secondly, <Col N="490" /> under the Constitution they could go to court anyway.  In the interests of the ordinary development of the health services it is far better that they should have a right of appeal to the Minister of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>But not every Minister may be as reasonable as is the present one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what Ministers are there for.  I often take unpopular decisions, which is not a very pleasant exercise, but that is what Ministers are supposed to be there for.  It has never happened that when the board wanted to give or withdraw an approval an appeal upwards has arisen.  That is an interesting commentary on the situation since 1950.  I would envisage that in the overwhelming number of cases, ministerial consent would be given.  It is difficult to envisage a situation in which it would not be given but there could be one in which it would be very desirable for all concerned to retain the protection afforded by the consent clause.  We have a written Constitution throughout which the rights of the individual in terms of appeal and natural justice exist.  Therefore, no matter what statutory agency one sets up one has to enshrine in it the right of reference to a Minister and indeed he also must give way in terms of an appeal subsequently to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DonalOrmonde" hpid="Dr. Ormonde Dr. Ormonde">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>Repeatedly we have been told that this was contained in the 1950 Act &mdash; we were told the same in section 31 &mdash; and that, therefore, it is included in the 1984 Bill.  I would hope it is not being included just for that reason because things are very different in 1985 than they were in 1950 or 1951.  When this Bill was being redrafted, or reconstituted, I should like to think we started afresh, that we intended not so much to update a Bill by bringing forward what was included in the 1950 Act, as to adopt a totally fresh outlook on the whole matter.  It was for that reason that we were to bring in a new Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>While I would accept what the Minister said about the need in certain sections of the Bill to have ministerial consent, nevertheless in this Bill we are investing power and responsibility in An Bord Altranais to maintain standards.  I fail to understand why the Minister wishes to act as judge of their competence to do that.  We spent a longer time on section 9 than on any other section so far.  Section 9 refers to the composition of the Bill.  We have got a well-balanced board which is broadly representative. Obviously it will not please all the various vested interests.  If we stayed here until the end of 1985 we would not come up with a board of 29 members which would cater for all the various interests as they would see it.</P>
      <P>After a very long and arduous debate in the House we came up with a board of 29 members which is broadly representative. When 17 members are elected by the nurses and 12 are appointed by the Minister we will have a board who will be quite competent to make the necessary decisions to ensure that we will maintain a high level of nursing standards.  In a section where it is not necessary to have ministerial consent or direction, we should not insert them just for the sake of having them in the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make one general final comment.  Apart from the reasons I have already mentioned I want to point out that there is both a training and a service implication, and particularly a service implication in the withdrawal of recognition.  I am not suggesting the board would not give cognisance to the service implication.  The Minister of the day may be very preoccupied with the service implication.  The question of replacing the service implication of student nurses would have to be considered by the Minister.  In so far as training and service are enmeshed, it has to be recognised that, when a decision is being taken about a large element of service in the hospital, the Minister should be consulted by the board and his consent sought.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23 are related. Amendment No. 23 is an alternative to amendment No. 22.  We could take amendments Nos. 21, 22 and 23 together.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">

      <P>I move amendment No. 21:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (5), line 17, to delete &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;High Court&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is similar to the last amendment we discussed.  Subsection (5) of section 35 reads:</P>
      <P>A hospital or an institution of which the Board has refused to approve may apply to the Minister to direct the Board to approve of it and if the Minister, after consideration of the facts of the case, gives the direction, the Board shall approve of the hospital or institution.</P>
      <P>This gives power to the Minister which many Ministers would not want.  If An Bord Altranais decided to close down a training school in the Minister's constituency, he might have difficulty in going along with that decision.  In this subsection it would be much more appropriate to have the appeal to the High Court.  If the Minister accepts an appeal to the High Court in line 17 we have to substitute the word &ldquo;court&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;Minister&rdquo; in line 18.  That is the reason for the two amendments in my name.  If my amendment is accepted, amendment No. 23 will not be necessary.  I have no hangup about whether amendment No. 22 or amendment No. 23 is accepted.  The principle is that, if the board decide to withdraw approval from a training school, an institution or a hospital, the application should be to the High Court rather than to the Minister, and it would be the court who would reverse the decision rather than the Minister.</P>

      <P>I support the amendments substituting the High Court for the Minister in subsection (5).  I also <Col N="493" /> support the points made by Deputy O'Hanlon.  This would be better for the Bill, particularly as in an earlier section of the Bill the Minister had no problem about making the High Court the immediate source of appeal.  The High Court should be inserted in this subsection also.</P>

      <P>I support the other speakers on this amendment.  It is a matter of great prestige for hospitals to have a nursing school.  My own hospital in Ardkeen is the only one in the south-east to have such an honour.  To have such a facility withdrawn would be very serious for any hospital.  Our interest is to protect the Minister to a great extent.  As Deputy O'Hanlon said, the Minister could be put in a very invidious position if a nursing school in a hospital in his own constituency had approval withdrawn.  This could make life very difficult for him.  It is with this in mind that we are proposing this amendment.  The issue is grave enough to have it referred to the High Court and a decision taken there rather than landing it on the lap of the Minister.  In all honesty we are making this proposal in the interest of the Minister.</P>

      <P>I regret that I am unable to accept the amendments.  I am a little surprised at the reaction to this subsection because the whole section has stood the test of time over the past 35 years and has not given cause for embarrassment to the board in all those years. I am aware that the board laid down stringent standards for the training schools.  If hospitals do not accept these standards, those claiming recognition would not be left in any doubt about their shortcomings by the board and the hospitals would have to accept that state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, we must have provision for appeals in the interest of justice and fair play.  In the first instance, appeals should be to the Minister, who is supposed to be making an input into the hospitals, who is in charge of the health services.  With all due respect, the High Court does not run the health services.  In any event, if the Minister should decide to overturn <Col N="494" /> the views of the board he would have to justify it.  He would have called on the Department experts to assess the merits or otherwise of appellant training schools.  Then, if the training school felt that the whole thing was totally unjustified and unlawful, they would have the right of appeal to the High Court.  This right is implicit in all legislation.</P>
    <P>Of course, we should not be calling on the High Court at every hand's turn, particularly in this instance in regard to the training schools.  The provision as drafted here does not preclude a hospital or other institution from appealing to the courts if they should wish to do so, and obviously there would be an appeal to the courts if the appeal to the Minister failed.  That is adequate protection.</P>
    <P>There was an original objection from the Conference of Major Religious Superiors of Ireland who suggested that the Minister for Health initially would be involved in the opening of a hospital training scheme.  I will not have any function in regard to initial approval by the board of a hospital as a training school, so that interpretation is not correct.  I assure Deputies that legal advice was obtained to the effect that there is nothing in the legislation to preclude the hospitals from appealing to the High Court.</P>
    <P>As I have said, the Minister for Health is supposed to be in charge of the health services and I am afraid Ministers for Health have not been anxious to take hard-nosed decisions in relation to training hospitals of which, possibly, we have four or five too many.</P>

      <P>The Minister has just raised a fundamental issue.  He said the Minister is supposed to run the health service.  This seems to run throughout this and other legislation.  On the issue of a clearly defined role for the Minister and, in this case, for the board, as Deputy Ormonde said, there are three references in the Bill to the Minister and to ministerial powers.  It appears as if the Minister is supposed to be running the health services, so what is the role of the health boards or, in this instance, of the board <Col N="495" /> provided for in relation to training schools?  I see a certain overlapping here and it is important that we should deal with the respective role of the Minister and the new board.  I should like the Minister to elaborate on this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It boils down to the fact that any Government worth their salt would run the health services.  They provide the money for the training schools in the hospitals.  One would swear that the hospitals were running flag days every day of the week to pay for student nurses.  The Exchequer pays for them. The Minister must have some fundamental executive powers in this matter and the powers being given in the Bill are reasonable.  He is not taking on himself any function in regard to the initial approval of a hospital as a training school. Hospitals now have become super-duper institutions, very expensive, and if the board propose to withdraw recognition of a hospital as a training school there is the right of appeal to the Minister.</P>
      <P>We all know that health boards would have an enormous problem in relation to servicing an area if recognition was withdrawn from a training school.  Such major service problems might not be known to the board here being established because they might not have a wide view of a particular area.  However, there is adequate appeal machanisms in the section.  There has to be a political as well as a judicial element in this and we cannot be running to the High Court in the first instance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Minister that the number of appeals will be few and far between and if appeals to the Minister are not successful training schools can appeal to the High Court. What we are suggesting is that the middleman be left out.  I was glad to hear the Minister saying that he who pays the piper should call the tune in relation to the health services.  That may well be, but members of health boards throughout the country would take a different view in relation to financial allocations.  If one <Col N="496" /> wants to take it upon oneself to call the tune then I suggest that person does it all the time and not be selective.</P>

      <P>It depends on the tune one wants to play.  We play a global tune and local people want to play a local tune.  We make broad allocations of money and the health boards spend it at local level.  Frankly, at the rate some health boards whine at what they get we would nearly be better off doing the whole job for them.  However, that is a policy decision and I am not Erskine Childers.</P>

      <P>It is important that in this legislation we define the role of the Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> An Bord Altranais. From what the Minister has been saying it appears that because the Exchequer provides 90 or 95 per cent of the finance he has the sole control of the administration of the health services.  In this regard we are talking about the health services, nurse training schools and the 65 hospitals. It is relevant to know the function of the health boards.  We must be told if they will take directions solely from the <Col N="497" /> Minister in administering the services.  It appears from what the Minister has said that because the Exchequer provides more than 90 per cent of the finance the Exchequer should have sole control and that health boards and An Bord Altranais will only administer the various schemes. The Minister made it clear that the Minister of the day should be running the health services.  It is important in the context of this Bill that we should clarify the role of the Minister <i>vis-à-vis</i> the role of An Bord Altranais.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important to point out that the section we are discussing relates to grounds of appeal to the Minister in the event of a refusal by An Bord Altranais to approve of a training school as distinct from the closing down of one or the non-recognition of one.  A hospital or institution may apply to the Minister to direct the board to approve of it.  The Minister may, after consideration of the facts of the case, give the direction and the board shall approve the hospital or institution.  The prospect of that arising is remote.  We have too many such schools and the prospect of a whole range of new developments is unlikely.</P>
      <P>I must stress that this can only be taken to the High Court if the institution involved feels it has been treated unlawfully or unfairly.  That institution can only go to the High Court on a point of law.  The form of appeal is more than adequate at this stage.</P>

    <P>The subsection specifically refers to a hospital or institution while other sections refer to a &ldquo;hospital, institution or body.&rdquo;  Why is there no reference in subsection (1) to a &ldquo;body&rdquo;?  In the event of future central training arrangements for nurses with affiliated hospitals on community placements there is not in the Bill any approval for a body such as a health board to provide for the selection of specific assignments.

      <P>Subsection (2) states:</P>
      <P>(2)  For the purposes of giving effect to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section the Board may, by rules, specify conditions of suitability for hospitals and institutions.</P>
      <P>Has the Minister any idea of what the rules and conditions will be?  The Minister mentioned the question of reducing the number of training schools from 65 to 15, a fundamental departure from present circumstances.  The Minister has told us that since 1950 very few training schools have closed.  I can recall that one school, St. Brigid's in Ardee, closed.  As legislators we should examine closely any proposal to reduce the number of training schools from 65 to 15.  We should not reduce the number for economic reasons if they are providing an input into the delivery of health care.  Training schools provide a very good input into the delivery of health care provided they are up to standard.  We should be slow to encourage their closure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From what the Minister has said it appears that a Minister could use his authority to ensure that training schools are closed in certain areas where they are providing this input.  That brings me to the question of the role of health boards. <Col N="499" /> Have they any function other than to deliver the services as directed by the Minister?  The recommendation of the working party to reduce the number of training schools from 65 to 15 is something we should be concerned about.  I do not think such a move would be in the interests of the people so we should give some thought to that recommendation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>A great deal of work is being done preparing the criteria for suitability.  As late as September 1984 discussion documents and drafts on the criteria for approval and inspection of schools of nursing and midwifery issued. I can assure the Deputy that we will take very careful note of his observations in that regard but I do not want to elaborate further on this because this could be the basis of a debate which could take a great deal of time.  As I said, the Deputy can be assured that we have taken note of his views which, in my view, will fit into the framework of the Bill.</P>

      <P>I accept that this subject is worthy of more elaborate and serious consideration elsewhere but the Minister introduced the fact that the working party recommended that the number of training schools should be reduced from 65 to 15.  This is fundamental to this section which deals with the giving and taking of approval from hospitals with training schools.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In my health board area there were two training schools for psychiatric nurses, one in St. Brigid's, Ardee, and the other at St. Davnets, Monaghan.  The training school in St. Brigid's, Ardee, was closed ten years ago and the training school in St. Davnets, Monaghan, because of cutbacks, has not taken any students for the last three years.  This will cause a problem in the delivery of care to psychiatric patients because at some time in the future there will be a bottleneck.  There will be more elderly nurses and, depending how long the training school is closed, there will not be younger nurses to look after psychiatric patients.  This is something the Minister, <Col N="500" /> the legislators and the health boards should be concerned with.  This is all interlinked with ministerial powers, the role and functions of the health boards and, in this case, the role and functions of An Bord Altranais.  We must ensure that there are sufficient training schools to produce enough nurses to give adequate and proper care to patients.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy correctly made the point that they are all interlinked.  I hope to publish in the very near future the excellent and comprehensive report of the study group set up in 1981 to look into the general development of our psychiatric services.  That report has been presented to me and I will be bringing it to Government within the next week or two.  I can assure the Deputy that we need to have a complete and fundamental review of the role of our psychiatric hospitals and their training structures.  That is highlighted in many ways in this report.  I will be formally asking the board to review the rationalisation of the nurse training schools.  This will be one of the first questions I put to them arising out of the working party report.  We have a very bad record in implementing recommendations of various working parties.  This report was commissioned in 1980 or 1981.  This is 1985 and we are only receiving that report.  The quicker the board consult with the agencies concerned and the Department on this issue the better.  Section 35 gives the necessary protection at the end of the day.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 24:</P>
      <P>In page 17, subsection (2), line 26, after &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; to insert &ldquo;, but the Training Schools shall select their own candidates for nurse training&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="501" /> I consider this amendment as being of fundamental importance.  Section 36 (2) reads:</P>
    <P>The Board may, if it so determines, establish a central applications bureau to process applications from persons wishing to undertake training as a nurse.</P>
    <P>We would welcome the setting up of a central application bureau to collect applications from potential student nurses because nobody can be happy with the present system where a boy or girl writes to 65 training institutions and very often gets a negative reply from all.  We believe it would be in the interests of the potential students that there should be a central applications bureau.  We are very concerned about this section.</P>
    <P>We do not disagree with subsection (1) which gives the board power to lay down minimum educational requirements but we are concerned that the board would have the power to decide which students a hospital would take and we are also concerned that it is not written into the legislation that the training schools would select their own candidates and will make the final selection.  This is a very important section.  If my amendment were accepted subsection (2) would read:</P>
    <P>The Board may, if it so determines, establish a central applications bureau to process applications from persons wishing to undertake training as a nurse, but the Training Schools shall select their own candidates for nurse training.</P>
    <P>We believe that is fundamental.  The Minister in his closing statement on Second Stage referred to the analogy between the universities and the training colleges.  They are very different.  A student applies to a university, and that is an independent contract, whereas the student nurse goes into the hospital as an employee, and therefore, there is an employer-employee relationship.  It would be against the principles of the Constitution if we were to interfere with the employer-employee relationship by <Col N="502" /> not giving the employer a say in who will be selected as the employee, in this instance, a student nurse.  Subsection (3) states:</P>
    <P>Any hospital or institution approved of by the Board pursuant to section 35 of this Act may not, without the consent of the Board, accept for training any person who is not approved of and recommended by the Board.</P>
    <P>We accept that the board have the right to lay down the minimum educational requirements necessary for entry into a hospital for training as a nurse.  We also accept that the board, if they so wish, may set up an applications bureau to collect applications and to process them to see that the applicant has the minimal educational standards required.  We believe that it is fundamental that the training school have the final right of selection, particularly in regard to the employer-employee relationship.  It is also very important that the character and ethos of hospitals are maintained.  That has always been important and has been written into legislation in the past.  It would be very wrong in this legislation to take away from hospitals the right to select their own students for their training schools.</P>
    <P>In relation to subsection (3), I could envisage a situation where a voluntary hospital, with a mission abroad, might wish to take in a student nurse from a Third World country.  They should have the right to train a nurse and send him or her back to that country.  An embargo should not be placed on them by that subsection.  I ask the Minister to accept amendment No. 24 that training schools shall select their own candidates.  I also ask him to delete subsection (3).</P>
    <P>With regard to the right of hospitals to maintain their own character and ethos section 14 of the Hospitals Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, states:</P>
    <P>(1)  The following functions in relation to the participating Hospitals (in this Act referred to as functions assigned to the Council) shall be performed by the Council.</P>
    <P>(2)  The Council shall not assign any <Col N="503" /> visiting medical staff to a participating Hospital of a particular denominational character unless the assignment is in accord with such character save with the approval of the Hospital Board concerned.</P>
    <P>(3)  In the exercise of its functions in relation to the co-ordination of the activities of the Hospitals in the matter of nursing education and the conduct of the negotiations in regard to such matters with An Bord Altranais, the Council shall take no account which would operate to&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  involve a student nurse in any arrangement for attending lectures on the ethics and psychology of nursing which do not conform to her religious beliefs, or</P>
    <P>(b)  interfere with the autonomy of a nursing school attached to any participating Hospitals of a particular denominational character.</P>
    <P>That is already written into legislation in relation to the Hospital Federation and Amalgamation Act, 1961, and it was very sensible and wise at the time.  We should ensure that we do not do anything in this legislation which would interfere with the right of a training school to select their own candidates or with the character and ethos of our hospitals.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I will make some observations which may be helpful.  I know that many Deputies have had approaches about the proposed central applications bureau and how it will work. Deputy O'Hanlon and others have approached me in regard to this matter and have expressed concern, a concern which has also been voiced by some managers of voluntary nurse training hospitals. I recently met representatives of the Conference of Major Religious Superiors whose members include those concerned with managers.  I had lengthy discussions with them and I explained that this section is an enabling provision which would allow the board to establish a central applications bureau.  If the bureau is established &mdash; and it is my wish that it <Col N="504" /> should be established &mdash; its operation will be determined by the board and it will set down various rules for the operation of the CAB.</P>
      <P>I subsequently arranged for the conference to meet members of the staff of the present board.  They met Sister Columba, Sister Carmel, John Foster, Noel Daly and Jerry Donnellan on 15 January and they had a very interesting discussion. They were informed of the thinking of the present board in terms of a central applications bureau and I gather that the chief executive officer of An Bord Altranais has agreed to liaise with the secretary general of the conference on developments from now on.</P>
      <P>The working party, which had many representatives from the voluntary hospital side, made a very compelling case in favour of a meaningful &mdash; to use that awful word &mdash; central applications bureau.  Their case was cogent and compelling and, even if the working party had not suggested it, I would have put it into the Bill in the interests of equity among applicants for student nursing &mdash; God knows this has been lacking here in terms of recruitment of student nurses &mdash; and also in the interests of efficiency.  Deputies will agree that a progressive step in any field is always accompanied by misgivings, particularly by those who perceive that they are going to lose a privilege or a certain role.  The operation of a central applications bureau will be in the hands of representatives of the nurses who will determine entry into nursing.  I do not accept &mdash; I want to be very clear and firm in this regard &mdash; that the CAB could be simply an efficient sorting office and no more than that or a kind of vague reference system.  It has to be something more than that if it is to serve the needs of nurse training.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon has put down two amendments.  At this stage I am not prepared to accept amendment No. 25 but I am prepared to examine it on Report Stage. It would be administratively undesirable to operate if a central applications bureau was not established.  If for example there was a gap of six months between the <Col N="505" /> setting up of a Central Applications Bureau that section would have to operate and would cause all kinds of problems. For administrative convenience I am prepared to look at amendment No. 25.</P>
    <P>The working party on general nursing were quite specific with regard to the overwhelming influence which the training schools would have in relation to the CAB.  They stated that the Central Applications Bureau should be as representative as possible of all nurse training schools and of all other bodies interested in the recruitment and training of nurses. They stated that the committee of the CAB should have approximately 20 members appointed by An Bord Altranais, 15 of whom would be appointed by the board on the nomination of the schools.  The voluntary hospitals will have nominations to the CAB and will have a very big role to play but it will be a role based on equity of application and selection of students in the services.  I thank Deputies for giving me an opportunity to put that much on record at this stage.</P>

      <P>The Opposition are now on their third attempt to row back from a decision taken twice by this House to support the national plan <i>Building on Reality</i> and to try to reopen the whole question in a manner which does not really address any of the policies that are in place and which will not produce constructive proposals to deal with the problems which we face which are widely recognised in the House and which were dealt with at some length last night by my colleague, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism.</P>
      <P>In spite of what the Opposition said last night and in spite of the line they have taken, the kind of programme they are talking about in the motion which they have down on the Order Paper actually exists.  It exists in the national plan which, as I said in the House before and as the Taoiseach said when he introduced the plan to the public, is the first time a Government have stated for three years in advance their expenditure plans on both the current and capital side and have set out clearly what amounts to a picture of the total financial resources available to the Exchequer over that period and the disposition of those financial resources to meet the policy requirements that are identified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all at one in the House on identifying &mdash; it is not today or yesterday it happened &mdash; the absolute necessity for us to take whatever measures are in our power to deal with the problem of unemployment. Deputies opposite and Members on this side have made it very clear that they see a particular problem in relation to people who are long-term unemployed and young people who are <Col N="507" /> unemployed.  The latter part of the problem could do with a bit more calm analysis than it often seems to get.  I remember an educational correspondent of one of the national newspapers carried out her own examination of the problem of youth employment and found &mdash; this was confirmed by the chief executive of one of the State agencies operating in the area &mdash; that the record of young people coming onto the labour force for the first time and getting employment after the various training and work experience courses was a lot better than it is popularly supposed to be.  I make that point to put it on the record of the House. Deputy Ahern will agree that there is enough discouragement around without making people believe that a particular situation is more difficult than it actually is.  It leaves us with the undoubted problem of the long-term unemployed which we must redress.  I intend to come to that in a few minutes and will have something more specific to say.</P>
    <P>The plan sets out a programme over the three year period 1985, 1986 and 1987.  The programme does the kind of things the Opposition are calling for in their motion.  The motion requests the Government to undertake an immediate and comprehensive programme of investment and other measures designed to provide employment and alleviate the widespread hardship caused by mass unemployment and to halt the rising tide of emigration.  It is couched in language which makes it clear from the beginning what the tone of the Opposition's address will be.  I am bound to say that, having reviewed the kinds of things that were said in the House last night by the Opposition they are acting &mdash; I suppose one can understand it from a political point of view &mdash; as if the national plan had never been published and there was no policy framework over the next three years for either investment or action on the current expenditure side.  They are acting as if there was no policy designed to bring these things about.  That is not the case.  There is a body of policy covering all these points and it does more than <Col N="508" /> cover them.  It sets out very clearly the amount of financial resources that will be available to the Exchequer and the public authorities over that period and not just the financial resources that are available from within the country by means of taxation or the capital we can raise here.  It also sets out the amounts we expect in total, including the contribution to the total amount of resources made available by foreign borrowing.</P>
    <P>If the Opposition are saying we should have a greater volume of investment in the public capital programme, which is the area they are specifically addressing, than is provided for in published Government policy, there may be an argument there that could be sustained.  That is one of the aspects of policy for the next three years we examined very closely before we published the plan.  If that is what the Opposition are saying they must go the rest of the way.  There is no doubt but that if we were to follow that course and use more of the resources we will have over the next three years for capital projects of the kind talked about by some Deputies opposite the inevitable result is we will have to divert funds into that area and away from other areas of expenditure. Where will we divert them from? We will divert them from current expenditure. I should like the Opposition to tell me what areas of public expenditure they want to see reduced over the next three years in order to make possible the kind of things that underlie their motion. I know from my experience of over two years in this position that that will be met with a deafening silence.</P>
    <P>The Opposition are in a position where they say we need more capital investment. They also say they are against any kind of restriction on current spending. They have completed the hat trick now in the last few months by saying the Government are not making progress rapidly enough in reducing the current budget deficit.  From time to time in their wilder flights of fancy when certain Members of the Opposition become involved in the financial area they say equally inconsistent things about the way we go about borrowing to fund the kind of programmes <Col N="509" /> we have.</P>
    <P>There are no two ways about it.  If the Opposition are saying we should put more money into the capital expenditure side in the next three years they are also saying, if they are any way consistent about it, we should put less money into the current expenditure side.  I should like them to tell the House and the public what areas of public expenditure they will cut over the next three years.  If they were talking about making a large addition on the capital side they would inevitably find themselves making large reductions on the current side.</P>
    <P>Anyone who has considered the general pattern of current Government expenditure knows that if substantial reductions are to be made in current expenditure, one must list the areas to concentrate on in order to find the money.  More than 80 per cent of total expenditure is in the areas of health, education, social welfare and environment. Consequently, the making of a substantial reduction to finance extra capital outlay would have to be in those four areas particularly.  One would be forced to look at those areas not because of having any hangup about expenditure on them but because they are the only ones big enough to be capable of yielding any kind of leeway that would make a substantial addition on the capital side. If the Opposition continue to refuse to face that fact they must consider the other possible option, to increase borrowing substantially.</P>
    <P>To many Members of the Opposition borrowing seems to be the answer to whatever problem we have.  Their attitude is to borrow more money in order to bring about immediate effects, but borrowing is deferred taxation.  We must repay such funds.  The interest must be paid during the term of the loan and the principal must be repaid at some time. Those moneys would come from tax revenue. If the Opposition are saying seriously that, in order to finance what they are advocating we should increase borrowing in that period, they must accept inevitably that there will have to be a bigger provision for the funding of <Col N="510" /> the debt, for the payment of interest and for the repayment of principal at some point.  Again, on the current side they would be forced into making room for that by reducing expenditure in some of the other current expenditure areas. Inevitably they would be forced into considering the four areas I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>That scenario was not referred to by the Opposition last evening.  It does not suit their case to make such references. Having regard to the point at which they start they appear to be doing themselves very little favour by adopting that line. Even if Fianna Fáil do not agree chapter by chapter with what is in the national plan &mdash; and I can conceive of that being the case &mdash; they would be doing a far more constructive and better job for the people for whom they are concerned, and I do not doubt that concern, if they took the plan and said that, &ldquo;in chapter so and so, we think that the balance is wrong, that a readjustment should be made.&rdquo; They should be prepared to put forward more specific proposals about a rebalancing of expenditure as between the capital and the current side or even a rebalancing of the current expenditure side as between different areas.  That kind of exercise, rather than the road they took in the discussion last night, would be far more in keeping with the concern they have expressed.</P>
    <P>To an extent the Opposition have tried to reconcile their very ambivalent budgetary stance by resurrecting this old proposal of the self-financing tax cuts.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend saying something about that.  The proposal is very seductive, one that has attracted quite a few adherents recently.  Just before Christmas the Opposition found a list of areas in which they considered more money should be spent.  The changes they proposed would, in their full flowering, amount to £600 million in a year.  Now they are trying again to peddle the myth that we can have high spending and low taxes.  Even their own most recent two <Col N="511" /> experiences in Government should have shown them that that is not a combination that would ever work, that it is Alice-in-Wonderland stuff.  I have a very clear memory of Deputy MacSharry as Minister for Finance in the middle of 1982 trying to explain why his tax revenue was so far off target.  That was a very painful experience for him as it must have been for the Government of the day, but it should have made them realise that it is not possible to have a situation in which by looking into one mirror you can reduce taxation while at the same time by looking into another mirror you can extend expenditure almost infinitely.</P>
      <P>If Fianna Fáil believed in the principle of self-financing tax cuts surely that time between March 1982 and December of that year was the time to have tried it, but they did not do so.  I was not privy to their discussions but I recall their reaction on finding that their revenue figures were so far off target.  Their reaction was not to opt for self-financing tax cuts but for reductions in expenditure and that was the line they took in July 1982.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I submit that the Opposition do not really believe in a general way in the principle of self-financing tax cuts but they are cynical enough to throw out the idea when they are in Opposition. Despite what Deputy O'Kennedy seems to think about such a policy, the party opposite have more sense than to try it when in Government.  They owe it to themselves and to the people they represent to be straight enough in Opposition not to propound such a policy as the universal solution for all our ills.  If the price of almost any commodity is reduced there is more than a fair chance that sales of that commodity will increase, though there are commodities in respect of which the theorists tell us that sales would fall in the event of a price reduction.  However, I do not notice many of those in the economy at present.  If tax is a large element in the price of some commodities as has been the case in this country for many years, there is a fair chance that on a reduction in the price of the commodity sales would increase substantially so that <Col N="512" /> over a period there would result a big enough increase to allow for a situation in which we would begin to replace the revenue that would have been lost by the price cuts or the tax cuts.  But it will happen over a period.  The example of which Deputy Burke reminded me is a very good one in that regard.  We reduced the excise duty on spirits last October &mdash; I am sorry that Deputy Ahern made that remark <i>sotto voce.</i></P>

      <P>We looked at a range of products and picked the one that we thought would give the fastest response in terms of an increase in sales.  The space of a few months is not enough in which to judge it but from the evidence we have, had we not reduced the excise duty on spirits last October, the revenue from excise duties in 1984 would have been higher than it was but the sales of spirits would have been lower.  For a range of products I have no doubt that a price reduction would lead to an expansion in the volume of sales, but it would take time.  During that period of time we would be at a loss of revenue.</P>

      <P>A couple of weeks ago Deputy O'Kennedy, who met a few groups in different trades who were making a case for that kind of reduction, said that Fianna Fáil believed in the idea but that they would not necessarily tie themselves to the figures.  What kind of contribution is that for the Opposition to make to a suggestion of that kind?  It shows that either they do not believe it or that they believe what I say, which is that it would take time to make up the revenue.  They have committed themselves to agreeing to a package of cuts. Looking at that package and making all possible allowances for the effects of the reduction on the volume of sales and consumption, I would reckon that even given the saving that they talk about there would be a net loss of revenue of around £40 million a year in that and it would build up to £100 million.  There would be a loss of revenue over a period.</P>

I would worry about the consequences <Col N="514" /> on the people who will be affected just as I would worry about the consequences of some of the suggestions made by the Opposition in which they argue for the expansion of capital expenditure now and over the next couple of years and the reduction of current expansion.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the 10 minutes I have been given although it will not be possible to deal effectively with our amendment in that time.  There is a danger in allowing a debate on a crisis like this to descend into charges from one side or the other.  As the Minister said, he is prepared to debate his national plan and whether or not there should be changes of investment.  I would take a different approach to this problem of unemployment.  It derives directly from an ideological position on the questions of employment, resources and finance.  It is popular in this House to decry ideol <Col N="515" /> ogy.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, last night said that we should not have any hangups about ideology and that it was necessary to tackle unemployment as he outlined.  The Minister's suggestion had a very clear ideological base.  The answer he received from the Labour Party today that they are not happy with the ideological position he adopted in relation to the NDC should give anyone who believes that there is no such thing as ideology in this House food for thought and they should decide for themselves where they stand on the issue of unemployment and how it can be solved.</P>
      <P>I listened carefully to Deputy Ahern last night.  I was not surprised at the position he took but I was disappointed because I thought he would have had a more radical approach.  The Government side referred to his approach as an 1930s approach and that is what it was in terms of the Fianna Fáil of the 1930s.</P>
      <P>Why is it that since 1920 no matter who was in power we have always had an unemployment crisis?  We have never had an unemployment rate of less than 60,000.  Even at the end of the boom times our unemployment rate was 65,000 and it now stands at 250,000.  The enormity of the failure of any of the alternative parties, the Fine Gael-Labour Coalition and the Fianna Fáil Party, is demonstrated by the size of the Irish born immigrant population in Britain and US.  In Britain alone one million Irish born people are living and the emigration pattern has started again.  People are once again emigrating to Britain in search of work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Effectively, what I am saying is that the reason for the present crisis is precisely that there has been a commitment down through the years since the establishment of this State to the ideology of private enterprise.  That, cut down to its barest bones, can be described as the attitude or approach that the only way for society to become organised is to allow people to make a profit.  That gives rise to a whole range of other attitudes and approaches, one of which at Government level is that it is the job of Government to create conditions to allow people to <Col N="516" /> make profits.  That is precisely the approach which this Government are adopting, even with the presence of the Labour Party.  It is precisely the approach that Fianna Fáil Governments adopted in the past and, no doubt, will adopt in the future if they get back into Government.</P>
    <P>I would argue that it is the evidence of history that private enterprise has failed in this State and that the only way of realistically tackling the problem would be to take a completely different approach.  The Government of the day, elected democratically by the citizens of this State, must plan the development of the resources of the State to ensure that every person capable of working has the opportunity of working.  Private enterprise clearly has failed to do that during the course of the history of this State.  In the few moments left to me, I would refer to a number of points which perhaps highlight this.</P>
    <P>On the question of resources &mdash; for example, natural gas &mdash; the policy of the present Government is to burn it, to use it for very little else except for the NET factory &mdash; to burn it off as fast as possible, this despite the fact that the use of that gas in manufacturing industry could create real, sustainable, productive jobs and increase the wealth of this country.</P>
    <P>In the lead and zinc mines in Navan, one of the largest of such mines in Europe, again these minerals are dug out of the ground and exported.  No effort whatsoever is made to try to ensure that the lead-zinc ore is smelted, or used to create any kind of productive jobs, not in any other State but in this State.</P>
    <P>We know that there is oil.  To what extent is unknown to us here in this House, strangely enough, but the multinationals seem to know how much is there and have gone to the trouble of reopening the Whiddy oil terminal, presumably to benefit from the oil which is being discovered.  The whole concentration of effort in relation to oil by this and previous Governments has been the tax take which it is possible to get from it. No consideration, apparently, is given to how that oil can be used in this State to create productive, worthwhile jobs and <Col N="517" /> increase the productive wealth of this country.</P>
    <P>On the question of land and agriculture, this is a resource which reproduces itself all the time.  Where is the Government plan to develop this resource in a planned way.  Where are the plans to develop a proper food processing industry?  We could go on all night, but they are the basic resources, apart from our young population.  They are the ingredients.  What is absent is the finding out of how these resources can be used to provide jobs, not in other states but in this State.  That is an ideological question. The private enterprise system has been given its chance.</P>
    <P>I conclude by saying that the Labour Party involved in the present Government will have to think very clearly about what they are doing in that Government. Why are they lending an air of respectability to a private enterprise Government which is presiding over growing unemployment?  They must decide to pull out and to come with us in The Workers' Party to provide an alternative &mdash; a real Socialist alternative to the private enterprise parties, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened to the contribution of the Minister for Finance. During the course of that contribution he referred on a number of occasions to the cynicism apparently, of the Opposition. I would return the charge on the Minister and say that in his 25 minute speech he made no proposal with regard to the tackling of the unemployment and other economic problems which face this country today.  He made no attempt to justify the amendment which he put down to the very reasonable proposal which we put before this House tonight.  Instead, he trotted out the old charge of £600 million which we were supposed to have been spending as a party in the pre-Christmas period.  £600 million is a totally wrong level, but I ask him was it not reasonable for Fianna Fáil to propose that we should <Col N="518" /> as an island nation have a merchant shipping line which would provide us with facilities for our exports and also protect us in the event of any emergency, as did the previous Irish Shipping organisation? Was it wrong for us to ask that some action be taken to save the national disgrace of our ships being tied up across three Continents, Europe, Africa and Asia, and the shame being brought on and treatment being given to the employees of Irish Shipping?</P>
      <P>Was it wrong for us to ask this Government to keep Verolme Dockyards in Cork operating and not let them go into liquidation &mdash; a company which could and should have remained viable?  These are just two examples of the type of proposals which we were making before Christmas.  There are no Government proposals for jobs.  We are all too well aware that the greatest social and economic crisis which faces Ireland today is our unacceptably high and still growing level of unemployment.  Our people, and in particular our young people, could be forgiven for thinking that they face a future which is without hope other than the unemployment register or emigration.</P>
      <P>The challenge which we must face and answer is that of ensuring that forecasts of ever spiralling unemployment never become a reality.  This challenge must be met by Government undertaking an immediate and comprehensive programme of investment and other measures.  This type of Government action would receive a response from the Irish people and would bring forward a spirit of co-operation from individuals, local communities, public bodies, employers and employees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Unfortunately, this Government are incapable of providing this type of leadership which is required.  The Government, in their joint programme of 1982, talked of introducing measures immediately to tackle unemployment which at that stage stood at approximately 160,000.  In the latest published figures unemployment stands at 224,500.  However, Mr. Greene of the YEA talks of a figure of a quarter of a million.  This is, <Col N="519" /> of course, without taking into account emigration at all.  This figure alone is a clear condemnation of the failure of two years of Coalition mishandling of the economy.</P>
    <P>Having listened to the Minister for Finance here this evening I am further convinced that this Government are apparently unaware that there is a human factor and not just statistics involved in the unemployment register.  The human misery for the man or woman who through no fault of theirs finds themselves unemployed is something apparently this Government are unable to comprehend. There is also the effect on families, children and home life which apparently passes this Government by.  The Government response to the crisis is to ask this House and the nation to rely for a solution to the crisis on that dreary grey document, the national plan, which sees, even if it is a success, unemployment rising at the end of the plan's projected period in 1987 to 227,000 when one takes into account the fiddling around they are engaging in with regard to make-work projects.  Even that programme and its targets in regard to interest rates and unemployment are already out of tune and it has been published only about three months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>In calling for a programme of investment on the part of this Government unfortunately I am pessimistic of their record to date. Apparently they have a fixation about public expenditure control, the future prospects of our people apparently to be sacrificed on the altar of financial rectitude. We accept that the balance between Exchequer revenue and expenditure must be rectified over time.  However, the elimination of the current budget deficit must not be seen as a major economic objective but rather as a constraint.  All decisions about change in public expenditure and public sector borrowing should be taken in the context of the need to halt and reverse the continuing rise in unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="520" /> Not only have the Government lost their way but that failure is now being reflected in the loss of direction in some State agencies.  Regrettably, I must mention the IDA in this context.  I do that despite the announcement in Greystones today.  I congratulate all concerned in the project there and wish the project well. I hope there will be many more of them around the country and that there will be further good news in regard to employment for our people.  However, the IDA as an organisation has in the past served our people well.  But, if one is to judge from recent statements about job prospects for the immediate future and the response to problems in particular towns and regions, the IDA today are prepared to sacrifice their hard-won credibility and give the impression that they are rudderless. They give the impression of an organisation attempting to justify their existence.  A public relations blitz, which is apparently underway at present and which is patently out of touch with what is going on in the country jobswise, leads one to suspect that it is an organisation more concerned with maintaining a structure which was established for different times into the late 1980s and 1990s.  That is particularly sad because this country needs a strong, clearly led industrial organisation to tackle the challenges ahead, clear in its targets and the direction it should follow.  I call on this Government this evening to give this leadership to the IDA.  I call on the IDA themselves to face the challenge ahead without fear and with their long tradition of loyalty and service to our people.</P>
    <P>In assessing the country's capacity to find a solution to our problems it must be remembered that Ireland is a small country of 3,500,000 people.  We are also very small in terms of our share of total world trade, which is about .5 per cent. Any country which is so small on the world stage cannot blame international recession for its problems.  We can maintain and even expand our share of world trade in absolute and relative terms without its having an undue adverse effect on other countries.  An expansion from .5 per cent to .6 per cent of world <Col N="521" /> trade would constitute just a ripple in the overall pond of world trade but would totally solve our economic problems.  We need to identify specialist, high value market niches in which we can establish our search we must include every product and service industry in which we have resources and in which we can identify growth potential.</P>
    <P>In the home market the Government should initiate immediately a high power drive to maximise the potential of job creation and of Government purchasing. It should invest in a comprehensive campaign to promote the purchase of home-produced goods and services by our people, a call which I believe will find a ready response among our people.  For example, with a revitalised construction industry there is potential for £800 million worth of products to be manufactured at home with the jobs that would be created. I would ask in particular that the job potential of our agricultural produce be examined and in particular the elimination of wasteful food imports.</P>
    <P>I make these calls and suggestions to the Government for action more in hope than expectation of any activity because they are a Government divided among themselves.  We are one day only into this new term and already we see the divisions existing with regard to the National Development Corporation.  If they are not prepared to take the action so necessary then I would ask this Government to give hope to the country, hope to people on the dole, or do the honourable thing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister for Finance chose to leave after his usual lecture in his style of voodoo economics instead of looking at the real cause of our economic problems and facing up to them.  He should not come in to lecture us about what he sees to be the role of Opposition.  That is not what this Parliament is all about.  That is not the responsibility with which we are charged here. The Government should recognise some of their failures where such exist and be <Col N="522" /> honest enough to do something about them.  It is cosy to come into this House and start talking back.  I could sum it all up simply like this.  This Government were elected to do a job.  They took on the responsibility of Government to do that job.  They knew the problems the day they came into Government to do that job.  They set themselves a programme for Government which might as well have been thrown out the window because none of it is being implemented. It is the legitimate role of Opposition to come in here and put that fact in front of them as I have done many times in this House.</P>
      <P>I take grave exception to the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, coming in here saying that there has never been a constructive suggestion from this side of the House, that it is time we got our act together.  It is time this Government got their act together. Indeed I have always doubted that they had it together from day one.  On day one they knew exactly what actions they needed to take in order to solve our problems. They knew and set out what they would do.  But, instead of doing what they said they would do, they chose the easy options.  They knew that current expenditure had to be reduced but instead they reduced capital expenditure. They knew this economy could not take penal taxation, yet they imposed more and more with the result that they are now at a stage of diminshing returns. They have squeezed this economy to death.  The white economy is being squeezed to death while the black economy flourishes.  Until they over there recognise that that is a major problem in our economy then we and the people of this country will continue to cry in vain. Trying to get the message across to some Ministers on that side of the House, with responsibility for ordinary economic affairs, our industrial development, the creation of jobs and the fostering of investment, is like endeavouring to carry on a dialogue with the deaf.  We have been two years at it, trying time and time again to get through to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We told them what would be the result <Col N="523" /> of their huge increases in indirect taxation. We told them they would squeeze Irish industry out of business, and they have done just that.  We told them they would send trade over the Border; they have done just that.  The records showed time and time again that that would be the end result.  Any small farmer living within 40 miles of the Border can tell you that whenever the rates vary so much between up there and down here trade always goes up.  One does not have to have them identical but there must be a margin there.  The price of petrol constitutes another incentive to bring people across the Border.  We pointed out all of those dangers to them but it is like carrying on a dialogue with the deaf; there is no response.  Belatedly they took one action in relation to spirits. I presume they have the figures to prove whether that decision was right or wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a very poor reflection on the kind of society we are ordering in this country that our priority in this area alone was to reduce the price of spirits so that everybody could go off and get drunk.  Unfortunately, that is the way an awful lot of our people are feeling at present because they have given up the ghost.  Where has the shortfall in the taxation of the Minister for Finance arisen? He is £13 million down in corporation tax.  Does he know the reason?  Let him look at the return on capital investment in industry here over the last ten years and see what has happened.  It was 22½ per cent then; it is now down to 9½ per cent.  That is a crazy situation.  That is why factories are continuously closing here because they cannot manage on that sort of return.  What is their profit margin? What is their bottom line before they pay tax, dividends and huge interest rates?  It is now less than 4½ per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no way that you can run a business or a country with that sort of economic policy.  The sooner the people over there realise that running a business and running the country are in many ways <Col N="524" /> very similar, the better.  They should know what the real problems are and what is creating the problems.  Only then will they get on the right road and begin to realise what makes it tick, what makes the economy work and what makes business and the people work.  This country lacks national leadership and community motivation to make it work.  The Government have thrown in the towel.  They will not get out of the morass until they see what direction they should be moving in and set the country on that road.</P>
    <P>We have now reached a crazy and bizarre position in the lifetime of this Government.  We often wondered whether they could agree on anything. The haggling continues.  Last night the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism talked about the need to tackle the job problem with, whatever they like to call it, 250,000, 230,000 or 270,000 people unemployed, and the emigration figure whatever that is.  The central plank of his speech last night was the setting up of a National Development Corporation.  Nobody in this House is under any illusions about my views on the original National Development Corporation. I made them abundantly clear time and time again.</P>
    <P>We did not believe what the Government parties were saying during the last general election campaign.  Whatever about the corporation, at least it was to do something.  Now we do not know whether it will ever be set up.  We had a statement from the Parliamentary Labour Party &mdash; and I am glad to see the Minister here&mdash; setting out what they will accept in relation to the National Development Corporation.  I have to agree with part of their analysis.  They said the proposal is indefensible on commercial grounds.  In some respects it is. It is crazy for anyone in business to start up a new project, run it for a few years and have a predefined decision that it will be sold in three years.  How can anyone hope to get a price at the end of the day if everyone knows the project is for sale and has to be sold?  That was predetermined before they went into it.  That will <Col N="525" /> not operate successfully in the interests of the taxpayers.  It is crazy.</P>
    <P>The form in which the Minister spelled it out last night is a very pale shadow of what they agreed in their Programme for Government two years ago and what they set out as a central plank in their policy to combat unemployment.  This Government have always frowned on the National Enterprise Agency.  Why put on another layer of bureaucracy when there is already an agency there which can do the job?  They are not doing the job except in very minor areas because they do not know how long they will be there and what their future is.  I visited that agency.  They have some very good ideas. If the Government had given them the go ahead, they would have developed many of their ideas.  The Government have wasted over two years.</P>
    <P>What is the reality of setting up this corporation?  Let us look at the practical side.  The country will be very confused tonight because of the fact that the Parliamentary Labour Party do not accept what the Government have decided.  Perhaps they have not decided.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, responded to the Parliamentary Labour Party statement by saying he introduced a Government decision. If we are to have what the Minister said, I say to the Government that they should forget it.  If they get agreement they will bring legislation in to this House.  The Minister of the day will have to get a board of directors of some description.  He will have to go around and pick them.  They will meet and advertise for a chief executive.  That will take months.  The legislation will have to go through the Seanad as well.</P>
    <P>Twelve months after the legislation is passed they will be lucky if they have the board set up.  Then the chief executive has to employ his staff.  The Government should have a bit of sense and forget about it in the interests of the nation. They already have a good agency and if they want to make a few changes they should go ahead and do so.  At this stage in the lifetime of the Government the national development corporation will <Col N="526" /> not be functional in time to find any solutions to the serious problems facing us. That is a fact of life which cannot be denied.  Anyone who was ever in Government knows what the timelag is in setting up an agency.</P>
    <P>Last night the Minister said he never got any serious ideas from this side of the House.  Since I was made spokesman on Industry I made many suggestions, serious practical suggestions.  I should not have to remind the Government about some of them.  This time last year for nine months I had been making a case for venture capital to correct one of the basic ills and weaknesses of Irish industry, that is, the lack of an equity base.  I said venture capital was the road to travel.  I warned the Taoiseach of the problems he would face.  I said if he made it a complex scheme it would not work and he would get no response.  It has not worked.  It has been a dismal failure for the reasons I spelled out 12 months ago.</P>
    <P>In simple terms the reason it is a failure is this.  They locked in people.  If I invest £25,000 in venture capital and for one reason or another the company does not trade, not alone do I lose my money but I get no tax write-off for that £25,000.  I told the Taoiseach last year that if he did not allow institutional funds access to this, it would be a dismal failure because that is where the funds are for investment. He ignored that too.  The business funds available today which could go into productive investment are in unit trusts. There is legislation on unit trusts and this legislation debars them from taking part. The Taoiseach would not listen last year. Twelve months later when he sees it proved he should listen, and I hope that next week we will see the changes that can bring it in.  When a man puts in his money and is locked in for three years, he has no way of getting out.  He is given tax relief for three years only and he is locked in for five.  That system might as well never have been brought in.</P>
    <P>The Minister talked about workers sharing in profits in industry, that is assuming they make profits.  The very dismal failure shown here tonight in relation to industry is indicative of the fact <Col N="527" /> that profits will not be there to be shared until the ground rules are put right.  All this emanates from the lack of a proper economic policy.  The Government chose the wrong options.  They chose the soft options.  They crucified the people with penal taxation and left them no incentive to work, no incentive to invest.  We had the black hole last year.  I will be interested to hear if there has been an even bigger outflow this year.  The Government are not creating confidence.  The bizarre situation has now arisen that, when the Minister speaks, we do not know whether what he says is agreed policy, and we do not know whether it will ever be implemented.</P>
    <P>I made suggestions in this House about the fundamental problems of the food industry and they were ignored.  We had a task force of Ministers running around the country.  Their only contribution was to say they would appoint an international consultant.  The Government are continuing to bungle the development of our natural resources of oil and gas. They are hung up on an ideological argument between themselves.  In October 1982 I made a decision that Limerick, Clonmel and Waterford should get natural gas.  Limerick Corporation, then dominated by the Coalition, took a decision that they would take a minority interest in it.  Two years and five months later not a single thing has been done about bringing gas to Limerick, Clonmel or Waterford.  They bungled the £600 million gas deal with the North of Ireland. They should have gone ahead with it because intrinsic in that is an opportunity for the horticultural industry to develop.</P>

The opportunities are there but they are being lost to the economy by a Government continuing to fumble, who are bungling the development of our natural resources of oil and gas.  Opportunities to develop the agricultural industry and to stop imports have been fumbled.  There have been no <Col N="528" /> efforts made to provide cheaper natural gas to the agricultural industry so that farmers could try to compete with their overseas rivals.  The Government have had these opportunities but they are hung up by ideological arguments.  They should stop coming in here to give us lessons and sermons.  When I was in Government I reduced expenditure in my Department by £23 million.  I produced an Estimate for 1983, which Deputy Bruton inherited, showing a reduction of 21.4 per cent from 1982.  It is a Government's duty to manage the economy and our chief duty is to offer constructive criticism and suggestions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Deputy Reynolds is a practical man and I have a certain regard for him, but he did not refer to a single thing which his party brought him into the Dáil with in 1977.  He did not refer to the &ldquo;Seán Lemass-type National Development Consortium&rdquo; which Deputy O'Malley made damn sure would never get off the ground.  They were talking of &ldquo;tens of thousands of jobs only waiting to be created&rdquo;, but never an office was provided, or a telephone, or even an office boy, let alone a chief executive. There would be 10,000 jobs through the exploitation of resources.  They were to reduce unemployment by 5,000 in 1977, by 20,000 in 1978, in 1979 by a further 25,000 and by 30,000 in 1980.</P>

      <P>My party will put up with that and that is why I am proud to be allowed to remain a member of it.  The speech of Deputy Bruton last night referred to the National Development Corporation.  I want to say in a frank, open and, may I say in respectful and affectionate terms, before the Labour Party make an issue of the National Development Corporation that I hope they will tell the people and get it clear among themselves what jobs the corporation will do.  I hope Deputy Bruton will tell me that, because from his speech I am not too clear or from the Labour statement, what is intended for the National Development Corporation.  It is no more clear to me then the &ldquo;Seán Lemass-type&rdquo; National Development Consortium was seven years ago.  Deputy O'Malley managed to put it on ice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the National Development Corporation, if we are committed to a deadline for selling something, obviously we are not in a seller's market any longer; <Col N="530" /> but there is no suggestion in what Deputy Bruton said that there will be a deadline. Presumably he will choose the right moment for selling the projects and for recycling the money into something new. That seems to me to make common sense.  Still I should like to know what kind of projects he has in mind.  Suggestions like this by Fine Gael and Labour should be put to the Dáil at an early date because even with the innocuous and rather inventive form Deputy Bruton has given to the thing, it is still not clear to me whether we will be wasting much money and time in developing this project. I will want to know what it will do before I will consent to it.</P>
    <P>I have a concrete suggestion which I hope will appeal to Deputy Reynolds.  If we are to have a National Development Corporation which is not out of harmony with what the <i>Building on Reality</i> programme envisages, I have a suggestion which I hope will go some distance to meet the Labour preference for investment in the building trade.  I suggest that they should embark on house renovation as it has been done in Holland, Denmark, in a couple of cities in Britain, in France and in Germany.  It involves the subsidisation of local authorities to take over and renovate properties that are going down hill.  There are many places in the city and the inner suburbs, 19th and 20th century buildings, which look fine on tourist posters but when you go close to them you will see 17 door bells on the doors.  This is even beginning to appear in my constituency, though I have moved further out.</P>
    <P>There is a real social role there for the local authority to take over these buildings and recycle them into private hands and then move on and do the same with other buildings.  There would be great sense in such an enterprise and it would be worth adding that to the list of the National Development Corporation. In a nutshell, I should like to appeal to the Coalition parties&mdash;&mdash;</P>

The people deserve better than that.  Every Deputy on the other side has a personal duty to look into his or her own heart and ask what contribution he or she can make to giving the people a more rational form of Government than the one being wished on them by the party opposite.</P>

      <P>In responding to this debate, I must say with regret that I find little of substance in the shallow arguments which have been advanced by the spokesmen on the opposite side of this House.  This is regrettable both in the context of the grave employment and economic problems which we face and in terms of the absence of a constructive approach by the Opposition towards any solution to those problems. Suffice to say that the Opposition's approach to the economic issue must be categorised as piecemeal and opportunistic, as is exemplified by the extravagant promises with which they have bemused interest groups throughout the country in recent months.</P>
      <P>In contrast the Government's strategy, as outlined in the national plan, presents a package of measures designed to maximise productive investment and job creation combined with a series of innovative manpower initiatives which are targetted directly at those among the unemployed who are experiencing the greatest employment needs.  This economic strategy is complemented by the social dimension of a plan which is the first document of its kind to place social and economic issues on a par with one another.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel that it is incumbent in the short time available to me that I should focus directly on certain of the mechanisms which the Government have decided to employ to boost job creation, particularly in the productive and commercial sectors of the economy.  It is important to counter <Col N="532" /> the sterile myths which seem to perpetuate the notion that the real prospects for growth and employment in our economy repose in an autonomous private sector. Recently, the advocates of the so-called &ldquo;small man&rdquo;, whose evangelism echoes so resoundingly in the State-assisted academies of learning and business have reached a crescendo in their critique of the public sector.  This new &ldquo;economic calvinism&rdquo; is more remarkable for its apparent justification by faith in the untrammelled operation of the so-called &ldquo;free-market&rdquo;.  These criticisms are frequently voiced by individuals who can hardly claim a lifetime's experience in the private sector or any encounter with the realities of managing a profitable business beyond the cushioned board rooms and consumption of conspicuous expenses.</P>
    <P>Overall policy must ensure the maximum contributions from both the private and public sectors, and the further evolution of co-operatives, including workers' co-operatives.  Public enterprise has contributed in a major way to the development of modern Ireland.  This cannot be denied even by the most Right wing ideologist.  The task is to re-unify the existing enterprises in the competitive commercial world of the eighties and plan for the effective expansion of new public and private enterprises.</P>
    <P>In this context, I should like to refer to the National Development Corporation. This matter has been under discussion in the Labour Party for many years and represents as far as we are concerned a crucial part of Labour policy.  There can be many legitimate points of view about the scope of the NDC, the nature of activities it should engage in and the types of control that are required for its effective operations.  As far as we are concerned the NDC will be involved in starting new productive projects on its own or in conjunction with the private or co-operative sector and in many other developmental tasks in key growth sectors of our economy.  The corporation will represent a major initiative geared towards the task of sustainable job-creation. The legislative basis for the corporation will be debated in the House in this <Col N="533" /> session and the Government are open to constructive suggestions and ideas for improvement.  We need in the future to direct our resources carefully and to get appropriate returns from investment in our semi-State commercial enterprises. The corporation will be a serious instrument of development.  It cannot as far as we are concerned be allowed and it will not be allowed to falter or to fail or disappear in any way.</P>
    <P>I have limited time and I have confined myself to concise remarks because of that.  The reality of our situation is that we need to foster enterprise in both the private and public sector of the economy without false or arbitrary distinctions as to the merits of either if we are to be able to succeed in solving our unemployment problem.</P>

      <P>It is difficult in the course of 13 minutes to encapsulate all the tragedy and trauma, the frustration and hardship that is present in so many of our homes today because of the unprecedented level of unemployment.  That is not a negative statement coming from the Opposition; it is a statement of fact. However, for reasons best known to themselves it appears that the Government are not prepared to accept that.  As an Opposition we are being appealed to not to be rocking this very tender boat, not to be criticising the Government. Minister Bruton last night staged a performance the likes of which I have never seen in the House.  In the course of the half hour's contribution he established that there was a greater obligation on the Fianna Fáil Opposition to prepare and produce policies to solve our unemployment crisis than there was on the Government. Naturally, I am flattered at the faith he has in Fianna Fáil.  I can assure him that at the earliest possible date we will demonstrate when the Government the capacity we have for so doing.  However, it is unreasonable of him to expect <Col N="534" /> that we should do it now.  More so it is unreasonable and untruthful of him to suggest that we are doing this solely for political purposes.  I wonder in what capacity are we here.  Are we not politicians? Is there not an obligation on us to demonstrate the appalling situation that exists today arising from the ineptitude of that which is masquerading as a Government not just for a day, a week, a month or a year but for almost two and a half years?  In that time we have not had anything from them except a litany of promises, platitudes, tunnels and lights at the end of them, poises for movement forward, left turn, right turn, back turn and be patient and Santa might bring a solution.</P>
      <P>It was suggested that we were being negative by raising the matter.  The Minister for Finance said that if Fianna Fáil had any sense of decency they would not be disturbing the Government in the fashion they are but rather would accept that the solution is in the great plan, <i>Building on Reality.</i> I suggest to the Ministers for Finance and Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism that the matter of the lack of faith that resides in the Government is not peculiar to the Fianna Fáil Party.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to the issue of the <i>Evening Press</i> of 28 December which dealt with a statement by the Taoiseach in the House on 14 December.  On that occasion the Taoiseach, as reported at column 3151 of the Official Report said:</P>
      <P>uniquely, we have done this while turning around the economy.  The drastic fall in living standards imposed upon our people by Fianna Fáil's policies has been halted, and our people in the years ahead can look forward to some recovery, even if modest...</P>
      <P>The collapse of employment to which Fianna Fáil policies had contributed has been halted, and this is in the process of being reversed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One week later there was a revelation. While the Minister for Labour was pursuing whatever he thought appropriate in America, the unemployment figure <Col N="535" /> increased by 11,000.  On 28 December 1984, following the statements by the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy J. Bruton, said on the Adjournment that we had turned the corner and that there was light, and following statements by the Minister for Finance in his typical professorial I-know-it-all fashion that &ldquo;we are on the right road but Fianna Fáil are thwarting us,&rdquo; an article appeared in <i>The Irish Press</i>, and I quote:</P>
    <P>FG TD's call to highlight jobs crisis.</P>
    <P>An unprecedented joint session of the Houses of the Oireachtas to focus attention on unemployment as &ldquo;the number one national priority facing the country&rdquo; was called for last night by a group of Fine Gael TD's and Senators.</P>
    <P>I do not know if Deputy Kelly was among them.</P>
    <P>Speaking for the group of six, Dublin South Central T.D., Mr. Gay Mitchell, said they would have had no bother in getting the support of thirty more for their request.</P>
    <P>I notice my colleague Deputy Gay Mitchell is not here, nor is Deputy Mary Flaherty, Deputy Mac Gahon or Deputy Richard Bruton.  Can I take the Deputies here and subtract them from the total to know who the 30 are?  Is that a Fianna Fáil statement?</P>
    <P>Mr. Mitchell said they had to take &ldquo;war-like steps, if you like&rdquo; to show the vested interests that a maximum effort must be made to combat unemployment...</P>
    <P>Mr. Mitchell said he believed there would be a &ldquo;groundswell of support&rdquo; among Fine Gael Deputies for special measures to be taken.</P>
    <P>As a party with a greater interest in unemployment problems than Fine Gael ever had, I assume the same unrest exists among the members of the Labour Party. I know that in their hearts Deputy O'Sullivan and Deputy McLoughlin feel as I do, that is, that the country was never in a worse position.</P>
    <P>All we ask in this motion is that the <Col N="536" /> House accepts what 30 members of the Fine Gael Party are prepared to accept outside the House and which I know every non-ministerial member of the Labour Party accepts.  I can appreciate that any member of the Labour or Fine Gael Parties who holds office is anxious to stay in office and will endeavour to do all in his power to reconcile his attitude to this national problem with his political ideology, but the country has not time for these Members to sort out these differences. What the country needs is an acceptance of the present appalling situation and policies to remedy it.</P>
    <P>I am not given to using economic jargon or clap trap, nor to the acceptance that this problem can be solved by the establishment of an agency.  As a normal educated person I see no reason why, in respect of our indigenous industries, and where the good Lord has given us the resources for food processing, agriculture, forestries, our seas and our building industry, it should not be possible from next week to create thousands of jobs, because when we subtract the net cost&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesCTunney" hpid="Mr. Tunney Mr. Tunney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>But we never had such a high unemployment figure.  Let us not think about the past.  It must be accepted that we have an educated workforce&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankMcLoughlin" hpid="Mr. McLoughlin Mr. McLoughlin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McLoughlin</NameTxt>
      <P>This was done before and we are still paying for it.</P>

      <P>If Deputy McLoughlin wants to opt out of the 30 he is welcome to do so.  If he is happy with his leader and accepts that everything is being done for the people in his constituency, that is his entitlement, but if he does this he will find himself among a very small group in his party.  When we take the difference between what is given to a person so employed and what he or she is getting from the Department of Social Welfare, we will see that the amount to be borrowed would be relatively small.  Not only would we be creating wealth but we <Col N="537" /> would give the people dignity, a feeling that they are making a contribution to their families, to the community and the nation; we would be giving them a reason for leaving the bed in the morning and even a reason to go to bed at night; we would be giving them an opportunity to feel a sense of personal satisfaction because they have made a contribution to the wealth of the nation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not agree with the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism that the greater problem lies with the long term unemployed.  For me the greater problem is the 70,000 plus intelligent, imaginative young people who are geared for work.  We are failing these young people if we do not provide work for them.  The Minister, Deputy Bruton, and his colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, accuse Fianna Fáil of trying to upset the people and the Government.  They say there is no problem. The Minister for Finance says he will solve this problem but he will not borrow.  Everybody knows our financial situation is worse now than ever before. This Minister for Finance has borrowed more in two years than any of his predecessors. <Col N="538" /> His budget deficit this year will be greater than ever before, one and a half times what it was when we were put out of office.  That Minister and the Taoiseach tell us everything that was wrong under Fianna Fáil's Administration has been halted since they waved their magic wand.  Imagine a Taoiseach being so out of touch that, when he is making a statement, he does not know the unemployment figure stood at 214,000 and within a week of making that statement, that it would increase by another 11,000.</P>
    <P>I said during the Adjournment debate that I was convinced the time had come when, if there was to be a future for this country the Taoiseach must be asked to resign and the Government must be asked to step aside.  In the parlance of the National Stadium people would say &ldquo;for God's sake throw in the towel.&rdquo;  In other areas, maybe the butchering trade, they would say &ldquo;for God's sake would somebody not use a humane killer&rdquo;?</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed injury benefit on 14 December in respect of an incapacity resulting from an occupational accident.  There is no trace of receipt of medical certificates beyond the first certificate received and accordingly disability benefit could not be paid on an interim basis.  Investigations confirmed the occupational accident on 11 December and that he had been absent from work due to the incapacity to 16 January 1985.  Injury benefit was allowed and payment has now been made in respect of the period from 11 December to 16 January.</P>
      <P>He had previously claimed disability benefit from 15 October 1984 and in this connection he was requested to attend for examination by a medical referee on 17 January 1985.  However, this examination did not take place on account of poor weather conditions.  In the light of the further information now to hand, it is no longer necessary to proceed with the examination.</P>

      <P>The person concerned is a landholder and an applicant for unemployment benefit.  He does not satisfy the contribution conditions of having 78 paid contribution in a three year period and his entitlement to unemployment benefit could not be determined until it was ascertained whether the income from his holding exceeded £2 daily.  Inquiries were recently completed after which a deciding officer assessed him with an income from his holding in excess of £2 daily and disallowed his unemployment benefit claim. He appealed against the disallowance of his claim and arrangements are being made for an oral hearing of his case next week.  His entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reviewed in the light of the decision of the appeals officer.  He is at present in receipt of unemployment assistance at £57.20 weekly pending the outcome of his appeal against the disallowance of his unemployment benefit claim.</P>

      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 3 September 1984 and was paid to 10 September 1984 after which date he was certified fit to resume work.  There is no record in <Col N="435" /> the Department of a claim to disability benefit from him subsequent to that date.</P>
      <P>It is a condition for receipt of invalidity pension that the claimant, apart from satisfying the contribution conditions, must be in continuous receipt of disability benefit for at least one year and be permanently incapable of work.  The person concerned claimed unemployment benefit from 18 September 1984 and has been paid to date.</P>

      <P>The unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned was disallowed from 17 September 1984 to 23 October 1984 on the grounds that he left his work voluntarily without just cause. Following a further review of his case his unemployment benefit claim was disallowed from 24 October 1984 on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking work and accordingly he did not fulfil the condition for entitlement to unemployment benefit of being available for work.</P>
      <P>He appealed against the disallowance of his unemployment benefit claim from 24 October 1984 and attended an oral hearing of his appeal on 21 December 1984.  The appeals officer also decided that he was not available for work and disallowed his unemployment benefit claim.  He has continued to sign at his local office and inquiries are being made to ascertain if he fulfils the condition for unemployment benefit in respect of the period following the disallowance of his claim by the appeals officer.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if he is aware that the Western Health Board has initiated legal proceedings against Galway County Council for payment of £2,151,512 supplementary welfare allowance; if he is aware that this demand is completely out of proportion to the contributions of local authorities in other health board areas; and if he will now agree to meet a deputation from Galway, Mayo and Roscom-mon County Councils to discuss the payment of the sum now being demanded.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for financing the supplementary welfare allowance scheme are set out in the legislation governing the scheme.  Local authority contributions are paid directly by the local authorities to the relevant health boards which administer the scheme. Health boards in many cases experience considerable difficulty in obtaining payments from local authorities in their areas and it is known that the Western Health <Col N="437" /> Board intends to initiate legal proceedings to recover arrears of payments statutorily due to it from the local authorities in its area.</P>
      <P>The amount of the local authority contribution to the financing of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is small in terms of overall local authority expenditure but nevertheless the present system has given rise to dissatisfaction for some time.  As previously announced however the financing arrangements for the scheme are under review and proposals have been put to the Government on this matter.  Pending the outcome of the Government's consideration of the matter it is not considered that a meeting with the county councils concerned would be appropriate.</P>

      <P>I received a request for a meeting from this association on 30 March 1984 but because of a heavy schedule I was not in a position to meet them.  However, I arranged for senior officials of my Department to meet them and that meeting took place on 27 November 1984.  The views expressed by the association then were examined and considered by my Department and I, therefore, do not see any benefit in arranging a further meeting now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. F. Fahey</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Labour if he is concerned about the increase which is taking place in the numbers of people who are now forced to emigrate because of the lack of employment opportunities in this country and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of suggestions that there has been some increase in the net population outflow.  Based on past experience I feel that we should treat such inter-censal estimates with caution, due to the sensitivity of the main demographic variables which impact on population change.  The statistical data in the next census will <Col N="448" /> provide accurate information on population movements.</P>
      <P>While I would be concerned about a rise in enforced emigration, I would question whether conclusive evidence exists to support such a situation at this stage. In an era of modern communications and transport systems and since it is EC policy to facilitate free movement of workers within the European Community, a greater interest in working abroad is to be expected.  Young people, in particular, have a favourable attitude to working abroad, as evidenced in a survey conducted for the National Youth Policy Committee's Report published in September 1984.  It is significant that, even during the seventies when there was net immigration overall, there was net emigration among the 15-24 year age group.</P>
      <P>In view of the reality that, despite the unfavourable situation in Britain, some people may still opt to seek employment there, and in recognition of the important role played by the Irish centres in Britain in helping them on their arrival, I approved grant assistance to the centres amounting to £68,000 in 1984.  This represented an increase of £30,000 on the level of support given in previous years.  The provision in my Department's Vote for 1985 is £72,000 which is an increase of 6 per cent over last year's allocation.</P>

      <P>I have received representations from the Fettercairn community council, Tallaght, who are in the process of building a youth and community centre with the assistance of the AnCO community youth training programme.  Funds have been made <Col N="449" /> available under the National Plan for the provision of community and recreational facilities over the period 1985-1987. Assistance is not given from such funds towards the purchase of materials for projects being built under the community youth training programme.  I have arranged a meeting between the Fettercairn community council and officials of my Department to discuss the matter fully.</P>
