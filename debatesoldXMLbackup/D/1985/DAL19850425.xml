      <P>Could I ask the Taoiseach or the Minister for Energy to explain to the House, in view of the commitment and the promise the Minister gave on Tuesday on the Order of Business that any announcement in relation to changes in the oil exploration terms would be made in this House, why he has chosen once again to undermine the privacy of Parliament by making an announcement outside the House while the House was in session?</P>

      <P>When the House adjourned last night, I was speaking about VAT on unregistered farmers.  I was asking for some information in regard to the increase in the VAT refunds from 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent.  There does not seem to be any Minister or ministerial presence for the debate on the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The House is in session and Deputy Mac Giolla is in possession.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>I was specifically asking the Minister if he would explain to me on Committee Stage the whole process of this question of VAT refunds to unregistered farmers.  My understanding is that out of 175,000 farmers only 700 are registered.  What is the difficulty in getting farmers registered?  What are the VAT refunds for?  Why have they increased from £6.8 million in 1979 to £22 million in 1981 and £41.5 million in 1982 and £53.7 million in 1983, the last figures available to me?  That is a very spectacular increase in VAT refunds to farmers. What is it all about?  Is there a big fiddle in it?  A number of major farm inputs are zero-rated, like fertilisers.  An explanation would be helpful as to why it is necessary to increase VAT refunds to unregistered farmers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I understand that this was abolished in 1976 but restored again in 1978.  I should like to know something of the whole <Col N="1768" /> background to this question, There are specific payments from the Exchequer and it would be helpful to have some information as to why they are necessary. In this Finance Bill, under section 43, the raising from 2 per cent to 2.2 per cent of the compensatory flat rate credit allowed to taxable persons purchasing agricultural produce or agricultural services from unregistered farmers comes up again.  If all farmers were registered, it would be simple enough to establish the exact amount, but this is a calculation. There is no indication as to whether the figures are justified or unjustified, too much or too little.</P>
    <P>On the capital acquisitions tax, again it is very interesting when you come to any question of capital or corporation taxes.  In this case, all the sections here are dealing with exemptions, not additions. The capital acquisitions tax brought in only £10 million in the year 1983-84, which is much less than used to be brought in on the old death or estate duties.  Yet, this Finance Bill is actually giving further exemptions, rather than increasing the amount of tax from capital acquisitions.</P>
    <P>The other area that worries me in this Finance Bill is with regard to section 66. This is a new taxation system.  I think it is the first time ever that in a Finance Bill there is a requirement for Bord Telecom to make contributions to the Exchequer over the next three years.  That is an extraordinary item to have in a Finance Bill and an extraordinary system of taxation for any Government to bring in, that they just instruct State companies to pay them so much every year and to hell with the consumers.  How can he expect Bord Telecom to raise this money each year other than by increasing charges to the consumers?  The Minister is doing this to Bord Telecom at an important period of their development.  Possibly in the next two or three years they will be in an excellent position to return some of the moneys to the Exchequer but this should be on their annual surplus, not a payment whether they have a surplus or a deficit as the Minister is proposing.  In the next few years their annual surplus should be <Col N="1769" /> quite considerable but the Minister is too greedy and in too much of a rush to get the money.  By his action he is crippling Bord Telecom before they have an opportunity to establish themselves.  If they have to raise their charges to make up this money for the Minister, they will damage themselves in the eyes of the public.  There will be a reduction in the number of people who will be able to take their telephone and telex services because of the high prices.  In turn, this will reduce the income of Bord Telecom and the possibility of their having a surplus.</P>
    <P>This is the response of the Minister after a very specific promise in the plan <i>Building On Reality</i> that there would be no further increase in taxation.  We were told there would be variations in taxes but there was a specific guarantee in the plan that taxes would not be increased. However, we are told by the Minister that what he is proposing in respect of Bord Telecom is not taxation.  The Government just instruct the ESB to give them £25 million and Bord Telecom to give them £170 million over three years. This is a method of taxation by the back door on consumers of electricity and of the telecommunications services.</P>
    <P>Incidentally, perhaps the Minister would consider adopting this approach towards the Central Bank.  If he can do it to Bord Telecom why not to the Central Bank?  He has told the Central Bank to fund whatever losses arise from ICI and if the bank this year pay out £60 million or £70 million to cover the ICI losses they will most likely reduce the amount they give to the Exchequer which was £134 million surplus last year.  The Minister could ensure that he will get the same money this year by imposing a specific requirement on the Central Bank that they pay £134 million or £140 million every year and let them recoup that from the banking and financial services, as Bord Telecom have to do in respect of their consumers.  That would force the Central Bank into making Allied Irish Banks and the other banks pay for their mess but he has not done that.  The Minister has accepted that the Exchequer will <Col N="1770" /> lose whatever amount the Central Bank have to pay to cover the losses in the ICI affair and he will be at the loss of that amount because the Central Bank will deduct it from their surplus.</P>
    <P>Section 67 deals with the famous &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;.  A specific figure of £660 million has been given by the Minister as the amount of profits and dividends sent out of the country in 1983.  Obviously that amount increased last year because we were told there was a tremendous increase in productivity and in exports by the multinationals in 1984.  This would lead one to expect that profits and dividends were even greater in 1984.</P>
    <P>Such profits and dividends of the multinationals is the added value created by the labour of the Irish workforce on imported raw materials which are then exported.  The only benefit to our economy is the jobs the multinationals create. The wealth created could be an additional asset to the country but all of that goes out to the parent companies.  I think it was Deputy Cosgrave who said we cannot quibble with that, that companies have this right.  However, they do not have that right in every other country.  They have that right here because our Ministers for Finance and for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism and the IDA gave them that right.  It is one of the incentives given to multinationals, it is why they want to come here rather than to other countries.  They have been given the right to export all their profits and dividends but it is not necessary that they do that.  They are not allowed to do this elsewhere.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now proposing that multinationals be given tax free incentives if they invest in Government gilts. In other words, he will enable them to make further profits in Ireland by inviting them to invest tax free in Government securities.  However, all that is required is an alternation in the IDA grants and allowances given to multinationals when they come here to ensure that a certain percentage of their profits are invested and used in Ireland.  That does not mean taking the money from the multinationals &mdash; it is still their profits &mdash; but it would <Col N="1771" /> mean it would be invested in the Irish economy rather than sending it back to the parent company who decide where to invest.  That would be a very simple arrangement, one that would be for the benefit of the Irish economy and would create better relations between Ireland, the other Irish companies and the multinationals. Rather than putting out some bait in the hope that the multinationals will take it, the Minister should give specific directives as to what they can do with the profits.</P>
    <P>In the course of the debate over the last two days, particularly in comments emanating from Fianna Fáil speakers, there were many fine suggestions on how jobs could be created, budgetary policy changes, the possibilities of new methods of investment and so on.  There were also suggestions for reduction in taxation in various areas.  They talked about incentive schemes, greater tax allowances to be given, reduction in taxes, or allowing entrepreneurs to make more profit, thereby creating more jobs.  That was the general thrust of their remarks &mdash; it being argued that to offer such incentives one did not need to increase but rather possibly reduce corporation profits tax, property tax, wealth tax, etc.  All of those suggestions for job creation would cost money.  We have not heard from Fianna Fáil speakers how they would propose raising such money.  For example, one must ask do they intend to increase further taxation on PAYE workers or to increase further the amount of returns from value-added tax.  If not, where is the money to come from?  They have not told us what they propose to tax.  They contended they would do a better job in bringing in the money outstanding, the taxes which the Comptroller and Auditor General said last May were collectable. He listed a total amount of £677 million falling into that category, those are taxes that have already been assessed but have not been paid.</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil speakers have not outlined what is their policy, their budgetary policy, where they would find extra <Col N="1772" /> moneys.  If one does not find extra moneys then one must reduce services &mdash; this is what the Government are contending &mdash; that one must reduce health services, educational and local government services or else one charges for health, educational or local government services. That is a further method of taxation this Government are introducing which Fianna Fáil rightly oppose, as they opposed the cutbacks in education over the past couple of days.  But, if one does not do that, where is one to find the extra money to pay off the national debt? Where is one to find the money to create a real jobs programme, to put back more into the economy, particularly in the construction industry where more funding is needed?  It should be remembered that 75 per cent of that comes from the Exchequer.  Therefore one needs more money put in to have more emerge.  We agree absolutely with that policy.</P>
    <P>It is absolutely essential that we get away from the negative policy of this Government which is destroying the whole base of our economy to the extent that when we return to viability and want to lift off there would not be the base there to do so.  We agree that money is needed for a viable jobs creation programme to put life back into our economy. But we say specifically where that money can be found.  First we go into the area of taxation already assessed, ensuring that that is collected from the self-employed and farmers.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General that amounts to £234 million, that there is outstanding in corporation profits tax £279 million &mdash; that is without there being any increase &mdash; capital gains tax outstanding, £9 million, capital acquisitions tax outstanding, £10 million; health levies not collected £9.8 million; residential property tax, £1 million, etc., plus PAYE contributions of £39 million outstanding from employers and £41 million outstanding in PRSI.  That is what the figure of £677 million is made up of.  The first thing is to attack that area and bring in those outstanding amounts, but one must hurt people in so doing.</P>
    <P>The second goal is to impose further <Col N="1773" /> taxation in this area, an area that is under-taxed. The Government keep contending that generally we are overtaxed.  Certainly PAYE workers are overtaxed but the country generally is not overtaxed. Capital is not overtaxed, wealth is not overtaxed, in fact it is not taxed at all.  It will be seen that property is not overtaxed when it brings in merely £1.8 million while water charges in Dublin alone bring in £4 million.  What a joke.  There is wide scope for further taxation in that area.</P>
    <P>The proposed land tax does not come within the ambit of the Minister for Finance or this Bill.  Rather is it the responsibility of the Minister for the Environment who is waiting until the local government elections are over before he introduces his Local Government (Finance) Bill in which we understand this land tax is to be included.  It is only right that rates, which had obtained for 150 years and were abolished three years ago on a constitutional issue, should be replaced.  I should like a guarantee from the Minister for the Environment that when he introduces this land tax as a method of local government financing he will abolish the water rates.  Let him tell us now that as soon as this land tax is introduced water rates will be abolished, because they were introduced to replace agricultural rates which the courts contended were unconstitutional on a valuation basis.</P>
    <P>A number of explanations will be required of the Minister for Finance and the Government on Committee Stage, particularly with regard to the Minister's dismissive attitude in his miserable speech introducing this Bill.  It contained no economic or budgetary strategies.  He did not explain in any way what was the Government's viewpoint.  It is to be hoped that in the course of the Committee Stage debate we will be given much more information about what the Minister proposes doing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Public demand last year among different groups was that we should create greater incentive to work, aiding business in every way possible.  It is my belief that these budgetary proposals <Col N="1774" /> will improve the incentive to work, creating a high level of business activity.  I refer to the restructuring of the value-added tax rates which will alleviate enormously the problem of cross-Border traffic and the smuggling of goods from the North.  I believe it will also reduce costs to industry and improve their cash flow because of the imposition of VAT at the point of entry which was announced in the course of the 1982 election campaign.</P>
      <P>The reduction of VAT on tourism from 18 per cent to 10 per cent has resulted in an increase in anticipated visits from abroad this year.  As a Deputy representing a constituency that is a gateway to a tourist area, I welcome those proposals. I have been told by tourism interests in recent times that the level of business from the United States alone this year is anticipated to rise by over 30 per cent.  I know that cannot be laid entirely at the door of the Minister for Finance in that the strong dollar has attracted much of that business here.  The tourism industry has welcomed the decision and as a Deputy from a tourist area I welcome it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In relation to the incentive to work, that is a problem and will remain a problem for a long time.  However, the new income tax bands and the elimination of the 65 per cent rate will have a positive effect in that area.  It will be an incentive for people to take on additional responsibilities. A major reform of the taxation system is still required because the levels of personal taxation are still having a detrimental effect on the incentive to work.  Employees are becoming steadily more dissatisfied with gross pay increases because of the effects that that increase will have on net pay.  There is an unwillingness to accept extra responsibilities and an unwillingness among hourly paid workers to do overtime because many prefer to get involved in the black economy in activities which cannot be accounted.  The high levels of personal taxation are causing difficulties for business in recruitment and motivation of staff.  I know people in Cork working for multinational companies who have requested transfers to their associated <Col N="1775" /> companies abroad and I have one or two friends working abroad with multinationals who are reluctant to come home because of high taxation levels. That is a serious situation which must be tackled.</P>
    <P>The VAT changes will create more jobs in tourism-oriented industries, it will reduce cross-Border traffic and manufacturers could benefit from the reduction in VAT at the point of entry.  More important is the fact that the Government for the first time have reversed the trend in upward taxation.  That must be welcomed even though the number of taxation decreases is small.  Unfortunately no matter who is in power the Government will be faced with high taxation levels and a justifiable demand for a reduction in taxation.  They will be caught in a vicious circle.  Deputy Yates put it simply by saying that as long as we are spending £1.20 and only taking in £1, we are in trouble.  If we attempt to reduce services to the public the public will protest and the vested interests operating those services will protest in some cases unjustifiably as we have a lot of inefficiency and duplication in the public service.</P>
    <P>The public service is an area where the vicious circle can be broken once and for all by creating more efficiency in our public spending and in our services to the public.  This will be a major task because of the vested interests involved.  There should be greater emphasis in this area. The massive wastage of public moneys is a national scandal.  I as a member of the Oireachtas Committee on Public Expenditure am appalled at the amount of public moneys being wasted over the last few years.  Despite our best endeavours this massive wastage is continuing.  The duplication for example in the National Manpower Service, the Youth Employment Agency, AnCO and the Department of Social Welfare should be tackled. The amount of duplication of effort in one small area such as the cataloguing of the unemployed is colossal.  Each agency is doing its own thing involving the expenditure of vast amounts of moneys and the use of vast numbers of staff.  This problem <Col N="1776" /> should be seriously tackled by the Government.  One of our few growing industries is the service industry to service the unemployed.</P>
    <P>Another area which the Committee on Public Expenditure reported on to this House some time ago is the massive amount of money being wasted on the renting of office accommodation and this is continuing despite statements made and investigations carried out, and we do not seem to be able to control it.  A draft report from the Committee on Public Expenditure will identify areas where massive amounts of money are still being wasted in the renting of office blocks. That is something which the taxpayer cannot tolerate any longer.</P>
    <P>The semi-State bodies both commercial and non-commercial have been referred to in recent months and we on the Committee on Public Expenditure have taken time to look at the operations of SFADCo and the IIRS.  The arrogance of some of the executives of these bodies must be seen to be believed.  They have the impression that they can spend money without accounting to anybody and when they are asked to account for it they get upset.  We had examples of that in recent times and in fact, the <i>Sunday Independent</i> last Sunday mentioned that the chief executive of one of those bodies complained to the Taoiseach about the manner in which questions were being put to him about his operations.  What is upsetting the public is not the questions being put but the answers being received by committees like ours.  The Government must take immediate action to eliminate wastage in these areas.</P>
    <P>The question of the duplication of effort and the wastage of money because of the failure of successive Governments to tackle the question of decentralisation must be considered.  The greater Dublin area is one of the fastest growing cities in Europe, its population increasing by 2 per cent over the last decade.  The problem is that while most European countries have attempted to devolve control and responsibility to regions we seem to be doing the opposite.  There seems to be an obsession to keep everything in Dublin <Col N="1777" /> and administer all schemes from the capital. Next week the Minister for Social Welfare will be asked questions about people not receiving social welfare payments and in that regard I believe that the amount of time involved in considering such cases, the number of telephone calls to the city and the cost of postage to Dublin is a waste of public money.</P>

      <P>Our main preoccupation must be with unemployment.  We all agree that there is a major crisis in that area with in excess of 225,000 people unemployed.  The southern region is one of the worst affected regions with unemployment at almost 25 per cent.  The social consequences of unemployment, the increase in the crime rate and mental stress are well catalogued.  We are all aware of the alarming increase in suicide rates in recent years.  Since 1980 there has been a dramatic increase.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am trying to develop a point, if the Chair will permit me.  The emphasis must be on catering for the long term unemployed.  Short term solutions will not help those people.  Unfortunately the major problem facing the programme for job creation is the relatively high interest rates which are strangling recovery and discouraging capital investment. Criticism by Opposition Members of the Government's performance in regard to unemployment has ignored the fact that the Government have been hampered in their moves by the need to bring Government spending in line with revenue.  I have outlined a way in which the Government can provide some relief in that area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have the fastest growing labour force in Europe, climbing at a rate of 3 per cent per annum, and to accommodate that labour force our economy will have to grow at about 7 per cent per annum, a major task for any Government.  To resolve the unemployment problem we must reduce our inflation rate to the European average and the budget deficit must be further reduced.  I should like to refer to the criticism by the Construction Industry Federation of the effect the higher VAT rates will have on the construction industry.  I accept that the higher rates will affect that industry but <Col N="1780" /> the criticism has ignored a number of factors.  It has ignored the fact that the grant to new house purchasers has been doubled from £1,000 to £2,000.  The decision to give a grant of £5,000 to local authority tenants who surrender the tenancy of their homes has helped the house construction programme enormously.  In my region alone up to 100 people have applied for that grant.  That means that 100 new homes will have to be built in the Cork city region.  I have no doubt that countrywide thousands have applied. While the building industry have grounds for criticism in some areas the whole truth has not been told.</P>
    <P>The December quarterly report by the ERSI forecasts that the progress towards achieving the policy aims of stabilising unemployment and improving the public finances will be slow in 1985.  It suggests that the Irish economy is largely reflecting the wider European experience and that where unemployment is concerned the chances of any substantial improvement here are slim.  It forecasts that the European average will increase above the 11.6 per cent present figure.  The report expects the economy to grow by about 2¼ per cent in real terms during 1985 with inflation falling to below 6 per cent.  It forecasts that disposable incomes will rise, for the first time in a number of years, by more than 2 per cent, thus ensuring an improvement in living standards. That must be viewed as good news.</P>
    <P>I should like to be parochial in regard to VAT rates and refer to the Government's decision last year to introduce a duty free port in Cork.  That will be a major advantage to the Cork area. Unemployment in the greater Cork area is about 20 per cent and in the city it is up to 25 per cent in certain areas.  The rise in the last quarter in Cork is similar to that experienced in 1983-84 and, overall, the rise in unemployment in 1984 was less than half of that of the previous two years.  As the rise in unemployment is approximately the same as the expected rise in the labour market it means that we are off-setting job losses with the creation of new jobs in that region.  We can take up the influx into the labour market <Col N="1781" /> in that region if we are allowed to sell the region properly.  The Minister for Finance should introduce the legislation to establish a duty free port in Cork in this session and implement it before the autumn.</P>
    <P>Last year when speaking on the Finance Bill I referred to the threat facing the newspaper industry.  I welcome the decision to reduce the VAT rate applying to newspapers which was announced in the budget.</P>
    <P>I should like also to make specific reference to the section dealing with relief for expenditure on the improvement of flats in multiple dwellings.  It is important in the context of urban renewal to encourage as many people as possible to live in inner city areas.  Cork, like Dublin, suffers from having a large amount of under-utilised accommodation over shops in the city centre.  The provisions in the Finance Bill which give a tax allowance for the reconstruction, development and improvement of multiple dwellings will be a major benefit to the urban renewal programme.</P>
    <P>Taxation is of immediate concern to us all because of its effects on every-day living.  Most of us pay tax in one form or another.  Recently the subject of tax equity has been frequently in the news because of the high rates of taxation. We all accept the need for improvement, even the Government, but the question is how to bring about that improvement. I heard Deputy Mac Giolla speaking on this subject but he did not put forward many solutions to the problem.  The high levels of taxation have stirred up ongoing agitation about tax equity.  The nucleus of the problem is that tax rates are high because public expenditure is high.  I put forward suggestions earlier as to how we could get out of that vicious circle.  The Government must make every effort to widen the tax base.</P>
    <P>I welcome the announcement last year of the decision to introduce a land tax. There are certain groups who can put forward their case in a very professional manner but we must not overlook the fact that an unjust system has been operating for years and that everybody must <Col N="1782" /> pay his fair share of taxation.  I hope that the proposals announced by the Government will be implemented.  In recent weeks there has been a further lobbying campaign by the farming organisations and cases have been made in relation to people who could not meet the demands which would be made on them under a land tax system.  Unfortunately all businesses face the same problem.  Small businessmen have to pay rates on their premises and are also taxed under the income tax system.  There cannot be exceptions.  If an individual's circumstances do not allow him to pay there must be an examination of the efficiency of his operation.  The ceilings are reasonable.</P>
    <P>I welcome many of the provisions of the Bill, especially those in relation to VAT rates.  I hope that the downward trend in taxation levels will continue in forthcoming budgets.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The budget which this Finance Bill is intended to implement has four principal features.  Firstly, it involves the highest current budget deficit ever, £1,234 million, all of which will have to be borrowed.  Secondly, its arithmetic is very dubious.  Thirdly, it makes no contribution whatever to solving the appalling problem of mass unemployment. Fourthly, it can already be seen to be substantially off target.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget which the Minister for Finance put before this House on 30 January last, even on the basis of its own very doubtful arithmetic, projected a deficit of £1,234 million, which, as I have already said, is the highest ever and which amounts to 7.9 per cent of GNP.  This amount will have to be borrowed and added directly to our national debt.  This, of course, is the worst type of borrowing; borrowing to pay for current expenditure, borrowing which adds to our overall national indebtedness without creating any corresponding assets either by adding to our infrastructure or improving our productive capacity.  Not alone is this current budget deficit a record in size, in absolute money terms, but it also represents a very high proportion, almost 8 per <Col N="1783" /> cent of GNP.  At 7.9 per cent of GNP, it is one of the highest ever and compares with 7.2 per cent last year.  In 1985 the Minister is going for a higher percentage of GNP as a current budget deficit than he did in 1984.  These figures, as many people have already pointed out, make a complete nonsense of any claim by this Government that they have got either their budgetary situation or Exchequer borrowing under any kind of control. That was the reality of the figures in the budget itself before any allowance is made for the way in which those figures are now being significantly changed for the worse.</P>
    <P>I do not know if there is much point any more in talking about the Government's document <i>Building on Reality</i> at this stage.  There is now fairly widespread agreement that it is, in fact, a dead letter. It is almost impossible to believe, looking back now, that it actually proposed a current budget deficit for 1986 of £1,079 million.  I believe the Government must now acknowledge that that is totally unrealistic.  It was unrealistic to begin with and the way the budgetary situation is emerging this year and particularly having regard to the static nature of the economy it is by now totally outside the realms of possibility.</P>
    <P>During the debate that took place here on the budget itself, we expressed again and again our doubts about the validity of the arithmetic in the budget.  It is becoming increasingly clear that those doubts were well-founded and that the budgetary arithmetic is not going to stand up as the year unfolds.</P>
    <P>A nicely rounded estimated figure, for instance, of £30 million was put in for savings on pay.  To say that this was optimistic is to put it mildly.</P>
    <P>There was also a figure of £28.6 million put in for non-pay savings.  Three months later, we are told that these savings are incorporated in the revised Book of Estimates which has just been published.  The handling of this important aspect of the budget was highly suspicious.  Why were we not given a clear itemised list of these projected savings?  Why have they been <Col N="1784" /> concealed in this way so that one has to carry out a detailed examination of the Estimates to find them?</P>
    <P>The figure in the budget to cover the cost of unemployment was calculated on the basis of an unemployment figure of 217,000 for the year.  Again, experience to date shows quite clearly that this figure was seriously understated and that the amount provided was inadequate. Unemployment is running at 10,000 above the figure projected.  Every Deputy in this House knows from his or her own personal experience in his or her constituency that the Department of Social Welfare are making unprecedented efforts to reduce the overall size of the bill for social welfare in the current year by arbitrary administrative action. These efforts are not being confined to the elimination of fraud and abuse, but are causing real deprivation and hardship to many people who are perfectly entitled to benefits which are being delayed or reduced, through one type of administrative device or another.  The Government are cheating in this whole area of social welfare.</P>
    <P>Going into this debate we have available to us the figures for the first quarter of the year, that is the Exchequer returns to 31 March 1985.  These figures disclose a very serious and worrying situation. The Minister seeks to suggest that it is not possible to come to firm conclusions on the basis of the returns for one quarter, particularly the first quarter and that there are special features which distort the situation.  That may well be, but even allowing for that, there is enough evidence available from the figures as published to indicate that the budget is very seriously off course already.</P>
    <P>The total revenue for the year as a whole was projected to increase by 7.5 per cent.  In the first quarter, however, total revenue has increased only by 2.7 per cent.  If this result is continued throughout the rest of the year, the outcome from the point of view of the current budget deficit will be catastrophic.</P>
    <P>The details of the main headings of revenue for the first quarter reveal a very <Col N="1785" /> disquieting picture so far as income tax and VAT are concerned.</P>
    <P>The position in regard to income tax is particularly alarming.  The budgetary projection was for an increase of 8.4 per cent in income tax receipts for the year as a whole.  The returns for the first quarter show an actual decrease of 3.8 per cent. In assessing this serious falling-off in income tax receipts, it should be borne in mind that, in fact, in the first quarter, the increase should if anything be greater than the 8.4 per cent average projected for the whole year, because people are pushed into the higher bands towards the end of the fiscal year.  Instead, it is seriously and alarmingly down.  The figures are apparently affected by a timing change in receipts of income tax from building societies of £40 million. That does not really affect the seriousness of the picture.  It is not just that the projected rate of increase in receipts has failed to materialise, but there has been an actual decrease on the corresponding quarter in 1984, a decrease of 3.8 per cent.</P>
    <P>The situation in regard to VAT, while not as catastrophic as that revealed in the case of income tax, is still very serious. VAT receipts for the year were projected to increase by 9 per cent.  In the first quarter, the increase has been only 4.8 per cent.  That is a serious falling off in what was projected.</P>
    <P>If these trends in regard to income tax and VAT are maintained at anything like the same level throughout the year the current deficit could be significantly higher than even the already record deficit projected in the budget.</P>
    <P>Speaking to the Fianna Fáil Ard-Fheis before I was aware of the figures for the first quarter of 1985, I indicated clearly what was happening in the economy and in the public finances as a result of Government policies.  Speaking of the policies pursued by this Government in the past two years, I said:</P>
    <P>They have pushed us steadily downward in an inexorable spiral of falling output, higher and higher taxes, mass <Col N="1786" /> unemployment, reduced public services and social deprivation.</P>
    <P>The present depressed level of output cannot support the burden of taxation imposed on it and the services we need as a community.  What the present Government are doing is adjusting everything downward.</P>
    <P>That is exactly what the figures published for the first quarter of 1985 show.  The falling level of economic activity is now being reflected in the diminishing returns from both income tax and VAT.</P>
    <P>It will be recalled that the budget table on the credit side included an item of £58 million which was optimistically attributed to extra income arising from the impact of the budget on tax revenue buoyancies.  The first quarter Exchequer returns clearly indicate that no such buoyancy exists and therefore cannot be relied on.  We must, therefore, at this stage, discount that £58 million as extra income during the course of this year.</P>
    <P>What does it all add up to?  When the dubious nature of the budget arithmetic &mdash; the non-existent revenue buoyancy of £58 million, the unrealistic figure of £58 million for savings, the underprovision for social welfare &mdash; is added to the downward trend in receipts which has now manifested itself, an increase in the size of the current deficit emerging at the end of the year is inevitable and that increase could be of substantial proportions.  It will almost certainly not be less than £100 million and could be twice that amount. Some people might have been looking to offset the factors I have outlined for some improvement in the figure for expenditure on the Central Fund services because of changes in either interest rates or exchange rates but the Minister in a reply on Tuesday does not envisage any change in that overall figure.  In any event, that is speculative territory.  In my view, therefore, we must look forward to a current deficit of £1,350 million and that must, of course, have serious implications for the level of Government borrowing during the current year.</P>
    <P>In the budget, the requirements of the Public Capital Programme, £785 million, <Col N="1787" /> were added to the current budget deficit of £1,234 million, to give an overall Government borrowing figure of £2,019 million for 1985.</P>
    <P>In the first quarter of the year, of that £2,019 million, the Government have already borrowed £834 million.  This means that 41 per cent of the total allocation for the year has already been used up in the first quarter.  This figure of 41 per cent clearly raises the possibility that borrowing for the year will, in fact, be greater than the £2,019 million stipulated in the budget.</P>
    <P>At 31 March, 1985, the total national debt was £19.1 billion.  At 31 December, 1982, just at the time when this Minister for Finance took over, the total national debt was £12.7 billion.  In other words, Deputy Alan Dukes, as Minister for Finance, in just over two years, has increased our national debt by 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>His record in regard to foreign borrowing is worse.  At 31 December, 1982, when he took over, our foreign indebtedness was £5.3 billion.  It is now £8.6 billion. Deputy Alan Dukes, as Minister for Finance, in a little over two years, has increased our foreign debt by 64 per cent. He has increased the foreign debt of this country by more than any of his predecessors.</P>
    <P>How interesting it is today to recall the massive campaign engaged in by this Government about borrowing, and foreign borrowing in particular, in their obsession to attack Fianna Fáil and undermine us politically.  They turned it into a long playing record.  One recalls that old ladies who, up to then, had only been concerned with the amount of their old age pensions or whether they were going to get an increase were worrying about our foreign indebtedness.  Now we find that this Coalition Minister for Finance has turned out to be the biggest spender and borrower of them all.  It is not only that the present Minister for Finance is borrowing more than any of his predecessors.  The unfortunate truth is that he has been guilty of major errors of judgement in the manner in which he has borrowed.  After making a major <Col N="1788" /> mistake in relation to dollar borrowing in 1983, he tried to switch from foreign borrowing altogether in 1984 and as a result, drove up domestic interest rates in this country to record levels.</P>
    <P>This Finance Bill makes provision for a new type of Government borrowing, whereby multinationals operating in this country will be invited to invest in Government bonds, the interest on which will be free of tax.</P>
    <P>As is the case with practically everything this Government do, it was misleadingly presented and duly welcomed in the media on the basis of that misleading presentation.  We were told by the usual faithful scribes that the Government were taking measures to deal with the &ldquo;black hole&rdquo;.  The impression was conveyed that it was a real attempt to deal with something about which there was genuine public concern, namely the sending out of the country of their profits by multinationals and the failure of these multinationals to reinvest in manufacturing activity here and thereby create employment.  From that point of view, what is proposed will not really meet the situation.  The multinationals are now being offered the opportunity to invest in Government bonds and that, of course, is no substitute for actual industrial reinvestment. Furthermore, this is an entirely voluntary measure and its success will depend on the response from the multinationals. It is doubtful whether multinationals will place much of their funds in Government stocks, however attractive the stocks may be.</P>
    <P>Here we must look with some surprise at what the Minister said in his speech about these bonds.  He said that he had no estimate as to what impact a new investment facility on special terms would have on this outflow.  He also said that he could not specify what the precise terms of the security issued under this section might be.  He does not know what type of bonds there will be even though the problem of the black hole has been with us for many months now and he has a provision in the Finance Bill purporting to deal with it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1789" /> What is needed is a scheme which will encourage and motivate multinationals to reinvest their profits in extensions of their existing business or in new manufacturing projects, not in Government bonds.  In that way, there would be a very positive multiplier benefit in the form of extra employment and increased output. It would not be very difficult to formulate such a scheme which would encourage and make it attractive for multinationals to reinvest their profits in this country in the form of additional manufacture, thereby creating employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla was inclined to criticise us on two grounds.  He said that most of what we proposed was on the basis of offering incentives and I accept that.  However, he should understand that in this country we are dealing with a free enterprise economy.  He would probably prefer us to be dealing with a totalitarian regime which would have complete control over the economy but we on this side of the House, as practical people, believe that we have to live in the real western world, which is a free enterprise economy.  We have to work and operate in that environment and, therefore, we believe that we must offer financial incentives, direct financial grants of one kind or another or taxation incentives.  I find it odd that Deputy Mac Giolla and his colleagues are still trying to sell &mdash; and this came out very clearly in the recent Ard-Fheis &mdash; the people of this country the old style Marxist-Leninist totalitarian regime type of economy when they know that those economies have totally failed. They might be very nice, desirable, intellectual concepts but their practical outcome in Russia and in Eastern Europe is that, whatever else they may do, they do not improve the material welfare of the people involved.  In fact, it is fascinating that the Chinese have now publicly stated that they are going away from the whole idea of a Marxist-Leninist philosophy and approach to the economy because they believe it is not relevant to today's circumstances and they propose to try some other approach.  Although that is the position, Deputy Mac Giolla and The Workers' Party are still advocating these <Col N="1790" /> old-fashioned approaches and philosophies which have not worked anywhere.</P>
    <P>He also seemed to fall for the Fine Gael tactic of confusing the public mind about the Fianna Fáil approach to the economy.  We believe that there must be a new approach, a turn around.  In my Ard-Fheis speech, I said that we must take an economic leap and try to break out of this vicious downward spiral in which we are trapped by the policies of the Government.  Deputy Mac Giolla said, as Fine Gael have also said, that many of the things we propose would cost money.  He made the mistake of saying that that means increased taxation.  We are talking about getting economic development from more taxation; we see clearly that it is the present crushing burden of taxation which is depressing the economy. We are talking about capital investment and it is rather naive to say, when we advocate programmes of capital investment, that that means more taxation. Of course it does not and I dealt with this at some length in my Ard-Fheis speech.  I pointed out that we had to take in the short term this risk of reducing taxation and raising capital investment so that, in the medium term, our investment will both repay the tax which we have foregone and remunerate the investment.</P>
    <P>The proposal set out in the document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> whereby Bord Telecom Éireann will make a contribution of £50 million, £60 million and £70 million in 1985, 1986 and 1987, a total of £180 million to the Exchequer, is extraordinary. Deputy Mac Giolla was right to point out that it is extraordinary to find that proposal enshrined in the statutory provisions in section 66.  It is very difficult to understand why a statutory provision is needed for what is really only a bookkeeping entry of that kind.  It was an unfortunate proposal even as it was originally put forward in that it placed this arbitrary levy of £180 million on BTE in their early years when they would be short of finance and struggling to build up their organisation.  It appears now from <Col N="1791" /> what the Minister said in his speech that the £180 million involved will be subsequently repaid over the next ten years. This is clearly a manipulation of public finances because the £180 million is a contribution.  It will not appear as Government borrowing and it will also make the deficit look smaller than it is. Why should this £180 million be borrowed by the Government from a new board when they need every penny they can get, and then repaid later when presumably the board will have achieved profitability and will not need the repayment? No matter how you look at it it seems to be very much a device to manipulate this area of the public finance in order to make the Government's finances and position in the years immediately ahead better than they would otherwise be.</P>
    <P>I wonder if the Minister for Finance has any notion, any concept of the degree of cynicism with which his speech here on Tuesday was greeted.  It was a very dishonest speech.  It attempted to give a completely misleading picture of both the state of the economy and the public finances.  The Minister had the audacity to say yesterday that there is growing confidence in the economy.  What economy is he talking about?  It cannot be the Irish economy where there are mass unemployment, an increasing level of emigration, falling revenues and falling consumer demand.  There is no confidence anywhere, no new investment, no new enterprises starting up.  The Minister says that the Government have achieved their budget targets.  This year the Minister plans for the highest budget deficit ever.  I have already given the figure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will, no doubt, have seen <Col N="1792" /> reports of the statement of clarification which I issued yesterday in relation to certain of the provisions of the 1975 Exclusive Offshore Licensing Terms.  As I said this morning copies have been placed in the Dáil Library.  I outlined the manner in which I would apply, in the case of marginal fields, the discretionary powers available to me under sections 23 (7) and 29 (2) of those 1975 terms.  The two sections in question empower me to reduce levels of State royalty and State participation, where I am satisfied that this is necessary in order to enable a marginal field to be developed and, at the same time, to provide a reasonable return on the expenditure to be incurred by the licence holders.</P>
    <P>The maximum levels of State take under the headings set out in the 1975 terms were designed to apply to medium and large fields which would be sufficiently remunerative to bear such a burden. The general perception now is that, in certain of our exploration areas at least; finds are likely to be relatively small and may be economically marginal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>By a &ldquo;marginal field&rdquo; I mean one on which the return on investment does not adequately reward the <Col N="1793" /> investor for risk, taking account of alternative investment opportunities.  Oil companies need to know, before committing to exploration, how the terms &mdash; in particular &ldquo;carried&rdquo; State participation &mdash; will be applied in the event of such a marginal discovery.  Otherwise, in making their financial projections, they may feel that it might not be prudent for them to assume in advance that any particular degree of flexibility will be applied and, accordingly, they may envisage the maximum terms being applied in their full rigour.  There is a danger that, if this were to happen, many reasonable prospects might be seen as potentially uneconomic and not worth exploring.</P>
      <P>I must have regard also, in this context, to certain other factors which have a bearing on exploration.  The most important of these are the fall in oil prices since 1982 and the uncertainty as to the future trend.  This has led to a cutback in exploration budgets generally.  I must also bear in mind that the Irish offshore is competing for the available exploration funds with other offshore areas, some of which offer attractive terms for the type of marginal field which I mentioned.</P>
      <P>Ireland's offshore is still relatively unexplored.  While there has so far been no commercial oil discovery, we have got considerable encouragement in recent years.  Our objective now is not only to maintain a reasonable level of drilling but to increase it and accelerate the pace with a view to achieving commercial discoveries.</P>
      <P>The arrangements I will be applying may seem rather complex.  This in unavoidable because it is a delicate exercise to strike a fair balance between the State's interests and the need to allow an adequate return on the high risk investment of the oil companies.  The matter has been studied in great detail in my Department and the arrangements to be applied have been tested over a wide range of hypothetical and real cases.  I am satisfied that they are the fairest that can be achieved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The approach, in essence, is that a &ldquo;marginal&rdquo; field will be defined by reference to a profitability ratio (called R) <Col N="1794" /> which is, in effect, net revenues divided by capital expenditures.  Where, on this basis, a field is deemed to be marginal, it will qualify for marginal relief.  In the first instance, fields with proven recoverable reserves of less than 75 million barrels will be relieved of royalty on the first 25 million barrels of production, provided that such an arrangement does not improve the profitability ratio beyond the qualifying threshold for marginal relief. If it does, the licensee will be entitled to such an element of royalty relief as will bring him up to that threshold.  It is important to note that the royalty relief is not automatic; it is not enough that the field be less than 75 million barrels &mdash; it must also be a marginal field.  In the case where, after account is taken of royalty to be paid, the field is still marginal by reference to the criterion &ldquo;R&rdquo;, then the maximum proportion of the State's participation which licensees would be required to carry in accordance with the 1975 Licensing Terms will be determined by the following formula:</P>
    <P>C= (1-P) / P × (R-1.3) × 1.85</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>More copies will be circulated as soon as possible after they come off the printing machine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this formula, &ldquo;R&rdquo; is the profitability ratio to which I have already referred; &ldquo;P&rdquo; is the level of total participation chosen by the State expressed as a fraction, and &ldquo;C&rdquo; represents the fraction of <Col N="1795" /> the State's chosen participation for which the licensees must provide funds at the allowable rate of interest.</P>
    <P>Where a maximum level of carried participation is determined by this formula, the licensee will be entitled to recover (after payment of taxes and royalties) his expenditures on behalf of the State and allowable interest thereon from the proceeds of the sale of the &ldquo;carried&rdquo; portion of the State's share of petroleum produced.</P>
    <P>As regards factors such as costs, prices, inflation rate, etc., the assumptions to be embodied in the formula will be those which, in my opinion, are the most realistic that can be adopted at the appropriate time.  In evaluating such factors I will take into account any representations made by the operator and such other expert advice as I may deem it advisable to procure.</P>
    <P>The State still reserves the right to participate up to 50 per cent as provided for in the 1975 terms.  Where the application of the formula indicates that the State will not be carried for the full amount of its chosen participation share, the State will (i) opt to pay, either itself or in association with others, for the development of the State's remaining entitlement to participation; or (ii) allow the licensees to carry the State for the remaining portion of the State entitlement on terms which allow an agreed risk premium.</P>
    <P>The formula will apply to marginal fields, as already indicated, but only where I am satisfied that no other opportunity remains to enhance the profitability of the project.  Finally, irrespective of the projected real rate of return, the formula will not apply automatically in the case of very large fields.  Such cases will be the subject of individual negotiations at the appropriate time.  &ldquo;Very large fields&rdquo; are taken to be those which are (a) in excess of 1 billion barrels of recoverable oil in water depths of 600 ft. or more, and (b) in excess of 300 million barrels of recoverable oil in water depths of less than 600ft.</P>
    <P>The new arrangements, which will <Col N="1796" /> apply to new licences, including licences granted under the third licensing round, will facilitate the more competitive and better endowed companies in committing the large funds involved in exploration and will, at the same time, safeguard the State's entitlement to a fair share of revenues from a field.  I will, of course, be prepared to consider, on a case by case basis, any requests from the holders of existing licences to have the new arrangements made applicable to their current licences, but it may be necessary to seek appropriate adjustments in work programmes in such cases.</P>
    <P>As a result of this clarification, I expect oil companies to respond with an increased level of exploration, particularly in the context of the third licensing round, which closes on Saturday, 15 June 1985.</P>

      <P>Listening to the Minister's clarification at the end of his speech, I say he should go back to the drawing-board and get more clarifications in relation to yesterday's hastily put together press conference and today's announcement.  As I said earlier, I deplore the manner in which this matter has been handled by the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and the Government because I got a commitment here on Tuesday that this matter would first be announced in this House but, unfortunately, for reasons best known to themselves, whether it was the handlers who decided that this was the best way to approach it or otherwise, they sought to ignore the House and undermine the primacy of Parliament once again.</P>
      <P>I will now try to tease out exactly what is in this statement, not an easy job because there are people better qualified than I in the public arena who cannot tear it apart either.  There are certain fundamental principles to which we should address ourselves this morning and we must wait until we can do the final calculations on the profitability ratio and formulae the Minister mentioned today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first thing we must look at and appreciate is that Ireland is not an oil producing province.  Secondly, we are <Col N="1797" /> looking for scarce exploration funds in competition with every other country around the world.  We want these companies to come into an area which is not proven.  For the past 18 months I have been pointing out to the Government that the third round licensing would be a failure if they did not take decisive action to solve the problems which still exist in the licensing terms which came into effect in 1975.  I was not in politics at that time but I remember reading that we were on the verge of discovering a major oil bonanza off our shores.  Over the last ten years we have found oil in the Porcupine and off the Waterford coast, but we still do not have any proven oil reserves, we are still not an oil producing province. The terms set ten years ago may have been right at that time but they are not right today.</P>
    <P>Let us look back at the activities over the last ten years.  There were more wells drilled in the first six months in the United Kingdom sector of the North Sea than have been drilled in our waters over the last ten years.  That puts the level of activity off our shores into perspective.  As I said, I knew the third round would be a failure as anybody looking at the situation realistically could see.  The closing date of the third round, 15 February, had to be postponed because there was little or no interest expressed.  The Government postponed the date in the hope that the taxation terms set out by the Minister for Finance on 14 January would increase the interest in applying for licences but that did not happen.  There were elements that needed to be clarified because there were still many other areas of uncertainty, and they are still there.</P>
    <P>If the Minister and the House appreciate how exploration funds are allocated to various regions around the world, they would know what I am talking about and they would not have taken this approach. Everybody knows economic models covering the various areas for which exploration funds are sought are fed into the computer.  There is no point trying to tell anybody who understands the situation that one can feed into a computer words like &ldquo;uncertainty&rdquo;, &ldquo;flexibility&rdquo;<Col N="1798" /> and &ldquo;bona fides of the Minister&rdquo;.  That will not produce anything from a computer in Texas or anywhere else and for that reason I regret to say we will remain an area with a very low level of activity. That is not the objective of this party, and I hoped until today that it was the objective of the Government to accelerate exploration, to find the oil in commercial quantities and then to sit down and say where we will go.</P>
    <P>We know what the development of oil in Norway and the United Kingdom has been.  We see that the ninth round in the United Kingdom has been very successful. Why has it been successful?  Because they have approached it in a realistic common-sense manner knowing there is a scarcity of exploration funds and setting out with the objective of getting the maximum share of this money into their area. We sat on the fence far too long and when the Government finally addressed themselves to the problem they went about it the wrong way.</P>
    <P>As I said, exploration funds are scarce and cannot be found too easily.  When we look at the cost of exploring for oil around the world we see that it works out on average at a cost of $12 a barrel.  What do the multinationals find on looking at companies listed on the stock exchanges which have reserves of oil and have discovered proven reserves of oil?  They can buy from companies with reserves of oil at $8 a barrel.  Why then should they spend $12 a barrel exploring for oil?  The cheapest place to explore for oil is the world stock market.  This is the climate in which we operate and we should not fool ourselves.</P>
    <P>There have been promising signs lately, especially in the last well.  I do not know exactly what the details are but maybe this is an attempt to get something done with that well.  Maybe when this fudge formula is put into the computer it will produce something for a specific company in a specific area.  If that happens, then I say shame on the Government for having ignored the broad perspective of the industry for so long. The objective behind the terms announced today should be to attract people into <Col N="1799" /> the third round but I do not believe that people will be breaking down the door trying to get licences as a result of these terms.</P>
    <P>We must strike a balance between getting the maximum for the State and the hard-pressed taxpayer and at the same time leave a proper return on investment for those who place such huge sums of money at high risk.  How can the taxpayers' interests be best protected?  I say without hesitation that the first approach by the Government has been misguided and misdirected.  I do not know if this approach followed on from ideological hangups but from the point of view of the hard-pressed taxpayer the one thing that should not have been given away is royalties on the barrels of oil produced.  The track record and economic history will prove time and again that the only safe way to protect the taxpayer is to take the royalties on the barrels of oil produced. The Government have decided not to do that but rather to waive the royalties on the first 25 million barrels of oil produced on wells up to 75 million barrels.  With the average price of oil today in a well of 75 million barrels that could mean, from the taxpayers' point of view, giving away £60 million to £70 million.</P>
    <P>Is that what it was designed to do?  Are the Government foolish enough to think that it will have the beneficial effect in the third round that they thought it would have?  If they think that they will not be left long in ignorance when they try to find applicants for the third round.  To my knowledge there has been no complaint from the industry in regard to our terms in relation to royalties and corporation tax.  No argument was ever put forward to me either as Minister or as Opposition spokesman in relation to royalties or taxation. Why should the Government choose to give away royalties when the industry did not ask them to do so, instead of directing their attention to the real problem which is the uncertainty which exists in relation to the State's participation in any well?</P>
    <P>It may sound complicated but it is as simple as this.  A company go out and drill <Col N="1800" /> for oil and if they find it in commercial quantities they come back to the State under the 1975 terms and the State can say, if it so wishes, that it is taking up 50 per cent of that well.  They can also say to the licensee that they want the licensee to pay the total development cost. Although the licensee has only a 50 per cent share of the well the Government can say they want him to pay 100 per cent of the development cost.  Think of what that means to people trying to put hundreds of millions of pounds together to get a development going.  They only own 50 per cent of the well and yet they have to find the total amount of finance.</P>
    <P>Like insurance companies and others in big business normally oil companies share the risk around.  They give 5 per cent to one company and 20 per cent to another and so on but if they only own 50 per cent one can see the severe limitations which will be placed on them in trying to spread the risk in what is accepted as being a risky business.  As a result of the uncertainty that exists no company can come up with an economic module which will tell them that it is correct for them to go ahead.  That is the root cause of the problem in relation to exploration off our coasts and the Government have ignored this.</P>
    <P>We can talk about having 50 per cent now and we have spoken about this for ten years but 50 per cent of nothing is nothing and what we have been clapping ourselves on the back about for the last ten years has turned out to be nothing.</P>
    <P>What is in the best interests of the economy and the taxpayers?  It is certainly not giving away royalties.  When we deal with the oil business we are dealing with high risk capital and development costs over which the State has no control. We are going into a business we do not know anything about.  We can try to estimate what the expenditure and development costs will be and out of that must be paid the 50 per cent carry for the State. The result is that the State has no say over the sale of the oil until its 50 per cent carry has been paid.  Our approach would be to protect the taxpayer and get the maximum benefit for him by holding <Col N="1801" /> on to the royalties and our taxation system which have not proved objectionable to the industry nor have they been the cause of people not coming in here to drill for oil.  I do not know why the Government have approached it in the way they have.  I asked many times about all the early morning visits and about the Rolls Royces which were lined up outside of Government Buildings one Friday morning at 9 a.m.  Was that visit in vain? Until all this has been teased out no one will be in a position to say.</P>
    <P>From a business point of view, when one tries to work out what this means and the Government's position in relation to what is a reasonable return the answer comes out at 10 per cent.  When one studies the make-up of that formula it appears to start off from a premise of 20 per cent in one part but it finally turns out, using the 1.85 profitability ratio, at 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister saying to the oil industry that 10 per cent constitutes a reasonable return?  Does he expect the industry to knock down his door for application forms and spend hundreds of millions of pounds for a miserly 10 per cent?  The Government have not been able to keep money in the country.  Look at the amount of money which has flowed out through the black hole.  If the Minister can confirm that the rate of return will be higher than 10 per cent I would be delighted to hear it.  Where did the figure of 1.85 come from?  No economist understands where it came from.  When one uses the figure of 1.85 and works through the formula the bottom line is 10 per cent. If that is the case then the Minister will not get anywhere.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately and regrettably the announcement errs on the side of getting the maximum benefit for the taxpayer. We are left in an uncertain situation where we cannot control our destiny.  It appears now that if there are applicants for the third round we will not get any return from them.  There cannot be uncertainty in the world of business. People in Houston or Texas do not love Ireland.  They do not have to drill in our waters.  They will go where they can get <Col N="1802" /> a return on their money.</P>
    <P>There are people in the public arena today who say that the ninth round from the UK Government was designed for marginal fields only, and that marginal fields only had been discovered since they introduced it.  They should get their facts right.  Since the ninth round was introduced the new terms are that there is no State carry whatsoever.  Corporation tax in England is 35 per cent.  There are no royalties either.  Fields of 150 million to 300 million barrels have been found over there since the new terms were announced.</P>
    <P>An incentive must be given.  Uncertainty has to be removed.  At the same time the Government do not have to sell the taxpayer down the river in an approach to what I well appreciate is a complex problem.  Wherever the Minister got his advisers, they do not live in the real world of commerce and business. If they have an ideological hangup which suggests selling the taxpayer down the river in the situation of a 75 million barrel field to give away £60 million or £70 million straight out of the taxpayers' pocket, so be it and the responsibility is on the Government's head.</P>
    <P>The Minister has not convinced me that somewhere in this well disguised operation there is not a benefit to a particular field, ignoring the long-term development of the industry.  If the Minister is thinking in terms of early production systems, it has been proven time and time again that early production systems damage the total reserves and do not give the returns that could be got out of any field.  This can be seen in the North Sea and in Norway.  If that is what the Minister is trying to do, to get, as most members of the Government have been trying to get, a good perception &mdash; action does not matter, performance does not matter &mdash; that is short-term.  You can fool some of the people some of the time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time.</P>

      <P>Ever since the Lemass Government granted exploration rights in Irish waters to Marathon back in the fifties for a few hundred pounds, <Col N="1803" /> the approach of successive Irish Governments, both Fianna Fáil and Coalition, to the whole question of the development of our mineral and oil resources has been characterised by an absence of any coherent policy and an apparently limitless desire to accommodate the demands of the exploration companies.</P>
      <P>The new concessions announced for the oil companies, taken in conjunction with the decision in January last to grant even more favourable tax arrangements for companies involved, are just the latest part of the process of capitulation to the multinationals.  Whatever formulae are used, it is still capitulation.  The Minister is telling the oil companies that he will not impose all the royalties to which this State is entitled, nor will the State take up the 50 per cent State participation, both of which until now were part of the offshore licensing terms.  The Minister's statement confirms what the media regarded as the real position.</P>
      <P>Every time a promising oil or gas show was discovered, the media spoke with one voice and declared that the State could not possibly afford to take up the 50 per cent stake and that it must make tax and royalty concessions to the oil companies if it wished to see oil produced. Deputy Reynolds quite rightly said we are not an oil producing area at the moment.  Now that oil companies have got their way, and have got the concessions for which they have been pressing in the media and elsewhere, we will soon see the oil coming ashore.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the early seventies, after the discovery of the Navan ore body, the same interests who are now campaigning for improved terms for the oil exploration companies told us that, unless we gave the most favourable terms possible to the mining companies, the ore body would never be developed.  We are now paying the price for this.  Tara Mines have been developing the Navan ore body since 1978 and contributed not one penny in royalties or taxation to the Irish Exchequer. At the same time, they have been exporting 300,000 tonnes of ore concentrate <Col N="1804" /> each year with little if any benefit to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>The new deal for the oil companies has been announced at the end of a very effective public relations campaign by the oil companies to convince public opinion that concessions were necessary if the oil was to be developed.  Some sections of the media have been the willing accomplices of the oil companies in this campaign. There is a general welcome among the editorial writers in the morning's papers for the new deal.  The <i>Irish Independent</i> believes that it is far more important to err on the generous side.</P>

      <P>The constant speculation in shares on the Stock Exchange which has accompanied the search for oil in Irish waters has constituted the most ugly and unacceptable face of capitalism.  Huge fortunes have been made in speculation in oil shares, but not one drop of oil has been brought ashore.  If we measure what has been happening in terms of job creation and the general well-being of our people, the speculators might just as well have been playing poker or backing horses in Punchestown or Cheltenham.  The principle is exactly the same.  Huge profits are being made with no benefit to our depressed economy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The interest of the Irish people and the interests of the oil companies are not the same.  Whatever oil is there is probably quite small in terms of the overall requirements of the giant multinational oil companies like Chevron.  In terms of the annual energy needs of this country it is very substantial.  The oil companies have <Col N="1805" /> recognised this and are using it to extract every possible concession from the Government.  There is no urgency on the part of the oil companies.  They are prepared to wait.  They want as much profit with as little Government &ldquo;take&rdquo; in the form of tax and royalties as possible.  It is not in any way in conflict with their interests to delay the development of the Irish fields.  Hence their very low key approach to Irish prospects and their attempts to throw cold water on Irish offshore hopes at every possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The whole approach of the Government to the development of oil resources has been flawed.  Largely we have had to depend on information supplied by the oil companies themselves as to what exactly is there.  There is a strong argument that we should have adopted the approach which the Norwegians adopted who, once it was established that there was oil in their waters, involved themselves much more directly in exploration and brought in the technical expertise from elsewhere.  They bought the technical expertise to do the job.</P>
    <P>The oil companies are claiming that they have not found oil in commercial quantities in Irish waters, that they are only marginal fields, which is the term used by the Minister.  His whole package is designed for the marginal fields.  The clear information available in the oil industry is that Gulf Oil, since taken over by Chevron, have found oil in commercial quantities.  Significantly they have since taken over what seemed to be the totally useless asset of Whiddy and are developing it for some extraordinary reason.  I wonder what it could be.  Could it be that they know the oil is there?  The information is that the oil they have found is of a very high quality and is contained in a number of small reservoirs rather than in one large field and could relatively easily and cheaply be brought ashore &mdash; in shallow waters close to the shore. There is likely to be a whole series of small reservoirs in the 75 million barrel class.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1806" /> That is precisely what the oil companies are looking for &mdash; a special concession for a whole series of these small reservoirs off the Waterford Coast, instead of one large one.  Each will fit neatly into the Minister's category of marginal wells in the 75 million barrel class, for which they will get the concession of royalties.  One-third, 25 million barrels, can be taken in without paying any royalties.  We say that, like the Norwegians, the State itself should be in the more promising locations, sometimes located in blocks not yet taken up, but which are beside blocks where promising shows have been located by drilling.  This has been the procedure of the Norwegians and has given them enormous information on and control over the oil companies, and enormous independence. The Norwegians are not some huge country with which we could not possibly compete.  They are precisely the same as ourselves, with about four and a half million population.  However, they have a strong and determined Government and are prepared to fight the multinationals.</P>
    <P>The Minister who has negotiated this new arrangement is the leader of the Labour Party.  I wonder does he speak for that party in this matter?  <i>The Irish Times</i> of 30 May 1984 under a heading &ldquo;Cluskey calls for tough line on oil&rdquo; reported that the Tánaiste's predecessor as Labour Party Leader said that &ldquo;the suggestion by Atlantic Resources that, in return for bringing oil ashore at an early date the Government should renegotiate the existing licence terms, should be resisted at all costs&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>He later said: &ldquo;We should not be under any illusions about all this.  Any revision of the terms currently obtaining will benefit the oil companies, and will disadvantage us&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The terms have now, in effect, been renegotiated to the oil companies' favour twice in the last six months.  Given the record of this Government, it is not likely to be the last time.  This is an outrageous deal, a capitulation and sell-out to Chevron and the Seven Sisters.  The Minister is again giving away our natural resources <Col N="1807" /> free, as previous Ministers did with our mineral resources.</P>

      <P>The Minister for Finance, as I have already said, has had the audacity to say that this Government are achieving their budget targets.  This year the same Minister brings in the highest budget deficit ever &mdash; £1,234 million, or 7.9 per cent of GNP.  This is the Minister for Finance who talked a while ago about reducing the current budget deficit to £700 million.  It is totally deceitful for the Minister to talk about achieving budget targets when, in fact, what he is doing is letting the current budget deficit run to an unprecedented height.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As I see it, the Minister for Finance, <Col N="1808" /> in particular, and this Government have adopted a totally new tactic so far as the public finances are concerned.  What they do is bring out a document, proposal or statement setting themselves the softest of all possible options.  In this case it it the current budget deficit.  Then their propaganda machine goes to work and their pretty pliable public media accept the soft targets put out &mdash; a current budget deficit of enormous proportions. Then the Government and the Minister gives themselves a pat on the back and credit for reaching these soft targets which they set.  That is exactly what has happened here.  The Minister in his Budget Statement set himself a current budget deficit of practically 8 per cent of GNP &mdash; an all time record.  Now he comes in and assures us that he is reaching his budgetary targets.  Why would he not reach them, since he set them and at the softest possible level of achievement?</P>
    <P>In another part of his speech, the Minister said as follows:</P>
    <P>The recent publication of the end quarter figures for March led to some wild speculation that a second budget was planned for 1985.  There was no basis for this kind of comment.</P>
    <P>Later on in the same paragraph, he says:</P>
    <P>Should it happen that a significant overrun begins to emerge during the course of the year, then the Government will take whatever steps are required to keep the budget in line with targets.</P>
    <P>I want to state that that represents double-speak by this Minister for Finance.</P>
    <P>First of all he implies that there will be no second budget.  Then the second statement clearly envisages that there may be.  When the Minister for Finance talks about &ldquo;whatever steps are required to keep the budget in line with targets in the event of significant overruns&rdquo;, he is, of course, talking about a second budget and nothing else.  It is totally misleading for him to suggest that talk of a second budget is wild speculation.  It is nothing of the sort, because the trends shown up in the first quarter Exchequer returns, if <Col N="1809" /> they were to continue throughout this year, will certainly require a second budget of some kind.</P>
    <P>There is another contradiction in the same paragraph.  In one part of the paragraph the Minister says that it is much too early to draw conclusions about trends for the year as a whole, while later on he says that he has &ldquo;no reason at this stage to be other than confident about the likely outcome&rdquo;.  If it is too early to draw conclusions for the year as a whole, how then can the Minister be confident about the year as a whole?</P>
    <P>That whole paragraph by the Minister represents, as I say, an audacious piece of double-speak and is totally unworthy of a Minister for Finance, coming into this House purporting to give us a factual outline of the position in introducing a Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>This Minister's preoccupation with presentation rather than with straight factual statements is leading him into this sort of self-contradictory statement.  We all recall that on introducing the budget this year, he departed from all previous tradition and practice in the manner in which he presented his budget.  He did so because his budget speech was being broadcast on radio and he wanted to bring the good news in the budget forward to the beginning so that he could create the best possible atmosphere for his radio audience.</P>
    <P>That sort of thing may be what the national handlers require the Minister to do, but it is certainly not in keeping with the dignified and responsible tradition of previous Ministers for Finance from all parties in this House.</P>
    <P>We had more of this type of preoccupation with presentation and propaganda in the sort of speech the Minister delivered here on Tuesday.  The local elections are coming up and it is necessary to give out some good news and whip up enthusiasm in the Government party ranks.  I have no hesitation whatever in accusing the Minister for Finance of distorting the economic and fiscal realities of our situation for party political electoral purposes.</P>
    <P>The Minister's most recent claim that <Col N="1810" /> we have come through the worst of the recession and that there are some encouraging economic developments is just not credible.  This sort of claim has been made at periodic intervals over the last 18 months, especially by the Taoiseach, who has been seeing the light at the end of an awful lot of tunnels and who has turned an awful lot of corners.  At the same time, unemployment rises, emigration grows and factory closures continue.</P>
    <P>The fact is that in many, if not most, respects our economic situation is much worse than it was two years ago.  The Minister's own Fine Gael predecessor, Mr. Richie Ryan, MEP, claimed at the weekend that the situation had become so bad that even the next, presumably Fianna Fáil, Government would not be able to do anything about it.  One of the Coalition's State board appointees, an economist from Trinity College, urged this week that the IMF should be called in because the Government have given up on the public finances.  Any economist today will tell you that (a) there is no recovery and (b) the Government's attempts to correct the public finances have failed.  Indeed, I challenge the Minister to produce one reputable economist who will affirm that the recession is over and that economic recovery is underway.  He will not be able to find one because in conscience nobody with any regard for the realities of the situation could make such an absurd proposal.</P>
    <P>We have almost 18 per cent of our labour force unemployed.  In December and January of this winter the numbers unemployed rose by 17,600, the highest rise for any two month period since records began.  A slight fall since then does not appreciably alter that picture. Major industrial closures and financial collapses continue.  Emigration on a large scale has started again, estimated at as much as 30,000 a year by agencies in Britain, and that does not include the United States.</P>
    <P>Investment is at its lowest level since the 1960s.  IDA job approvals are running at about half the level of the early 1980s and are in no way counteracting job <Col N="1811" /> losses.  Real interest rates are at an unprecedentedly high level, about eight percentage points above the rate of inflation. The recent slight drop in interest rates does not even fully restore the situation that existed at the beginning of last December.</P>
    <P>Despite our rate of unemployment of 18 per cent, the Finance Bill contains no new measures to promote employment. Unemployment is running at 60,000 above the level that was the starting point when the Government came to office and was the starting point of the Coalition's Joint Programme for Government and it is 10,000 above the peak projected in the document <i>Building on Reality</i> as late as last October.  The latest ESRI-CII survey does not anticipate any increase in manufacturing employment this year.</P>
    <P>Employment in the construction industry continues to fall and it is only 58 per cent of the level of five years ago.  We are told the economy is recovering, but in one of the basic industries employment is at 58 per cent of what it was five years ago.  Of all the sectors, building and construction have suffered the most severe contraction.  The annual bulletin of housing statistics shows that in 1984 house building fell by 25,000 for the first time in eight years despite an increase in local authority housing.  The decision to raise VAT on new houses from 5 per cent to 10 per cent is a piece of lunacy in the light of falling housing construction.  We will be putting down an amendment to cancel that increase and we will be looking for support for that amendment when the time comes.</P>
    <P>I was intrigued to hear Deputy Allen in his contribution try to defend that increase in VAT from 5 per cent to 10 per cent in respect of new houses.  I had the experience of discussing the situation with some people involved in building and construction in Cork, which is Deputy Allen's own city.  If he would take the trouble of talking to them I do not think he would dare come into this House and make the kind of case he tried to make today.  All Deputies have been circulated <Col N="1812" /> with a good document from a firm of auctioneers, valuers and estate agents.  Naturally as a commercial firm they are putting forward their own case as best they can but nevertheless their analysis of the situation is a good one. For the benefit of Deputy Allen, I should like to quote some extracts from that document:</P>
    <P>However, the announcement of the doubling of VAT on new construction from 5 per cent to 10 per cent in the January budget arrested the improving trends and since then there has been a serious decline in both sales and starts of new houses and apartments.  The decision of the Government recently to increase the new house grant from £1,750 to £2,000 will do little to avoid the mass unemployment that will take place in the building industry during May and June of this year.</P>
    <P>The document went on to say:</P>
    <P>Hundreds of sites throughout the country are in the process of being closed down and in most cases only dwellings which must be completed before the advent of the new VAT rate on 1st May are being completed.  The doubling of VAT has dealt a massive blow to whatever confidence remained in the residential sector.</P>
    <P>That document reflects the general view of the building and construction industry. The increase from 5 per cent to 10 per cent is quite inexplicable.  The kindest explanation is that the Government did not fully understand what they were doing when they were increasing the rate but when they discovered what they were doing to the industry they should have had the courage to change their decision. On Committee Stage we will give them an opportunity to mend their hand and to withdraw this ridiculous imposition on an already seriously crippled building and construction industry.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen also pursued a tactic which is now commonplace among backbench Government Deputies.  They come into this House and they demand certain things, they complain about other things and they insist that certain things must <Col N="1813" /> be done.  However, they conveniently ignore the fact that they are Deputies of the Government parties and if they want things done the right approach for them is to go to their Ministers or to raise the matter at their parliamentary party meetings and to insist that action be taken.  It is a rather despicable tactic for Government backbenchers to come in here and complain about this and that, to demand this and that and then to march dutifully into the lobby in support of Government policies that are doing exactly the opposite to what they require. It is parliamentary hypocrisy.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen came here today and spoke about the need for a programme of decentralisation.  I found it difficult to believe my ears.  He suggested the Government should pursue such a programme, but we in Fianna Fáil had begun a clear specific programme of decentralisation.  We set it out.  I happen to have with me our press announcement at the time, dated 22 October 1980.  We outlined our plans to transfer Government offices to the Limerick-Nenagh-Ennis area, to Waterford, Dundalk, Sligo, Letterkenny, Galway, Cavan, Ballina, Athlone and Killarney.  We also proceeded to implement that programme. Sites were bought, plans were drawn up and the whole programme was going ahead.  This Government came in and cancelled the whole programme.  Perhaps they were right in cancelling it in accordance with their particular economic philosophy. But it is hypocritical of Deputy Allen, who supports that Government and their policies, to come in here and ask for a programme of decentralisation when he knows that our specific programme of decentralisation, which had already been under way, was cancelled by the Government he supports.  That is typical of the sort of thing that has gone on in this House over the past two years. Government backbench Deputies, from all parts of the country, come in here, make speeches, insist on this, demand that, complain about something else while, at the same time, marching through that division lobby in support of <Col N="1814" /> Government policies doing and achieving exactly the opposite.</P>
    <P>I want to suggest that the income tax changes in this budget brought about no significant change in the tax burden of any group except for those in the top tax bracket.  Most workers will have experienced little or no increase in their take home pay after 6 April.  Indeed many will have had less in their pay packet than they had in the previous week.  The Minister, in his press statement of 11 April 1985, accompanying the publication of this Finance Bill, made the unfounded claim that the provisions incorporated in this Bill are a big step forward towards a demonstrably more efficient system of fairer taxation.  As far as most people are concerned the changes are so microscopic that they will go unnoticed.</P>
    <P>It is generally recognised that one of the major problems facing our economy at present is the depressed state of domestic demand.  According to the CII-ESRI survey for February, nearly one in four firms reported that production was being constrained and of these, 73 per cent blamed insufficient demand, that is in an economy which this Minister for Finance had the audacity to tell us is full of of confidence and has turned the corner.</P>
    <P>Traditional home industries are continuing to fare badly.  The volume of retail sales has declined by 10 per cent since 1980.  Most of the decline in the last two years has been the result of direct and indirect tax increases.  Reductions in taxation need not necessarily result in any significant fall in revenue given the present depressed state of our economy. Here I want to commend to the Government a process of selective tax reductions designed to promote employment.  Whatever arguments may be put up against that proposal of ours in times of expansion, development and increasing output there can be no argument against it at present when, all over the place, we are seeing diminishing returns setting in.  The first quarter figures for this year clearly indicate to us that there are diminishing returns throughout our economy on a massive scale.  In that situation the logic <Col N="1815" /> of selective tax reductions in particular areas, which create employment and remunerate themselves, in my view is overwhelming.  Why the Government cannot look at that is beyond me.  Is it that they are so blinded by these monetarist doctrines which they have espoused that they cannot look at one single, sensible, practical proposition of that kind?  Are they so obsessed with this fiscal rectitude, these monetarist doctrines, which are not even working for them?</P>
    <P>Richie Ryan, MEP, in one of his usual outspoken outbursts indicated last weekend quite clearly to us that in his view the Government's financial and fiscal policies are not working.  Other economists I have already mentioned said exactly the same thing although it is interesting to note that many economists who were breast high in monetarism and fiscal rectitude, who criticised us for our different outlook, are now all beginning to come round to believe that monetarism has failed and that the policies so implacably pursured by this Government have resulted in failure.</P>
    <P>The principal rises in the level of VAT and the multiplication of rates in recent years were decisions of Coalition Ministers for Finance.  Are we expected to give this Minister for Finance credit for correcting his mistakes?  The top rate of VAT, which four years ago was 25 per cent, having been raised to 30 per cent and 35 per cent, has now been reduced to 23 per cent in a belated effort to compensate for the effects of those decisions. Somewhere in his remarks the Minister for Finance claimed credit for doing this sort of thing.  For example, towards the end of his opening remarks on this Bill he had this to say:</P>
    <P>One of the central points repeatedly made by the Commission on Taxation in their reports to date is that we must simplify our tax structure.  I entirely agree with this and the changes in income tax and VAT which are incorporated in the Finance Bill are a big step forward towards a much more rational system of taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1816" /> Bravo.  Hear, hear.  We have a Minister for Finance who will now simplify VAT rates which he and his colleagues complicated in the first place.  Since coming into office, in their first, short-lived period, and within this period, they have multiplied taxation in every direction, created a whole new series of taxes of one kind or another, a whole new band of value-added tax rates.  Now we are expected to give them credit, to applaud their decision to uncomplicate this system of VAT rates that they made complicated in the first instance.</P>
    <P>We warned over the last two years the disastrous consequences the high VAT rates would have in Border areas but only now is any attention being paid to those warnings.  Trade lost in those areas will take a long time to recover fully.  However, most of the items that prior to the July 1981 Budget were charged at 10 per cent remain at 23 per cent while the 10 per cent rate of VAT applies, for a large part, to items that used to be zero rated or 3 per cent &mdash; footwear and clothing, fuel and new houses to name but a few examples.</P>
    <P>The urgent need for VAT reform arose directly from the savage rate increases introduced by Coalition Governments. The reform which we introduced &mdash; levying VAT at the point of entry &mdash; was the only real major one, a decision which incidentally two years later was copied by the British Government.  We all recall the ferocious onslaughts made on us at that time by the present Taoiseach and other leaders of the Fine Gael Party about that major reform we brought about.</P>
    <P>Section 11 of this Bill provides for the continuation of the 1 per cent income levy introduced by the Coalition in the 1983 Budget and justified by reference to what they described as the very serious budget situation.  The fact that this 1 per cent levy is being continued leads us to the conclusion, despite all the cutbacks and hardship imposed by the Coalition, that we are still in a very serious budget situation.  That was why that 1 per cent income levy was introduced in the first place &mdash; because of a very serious budget <Col N="1817" /> situation.  It is now being continued. Therefore, <i>ipso facto,</i> we must still be in a very serious budget situation.  But the Minister for Finance tells us that we are reaching all our budgetary targets, that we have turned the corner and the worst is over.  The amount of inconsistencies on the part of this Minister for Finance certainly will merit a major entry in the <i>Guinness Book of Records,</i> that is if they have any paragraph in that publication for inconsistencies.  I am not sure that they do.  But if they do not the Minister for Finance and his Coalition Government would merit a very special heading in that book for a massive parade of inconsistencies of one kind or another.</P>
    <P>As everybody knows, very high rates of taxation are to be continued through the medium of this Bill.  We on this side of the House believe that the only way to give our economy a fillip, in an endeavour to attempt to turn it around, is to secure a very significant reduction in taxation levels.  One of the ways in which people could hopefully look forward to achieving a reduction would be from revenues from offshore oil when it comes on stream. Therefore every taxpayer has a real interest in what will happen in regard to the taxation of those who will be reaping the benefits from offshore oil when it comes on stream.  We are unhappy with the way this is being dealt with by the Government; it arouses our suspicions.  This is a potential source of revenue.</P>
    <P>There are a number of things in this Finance Bill which were not mentioned in the Budget Statement.  That is not exceptional.  It has happened from time to time over the years that things occurred to Governments and Ministers after the budget, and they were included in the Finance Bill.  But, why was there nothing in the Finance Bill about the taxation provisions governing offshore oil when it come on stream?  Would it not have been a natural thing to do if we are going to have a change in the royalties and the taxation provisions, so that we could discuss them on Committee Stage so that every Member would know what exactly was involved and so that we could decide on whether the taxpayer was getting a <Col N="1818" /> fair deal?  That is not the way in which it was done.  We have had a sudden announcement about changed conditions and a complex statement was issued by the Government through the Minister for Energy about new provisions.  Some people on this side of the House are reasonably intelligent and got honours maths in school in the leaving certificate but none of us could make head nor tail of the statement put out by the Minister yesterday evening, and when he came in here today he certainly did not make the situation any clearer.  In due course we will have to try to get experts to tell us exactly what is involved and what is going on behind this complex statement which the Minister put before us.  Are some commercial concerns being singled out for favoured treatment?</P>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Reynolds, drew attention to the doing away with royalties and the changes in the tax provisions. The royalties, as Deputy Reynolds pointed out, were one way of ensuring that we could avoid any cheating or any creative accountancy for which some people in this area are well known.  The taxpayer could be certain that the royalty was a fixed sum per barrel of oil and that he would not be cheated out of the return. That is being done away with and we are left with complicated algebraic formulae. As yet none of us have been able to decipher it but we will make it our duty to get to the bottom of it.</P>
    <P>A statement in the Minister's speech today sends signals to us and it starts the alarm bells ringing.  He said:</P>
    <P>I will, of course, be prepared to consider, on a case by case basis, any requests from the holders of existing licences to have the new arrangements made applicable to their current licences, but it may be necessary to seek appropriate adjustments in work programmes in such cases.</P>
    <P>That is what it is all about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>The phrase that causes <Col N="1819" /> me to raise my eyebrows is &ldquo;on a case by case basis&rdquo;.  That gives the Minister of the day a fair amount of scope to make suitable arrangements as he thinks fit. Surely the whole point of bringing in new conditions is to attract new investments, to encourage people to start drilling wells.  Why should these conditions at the discretion of the Minister be applied to people who are already drilling?  They have carried out their drilling and development under the terms that were available at the time, so why should these new arrangements be applicable to people with current licences?  The House, the public and the taxpayer are entitled to know that, particularly the hard-pressed PAYE sector.  If there is any suggestion that the overburdened, hard-pressed taxpayers will not get the maximum possible return to which they are entitled from the development of this natural resource, we will have to sit up and take notice.</P>
      <P>This Government are now two and a half years in office and it is evident that their economic strategy has failed. Nobody could deny that the country is in a far worse state since they came to office: our difficulties have increased rather than diminished, borrowing has accelerated and the public finances are far more in imbalance than they ever were.  The monetarist approach has failed.  The economic doctrines of the new right which are only old nineteenth century policies resurrected have created mass unemployment and driven more and more people to emigration.  We cannot afford to continue on this downward path.  We must make an economic leap in order to break out of the vicious circle of depressed demands, closures, growing unemployment and high taxation.  A turn around is needed urgently but unfortunately this Finance Bill and the budget it implements only offers us more of the same mistaken, misguided policies that we have had to ensure now for two and a half depressing years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure my colleagues in the Labour Party will appear shortly to give a good account of themselves, like all Members on this side whether voting or not.  The Leader of the Opposition was critical of Government backbenchers and accused them of being guilty of parliamentary hypocrisy by demanding things that we should be in a position to have implemented by virtue of the fact that we are in Government.  I reject that criticism. It is the duty of Government backbenchers to be critical, if necessary, and to contribute and demand as often as is necessary.  That is parliamentary democracy and it should apply to the Government parties just as it has always applied to Opposition parties.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BernardJDurkan" hpid="Mr. Durkan Mr. Durkan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>The attitude of Government backbenchers should be compared to that of Opposition Members who repeatedly demand things they know cannot be delivered.  They had ample opportunity to do many things when in Government two and a half years ago but they were incapable of doing anything.  I will <Col N="1821" /> always strongly defend the right of backbenchers to make demands and pursue their case vigorously.  That is what parliamentary democracy is all about and all Members must have a high regard for that and the right of backbenchers to contribute at any time.</P>
      <P>The Leader of the Opposition said that the country after two and a half years under the Coalition was in a worse position than when we took office.  I reject that assertion.  If all the suggestions by the Opposition were the panacea to resolve all our problems why is it that Fianna Fáil did not implement them when in Government?  Had they done so we would not have any problems today.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of the Bill. Many will say that the Government could do a lot more, and I have no doubt that if other parties were in Government in an election year a lot more would be given, but that would not be in the best interests of the people or the economy. The Government have a responsibility to bear in mind at all times that concessions given in a budget must be paid for.  As has often been pointed out, there are two ways of paying for give-aways.  We can either borrow or increase taxation.  After all the discussions that have taken place here on the economy in the last five or six years politicians must surely recognise the need to be realistic.  There is no sense in trying to mislead the public and convince ourselves that what we are saying is true if we cannot in cold figures illustrate that what we are proposing can be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a classic example in regard to the local charges imposed by local authorities. Members of local authorities would not of their own volition introduce a local charge but something had to be done so that services could be provided.  The Opposition have announced that they will replace that system with a restructured local authority financing system.  I would love to know what that means.  Will the Opposition tell us what it means?  In my view it means a local taxation system of some type or other.  The people who will be voting on 20 June have a right to know what Fianna Fáil mean by &ldquo;a restructured local authority financing system&rdquo;.  The <Col N="1822" /> public should be told if it will mean an alleviation of the burden of existing taxation. I do not think it will mean a reduction in taxation, and when all the tinsel and the wrapping is removed I have no doubt it will mean that there will be a greater burden on people.  I am not saying that the existing system is the ideal one.</P>
    <P>In times of economic difficulty, even in an election year, it is hard to be flamboyant in the budget.  However, a number of worthwhile changes have been announced in the field of personal taxation.  I accept that they are only minor changes, but they are needed.  The increase in the total income tax allowance for married people from £3,600 to £3,800 was welcome. There has also been an increase in the personal allowance for widows from £2,300 to £2,400 and for the year when widows are bereaved from £3,600 to £3,800.  The increases are only marginal but they are sufficient to keep in step with inflation.  They are an indication that somebody is aware of their plight.  The allowance for single people is being increased from £1,800 to £1,900 and there have been a number of other increases along similar lines.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the biggest issues in the minds of the public are unemployment and taxation.  Unemployment is a serious problem but great efforts are being made to do something about it.  Direct and indirect taxation is a big burden on our people, but I wonder about the suggestions put forward by the Opposition in regard to taxation.  We have heard suggestions about selected inducements, reflation and other throwaways, but I wonder if they are feasible. I do not think such moves were successful in the past.  If Fianna Fáil consider that they would solve all our problems why is it that they did not introduce them when they were in Government?</P>
    <P>There is a feeling in some quarters that taxation can be reduced without any measures being taken to make up the shortfall.  We do not spend enough time telling people where their taxes go, where the money is spent, whether on environmental services, health or educational services or a whole host of other services <Col N="1823" /> which are regarded as being free.  Deputies from all parties have not been telling the people exactly what is happening. Nothing is free &mdash; they pay for it all. When a Government tell the people that they will be able to give them something without any additional burden, then it means the money will have to be borrowed. It is unfair, unjust and unethical to try to tell people that this can be done. It was done in the past in 1977 when people were told that cars under a certain horse power no longer needed to be taxed.  People enjoyed four or five years' complete relief from that taxation and everybody thought it was a great idea. It probably seemed so at the time but nobody pointed out what was likely to happen to the road system as a result.  Did anybody point out that a continuation of that policy would be disastrous?  Does anybody now claim responsibility for the current condition of the roads as a result of that measure of tax relief?  It is about time we realised that we can only give to the people what we are taking from them. If we give over and above that amount then we have to pay it back at a very high cost in terms of interest, and future generations will have to bear the consequences.</P>
    <P>It can undoubtedly be said that there has been a general increase in the burden of taxation over the past couple of years. If the burden of taxation were much lower, where would the revenue come from to pay for the services that are now being demanded with increasing rapidity by the people opposite?  Perhaps they could tell us, keeping in mind at the same time their failures in the past.</P>
    <P>The VAT system is another element of taxation.  There is a degree of criticism of the levels of VAT and the impact on some industries, particularly small service industries which are labour intensive. Often these enterprises have large borrowings at high interest rates and many of these employers are probably asking themselves whether there is sufficient incentive to remain in business. Many people feel they would be better off not using their skills and expertise to <Col N="1824" /> provide themselves and others with jobs but allowing the system to look after them or in some cases operating on the black market.  More consideration could be given to the problems experienced by firms, particularly service industries which are faced with heavy administrative, VAT and other costs, in order to encourage them to remain legitimate and not go into the black economy.  Many who are now operating legitimately may feel that they would be better off out of the system.  Perhaps the proposals the Minister has now set in train, such as the reduction or removal of some VAT bands, will have the desired effect in that area.  If not, it could mean the loss of a number of small service industry jobs.  It would be sad if a number of employers were forced out of the system because of administrative and tax costs.</P>
    <P>I welcome the change in VAT rates as the first indication of a move towards a single rate of VAT which would remove many administrative problems.  It would, of course, create a number of problems in certain areas which are zero-rated since few people would applaud a change at that level.  Nevertheless the general direction seems to be constructive and I hope it will have a beneficial effect on the economy generally.</P>
    <P>A number of speakers have commented on the effect of the new rate of VAT on the construction industry.  It would be wrong to say that anybody involved in that industry has welcomed this change.  Obviously it creates an extra burden and increases the price to the purchaser by adding to the overheads of house construction.  It must be pointed out, on the other hand, that the Government decided to offset the burden somewhat by doubling the grant.  The grant aid now available to the construction industry is greatly in excess of what it was some years ago when the people opposite felt that they alone had the sole responsibility for keeping the building industry in motion.  I would contend that the increased financial provisions for housing, such as the £5,000 grant for special categories and the increase of £1,000 in the new house grant, will more than <Col N="1825" /> offset any ill effects that might be created by the increase in VAT.</P>
    <P>There are a couple of other matters which at another time we might go into in more detail.  One of these concerns VAT refunds for local authorities, a change they have been seeking for some time.  They are seeking an exemption in respect of VAT on materials on the basis that this would have a major impact of their budgets.  I appreciate that to make this change would result in a shortfall elsewhere but perhaps the Minister would consider the matter and make the change at some future stage.</P>
    <P>We ought to provide further tax incentives for the small saver, incentives that would be greater than any proposed so far.  I am thinking particularly of the elderly in this regard because there is evidence to suggest that a number of elderly people tend, for various reasons, not to invest their money.  In some instances this reluctance may stem from fear on their part, fear of losing their meagre savings, fear of having to pay tax or of losing some benefit but we must do everything possible by way of incentives to encourage them to invest their money in the post office, in Government bonds or even in the banks.  Money that is being hoarded and not invested is not being utilised for the good of the economy.  Therefore, by bringing about a situation whereby the person with small savings would be encouraged to invest that money would not involve any cost to the Exchequer in terms of incentives.</P>
    <P>The Opposition have been talking about a possible supplementary budget but those suggestions have been answered by the Minister for Finance. All I can say in that regard is that I can recall one or two occasions when the people opposite while in Government thought about introducing supplementary budgets but did not do so.  During the last year in which they were in Government, public finances were very much out of control but no changes were made by way of supplementary budget to correct matters.  Perhaps the then Government were not aware of how bad matters were or maybe they did not take <Col N="1826" /> action because of the pending general election.  On that occasion a miscalculation to the extent of several hundred million pounds seemed to emerge.  That information may be only academic now but it may be no harm to recall it because we can draw inspiration from such experiences.</P>
    <P>Section 54 of the Bill refers to the levy on the banks.  This is a topical matter because when business and people generally are experiencing financial pressure, it is reasonable and understandable that they demand the kind of levy that is being put on the banks now.  Banking institutions and the big investors may not share that opinion but there must be some room for rationalisation in the banking system. To take one instance, a depositor with a bank is paid 8 per cent interest on his money while a borrower is charged about 15 per cent on the money borrowed.  The margin in this respect has widened considerably down through the years.  One appreciates that administrative costs have increased and that there have been various Government impositions on the banking system but these hardly account for the wide margin between the two levels of interest.  The Minister might look at this question at some time in the future.  I am not suggesting that it should be dealt with in a way that would impose a burden on the system but some means should be arrived at whereby the margin could be narrowed.</P>
    <P>I regard this Finance Bill as being constructive and forward looking.  It does not indicate proposals to hand out massive amounts of money to the electorate in an election year.  The Bill has been designed carefully with a view to keeping the economy on the rails to the greatest extent possible.  I am confident that that purpose will be achieved and that next year we in Government will be bringing forward another Finance Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This country needs courage and the lack of courage on the part of the Minister for Finance in relation to this Bill is very evident.  I wish to concentrate on merely a few of the sections of the Bill.  Much of what it contains has been dealt with already during the budget debate.  When I refer to courage I have in mind the sort of courage the Minister tried to bring to bear last year in introducing the venture capital scheme but, unfortunately, his own actions stifled that scheme subsequently. The same has happened again this year. I refer to Section 67 of this Bill.  Section 67 demonstrates the toe in the water approach of the Government in the sense that they have come up with a very good idea and a very good scheme but then they strangle it with regulations so that at the end of next year they will have to dash in with amendments to make the scheme work.  Why does the Minister continually bring interesting schemes into the House which sound good but which do not work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 67 says that if multinational companies want to invest some of their £500 million &mdash; this famous black hole money &mdash; in special Government securities, the State will not tax them on that investment.  On the surface, that is a good idea for which the Minister should be complimented, but unfortunately, this scheme will not work and we will be telling the Minister this time next year that it was a good idea which did not work.  It will not work because while it is desirable that foreign firms should reinvest their profits in Ireland, if they make money in this country it is earmarked for two things, for manufacturing activities elsewhere and to reward shareholders with dividends.  It is extremely unlikely that those funds will be available to invest in Irish Government stocks. Their other manufacturing plants all over the world will be looking for cash to reinvest in their business &mdash; not in Ireland &mdash; but worldwide.  If that pressure does not get the money, the shareholders, who will be seeking those funds as a reward for their investment, will almost certainly get it.  I compliment the Minister on the <Col N="1828" /> scheme but it is not of any great interest to the nation.</P>
    <P>We want the multinationals to leave their money here and there is a better way of ensuring that they do so.  The Government should encourage these firms to invest directly in Irish industry because those funds are for industry and not for putting away safely.  If they wanted to invest in Government stocks or others, they would not be in the manufacturing business in the first place.  They would simply sell off their plants, liquidate their assets and then buy Government stocks.  If they were interested in safe, gilt-edge investments, that is what all companies would do.  However, they are interested in manufacturing investment and in industry and commerce and that is what their money is for.  The Minister should take advantage of that and encourage them to invest directly in Irish plant and machinery.  Why not give them tax breaks if they expand their operations, set up new industries, or if they increased employment within their operations here?  That would be a more practical approach and falls in line with what they want to do with their money.</P>
    <P>Would it not also be a good idea to say to them that if they left some of their money here, we might consider joint ventures with the Government and other firms?  There is much work to be done here in relation to the development of infrastructure, the food processing industry, our natural resources and so on, which need huge capital.  We spoke this morning about the capital needed for oil exploration.  Capital is also needed to build motorways and why not get money from multinationals to put into those schemes by giving them tax breaks?  Why pretend that they suddenly want a nice, safe haven for the £500 million?  They want to invest this money; to an extent it is risk money and, for that reason, the Minister's approach is wrong.</P>
    <P>They could also be given tax breaks if they helped to increase the linkages in the economy, that is getting small industries to plug into bigger industries and get things moving in that way.  Perhaps the Minister may like to amend the Bill as it <Col N="1829" /> goes through the House but I predict, as I did on venture capital last year, that the Minister will amend this section within 12 months because the companies will tell him that the money is for shareholders and plants worldwide.  We should cash in on that and offer the plants and outlets here to invest directly in Irish industry.  If they do that, they should get tax breaks.</P>
    <P>There is another side to that upon which I want to concentrate because it demonstrates the wrong direction and naivety of the Government in introducing imaginative schemes and then panicking half way through and holding back.  What happened in the venture scheme will also happen in this case.  One would not be too suspicious in thinking that all the Government are trying to do here is to borrow money.  That is fair enough because economists have been suggesting that we should borrow internally instead of externally.  However, this section could force the Government into borrowing money at higher rates than in the marketplace because, if these special securities are issued at interest rates, it means that the Government are simply borrowing money from the multinational companies.  They are asking them to lend them money instead of sending it abroad and they will be paid interest on it.  If it is cheaper to borrow money abroad or in the Irish marketplace even with the tax break, why lock yourself into this system of borrowing money from multinational companies when you could get that money more cheaply elsewhere?</P>
    <P>It is not clear from the section whether there will be a market created in these securities or whether people will be able to trade in them.  If they cannot be traded in properly, multinationals will not get locked into them and the system will not work.  The Minister has also missed a crucial area.  I read the section carefully and, all through it, it refers to companies. Does the Minister know what is going on in the Irish economy?  The reality is that most foreign operations do not have companies in Ireland, they operate through branches.  The section does not mention branches and any reading of the section <Col N="1830" /> ties it to a company.  Every second line refers to companies.  It is quite clear that, for a start, nobody will qualify.  I do not want to name companies but there are many large companies operating here as branches.  The Minister should bring in an amendment in that regard and include the word &ldquo;branches&rdquo; in this section.</P>
    <P>I have demonstrated that this shows the naive approach of the Minister for Finance in attempting to inject a spark into the Irish economy.  He started off with a spark but he very quickly threw cold water on it and has now put it out. The fact that the Minister put this forward as a major advance worries me, particularly when put side by side with last year's venture capital scheme.  Last year I welcomed the venture capital scheme as a step forward, but I want to quote what I said on 8 May 1984 in this House on this section of the Bill as reported in the Official Report, column 394, volume 350:</P>
    <P>This scheme lacks a lot of courage. On the one hand it says that we want venture capital... to get businesses started, but there are so many barriers here that people will not avail of this scheme.  The reaction I am getting to this scheme is that it is an exciting scheme; but there are too many barriers...</P>
    <P>I said that 12 months ago in this House and I say the same about that section 67 today.  I have been proved dead right about that venture capital scheme.  Questions put down to the Minister in this House as recently as a month ago have elicited the response that only three or four venture capital funds have been set up in the country in response to the scheme.  We had expected 30, 40, 50.  We expected huge interest.</P>
    <P>Secondly, only a handful, a few thousand pounds of investment has gone through the scheme and it is quite clear that the venture capital scheme, launched with much fanfare, has been a total failure. When we told the Minister last year that it was an exciting scheme we were not being begrudging about it.  We <Col N="1831" /> pointed out that yes, it was a good scheme but he was killing it with red tape, and it did not work.  I point out to add strength to my argument that this section 67 in regard to multinational companies will not work either and I ask him this year to take my word for it.  I do not want to stand here again in 12 months' time having to point out that that section did not work either while admitting that it was a good idea.</P>
    <P>On the venture capital scheme the Minister for Finance, Deputy Dukes, last year said, and I quote from column 428 of the same volume:</P>
    <P>The scheme has been delimited to get the best results and the best multiplier effect we can from the application of investment to the kind of activity we have talked about.  We could spread the net wider.  There would be no difficulty doing that.  It would require no imagination whatsoever.  We could spread the investment jam a little more thinly and get a lesser result, but we are talking about a sensible balance between the requirements.</P>
    <P>That was the Minister's response to our call here to expand and extend the scheme.  He thought it unnecessary at that time.  Six months later he announced some minor changes in it.  Again in the Bill today there are more minor changes in it, and he tells us now that on Committee Stage he is going to bring in some further amendments.</P>
    <P>The Minister was much too cautious with this scheme.  The British experience with a much wider scheme has been more successful.  All right, in the attempt to be more successful and courageous in Britain they have taken on a few cowboys, they have had a few bad eggs, the odd maggot has slipped through the net; but the result in terms of creating jobs has been an overwhelming success.  In Ireland in our over-cautious approach of nailing down every little edge of the carpet and covering every corner in case the tax whizz kids would do you, we have killed the scheme.  The Minister brought <Col N="1832" /> forward an exciting scheme and offered it to the public and nobody took it up. The Minister made that clear in his replies to parliamentary questions in the last few weeks.</P>
    <P>I await the amendments on Committee Stage to see if they will be very interesting. The management fee must be altered if that scheme is to work, that is, the small percentage allowed to the people who manage the funds.  A person who manages a fund of £1 million was offered £5,000 last year in the Minister's Bill. Would you manage £1 million funds for £5,000?  I would not, with all the risks involved and the difficulties.  We told the Minister last year that nobody would do that, but he was afraid the funds would rip off the investors so he was extra cautious, and cautious Deputy Dukes put into the Bill that the maximum was 5 per cent, and nobody took it up.  He must change that.  He made a statement recently, on which I compliment him, in which he said that he realised that those management fees would have to be changed and he will change them on Committee Stage.  I look forward to him making that change, but let him do it properly if he is going to do it.  Do not put it up to 7 per cent or 8 per cent.  Leave it to the market, let the market decide.  If I invest money in a financial institution or ask a fund to put away my money in manufacturing companies, I can handle what I pay the professional adviser to do that.  We do not need the State to step in between the two of us saying &ldquo;You cannot charge more than this&rdquo;.  Leave it to the market and it will work itself out.  The firms that charge too much will not get the support of the investor and the funds that give a good deal will get the support.  It is another example of just too much Government interference in the regulation of the economy. That is one of the major difficulties in this economy on which I have spoken many times.  I do not want to go into it today but we should face it squarely.</P>
    <P>The Minister said also that he would extend this scheme to relatives.  We pointed out last year throughout the debate on the venture capital that that had to be done, that you cannot exclude <Col N="1833" /> relations investing in these venture capital funds because if you do that you are excluding the people who have a real interest in doing it.  The people who will have a real interest in investing in most small companies are not some fancy outside pinstripe suited bankers but more likely the relations and distant relatives, people who want to help out that company. Up to last year they were not being given the tax breaks and it is not in the Bill yet to do so.  They should be given the tax breaks, and the Minister has made a public statement that he intends to make some changes in that regard.  I encourage him to make those changes; but, please, if he is making them stop the dipping the toe in the water approach which we had last year in the venture capital scheme and this year in the multinational section.  Plunge in, take the risk. We cannot be worse off in this country than we are today.  Leaving party politics aside, the condition this country is in must be of serious concern to anybody no matter what political hat he wears, and this is no time for this extraordinary cautiousness which the Minister demonstrates in all of these schemes.  If you are going to have an exciting scheme like the venture capital scheme, for God's sake let it breathe.  If there are abuses we can tighten up a little, but at the moment good schemes are being stillborn.</P>
    <P>I want to extend this venture capital area to financial services, to tourism, for example.  Why not extend it to tourism, to construction, to agriculture?  Some of our largest industries are being excluded in a scheme which simply says that if you invest £25,000 in an industry you can write that off against your income tax. That is a brilliant idea which is very successful in America, on continental Europe and in Britain.  This country is the only place it has not been successful because we flew up the kite and then pulled it down before anybody had a shot at it.  I am concentrating on that plus the multinational thing which I have talked about because, taken together, they demonstrate the basic problem of the Minister's approach to solving our economic problems, which is much too cautious, <Col N="1834" /> much too careful, offering the goodies and putting them back before anybody gets a chance to examine them.  On the venture capital scheme I want to see amendments in this Bill dealing with management fees, with relations, including the services, tourism, construction and agriculture and in that way the Minister will get new funds set up and new investment in the economy.  Those two matters epitomise what I want to say on the Finance Bill.</P>
    <P>The income tax take will rise this year after an 18 per cent rise in 1984.  That must be taken into account with the income levy, the youth levy and all the other tax measures in the budget.  Let us be calculating about these figures.  For a person employed the employer pays 12.2 per cent PRSI and the employee pays 5.5 per cent, the health charge is 1 per cent, the youth charge is 1 per cent and the income levy is 1 per cent.  That is 20.7 per cent.  I have said a number of times that, aside altogether from PAYE, there is 20.7 per cent taxation in the income of every person in the State.  Is that a policy designed to employ people in this State? I have appealed to the Minister before now to tackle that situation.  Every board of every company today have on their agenda after the usual items &ldquo;rationalisation of staff&rdquo; as they call it.  The other word for that is &ldquo;redundancies&rdquo;.  The reason for that is that every person they employ, between the employer and employee a 20.7 per cent slice is taken off the top before any ordinary PAYE is taken.  That is prohibitive.  We must, as I think we can, get to a situation where at board meetings of all the companies the spirit of one item on the agenda will be that it is cheaper to take on extra people, so let us do it &mdash; not the notion that the more people we take on the more we are crucified, therefore we will not do that.</P>
    <P>Apart from that burden of taxation which has been spoken about at length from this side of the House &mdash; and there is a growing awareness on the other side of the House &mdash; I would be delighted if I thought that burden could be reduced or stabilised, but the reality is that the figures do not look any better for next <Col N="1835" /> year or for the period of the national plan.  If one looks at the Government's projections in that plan one sees it is inescapable that the taxation figure will rise even further, that is not to meet my targets or the targets set by outsiders but to meet the Government's own targets. The flow of revenue from taxation is not sufficient to meet the targets set down in the Government's plan.  If I had time I could demonstrate that by a series of facts and figures which are there for everybody to see.</P>
    <P>I want to comment on section 54 which deals with the bank levy.  This question of taxing banks and of bank levies has to be rationalised, because while one arm of Government &mdash; the Department of Finance &mdash; were busy imposing a Robin Hood type of arbitrary tax on deposit holders by way of the bank levy, instead of having a comprehensive sensible taxation system, another arm &mdash; the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism &mdash; failed to supervise the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  They did not know what was going on in one of our major clearing banks, AIB and their then subsidiary, the Insurance Corporation of Ireland.  The Insurance Corporation of Ireland should be made report to this House through their administrator now that they are a semi-State company. I am a little concerned that once the fuss has died down everyone will go back to his desk and let the situation drift.  I will be tabling a motion at the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies asking that we call the Insurance Corporation of Ireland before us without undue delay because they are now a semi-State company and should be made amenable to that committee.  There may be a case for the bank levy but there is no case for, on the one hand, a bank levy and on the other, not bringing forward a proper taxation system for the banks and not insuring the safety of depositors' funds because Departments are not living up to their responsibilities in controlling insurance companies in particular.</P>
    <P>I welcome the section dealing with inheritance taxation.  After June 1982, a <Col N="1836" /> spouse could bequeath a maximum of only £150,000 to the other spouse.  That meant that the pension, home, life insurance policies and so on were totted up and if they came to over £150,000 the surviving spouse had to pay inheritance tax.  This has been removed in this Bill and I welcome it.  Let me say bluntly that it had to be removed because not removing it was returning us to the old system of death duties.  Up to now the proceeds of insurance policies were included for inheritance tax purposes. This too has been changed in the Bill and I welcome it, but the Minister has not allowed income tax relief on the premiums of such insurance policies.  If I am paying an insurance policy to pay inheritance taxation between myself and my wife I do not get income tax relief on the premiums I pay on that policy.  Normally I get income tax relief on insurance policies but for some strange reason I do not get it on this policy.</P>
    <P>I want to concentrate on this multinational business by saying it will not work and I put forward some suggestions as to how it might be changed.  I pointed out the changes that would be necessary to make the venture capital scheme work. Let me deal now with the overall financial situation of this State which scares the living daylights out of me, as it does to anybody who is thinking clearly.  This State owes £19 billion and we are borrowing more money at the rate of some £2 billion a year.  I wonder if any of us, whatever our political persuasion, will ever see the end of these difficulties in our life-time.  This scares the living daylights out of me when I look at my children and then look at this £19 billion increasing by £2 billion each year.  Where is it going to end?  How will we handle it?  While I can make suggestions and proposals, and the Government have their own ideas, this is a real difficulty.  I am not over-attracted by the suggestion of the economist, Mr. Barrett, that we call in the IMF.  There has to be a case over the next few years for assistance from outside agencies, from the EC or the IMF, because I do not think we can handle this problem on our own.  That is <Col N="1837" /> my honest feeling at this stage.</P>
    <P>Could we, as a nation, reschedule some of this debt?  In my view the burden of repaying this debt is so crippling that perhaps we should face the music and try to reschedule the debt and not allocate blame between the parties or politicians. We should face this problem together and do something about this £19 billion because in five or six years time we may be looking at a figure of £30 billion of £40 billion and looking at an increased proportion of our hard earned taxation money flowing out to pay foreign lenders. The Government as the leaders of the nation should take the initiative to talk to the EC and the IMF about a rescheduling of the national debt.  I am aware that there is a certain amount of rescheduling going on.  Individual loans are being rescheduled week in and week out, but they are only being pushed out by 18 months or two years.  These are minor adjustments.  I do not think we would lose face if we put that £19 billion in one box and told the lenders that we wanted to reschedule this, we want to renegotiate this, and we want to deal with this in a mature way before it engulfs the whole nation.</P>
    <P>I know there are people who will scream about that and ask what about our credibility and international standing, but that did not seem to worry us where Irish Shipping were concerned.  We had sheriffs chasing our ships around the globe, nailing white things on the masts, confiscating telephone lines, locking up provisions and so on.  If this matter is handled sensitively I do not believe it will damage the reputation of this nation.  I would like to see this country with the help of the IMF, the EC and if necessary the USA, reschedule the debt so that we can breathe.</P>
    <P>Let me put it this way, what would any of us do if we had personal bank loans but could not live on our income.  Suppose 99 per cent of our salary was going to pay the bank, what would we live on?  How would we look after after our families and our households?  This is what is happening to this nation.  Too high a proportion of the income of the State is going <Col N="1838" /> to repay our debts.  We have many committees set up to deal with various items and why not have one set up to deal with the national debt?  We can allocate blame at the hustings, stand at opposite church gates and sort out who is to blame then but let us do something about the £19 billion before it engulfs this small nation on the edge of Europe and pulls it down in the next couple of years.</P>
    <P>In the national plan it was stated that Government expenditure would be static but it has gone up by 2 per cent.  It was stated that export growth would be 100 per cent but it has been 66? per cent.  It predicted a 2 per cent fall in interest rates but interest rates have held since then. The point I am making is the same as my point about the national debt: the plan is off course.  The best we can do is to attempt to reschedule the debt in a mature way with a maximum amount of support from all sides of the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>This Finance Bill is to give expression to the 1985 budget as outlined by the Minister for Finance in January. At that time he examined the economic position.  He said that in 1984 gross domestic product grew by almost 3½ per cent which was a rate of growth appreciably faster than the average for the rest of the EC.  He said further significant progress was made in curbing inflation with the average increase in consumer prices for 1984 easing to about 8½ per cent compared with 10½ per cent for 1983 and 17 per cent in 1982.  It is reported in today's newspapers that the Central Bank expects inflation to fall to 5½ per cent. That is an indication that the Government have been trying to resolve some of the grave financial difficulties outlined by Deputy Brennan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have a very serious financial problem. Like Deputy Brennan I agree that all parties should acknowledge that the problem exists.  Sometimes, in debates in the House, Members opposite appear like Robin Hood.  They say we cannot increase taxation.  Deputy Brennan said the Minister was too cautious with venture capital and the multinationals but at the same time he criticised the national <Col N="1839" /> plan and said the figures in it were too ambitious.  The Government adopted a reasonable approach in <i>Building on Reality</i> and set modest targets.  I, too, will despair if modest targets are not achievable now.  We must acknowledge that we have financial problems.  Earlier today Deputy Haughey criticised the announcement made by the Minister for Energy this morning concerning oil exploration. Perhaps it does not go far enough in encouraging oil companies to drill for oil here but at the same time Deputy Haughey cannot come charging in to say that he is here to protect the taxpayer from the giving away of more largesse by the Government.</P>
    <P>I was present last year when Deputy Brennan spoke about the venture capital programme and I heard him say there were limitations attached to it.  I agreed with him and I thought that the management fee outlined in the previous Bill was not sufficient to encourage the financial interests to promote venture capital on the scale we need.  I understand that the benefit which will accrue to the investor only comes into effect from January 1985. It is in this tax year that the benefits will come onstream.  Perhaps that aspect was ignored.  It is encouraging to see that two major trusts have been formed and it is well to understand that there are legal constraints on the operation of venture capital funds.  I understand the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism will bring in reforming legislation to allow venture capital funds greater scope.  I agree that there are limitations on the kind of investment that can be made in a venture capital programme particularly for services and other aspects of industry.</P>
    <P>One of the problems we have apart from interest payments on the national debt is the high level of unemployment. We could make an effort through the venture capital fund to create new employment.  In the mid-west an international corporation has already made a certain amount of capital available to a small industry allied to their own trade. I am speaking about the investment made <Col N="1840" /> by Molex in a small company in Smithstown. There has been an increase in the number of jobs there.  There are people who are willing to invest in the economy and that includes multinationals.</P>
    <P>There has been a great deal of criticism about the Minister's approach to to multinationals and the black hole.  The gyrations of Deputy O'Kennedy had to be seen to be believed.  He is the person who pours doom and gloom on everything. Yesterday it was on education yet his colleagues proposed that £100 million more be spent on education.  They said there should be 5,000 extra teachers and that there should be 2,300 more jobs for remedial teachers.  In order to pay them an extra £100 million would be required from the taxpayer and that does not take account of buildings in which to house them.</P>
    <P>In an area quite close to Deputy O'Kennedy's constituency a multinationals has put capital into a small company. There is confidence in the economy.  The cautious approach described by Deputy Brennan is building up confidence.  We have got used to doom and gloom.  I usually buy my clothes in a shop in the town of Ennis.  I always buy Irish clothes.  The person who owns the drapery is a member of the Opposition party.  He has a good business and it is growing.</P>

In 1984 I asked him about business and he said it had improved a lot and that the turnover was up by approximately 20 per cent.  He said: &ldquo;We will go out and have a jar&rdquo;, so we went out to have a jar. He asked me: &ldquo;How is politics?&rdquo; I said: &ldquo;We do not know when we will have a general election.  Everybody is predicting a general election&rdquo;.  He said: &ldquo;The country was never so bad.  Nobody wants a general election&rdquo;.  That is the doom and gloom he believes in, and he tried to convert me to the doom and gloom <Col N="1841" /> image.  I do not believe the Irish people want that any more.</P>

      <P>I am conscious of the Deputy's request.  I am aware that the procedure is carried out in one hospital only and that is in the Southern Health Board area.  I imagine it is carried out elsewhere but that information is not made readily available to the Department. There is a private clinic in Celbridge which undertakes the sterilisation operation on a private basis.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Where the procedure is deemed necessary for medical reasons, which is the ordinary reason why it would be deemed appropriate, my Department would consider that to be part of a hospital's normal activity and it would be funded by the ordinary allocations like any other service.  I have been looking at this matter for several months.  It is not unconnected with recent legislation in the area, and I am endeavouring to ensure that cover is given.  The VHI can pay for the procedure in the ordinary course of events.  Provided it was for medical reasons it would come within the ambit of their scheme.  In that framework, where the hospitals and the patients require sterilisation procedures, I hope the facilities will be made available on a broader basis.  It is probably available at the moment in more than one hospital but that information is not necessarily filtered back to the Department.</P>

      <P>The Eastern Health Board agreed some time ago to facilitate a number of general practitioners in the Finglas area who are anxious to provide a family planning service from the base of the local health centre.  Preliminary discussions were held with the individual doctors concerned in the area.  The Irish Medical Organisation had also been engaged in a general review of the provision of family planning services by general practitioners.  The Eastern Health Board agreed to defer action on the Finglas pilot scheme until the IMO had finalised their own review.</P>
      <P>I understand that the Eastern Health Board are still awaiting further communication from the IMO.

      <P>A number of voluntary organisations provide information and advisory services about methods of family planning which do not involve the use of contraceptives.  My Department have provided financial assistance to a number of these organisations by way of grants which were paid to the organisations concerned through the medium of the Eastern Health Board.</P>

      <P>Under the 1979 Act I am confined in terms of my departmental grant payments but I have paid money to the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, the National Association of the Ovulation Method in Ireland and the Irish Family Planning Association.  In so far as the IFPA are involved to a limited extent in what is known as natural family planning, and the provision of services, a grant for such services was paid in 1984 to that body.  I have paid out a good deal of money in recent years to the other organisations I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>Both areas, that of research and of provisional services, are involved.  I might make the point that in 1982 £25,000 was paid to CMAC, £27,500 in 1983 and £30,000 in 1984; and to NAOMI £20,000 in 1982, £17,000 in 1983 and £16,500 in 1984.  That is in the context of moneys sought.  The amount for the Irish Family Planning Association last year was £2,000.  These are the moneys paid for research and services.</P>

      <P>Requests for additional consultant medical staff have to be submitted to my Department in the first instance to clear the financial implications of the appointment and then to Comhairle na nOspidéal, which has the statutory responsibility for assessing the medical necessity for the posts.</P>
      <P>The South-Eastern Health Board have applied for an additional post of radiologist at the General Hospital, Wexford. Should the board attach a sufficiently high priority to this post and the necessary support staff and submit a precise proposal for its funding by way of transfer of resources of some £80,000 from other areas, I will give it sympathetic consideration.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that because of the shortage of both radiologists and radiographers patients must be transferred to Dublin or Waterford from Wexford at an enormous cost to the taxpayer and great inconvenience to the patient?  Will he appoint at least two extra staff &mdash; a scheme which I believe would be self-financing &mdash; to operate fully the ultra-sound equipment installed at Wexford County Hospital which at present is being grossly under-utilised?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a consultant radiologist in Wexford full time, but if there is to be another radiologist, it would cost £80,000.  The health board will have to decide their priorities in this area.  I have not heard from them as to how precisely they propose to fund the second post for the Wexford General Hospital. I await hearing from them in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that it is his responsibility to provide the <Col N="1847" /> funding for such extra staff?  Is he aware of the stress on the present excellent staff who, because of their caring nature, often forego meal-times to accommodate patients and whose workload has increased substantially since the transfer of the medical unit at Brownswood to Wexford County Hospital and the appointment of an extra surgeon there?  Will he immediately appoint two extra staff?  I understand that is not asking too much in the circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The board have pointed out that there has been an increase in the workload in recent years and also an increase in the other consultant staffing requirements in the hospital. They are requesting also a paediatrician for the hospital.  Basically, the health board will have to decide their priorities and give an indication to us as to how they propose to fund this post within their current budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am amazed at the Minister's reply to Deputy Byrne's question. First is he aware that the South Eastern Health Board made application to Comhairle na nOspidéal in 1978 for a consultant radiologist post, which was then sanctioned by the comhairle.  In the intervening seven years it has not been allowed to go ahead, because the Department of Health have not provided funding. As recently as in the last six months, they received another letter from the Department of Health to say that this post cannot go ahead due to lack of funding. Furthermore, when the Minister says that funding might be found within the board's allocation, in a similar situation when the South-Eastern Health Board offered to do just that, they were told by the Department that any funds they found would have to offset any overrun for that year, that any moneys they saved would have to go to correct the deficit.</P>

So far they have not.  I look forward to hearing from the health board and as a member of the board itself I am sure that the Deputy takes an active interest in it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ormonde</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not being repetitious. I have asked one question to date. Is the Minister aware that the workload in Wexford County Hospital has doubled since 1975, with in excess of 30,000 examinations in 1984?  The recommendation is <Col N="1849" /> that there should be something in the region of 12,500 to 15,000 examinations per radiologist.  The single-handed radiologist there is doing double the recommended workload.  Furthermore, the ultra-sound service, which could now be regarded as a basic facility, cannot be provided in Wexford County Hospital because the Department of Health have refused to fund two sessions of attendance of a radiologist in order that the permanent radiologist could devote himself at some time to ultra-sound.  Because the Department have refused to fund those two sessions, we are denied that basic service in the hospital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I may be excused if I say that I am glad to note that radiologists on a personal basis do some 15,000 examinations, or, indeed, 30,000 for that matter.  The position is that I shall treat the application with every sympathy when the health board come up with a specific proposal on the funding.  It is pointless for comhairle or anybody else to make proposals when the cost of employing the radiologist, as the Deputy well knows, and the back-up staff who go with him or her, is between £80,000 and £100,000.  That is the problem.  I shall consider the matter as soon as I get a definite approach from the board.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the necessity for accommodation for mentally handicapped adults in County Wexford. The present position regarding the proposed residential centre for mentally <Col N="1850" /> handicapped adults is that I have approved the brief for this development and the commencement of stage 2 planning of the complex at Enniscorthy.  The selection of the design team who will prepare the stage 2 planning documentation is currently under way.  Following the final detailed planning of this project, the commencement of construction will be given due consideration within the total capital resources available to me between 1985 and 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The project brief for the new centre was submitted to the Department in mid-1983 and was approved in May 1984 when approval was also given to the commencement of stage 2.  There is no delay in the matter.  The project is quite large costing £5 million. I have made provision for the project within the framework of the capital programme for 1985-1987.  I am aware that a substantial amount of money has been collected locally.  A sum of £100,000 has been mentioned but in the context of expenditure of £5 million that is relatively small.  Nevertheless we are grateful that amount has been collected.  I want to have a look at the way these large centres are developing and I will do that as soon as I get the final brief on the matter. There will not be any delay.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HughByrne" hpid="Mr. H. Byrne Mr. H. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. H. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that the people in Wexford believe that taking nine months to appoint a design team could be regarded as a delaying tactic?  Further, is he aware that the temporary unit at Enniscorthy is full with 16 patients and it is estimated that there are another 16 patients scattered throughout the county and living in most inadequate conditions?  Will he say when work on the unit at Enniscorthy will commence?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt <Col N="1851" /> that the situation in Wexford is unsatisfactory and I share the concern of the Deputy and the local concern in that regard.  The centre will be established on a phased basis.  It is my view that in the planning of these huge centres insufficient consideration has been given to the role of hostels, day care centres, workshops and to the role of the community and social therapy.  Instead, everyone has a vision of a massive centre with 200 mentally handicapped people being cared for by a large staff.  I urge that Deputies and local organisations would review that kind of structure.  This will not in any way interfere with the moneys being allocated to Enniscorthy.  In my own constituency, where a very large centre was planned for Loughlinstown, I urged that there be a detailed review of that structure.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister not concerned that BUPA, a major health insurance company from the UK, have already come in here and invested in a private hospital?  Does the Minister not think it would be in the interests of this country, and particularly of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board, that our own national company should be allowed to invest in hospitals?  Further, will he not agree that Calvary Hospital in Galway would be ideal in this case?  It is a small unit and is on the market at the moment and it would be an ideal unit in which the VHI could become involved.

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly I am at a loss to understand how the Deputy would regard it as a viable unit.  The Sisters themselves decided they would get out of running the hospital.  They did not regard it as viable, apart from the fact that they did not have enough vocations to continue the ordinary management of the hospital.  It is a 71-bed acute hospital and it has been administered by the Sisters of the Little Company of Mary since 1954.  I have not seen any rush on the part of any organisation to take over the running of that hospital.  In that area there is the Merlin Park Hospital, the Galway Regional Hospital and Portiuncula Hospital is down the road.  That hospital is being expanded and is an excellent hospital.  There is no demand from the health board that Calvary Hospital be taken over and there are no proposals to my Department.  In fact, the VHI have not asked that they should take over the hospital.  It is the job of the VHI to get the best possible bargain and contract for their members from all the systems, whether voluntary hospitals, health board hospitals or private hospitals. I question strongly whether the VHI should put the reserves of its members into hospitals or build more hospitals of which we have more than enough and in the process cost its members extra charges.  The big problem of the VHI is to keep premium costs down rather than getting embroiled in running other hospitals.</P>

      <P>In case the Minister misunderstands, this question does not relate to the VHI investing in new hospitals. This is a question of the VHI taking a part in a hospital that exists.  Is the Minister telling us here that officials of his Department and of the Voluntary Health Insurance have not had any discussions in relation to the Voluntary Health Insurance becoming involved in capital expenditure in hospitals that exist already?</P>

      <P>To my knowledge, not specifically about Calvary Hospital. They did not approach me about it.  They may have spoken to officers of my Department.  I have not received a personal approach from either the general manager or the chairman of the VHI.  I would make the point to the Deputy that the very large number of hospitals we have encounter great difficulties in running their establishments and meeting their budgets.  I do not think we should have the VHI become involved in new or existing hospitals which close down and in opening them up again.  I cannot understand the logic of it.</P>
      <P>If the British United Provident Association want to become involved in Blackrock, which is the one in which they have become involved, that is their privilege. But the Irish taxpayer and VHI members are not going to be milked in that operation.  The State and the VHI are not in the business of amortising the capital cost of a hospital over four or five years by charging them £300 a day to get a bed in it.  We have scarce resources.  I am at a total loss to understand why the £16 million to £18 million of VHI reserves should be used for investment of that nature.  Such reserves should be used to keep premiums down so that people remain in the VHI.</P>

Therefore I cannot accept that the Minister has no function to play in the future use of Calvary Hospital.  If we are to lose 70 beds it will put pressure on existing hospitals. Because of the fact that the VHI already have headquarters in the west, administratively it may be good policy on the part of the Minister to promote a situation in which they would control that hospital, keeping it in business, recognising the fact that Galway city and its environs are expanding rapidly.</P>

Some of stage 5 documentation has recently been submitted to my Department for approval.  The rest of the documentation, including the main bill, is still awaited.

      <P>The vehicle is an equipment transporter.  It brings stretchers, blankets, rescue equipment and so on and is an on-site communications centre at a major accident.  Experience indicated that the old ambulances were suitable for conversion for this purpose and this became as a mobile control and equipment carrier.  Unfortunately the <Col N="1860" /> Southern Health Board ran into difficulties in getting the ambulance drivers at the Cork Regional Hospital to undergo training and in getting them to agree to transfer first aid equipment from the old to the new.  The union sought an increase in payment for operating such a vehicle.

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>Traditionally, health inspectors have been employed on an agency basis on environmental health work which is the statutory responsibility of local authorities.  Following a recent review of the operation of the health inspectorate throughout the country, my Department have asked each health board to review the work arrangement in its area so as to ensure that adequate time is provided for achievement of work targets in respect of the health board's own responsibilities.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I can understand that the health inspectors association might feel that additional health inspectors should be employed by health boards so that the agency duties can be absorbed without detriment to health board work. The main concern of health boards must be that their own responsibilities in regard to food hygiene are adequately discharged.

    <P>The 1984 Garda statistics on crime are being finalised at the moment.  I understand that the numbers charged with drug offences and the number of drug seizures in 1984 represent a decrease in the figures for the previous year.</P>
    <P>It is too soon yet to say, with any degree of certainty, that the 1984 figures represent a reversal in the growing trend in drug abuse which was evident in the previous few years, but it does seem to indicate that the problem has to an extent stabilised.  While I am encouraged by this I can assure the Deputy that it will not lead to complacency on the Government's part in the fight against drug abuse.</P>

The number of drug seizures has gone up considerably and the number of persons charged with drug offences has also increased.  In 1981 more than 1,200 people were charged while in 1982 almost 1,600 people were charged.  In 1983 the number had increased to 1,800.  I do not have the breakdown of the social background of those charged but if it is available in the Department I will forward it to the Deputy.</P>

      <P>I make the broad point, bearing in mind that the 1984 report has not been published as yet, that despite the fact that the most intensive work has been done by the drug squad, the number of drug seizures last year appears to have dropped.</P>

      <P>The number of persons presenting themselves for treatment has levelled off.  In 1982, 1,300 people presented themselves for threatment. That figure rose to 1,515 in 1983 and in 1984 it was 1,454.  Admittedly the plateau is high but there has been a levelling off. I am very cautious about reading any trend into data of that nature but it appears that there has been a levelling off.  There is no doubt that the public awareness of the drug problem, which has been hightened in the last two or three years, seems to be having an impact.  The effectiveness of the drug squad and other matters such as the control of irresponsible prescribing have also had a considerable impact.  The fact that the Misuse of Drugs Act, 1984, which is in operation contains a provision under <Col N="1866" /> which life imprisonment can be imposed on pushers, has also had an impact.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>Despite everything the Minister has said I should like to know if he agrees that heroin, which is possibly the most dangerous of all drugs involved, is as readily and freely available on the streets of this city today as it was when the heroin epidemic was at its worst two or three years ago?  For example, in my constituency in the last couple of months £250,000 worth of heroin was seized by the drug squad in one seizure.  That was one of the largest amounts of heroin taken in one seizure and it took place in February.  In O'Connell Street heroin is available and that was documented by a Sunday newspaper. Will the Minister agree that, if such a dangerous drug is so readily and widely available in the city, there is no room for complacency on the part of anybody? Will the Minister agree that the problem can get as bad as it was in the past and that efforts must continue to eliminate the availability of heroin as far as possible?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that there is a serious heroin problem.  In the greater Dublin area there are about 1,000 heroin abusers.  The figures are consistent. In 1982 the figure was 772, 1,006 in 1983 and 969 in 1984.  Heroin is not readily available.  Certainly, it is not freely available.  I must point out that there is no capital city in Europe that does not have a heroin problem and there will always be a heroin problem in all capital cities of Europe.  Our role is to contain that and convince people not to abuse all forms of drugs.  To that extent the activities of the Garda, the courts, the Health Education Bureau, the Department of Health and the Government have contained the problem. Undoubtedly, in 1981-82 we came upon the problem somewhat late, but I devoted a great deal of time to this matter as did my colleagues in Government, particularly Ministers of State, O'Brien and Donnellan.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Gregory-Independent</NameTxt>
      <P>When I said that heroin was readily available I meant that those addicted to heroin do not have any difficulty in getting heroin in Dublin city.  Does the Minister agree that the number of those attending Jervis Street known to be addicted to heroin is not necessarily a true picture of the number of people who use heroin?  There is a cycle in the use of heroin and it is only at a certain stage in that cycle that users seek help from the Jervis Street centre or any other centre.  Will the Minister accept that the number of people using heroin in Dublin city is far greater than the 1,000 addicts he mentioned?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that the figure is that much greater.  Certainly, it is greater but one can only speculate as to how much greater it is.  If a person is on heroin for three years inevitably he or she will finish up requiring treatment at Jervis Street.  Taking the average over three years, the figure is roughly 900 people.  One could probably add some hundreds to that figure, bringing it up to 1,100 or 1,200.  The average is around 1,000.  That is the figure for heroin abusers who represent seven out of every ten drug addicts in the Dublin area.</P>

      <P>State supported research of a medical or a medico-social nature is at present carried out by two separate bodies, namely, the Medical Research Council of Ireland and the Medico-Social Research Board.  With a view to a more efficient management of research resources I have proposed that all research conducted by these two bodies be brought under the management of a single statutory authority.  To reach agreement on the detail of new arrangements it will be necessary for discussions to take place between representatives of my Department and the two organisations and these are at present in train.</P>

      <P>The Minister will accept that over 60 years the Medico-Social Research Board have done excellent work and carried out very important surveys in relation to topical social problems such as alcoholism, abortion and unemployment. Will he accept that if he takes this body into his Department there will be a loss of confidence with very important professionals, particularly in relation to confidentiality and their relationship with bodies outside the country, for <Col N="1869" /> example, in the United Kingdom where they obtained much valuable information, particularly during the survey on abortion?  Does he also accept that if this body are taken into the Department they will not be able to view problems objectively, that the Minister of the day might have his own view that a particular survey should not be carried out?  Would he reconsider this decision and ensure that the Medico-Social Research Board will have an independence and leave them as a semi-State body?</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned that there should be one unified body dealing with medical and medico-social research. It is in the general interest of the development of research.  I would hold the view that provided the amalgamation is carried out in a sensitive way, particularly protecting the independence of the bodies concerned and their staff, a new corporate body with a budget of about £2.5 million would perform that work in a more effective way.  I can assure the Deputy that the conditions of employment of the staff concerned and the general independence of the outstanding work done by both bodies will be protected fully in any corporate structure established.  This is the better way of unifying and organising research in the medical and epidemiology area.</P>

      <P>The budgets of both these bodies come within the general allocation system of the Department of Health.  Both have corporate body status and I can assure the Deputy that any misgivings in this area will be fully met. Any new corporate body will be set up with the greatest of care.  This is an area in which we are spending little money on <Col N="1870" /> research and a great deal on services and it is very much in the best interests that we should try to improve the position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>Before Question Time I said that the principal function of the Finance Bill was to give statutory effect to taxation changes announced in the budget statement of 30 January.  The <Col N="1884" /> Minister said that his aims were to improve the environment for increasing employment, to reform the taxation system and protect those on low incomes from the impact of the recession.  I acknowledged that there were serious financial difficulties and the previous speaker, Deputy Séamus Brennan, also some Opposition spokesmen seemed to be acting the part of Robin Hood by demanding the improvement of national services without indicating where the money would come from.  An instance of this occurred during the debate on education yesterday when Deputy Hugh Byrne suggested the employment of 7,300 new teachers at an approximate cost of £100 million to the taxpayer.</P>
      <P>The gloom and doom which has been preached continuously from the Opposition benches has begun to stick with them and their followers, even in the smallest cumann.  I outlined the case of one of their supporters in Ennis, a draper who had an increase in turnover of 25 per cent annually in the last two years but still says that there is an atmosphere of gloom and doom and that business prospects are not looking good.</P>
      <P>The Minister for Finance and the Government have given confidence to people.  They have done so in a cautious way.  It is not as expansionary as the Opposition might like.  The Opposition would like to spend millions of pounds without specifying the source of the money.  There have been signs that the Government's policy is working.  I refer to statements made by industrial and commercial people regarding shopping in Dublin during Easter.  It is claimed that the rationalisation of VAT has had a significant effect on trade and prevented many people from going to the North to shop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This measure has also improved the climate for the tourist industry.  In the mid-west region all the hotels are solidly booked for the next four or five months. In addition, Aer Lingus have indicated that they do not have any vacant seats on their trans-Atlantic flights during the next three to four months.  Therefore, in the <Col N="1885" /> event of fund raising activities in the US on the part of political parties here, advance notice should be given to Aer Lingus.</P>
    <P>In their two years in office the Government have brought under control the very difficult financial situation they inherited with the result that we are now reaching a climate in which confidence is being restored and investment encouraged. The Government have had considerable success in this regard as has been illustrated by the decrease in inflation from 17 per cent in 1982 to a projected 5½ per cent this year.  A great fillip to the economy also is the fact that last year's budget outturn was on target.  The Government are continuing to ensure that the incomes of the less well off are being protected.  In this area, too, there have been some important improvements. A prime feature of this year's budget is the increase in social welfare payments by amounts that are in excess of the projected rate of inflation between mid 1985 and mid 1986.  There are other improvements in social welfare schemes, too.  For instance, there will be equal treatment for married women, and for those who are pregnant and whose husbands are insured fully, there will be an extension of dental, optical and other benefits.</P>
    <P>Undoubtedly, unemployment is our most serious problem.  The figures in this regard represent a tragedy in human terms and a massive wastage in terms of economic resources.  In endeavouring to improve this area no effort must be spared and no possible approach left unexplored.</P>
    <P>One might be forgiven if, having listened to the Opposition, one had the impression that the unemployment problem could be solved merely by condemning it loudly enough and often enough without any worthwhile idea being put forward.  We would be glad if the position could be improved in that facile manner but that is not possible.  No Government in the history of the State has devoted more time to the unemployment problem than the present Government have devoted to it in the past two years.  They <Col N="1886" /> have introduced a wide variety of very valuable schemes to help stimulate employment.  An encouraging number of 5,000 availed of the enterprise allowance scheme in 1984.  The social employment scheme for the long term unemployed which is coming into operation now will provide employment for at least one year for up to 10,000 people who have been unemployed for more than a year.  This scheme can be availed of now by teachers and by school principals.  These people had expressed very strong views about the position whereby temporary caretakers lost their employment.  Schools, particularly, should avail of the scheme. Yesterday we had some comments about centre city schools but the social employment scheme affords a ready opportunity for the people involved to take advantage of what is being offered.  Local authorities are expected to be major participants in the scheme.  Apart from the valuable employment that will be provided, the scheme will enable local authorities to undertake desirable environmental, amenity and other works.</P>
    <P>Employment will be promoted also by two central features of the budget which are proposed in parts I and III of the Bill. The first is the alteration in the income tax structure which has been designed carefully to have the maximum beneficial effect on employment and the second is the rationalisation of the VAT system. Already it appears that the improvement in the VAT system is being noticed in the tourist industry.  The restructuring of the income tax bands and the increased personal allowances are most welcome. These changes will be some benefit to all income tax payers.  The increases in allowances may not be as large as one would wish for but they are an earnest of the Government's commitment to initiating much needed reform in this area.  I am confident that the reforms proposed in this Bill will have the effect of increasing the incentive to work, an incentive that is so vital to economic progress.</P>
    <P>When referring earlier to the changes in VAT, I alluded to the commercial aspects of the changes but the new rates have resulted in a reduction in prices in <Col N="1887" /> respect of a large number of items.  The benefit of these reductions will be enjoyed by householders particularly since the prices of such everyday items as soaps, detergents, cosmetics, crockery, glassware, sports goods, stationery, toys, household equipment and so on will be reduced.  These items form a large part of the weekly household budget.  I welcome also the reduction in VAT on newspapers.</P>
    <P>The reduced VAT rates on car hire will have a beneficial effect on employment in my constituency particularly in the context of Shannon.</P>
    <P>The building sector will be affected, too, by some of the VAT changes.  There has been a good deal of criticism of the increase in VAT from 5 to 10 per cent on building services but this increase must be considered in the context of the overall reform of the VAT system.  When assessing the overall effects, one must take into account the various measures taken by the Government to alleviate any adverse effects on building output that might result from the increase.  For instance, the new house grant is being increased from £1,000 to £2,000.  Many of those who have criticised the VAT increases have exaggerated their possible effects. They have failed to appreciate the context in which the changes are being made and have ignored the alleviating measures.</P>
    <P>The need for a fundamental reform in the VAT system had been obvious for some time.  The system had evolved in circumstances of a narrow taxation base and of a bewildering array of rates.  The high rate of 35 per cent was unacceptable. On many occasions the Opposition criticised that high rate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has acknowledged the problems of a system that was complex, inefficient and expensive to administer.  Another important factor in that regard was the provision of a serious incentive for evasion.  The reduction to <Col N="1888" /> three rates &mdash; zero, 10 and 23 per cent &mdash; in the VAT system will considerably simplify its operation and this in turn will bring about an element of administrative and economic efficiency.  In respect of all tax systems there is an incentive for evasion but in the case of VAT that incentive will be substantially reduced as a result of the changes being made.  It is not surprising then that the reform in this respect has been acclaimed so widely by business people and consumers as well as by members of the Opposition.</P>
      <P>The Government created a three-tier VAT system and they then had to decide on the appropriate rate to charge on building output, given that the 5 per cent rate had to be abolished.  The choice lay between increasing the present rate to 10 per cent or reducing it to zero, thereby removing building output from the taxable base for the VAT system.  The Government decided against the latter course, not only because the revenue loss would have been substantial, but because any erosion of the already narrow VAT base would have further distorted production and consumption patterns and would also have increased inefficiency. This is the exact opposite to what reforms in the VAT system were designed to achieve.</P>
      <P>The Government decided to charge VAT at 10 per cent on building services and to introduce measures to alleviate, as far as possible, any effects on the industry, particularly in relation to housing. The Minister for Finance is to be commended on his readiness to ease the difficulties which would have been caused by the application of a 10 per cent rate on new houses from 1 March.  When it was represented to him that the operative date of 1 March would have caused problems for builders and house buyers who had already signed contracts, the Minister wisely decided to defer it to 1 May.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A considerable part of the total building output, however, will not be affected by the increase in VAT.  The output of direct labour units for local authorities and Government Departments will not be affected, indeed, private individuals building their own houses will not be <Col N="1889" /> affected either.  Direct labour works in these categories will benefit by the abolition of the 35 per cent rate and, in particular, by the reduction in the rate applying to concrete blocks from 23 per cent to 10 per cent.  I have not heard the Opposition mention that or any of the other benefits in the system.  For a person building his own house, this could represent a saving of between £300 and £400 on a typical house.</P>
    <P>Demand for building in the industrial, semi-State and commercial sectors is unlikely to be affected because most enterprises in these sectors can reclaim VAT paid on buildings.  The Government are increasing the level of Public Capital Programme expenditure affecting the building industry over the period from 1985-87 and, as outlined in <i>Building on Reality</i>, they are increasing it by 9 per cent over the period of the plan.  This will also account for an increased share of the total public capital expenditure.  These increases have been provided despite the fact that some public investment programmes with significant building elements have been wound down as they near completion.  The Government have taken measures to support the housing programmes.  The range of housing grants and subsidies has been maintained in spite of the recommendations made by the National Planning Board to the contrary and new incentives have been introduced. These include the highly successful grant of £5,000 to enable local authority tenants or tenant purchasers with certain residency qualifications to purchase private houses.  Joint venture housing is being further encouraged and the site subsidy of up to £1,000 is being extended to those on local authority lists who are buying joint venture houses.  The public generally are not aware of the incentives which are available.</P>
    <P>Local authorities are also being encouraged to purchase private houses.  It is intended that the main thrust of this arrangement will be towards the purchase of new houses.  There is also provision in the Bill for new tax incentives to encourage the refurbishing of houses <Col N="1890" /> let in multiple occupation.  The commitment in <i>Building on Reality</i> to extend the scope of tax incentives designed to encourage the provision of private rented accommodation is given effect to in sections 20 and 21 of the Bill.  At present these incentives are confined to cases where a new house is provided for renting or where a building is converted into two or more dwellings for renting.  The new provision extends income tax relief to cases where buildings already in multiple use are refurbished to provide multiple residential accommodation of a better standard.</P>
    <P>The recently announced increase in the new house grant from £1,000 to £2,000 is of special importance to the individual house purchaser because it provides financial assistance in the form of a lump sum in the early stages of setting up a house.  The grant was originally intended to be increased to £1,750 to compensate for additional VAT on building contracts but I am glad that the Government agreed to a further increase to provide an incentive to the house building sector of the industry and also to help first time purchasers.  It is also expected that, in conjunction with other measures brought into operation recently, in particular the £5,000 grant for local authority tenants and tenant purchasers the increased grant will provide an important boost to the demand for private housing.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance and the Department of the Environment have looked carefully at the industry and are making genuine efforts to see that the rationalisation of VAT will not affect the building industry.  Wild statements which are not well founded have been made about lack of progress in the building industry.  I hope when the Bill is passed that the industry will get together and that there will be growth in future years.</P>
    <P>My main reason for supporting the Bill is because the Minister's approach has been most welcome.  In contrast to the spendthrift policies from 1977 onwards, the publication of <i>Building on Reality</i> has given people guidelines for the future.  I <Col N="1891" /> acknowledge that there are severe problems, especially in regard to interest payments on loans and borrowings made abroad.  Deputy Brennan said that we should try to make some arrangements with the lenders to produce a scheme which would extend the maturity of these loans.  The Minister for Finance has demonstrated that he is well aware of the benefits which can accrue from delaying payment of these loans because the enconomy is so depressed.  He has retionalised some of these loans and has eased the burden of repayments by extending them and he is to be commended for that. Financial experts here understand that the Government are on the right track. Any responsible person who is asked about their attitude to the Government advise people to put up with the hard times for a little longer.</P>
    <P>The Government have protected the incomes of lower paid workers and are steering the economy on a course which will help future generations to earn a living in this country.  I commend the Minister for introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>We have had the annual debate on the Finance Bill but, with the change in procedures in the House &mdash; and the Minister acknowledged this &mdash; the Bill must be viewed in the same context as the budget and the Government document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i> All three are interrelated and are really concerned with what the Government proposed to do about improvement in the economy and the public finances that essentially must be put right in order to provide the investment climate that will create the employment that will put the economy right.  Economics sometimes tends to become complicated but fundamentally that is the challenge facing the present Government.  Without in any way being pessimistic, I say that the Irish economy as a whole and the public finances are suffering at the moment in a vicious downward cycle of less investment, <Col N="1892" /> rising unemployment, reducing revenue and increased borrowing to finance current Government expenditure rather than capital investment.  That scenario is not just the Fianna Fáil Opposition speaking.  In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 18 March there was a very comprehensive article by an economist, Fionnuala Kennedy, setting out the very same theme, and yesterday in the <i>Irish Independent</i> a well known economic apologist for the Government, Sean Barrett of Trinity College, Dublin, spelled out the very same message that I have spelled out.</P>
      <P>I believe in the expansion of our economy, but I do not believe in keeping one's head in the sand.  I believe in facing up to reality, and <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> is a totally unreal document.  The budget since that document was issued and the Finance Bill we are debating at the moment are suffering from this overemphasis on presentation and cosmetics and keeping expectations alive.  I do not believe in doom and gloom any more than Deputy Carey does.  I believe in expansion in our economy.  I also believe in facing up to reality, and it is important to mobilise people to the point of view at present that things are very rough in Ireland and are being made rougher by a Government who seem incapable of developing the political will to deal with the problems, and so long as the Government show this incapacity to cope with the problems the figures will continue along the lines which I just mentioned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The causes of the downward spiral to which I have referred are that investment will fall this year by over 1 per cent compared to the target originally set in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>, and Government spending will go up by 2 per cent to 3 per cent compared to the targets set out only last October in that document. Again this is not I speaking as a Fianna Fáil Deputy.  These are the precise figures given by Mr. Sean Barrett yesterday in the <i>Irish Independent.</i> These budget calculations which we had under full debate and scrutiny in the House only three months ago and the taxation <Col N="1893" /> element which is now under discussion in the Finance Bill were based on unemployment figures of 217,000 for the year, and already those unemployment figures are running at 10,000 above the projected level.  Emigration is now conservatively on a scale of as many as 50,000 people a year.  These are the realities on which we can base sane policies geared to expansion and employment, but there is no point in hiding the realities in cosmetic exercises and ultra-emphasis on presentation which unfortunately we have had from the Government in recent months.</P>
    <P>From the figures in front of me I can say that for the first quarter of this year total revenue is already at least £40 million below target, while Exchequer borrowing during the same quarter is at £834 million out of the whole year's target of £2,019 million.  Therefore, we have this appalling figure of a downward cycle in regard to total revenue and, even worse, the appalling picture of 41 per cent of the Exchequer's annual allocation used up already in the first quarter.  Side by side with this it is estimated that the PAYE sector for the whole of this coming year will pay £178 million extra.  Again we have a downward spiral of fewer people at work paying more taxes to keep a declining economy in a decelerating state of imagined economic activity.  That is the picture that emerges when one looks at the scenario of unemployment above what was projected, revenue below what was projected and borrowing above what was projected, compounded by a total investment that is dropping and Government expenditure steadily rising, all in relation not to something that happened a year or two or three years ago, but to conscious documentation emanating from the Government last October in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i>and at the end of January this year in the budget. To cap all that, the only really sustainable aspect of our economic activity, our export performance and growth which is so essential to economic development and expansion will be only two-thirds of that envisaged in <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i></P>
    <P>It gives me no joy to mention these <Col N="1894" /> figures but they are irrefutable and paint an unsatisfactory picture in which leading economists are <i>ad idem</i> with what I say and what I am spelling out here.  The Minister is aware of the serious nature of the problem, and the question is what to do about it.  In the few minutes at my disposal I would like to mention some aspects.  What I am going to say is not new.  It is contained in the Telesis report and in many recommendations that have been made by various people.  Unfortunately, we suffer from a surfeit of analyses, but the principal recommendation that runs through the Telesis report and other analyses is that we want a taxation incentive regime oriented towards jobs, that in any industrial activity whether in manufacturing or the services we give special tax incentives related directly to jobs.</P>
    <P>Too much of our aid both in the way of grant aid, loan aid and tax incentive aid, is geared towards the capital side of expenditure at present rather than towards jobs.  Two industries which involve a high job content are tourism in all its aspects, not just the limited aspect to which the Minister addressed himself this year, and the building and construction industry in which already in recent times job losses of the order of 45,000 have occurred.  Therefore, here are two areas involving a high labour content both areas in which there are unemployed skills available.  Here are two industries where the Minister by introducing tax incentives and a regime to stimulate these industries can in an imaginative way do something to restimulate the economy in areas which have a high home produced input.  I appreciate that that is not the whole picture and that the Minister can point out other aspects, but if one can draw comparisons between these two industries and other industries, one can see straightaway the high level of home input, apart from the high labour content, that exists.  One is talking about home inputs of between 70 and 80 per cent in those two industries as against those in many other industries.</P>
    <P>The Minister can say that last year he made an effort to stimulate activity in <Col N="1895" /> this area by introducing a section in the Finance Bill dealing with venture capital. He knows as well as I do that that scheme has not succeeded.  We spent a lot of time debating it and I said that while the idea was excellent, the drafting of the section, its administration and interpretation would lead to the scheme grinding to a halt.  This scheme applied only to the manufacturing areas; it did not apply to the service industries.  On his own admission the Minister has spelt out the fact that in the last 12 months only two designated funds have been successfully launched. That is like having a pigmy doing a man-sized job.  It is an appalling admission that after all that talk, debate and good intentions there were only two designated funds successfully launched.</P>
    <P>I see similar difficulties arising from the Minister's idea of encouraging outside firms to invest their profits in Government securities by way of tax incentives. I hope it works out but I can see great difficulties arising.  What we want are realistic concepts and the most realistic concept of all is tax incentive measures geared specifically to jobs.  I would also like to see loans and State aid geared to stimulate more employment.  I believe capital intensive industries can look after themselves but the industries which gear their operations to jobs require favourable tax relief.</P>
    <P>We will have ample scope on Committee Stage to deal with matters concerning the economy.  I agree fully with what is now the conventional view of the economists, that is, that the Government have failed miserably to grapple seriously with the problem and the basic flaw flows from lack of investment.  Once investment starts falling&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Deputies who contributed to this debate, both those with whom I agree and those with whom I do not agree. Like Deputy Lenihan, I look forward to detailed discussions of all these matters on Committee Stage.  We will have an opportunity of teasing out the details of all the solid and progressive measures contained in this Bill that will have the effect which I indicated in my budget speech an in my opening speech and, I hope, of shooting down a great deal of the mythology in which the Opposition indulge on almost any economic debate we have in this House.  Deputy Lenihan mentioned the Opposition's mythology on the business expansion scheme.  I do not intend to go into detail on these specific points today but I intend to deal with some of the more general issues that have arisen.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before I do that I feel I should say a few words about Deputy O'Kennedy's opening speech last Tuesday.  On occasions like this, Deputy O'Kennedy seems to adopt a personal kind of approach to the debate.  He seems to suffer from a certain inability to put up with a measure of calm on the part of the Minister for Finance.  He spent a fair amount of his time complaining that I do not rush around wringing my hands and wondering what we are going to do next.  I and this Government have adopted a far more rational and deliberate approach to dealing with our problems, an approach about which Deputy Lenihan has just <Col N="1897" /> complained saying we have a surfeit of analyses.  The biggest problem with the Opposition is that the last bit of analysis they carried out on economic policy, as far as I can discern, resulted in the publication of <i>The Way Forward.</i> Ever since a few days after its publication, they have been running away from it as quickly as they could.  I am not going to go on about Deputy O'Kennedy's rather personalised approach because I think, in charity, I should not after the excoriation he suffered here at the hands of Deputy Molony, not for the first time.</P>
    <P>The broad impression I had listening to Deputy O'Kennedy in particular and the conclusion to which I came was that the Opposition are not in a position to make any substantial proposals of any kind in relation to tax reform.  Deputy O'Kennedy has been seen on many occasions in this House waving the first report on the Commission on Taxation, but I have never heard him say unambiguously that he favours the approach set out in that report.</P>
    <P>Neither have I heard him analyse what the effects of implementing the recommendations in that report would be.  I had not heard Deputy O'Kennedy or any other member of the Opposition give any kind of systematic commentary on how our VAT system should be restructured. I find it amusing, to say the least, that an Opposition which cannot produce one single proposal on taxation reform can come into the House and have the neck to try to represent what we did in this year's budget, which was a substantial reform of the VAT and income tax systems, as tinkering around the edges.</P>

He wants a lower level of current budget deficit but not once in the course of the last two and a half years have I heard Deputy O'Kennedy speak about what the consequences of that would be for expenditure.

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy made a number of assertions and produced figures, allegedly to support his case, that the levels of taxation are steadily increasing. If you choose to compare forecasts of yields in 1985 with 1984 outturns, there is an increase.  That would be the case for any two consecutive years you care to examine.  That comparison is facile and totally beside the point.  It ignores the other factors that operate such as inflation, growth in GNP, growth in money incomes and the general growth in the tax base.  Consequently we can only come up with one result: the second year's figure is bigger than the first year's figure.  That says nothing about the structure of the system.  This year we are meeting the commitment we set out in the national plan to ensure that there is no overall increase in the level of income <Col N="1903" /> taxation.  As I have said, we made that a central part of the plan and have provided to do just that in this year's budget and Finance Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy completely misunderstands me.  I am not saying his figures are wrong but that he made a mess of using the figures because they do not show what he thinks they show.  He also stated quite categorically on more than one occasion that we have the highest direct and indirect tax levels in Europe. That is not true either.  I want to make that point on Second Stage because we will not be able to come back to it on Committee Stage.  I am quite sure that without difficulty I could find cases where particular taxes are higher in other countries than here, and cases where particular taxes are lower in other countries than here.  Deputy O'Kennedy is well aware that we have one of the widest zero rate categories in our VAT system of any country in the Community.  That is a factor in the structure of our tax system which gives rise to a requirement for a level of rates for the things that are in the VAT system.  We have reorganised that system and we now have a far more rational spread of rates.</P>

      <P>At the end of the day the only rational response to what the Deputy is now saying, if I can be a little colloquial for a moment, is so what?  We are not dealing with the Danish, or the French, or the British population.  It does not matter too much to me what their tax system is.  Our tax system has to meet our requirements.  That is only the beginning of the argument.  Comparisons are of very little use when we are talking about economic policy.  They are of limited use in some other areas but not for today.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of Deputies mentioned <Col N="1904" /> unemployment.  We had the usual cant from Deputy O'Kennedy who seemed to find that I ignored the whole matter by using the word &ldquo;unemployment&rdquo; only once.  The press and all the commentators are tired of hearing that kind of cant.  We are ensuring that the course of economic policy is such as to get for us the maximum advantage out of the combination of circumstances which surrounds us.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Undoubtedly we have a very difficult problem to deal with.  We are not making progress as rapidly as I would like, but nevertheless we are making progress.  The increase in registered unemployment in 1984 was the lowest for five years and less than half of the rate of increase prevailing when this Government took office.  The live register figures for the end of March this year were the best for many months.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It is now becoming clear that this improvement in the unemployment trends reflects a significant easing in the rate of employment loss.  In the manufacturing sector, the estimated fall in employment in 1984 was considerably less than that recorded in the previous two years.  I expect that trend to be maintained during the course of 1985, given continued buoyancy in industrial output and in exports.  Those policies we are following, set out in the national plan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I said I expect we will continue to make improvements in the rate of job loss and in relation to unemployment as a result of the fact that industrial output in particular and exports will continue to be buoyant over the course of this year.  The policies we set out in the national plan were framed with the objective of securing the maximum employment growth over the period of the plan and creating conditions which will allow sustained growth in employment to take place.</P>
      <P>We also recognise that there are particular difficulties facing the long term unemployed.  We announced two specific new measures, the social employment scheme and the alternate scheme to deal with those problems.  I do not think anybody in this House could argue that we should not have particular regard for the immediacy of that problem.  Deputy O'Kennedy proposed so many things that if we put them all together we would be hard put to see the end of the current deficit even using telephone numbers.  He proposed quite a number of marginal changes in the taxation system.  He suggested selective reductions in PRSI contributions in respect of additional employees.  Of course, the Deputy is aware that for the third successive year there has been no increase in the rate of contribution to the social insurance fund in spite of increased social insurance expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The scope even for selective reductions in contribution rates is very much constrained.  Unless reductions of this kind are offset either by a reduction in social insurance benefits or increased Exchequer expenditure, the Exchequer being the residual financier of <Col N="1906" /> the Social Insurance Fund, corresponding increases in general contribution rates could not be avoided.  Anybody making that proposal has to face that problem.  If you bring about selective reductions in contribution rates you will have to make up for them somewhere.  That must be an increase in rates of contribution for those who do not benefit from the selective reductions, or an increase in the Exchequer's input into the Social Insurance Fund, or a reduction in the rate of social insurance benefit.</P>

The Deputy does not want to know about that.  He does not want to know about any timelag.

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy is a dab hand at shifting his ground when he does not like the course the argument is taking.  The venture capital scheme was referred to on a number of occasions during this debate.  I said last Tuesday <Col N="1907" /> and on previous occasions, and I repeat this afternoon, that it is far too early to make any judgment on the effect of that scheme and the progress we are making with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have given the Deputy all the information he requires.  It was not until January of this year that the tax relief actually became available.  It was not until January of this year that the scheme could really get into operation.  I am quite pleased that we already have two designated funds in operation in spite of the difficulty with the unit trust legislation which will soon be removed.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy would like the scheme to be expanded beyond manufacturing to other sectors.  We have a number of service sectors already covered in it.  To support his case he made the point that a job in services is as welcome as a job in manufacturing.  Of course there is no argument about that. The scheme is about encouraging investment in risky ventures.  We want to encourage, stimulate and give some assistance to people to invest in risky ventures.  The further we widen the scheme, particularly in what one might call the classical type service sector side and the more protected industries, the more we will get people, not to put money into risky ventures but to put it into the safer ones.</P>

      <P>Deputy Molony suggested that the exemption included in the Bill for inheritances between spouses should be extended to gifts.  That is a point to which I gave some consideration.  I shall make two points, first that the main concern behind the introduction of the exemption on inheritances was the protection of surviving spouses in relatively poor circumstances.  On the other hand, if we were to extend the exemption to include gifts between spouses, it could be seen as and would be a concession that goes further than the concession that I wanted to make.  It is a measure that I would not undertake.</P>
      <P>Deputy Noonan, <i>Limerick West,</i> suggested that an anomaly had arisen where a farm is being transferred into joint ownership where one of the transferees qualifies under section 93 of the 1982 Finance Act.  He suggested total exemption in such cases.  I have looked at that matter and there is no anomaly.  This is perhaps something which will come up on Committee Stage but the case is covered in that if there are two people, one of whom qualifies for the exemption and the other does not, the relief is given to the person who qualifies, in the proper proportion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to endeavour to put this proposal into a slightly larger perspective, if you will allow me to do so, Sir, while remaining within the terms of the question I propose to raise.  This latest story is simply one dimension or aspect of the whole question of participation by Irish-Americans in domestic Irish affairs. At every level there are reasons to express, depending on the nature of the interference, misgivings muted or, as in this case as would be more appropriate, angry misgivings about the justification for those interventions.</P>
      <P>It seems to me that this country is alone among the mother countries of the old world in being regarded, by the people who describe themselves as exiles &mdash; although it seems to me they are very willing exiles &mdash; or the grandchildren or the great grandchildren of those exiles, as what I might describe as a political duty-free area.  They feel perfectly entitled to tell us, with very little or no knowledge or acquaintance, or on the slimmest of acquaintance, how to run our affairs. They take up high profile positions which are as often as not deeply unwelcome &mdash; and for serious national reasons, not merely domestic political reasons &mdash; deeply unwelcome to the democratically elected Government here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Interference in the affairs of an unfree country, where that interference takes the form of standing up for the human rights of people who are being oppressed, murdered, butchered &mdash; as I am sorry to <Col N="1916" /> say appears to be the case in some of the nearer neighbours of these same Irish-Americans, people on their own doorstep &mdash; is perhaps justifiable, and indeed may be laudable, because those unfortunate oppressed people have no one else to speak for them.  But there is no section on this island, north or south of the Border, which is without a voice that can be heard, and I mean an Irish voice.  We do not require the addition to the chorus which our democratically elected Government or the SDLP raise continuously to the world in defence of the rights of individual Irish people or of their tradition.</P>
    <P>That interference is something which I might put into this kind of perspective, by comparing what we see with what would happen if we were to not merely hold opinions about things that happen in America, but were to go, amidst a blaze of publicity, to America and make those opinions known.</P>
    <P>I will venture upon the House two opinions of mine about internal conditions in the United States, if you will allow me to.  First it is a scandal that medical costs and hospital expenses in the United States should be so high that, when an Irish child has to be sent to America for an operation, the whole country has to be laid under contribution in order to pay for it.  It is not only a scandal but an inhuman outrage that a man can be sentenced to death for a murder &mdash; sometimes perhaps not even for a murder &mdash; in 1978 or 1979, spend five years on death row during part of which time the death penalty has not existed at all, and then be dragged into a gas chamber or to an electric chair.  That is an inhuman outrage, Sir.  I am alluding to it in passing.</P>

      <P>I may be saying something wrong-headed, something rash and I quite admit that my experience of America is limited to a 14 day stay there, most of it on official business and that I am <Col N="1917" /> far from being an expert on American affairs.  But suppose I were to whip up an organisation here, or promote a series of occasions on which people who think like me about medical costs in America or about the application of the death penalty in that grossly inhuman way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir, that shows how sensitive these matters can be.  Even you, Sir, who are not ten feet away from me, feel that I am stepping outside the line in speaking like this.  Put yourself in the position of the Chairman of the American House of Representatives if he were to hear me on his doorstep utter those opinions.  What would he say? Would he not say: let that whippersnapper go off for himself back to Ireland and look after his own affairs over there where he has plenty of problems on his own doorstep?  Would he not take that line?  He certainly would, Sir.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let me say that I believe that Irish-American interventions there are almost always well intentioned; in a vague, muddled, soft-witted way they are well intentioned.  I would put into that category the intervention of four American bishops who came over here last year, spent four days in the North of Ireland and then, if you do not mind, held a press conference, in which they uttered views about what was the only possible solution for the Northern problem &mdash; views into which I need not go in detail now; views from which I do not necessarily entirely dissent &mdash; but most certainly I would not hold a press conference after four days in America to air my views about how they might settle, let us say, the problems of their inner cities, their crime problems, their drug problems, the problems of their criminal law or of their health service. I do not want to offend these reverend gentlemen, but I dare say that not <Col N="1918" /> one of them would pass an examination paper of our intermediate standard on Irish history in the morning.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly, just a moment.  The four reverend gentlemen to whom you refer, were received in this House as guests of myself, representing this Parliament, and entertained.  In the Chair's opinion it is unbecoming that you should now, in the same Parliament, launch an attack on them or speak about them in a derogatory manner.  Again, I would ask the Deputy not to pursue that line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry again to encounter your extremely sensitive susceptibilities in this matter, which do you great honour, Sir, if I may say so with respect, and only prove even further the point I am endeavouring to make, namely how wise one is to stick to something one thoroughly knows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should stick to the band.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I doubt very much if the courtesy which you extended to these four prelates included an encouragement to them to hold a highly televisable press conference after four days in the North of Ireland containing their solution to the Irish problem.  Had it done so, Sir, I am afraid I would have had to censure you for encouraging them on this line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On a different level, there is, I know, a group of American politicians who do know something about the Irish problem, who do understand a great deal about it, who have been &mdash; and we are very much indebted to them, at least for their good intentions &mdash; active in trying to seek ways to reach an Irish solution.  I shall not name them individually now; I mention them only in passing.  With respect and genuine gratitude to them for their well meaning efforts, and even making 100 per cent allowance for their sincerity, and discounting 100 per cent any suspicion that these could be related to their own electoral prospects at home, I doubt <Col N="1919" /> whether those efforts are entirely positive in their results.</P>
    <P>I would remind people everywhere in the world that we have to live with one million people who have repeatedly said through their elected leaders, that they would eat grass sooner than be run into this State against their will; that there might be many things that could be done once we acknowledge their rights, but that they would fight other than be absorbed against their will.  What is the effect on the minds of those people when they see very prominent American politicians purporting to settle the future of Northern Ireland and of Ireland over their heads?  That is what worries me.  I know that the American politicians of whom I speak mean well, and have a strong feeling for Ireland because of the parentage; but I wonder to what extent their efforts are counter-productive.</P>
    <P>We accept the visits of these politicians and Bishops with a range of attitudes varying from the Chair's hospitality to my muted dismay; but we put up with them and do not try to use the law to prevent them from coming.  I would not encourage using means of that kind; but there is a limit beyond which something has to be recognised as intolerable.  I know very little about the proposed visit of this New York Police Band; but if it is the case, as I suspect, that this proposed commemoration, although ostensibly in remembrance of hunger-strikers who voluntarily gave their lives for a cause, is in fact related to a murder as beastly as any other murder, which took place in that vicinity five years ago, then this act moves instantly into the sphere of what is intolerable. It is one thing to come over here and give woollen-headed, sap-witted advice and hold press conferences; but to come here and participate in a celebration of murder is quite different.</P>
    <P>While respecting and understanding the attachment which we have to civil liberty, freedom of association, freedom of assembly and to freedom of speech, I would remind the House that these are liberties of the citizen; they are not necessarily liberties of aliens.  All these <Col N="1920" /> Irish Americans are aliens and they choose to remain alien.  The Minister's Department is not inundated by applications for naturalistion from these people. They choose to remain aliens and there is no difference between them and other non-nationals who come and go, who do not have to live here with the consequences of their words and deeds, and who carry as little responsibility for what they do as they have knowledge of the conditions in which the rest of us have to live.  When their participation in life here takes the form of attendance at a celebration of murder it is intolerable.</P>
    <P>If I could be persuaded that this was merely a commemoration of a hunger strike I would not feel quite so strongly about it, because I must admit to having mixed emotions about that episode. When a young man deliberately throws away his own life in pursuit of an ideal, he has bought, with the dearest possible coin, the right to have the cause he supports dispassionately examined.  To treat people on hunger strike in the manner in which they were treated by the British in 1981 and 1982 is insane.  While I acted as Minister for Foreign Affairs, it was Senator Dooge and I who had the job of going to the British to urge that point on them.  We were ignored and the result is that Mrs. Thatcher now has a colleague in the House of Commons, a member of Sinn Féin, which is a front for the Provisional IRA.  That is the consequence of her behaviour.  If I could be persuaded that this commemoration was related only to the hunger-strikers I would not feel the same way; but if there is a suggestion that it is related to the beastly murder of three innocent people, it is intolerable.</P>
    <P>The most prominent among the victims never did any harm to this country.  I did not even know he had a holiday home here until he was murdered; but I know that he had very little to do with Irish affairs, and most certainly never did us any harm.  When this commemoration appears to be related to a murder of that kind the question of whether it is tolerable instantly arises.  When we find that a police unit is participating in this commemoration, the people who are <Col N="1921" /> supposed to be the fraternal colleagues, the professional brothers of the Garda Síochána with whom they associate in many social and sporting activities at other times of the year, the thing develops a monstrous aspect which demands that we look at this as a different kind of incursion into Irish affairs from the episcopal or political ones.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister and the Government to consider whether it would be advisable to make exclusion orders against members of this band, to show that there are such things that we regard as being so deeply unseemly as to exceed the tolerance of ordinary Irish people.  It may not surface here, but I speak for a very large number of Irish people on all sides, in saying this.  I am not urging as a matter of policy that these gentlemen should be excluded, because I accept that such a move might be counter-productive and that in one sense it is even likely to be counter-productive, because it would represent a hurdle which we would be more or less inviting the IRA to jump, thus thumbing their noses publicly at us and giving them what the press call a propaganda coup.  I would not make little of that consideration; and perhaps if I had the file and advice on the matter I might, if I were in charge of it, come to the conclusion that to issue an exclusion order to keep out these deeply unwelcome aliens would be a mistake. But it is an option open to the Government, as much in the case of an Irish-American as in the case of a man from Borneo, which they should in this instance consider.  They should weigh in the balance the effect which the presence of a police unit at a murder celebration here, in a festive period, will occasion throughout the world.  I do not know the extent to which discipline prevails in the New York police but it is possible that a formal Government exclusion order is something which even the emerald section of that force might think twice about before putting itself on the wrong side of it.</P>
    <P>In case I have overstepped any verbal limit in what I have been saying I want to say&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;that Irish Americans, in spite of everything I have said, are doubly welcome visitors here, perhaps more than other Americans would be. They are welcome as visitors and friends. They are welcome as cousins and I say that unaffectedly and sincerely.  They are genuinely and heartily welcome, doubly welcome with their Irish blood, as visitors and friends; but they are not welcome as the stage props of the IRA.  It is the Government's business, although they may decide that tactical considerations rule out an exclusion, to consider carefully how to make that attitude, which I believe is shared by 99 per cent of the people here, clear and unmistakable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate on the Adjournment is taking place because there have been reports in newspapers on both sides of the Atlantic in the last few days that the Emerald Pipe and Drum Band of the New York Police Force who were here last year intend to come here again and participate in a parade just as they did on 1 September 1984.  It was said at the time that they had been invited to and did come to attend the Rose of Tralee Festival which took place the previous week and that subsequent to their coming to Ireland, and without prior invitation, they had agreed to attend the parade that was taking place in Donegal, as Deputy Police Chief Murphy of the New York Police said, without being fully aware of the implications involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That may have been so when they accepted the verbal invitation to attend the parade in Donegal but when they marched in the parade they were in no doubt of the implications of them marching. It had been conveyed to them in very strong terms by the Taoiseach, by gardaí at senior level and by officers of my Department.  The person in charge of the band denied that he had been asked by the Garda not to take part in the parade. I do not know where that information came from.  He said they had no idea that <Col N="1923" /> the Garda had objected.  They apologised to the Garda and added that they did not think they had done anything wrong. That is not correct.  They were informed of the views of the Garda.  They were also aware that the Lord Mayor of Dublin at the time had refused to meet them when he heard of their intention to participate in the parade.  They can have been in no doubt of the views of the Irish Government in regard to the participation by the 25 members of that band in the parade. They were in no doubt about the views of the Irish people, for whom we speak, about their participation in the parade.</P>
    <P>If they were in any doubt, the American Ambassador to Ireland, Mr. Robert F. Kane, wrote to Commissioner Benjamin Ward of the New York Police after the parade had taken place and said in the course of the letter.</P>
    <P>The Police Department's Emerald Bands participation at this rally was an affront to the Irish Government and people.  As you know the United States Government consistently and on a broad bipartisan basis have condemned violence and those who support violence to resolve the problems of Northern Ireland.</P>
    <P>...the acts of these police officers directly reflect on the record of the NYPD.  The record of the NYPD is a proud and honourable one but sadly I must tell you that in my opinion the participation of Emerald Band members at this rally unfortunately reflected no credit on the Emerald Band, New York and or its Police Department.</P>
    <P>By some stretch of the imagination it may be that some members of the organising committee of the Emerald Society Pipe and Drum Band attached to the Police Department may allege that they were unaware of the implications of what took place at the end of August last year. However, if the reports in newspapers in the last few days that they intend to repeat their performance this year are true they can be in no doubt as a result of what was conveyed to them last year, <Col N="1924" /> and what I am deliberately conveying to them in the House, of the attitude of the Government, the Irish people represented by the House, of the nationalists in Northern Ireland and of the two leading politicians in their country, the President of the United States, Ronald Reagan, and Speaker &ldquo;Tip&rdquo; O'Neill.  Those gentlemen visited Ireland in the last 12 months and repeated their commitment to support all efforts that were peaceful and non-violent to achieve a solution to the problem of Northern Ireland.  The members of the Emerald Band can be in no doubt about our views as a result of the letter from the Ambassador from their country accredited to Ireland.</P>
    <P>We gladly acknowledge and welcome the support of the Irish-American community for our efforts to find a peaceful solution.  We particularly welcome and appreciate what has been done by the Friends of Ireland in Washington.  We welcome the statements made by successive Presidents of the United States who have taken a real interest in finding a solution to the problem in Northern Ireland but we do not welcome support, whether it is by the Emerald Society Pipe and Drum Band or NORAID, for groups here who wish to achieve those ends by violent means.  We have made that clear on a number of occasions.</P>
    <P>I hope the organisers of the band will remember that the people they will be supporting if they march in Donegal this year represent an organisation that has in this State killed 11 members of our security forces, one of them within a month of the participation by this band in the parade last year.  The members of the band are police officers whose commitment to upholding the law is above that of any other citizens and I should like to remind those people that in the last month in my own town the organisation I referred to murdered a man in cold blood because, they said, he had been an informer.  The New York Police Department Emerald Pipe and Drum Band by their presence at this parade are giving their support to such people.  I want to say to them that if the reports in newspapers in New York and here are correct <Col N="1925" /> the Government, Members of the House, the Irish people and the nationalists in Northern Ireland do not accept that a solution to the problem in Northern Ireland can be found through violent means. Their support by their participation in this parade for organisations who believe that violence is the way to get a solution is not welcomed by the Government, the House or Irish people of nationalist tradition <Col N="1926" /> North and South.  If the reports are correct I ask them to indicate immediately to the organisers of the parade that for the reasons I have outlined they will not march in or participate in that parade this year.  I appeal to them to do that now.</P>

      <P>In January 1984 Dublin Corporation consulted with my Department on the question of the use of a &ldquo;caution children&rdquo; type traffic sign instead of the prescribed &ldquo;Children Sign&rdquo; (yellow diamond shaped sign showing a black silhouette of two school children) which was primarily designed for and almost <Col N="1872" /> exclusively associated with school or playground locations.  The corporation was advised that in November 1979 the Department authorised Dublin County Council to use the former type of sign on an experimental basis.  The authorisation was, however, conditional on the submission by the council of a report in due course on the effectiveness of this sign in order that a decision might be taken as to whether such a sign should be authorised on a permanent basis.</P>
      <P>In December 1984 the council submitted a report to the Department indicating that no evidence could be adduced from traffic accident statistics that the signs were effective or otherwise.  However, it was the council's view that the absence of a suitable authorised sign to indicate the danger of young children crossing roads in residential areas had led to a proliferation of misleading and unauthorised signs and that the authorisation of a standard sign would be of benefit in facilitating the removal of such signs.</P>
      <P>Because of the council's report, the Department is consulting with the Garda authorities and An Foras Forbartha on the desirability of authorising the use by road authorities generally of a standard sign to warn drivers of the presence of children in residential areas.</P>

      <P>There are no arrears of social assistance due to the person concerned at present.  She was deemed to have been disqualified for receipt of the allowance from 17 November 1983 to 8 August 1984 because she did not satisfy the conditions for its receipt.  An overpayment of £1,829.35 was assessed in respect of this period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrears amounting to £197.20 accrued in respect of the period from 9 August 1984 to 5 December 1984 during which she received the rate for a person with <Col N="1880" /> one child but was subsequently awarded an increase for an additional child.  These arrears were offset against the earlier overpayment, leaving a net balance for recovery from her of £1,632.15.  Recovery of this amount is being done by weekly deductions of £6 from the allowance currently in payment to her, leaving her with a net weekly payment of £56.65.</P>
    <P>She appealed against the decision disqualifying her for receipt of the allowance and assessing the overpayment, but failed to attend an oral hearing of her appeal arranged for 22 April 1985.  The appeals officer is holding the appeal open and if she still wishes to pursue her case she should notify the Department immediately and a new date for the hearing will be arranged.  She is also being notified of this by letter.</P>

      <P>The widow's non-contributory pension which had been in payment to the person concerned has been restored to her with effect from 1 March 1985, the date from which it was terminated. Pension books with orders payable from that date have been sent to the designated post office for collection by her and she has been notified accordingly.</P>

    <P>The claimant transferred a farm holding to her sons some years ago but failed <Col N="1882" /> to inform the local social welfare officer to this effect when her claim was reinvestigated in October last.  Accordingly the profit from the farm was assessed against her and served to disqualify her for pension. The position has now been fully rectified.</P>
