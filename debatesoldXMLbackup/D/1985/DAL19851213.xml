    <P>The special pay awards relate to a considerable number of grades including doctors employed in the general medical services, administrative and para-medical staff.  As regards bonus payment in <Col N="2295" /> respect of cash allowances, as already announced, a bonus payment in respect of certain social welfare benefits and allowances administered by the Department of Health is being paid in this month.  The health allowances included in this arrangement are the disabled persons maintenance allowances, the infectious diseases maintenance allowances, blind welfare allowances and domiciliary care allowances in respect of handicapped children maintained at home.  The extra provision of £1 million sought will bring the total provision for cash allowances administered by the Department of Health to £62.95 million.  As in the case of the bonus payments for Christmas, it has never been the practice to make provision for such amounts in the Estimate and it is customary at the end of the year to bring in a Supplementary Estimate, as happened in the case of Social Welfare, for £21 million and this £1 million is part of that sum.</P>
    <P>The extra provision for the General Medical Services (Payments) Board sought is £2 million.  This, together with the provision needed for the special pay awards to which I have already referred, will bring the total provision for the General Medical Services (Payments) Board in 1985 to £98.745 million.  The extra provision sought is required to enable the cash needs of the board to be met in 1985. The increase in expenditure on general medical services is a consequence of an increase in the visiting rate.</P>
    <P>The increase in the visiting rate in the GMS in 1985 is a matter for concern. Visiting rate for 1984, at 6.12 was already quite high.  It is likely that the visiting rate for the current year 1985 will be approximately 6.4.  In addition to the costs of doctors' fees, there is the important cost of drugs prescribed at these more frequent consultations.  The rise indicates the open-ended nature of the scheme, which is at variance with virtually every other health service.</P>
    <P>Proposals for changes in the GMS have been under negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation for the past year. The proposals derived from the report of <Col N="2296" /> the working party on the GMS, which provided a comprehensive review of the service and how it might be changed to the advantage of doctors, patients and the taxpayer alike.  Essentially, proposals would entail providing incentives for doctors to see patients less frequently but for longer and more meaningful consultations. As a consequence, it would be possible to curb the cost of drugs and apply the savings to the development of general practice.  Given the shortage of funds this is a rational way of ensuring that the best possible service is provided.</P>
    <P>I am very disappointed that the discussions with the IMO have as yet not reached a conclusion.  The trend in activity and expenditure in the GMS demonstrates that we cannot be satisfied to leave the present scheme unchanged for very much longer.  The sense of urgency which one must attach to these talks will be conveyed to the IMO at the next meeting with representatives of my Department.  It is not unreasonable to aim to know with some precision, the level of expenditure that will be required for an important service such as this and to aim to channel the resources so ear-marked into activities which yield most benefit for patients.</P>
    <P>The shortfall in appropriations-in-aid arises from the net effect of an increase of £1.7 million in receipts from health contributions and a shortfall in receipts under EC regulations.  A sum of £30.985 million has been drawn by the Department from Vote 49 to meet 24th round pay expenditure.</P>
    <P>As regards the overall Exchequer expenditure on Health Services the original Vote provision for 1985, together with the amount drawn from Vote 49 and the supplementary sum now being sought, will bring total Exchequer provision for Health in 1985 to £1,115.188 million.</P>
    <P>In 1971-1972 net non-capital expenditure on health services amounted to £86.6 million, representing 4.54 per cent of GNP.  The net non-capital expenditure level for 1985 which can be supported by the total Exchequer grant provision already provided, including the draw <Col N="2297" /> from Vote 49, together with the supplementary amount now sought, is estimated at £1,168 million, representing about 7.57 per cent of GNP.</P>
    <P>As regards health services policy generally, I will make some comments as they relate to expenditure during the year.  As outlined in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality</i>, the main thrust of health policy will be directed towards disease prevention, community care services and care for the poor and the disadvantaged. However, that does not mean that the acute hospital service will be neglected.  There is a need to improve efficiency in the acute hospital services and to scale down the infrastructure by reducing bed numbers.  At the same time it is necessary to ensure that patient care does not suffer and that new technological advances can be accommodated within the resources available.</P>
    <P>Some controversy has arisen in relation to my decision to designate St. Vincent's Hospital in association with Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, as the National Liver Transplant Centre and the subsequent performance in the Mater Hospital of a liver transplant despite their being warned, clearly and in advance, of the consequences of their action in terms particularly of the dilution of the expertise so essential to the carrying out of liver transplants.  On Wednesday, 6 November 1985, approximately one month prior to that procedure being carried out, I made a statement and conveyed it to all the hospitals concerned that not more than one centre could be justified in this country and that I would not approve of transplants being carried out in any hospital other than St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin, in association with Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  On 6 November I gave my reasons for that decision and I do not propose to elaborate on the matter.  However, if any Deputy wishes me to comment on it, I am willing to do so.</P>
    <P>I much regret the fact that the controversy centred upon an individual case but, in the interest of the proper organisation of the distribution of specialities between hospitals, I could not at that <Col N="2298" /> time have shirked the decision involved. In response to a number of inquiries subsequently, particularly from the media, which were critical of my decision, I indicated quite clearly that I had no option but to take a decision and to make it known lest there be any misunderstanding in the minds of those concerned as to the intention to implement that decision. I am happy to inform the House that the issue has been resolved and that at a meeting last Tuesday evening the board of the Mater Hospital unanimously decided to accept my decision to designate St. Vincent's Hospital, in association with Our Lady's Children's Hospital, as the National Liver Transplant Centre.  In the light of that confirmation which I had awaited, I have arranged at the request of the board of the Mater Hospital that the Secretary of my Department will meet in the near future with a group from the Mater Hospital to arrange for co-operation between the consultants of the Mater, St. Vincent's and Crumlin hospitals in the work of the transplant centre.  I am pleased to note that the matter has been resolved.</P>
    <P>There has been to my mind unnecessary, alarming and inaccurate comments about the alleged hardship that has been caused by the level of allocations which have been approved for health agencies in 1985.  Admittedly allocations have been tight.  However, some agencies are heading for a break-even situation for the year.  Others are fairly close to that target.</P>
    <P>The health services have always been an area where even the suggestion of any need for some financial restraint is greeted with a spontaneous barrage of abuse and criticism.  Rational and informed argument usually has a very short life expectancy in the environment generated by such abuse and such criticism. Emotionalism and, if I may dare to say so, an inclination towards a marked degree of hysteria, tend to set the pace and to infect the atmosphere.  The constraints on public expenditure at the present time mean that options simply have to be selected.  Real choices have to be made in pursuance of the twin objectives <Col N="2299" /> of the controlled reduction of high levels of borrowing on the one hand, and the need to reduce the penal burden of taxation most particularly as it affects direct taxation on the PAYE sector, on the other.</P>
    <P>The necessity for prudent management of resources does not imply a dilution of essential services.  Rather does it impose a discipline on management to make the best possible use of resources in the care of the sick and other vulnerable groups in the community.</P>
    <P>The campaign of free immunisation against measles was launched at the beginning of October.  This was the first public immunisation scheme to be provided through general practitioners.  A special allocation of £650,000 was made to fund this new scheme.  I am sure Members of the House will appreciate the co-operation of Deputy O'Hanlon in that regard.  It was an investment which was considered to be well worthwhile in economic terms as well as in its vital contribution to child health.</P>
    <P>The Department's target was for a 95 per cent up-take of the vaccine in a six-week intensive programme of vaccination. A 95 per cent up-take is required for eradication of the disease.  It was recognised that this would be an extremely difficult target to achieve in the period allocated, given that measles is not regarded as a serious illness by the general public and by some doctors.  It is considered that a 60-70 per cent up-take would be a good result in a voluntary measles immunisation campaign.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, the initial response appeared to be rather slow.  To counter this the Department called a meeting of the Directors of Community Care and medical officers of health on 12 November to discuss the problem and to indicate how the better areas had already achieved an up-take of over 50 per cent in the first month.  The Health Education Bureau were also asked to revise their advertising campaign and the College of General Practitioners renewed encouragement to their members to advise parents of the advantages of the service. <Col N="2300" /> A further meeting will take place on 19 December.</P>
    <P>The net effect of these measures has been to increase up-take steadily.  The average up-take is now 52 per cent.  If the present trend can be sustained it is expected that we will achieve an up-take of up to 60 per cent by February-March. This would be a significant achievement when compared with the results of similar campaigns in other countries, in particular Northern Ireland, where it might be as low as 25 per cent.</P>
    <P>We have invested a considerable amount of money to deal with the problem of AIDS which continues to occupy the headlines internationally.  We are fortunate that the disease has been slower to reach here than many other countries and we have been able to make arrangements to monitor and control it, with benefit from experience and information elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Detailed instructions have been given to health boards about arrangements for reporting and surveillance of cases and suspected cases of AIDS.  These instructions are periodically up-dated to take account of new information about the disease as it becomes available.  The surveillance system is working satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>The Blood Transfusion Service board have made arrangements to provide our total requirements for blood products from domestic blood.  These are important measures for the protection of our haemophiliac population.  Persons in the at-risk groups are asked not to donate blood.  All blood donations are tested for the presence of AIDS virus anti-body.</P>
    <P>Arrangements have been made for routine anti-body testing of intravenous drug abusers.  Other persons who suspect that they may have come into contact with the AIDS virus should make arrangements for AIDS anti-body testing through their general practitioner or at an STD clinic.  Confirmatory testing as required is arranged at the Virus Reference Laboratory, UCD, Belfield.</P>
    <P>In addition to the information already circulated to health boards, a general <Col N="2301" /> information booklet on AIDS for all doctors is in course of preparation.  An information leaflet for the general public is also being prepared.  In the normal way, counselling and education is a matter for the family doctor.  I am satisfied that our arrangements for monitoring developments in Ireland and internationally relative to the disease are adequate.</P>
    <P>I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House for approval.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Since the Minister came to office he has boasted it has never been necessary for him to introduce a Supplementary Estimate.  On this side of the House we have appealed to him to ensure there is no diminution in the level of services.  I am glad that this year he has decided to introduce a Supplementary Estimate because most of the money allocated will ensure there is a general practitioner service available to medical cardholders until the end of the year.</P>
      <P>The Minister told us he was convinced that sufficient money had been allocated to ensure a proper level of service this year.  As every Deputy knows, that will not be the case.  I was amazed that he referred to <i>Building on Reality</i>, because that laid down clearly that the amount of money to be spent in 1985 would be £1,090 million. The Estimate provides for £1,086 million with a further £13 odd million in the supplementary Estimates making a grand total of £1,115 million in round figures. That is almost £100 million more than provided for in the Government document and therefore, not alone on health matters but in regard to general Government policy, the document has been discredited. I was surprised the Minister spoke about it this morning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister said some of the money to be allocated would help to increase allowances to certain categories of persons for whom the health boards have responsibility.  There has been condemnation of the Government for lack of increased allocations for social welfare recipients this year.  There has not been any dependent allowance, and that was expected by social welfare recipients, <Col N="2302" /> who also expected a double allowance for Christmas as had become normal practice.</P>
    <P>In regard to the GMS, we are not surprised at the amount in the Supplementary Estimate because the Government had got their figures wrong at the beginning. On 5 June last I asked the Minister by way of supplementary question what the estimated over-expenditure of each health board would be this year.  The Minister was unable to give me the figure, in reply to Question No. 591 on 5 June 1985.  A week before that, the GMS payments board were able to inform each health board what the estimated shortfall for the year would be &mdash; not just the total short-fall in the GMS but the amount for each board.  The figure for the Eastern Health Board was £500,000, and the letter sent out by the payments board gave the figure to the North-Western Health Board, the North-Eastern Health Board in my constituency &mdash; the figure was £750,000 &mdash; and the others, making a grand total of more than £8 million of a deficit for the entire country.  As I said, a week later the Minister was not able to answer my question here.  Is it surprising, therefore, that the Government have their figures wrong in relation to the GMS this year?</P>
    <P>Why did the Minister change the method of funding the GMS?  Formerly it was funded directly by the Department, but this year the Government decided that the health boards should be responsible for funding the GMS and that any short-falls would have to be made up from other sources.  It is obvious that the boards could not control expenditure and they are in a most difficult position because they had to assume the role of middlemen, the amount of money allocated by the Department not being under their control.  Naturally, expenditure depends on the services given to the people who hold medical cards.  This is variable depending on the circumstances, The Minister expressed concern today about the high visiting rate.  We would all be concerned that expenditure should represent value for money, and in the health services we all have to say that <Col N="2303" /> they represent good value for money. There is a totally comprehensive GMS available to 32 per cent of the public, 24 hours a day, 52 weeks a year.  We must always look for efficiency and it is my opinion that the GMS represents excellent value for money.</P>
    <P>I was surprised here on 20 November when, in reply to a supplementary by me to Question No. 2, the Minister gave, as one of the reasons for the increased visiting rate, &ldquo;There are many interesting reasons for that, not the least of which are the negotiations going on&rdquo;.  The reason surprised me.  It was what came to the Minister's mind.  Everyone knows why the visiting rate is increasing.  The first obvious reason is the economic policy of the Government.  It is appreciated by all that when there is an increasing poverty rate and increasing unemployment there is consequent increasing morbidity and therefore an increasing rate of illness. That was very much realised in the thirties in a time of depression and rising unemployment.  We know that unemployment today is a direct result of Government policy and that is why we have an increase in the visiting rate.</P>
    <P>Another reason is the effect of the cutbacks. This morning for the first time the Minister admitted that there were detrimental effects from cutbacks.  Generally, when we suggest that these are cutbacks the Minister pretends that he does not understand what we are talking about.  Today, however, he admitted that there are bad effects from the cutbacks.</P>
    <P>The reduction in hospital services means that people are paying more visits to medical practitioners.  Naturally, if people have to wait longer for out-patient services they will visit their local doctors more frequently.  This year, because of the bad weather in summer the visiting rate increased: people's health tends to be better when there are normal summers, but this year was particularly bad and so was the general health of the people.  The Minister should consider these reasons rather than suggesting that in some way the doctors made a conscious decision to increase the visiting rate in the <Col N="2304" /> belief that that might have some influence on the negotiations.  That type of thinking has very serious implications for the success of any negotiations.  There must be trust on both sides.  All the people working in the field &mdash; the Minister, the Department, the health boards, the doctors, nurses and the para-medical staff &mdash; are trying to provide the best level of health care at the most economic rate.  It would be unfortunate if a &ldquo;them and us&rdquo; situation were to develop between the Department and the doctors.  I appeal to the Minister to show trust in the profession. I accept that one or two people in any profession can cause problems, but the members of any professional group do not welcome any such action.  People working in the health services would not be tolerant of any abuses of the system. We are very fortunate that in our health services all the professional personnel and staff are dedicated people who are committed to the welfare of those for whom they have responsibility.</P>
    <P>On the question of generic prescribing it is simple to suggest that doctors should prescribe products by using their basic name but I have suggested here that there should be formulae whereby doctors would know when they write the basic name of a product, the type of product that would be prescribed.  This is a matter on which the medical profession and the pharmaceutical profession could draw up their own formulae.  There was a difficulty in this area some 25 years ago or so when local authorities provided drugs for the dispensaries in their areas and when some of those drugs were found to be inferior.  These were drugs that were imported from the Far East.  It is important that doctors should have confidence in the drugs they prescribe and that there should be much more prescribing of generic products.</P>
    <P>Many people experience problems by reason of simple remedies such as white stomach mixtures and some cough bottles not being available through the health services.  Old people living alone or those on non-contributory pensions, for instance, have difficulty in purchasing these products.  Very often there is a <Col N="2305" /> temptation for a doctor to prescribe drugs that are more expensive and more potent.  This is borne out when one considers the figures for a drug such as Tagamet which is costing the Exchequer more than £2 million in the current year.  The drug is used for the relief of stomach complaints.  I am convinced that for many people simple white mixtures would bring a good response.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the financial restrictions in 1985 and suggested that there are too many alarming and inaccurate comments about the alleged hardship being caused by the level of allocations approved for health agencies for this year.  He said:</P>
    <P>The health services have always been an area where even the suggestion of any need for some financial restraint is greeted with a spontaneous barrage of abuse and criticism.  Rational and informed argument usually has a very short life expectancy in the environment generated by such abuse and such criticism.  Emotionalism, and if I may dare to say so, an inclination towards a marked degree of hysteria, tend to set the pace and to infect the atmosphere.</P>
    <P>The Minister might have been referring to himself because every elected public representative has a responsibility to draw his attention to the effects of Government action.  I am not blaming the Minister personally for any of this. The Government must accept collective responsibility and it is their responsibility to provide an adequate level of service, but this is not being done.</P>
    <P>It is not correct to say that any suggestion of financial restraint is greeted with a spontaneous barrage of abuse and criticism. What has been said in the past couple of years has been very moderate and constructive.  A number of statements have been made by the chairmen of health boards drawing the Minister's attention to the effects of the cutbacks in the health board's allocation.  In reply to a question here on Thursday last, the Minister admitted that there was a reduction in real terms in the allocation for each health board in 1985 compared <Col N="2306" /> with 1982, the last year before the Government came into office.  I asked the Minister what the reduction in real terms of each health board was in 1985 over 1982 and his reply as reported at column 1428 of the Official Report for 5 December 5 was that the percentage change in non-capital allocations in real terms was as follows:</P>

    <P>When one considers that the Eastern Health Board was the only one to get a marginal increase, and when one considers the rapidly expanding population, particularly the growth area of Tallaght, over that time, one realises that the net effect is a very major decrease in the EHB as well.  It is not correct to say that there is hysteria when people complain about reductions of that nature.  While opposing reductions of this nature, we are all in favour of more efficiency in the service.  Some reduction was possible by improving efficiency of the service at all levels, but the Government committed themselves to expanding the service in a number of areas and there has not been any expansion as money has not been provided for it.</P>
    <P>We have a real decrease not alone in the money allocated but in the level of service being provided.  In the hospital services it is obvious that if one does not provide locums to cover for personnel absent on holidays, maternity leave or on weekends there must be a reduction in the level of service.  If wards are closed and if out-patient clinics are closed there is obviously a reduction in the level of service.  The Minister is not coming to grips with what is happening.  Recently on a radio programme when asked a question about why hips were not being replaced by the South-Eastern Health Board the Minister replied that there was political connivance.  If there is a <Col N="2307" /> reduction in the allocation to the South-Eastern Health Board of the order of £3.644 million it is understandable that the health board would not have the hips available for replacements and that is why there is a slow down of availability of operations coming to the end of the year.  I cannot see, under any circumstances, how one could have political connivance between the orthopaedic surgeons and the executive of the health board because they are the principal people who ensure that these hip operations continue.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister aware of the problems with the radiotherapy services in Cork? Patients have now to travel to St. Luke's Hospital in Dublin for radiotherapy because of the inadequate level of service in Cork.  On the radio programme on which the Minister referred to hip operations, in reply to a question about dental services the Minister told a listener in Trim that while that listener might have a problem there were no problems in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  The Minister told us time and time again in this House that there has not been a diminution in the level of dental services.  We all know there are problems in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.  There was no service of a routine nature there for any adult with a medical card, on supplementary allowances or widows' pensions or on old age pension.  One person in my practice in this area had a service before the he was going for a hip operation and he needed the dental service before the orthopaedic surgeon would operate on his hip.  I have no doubt that the waiting list for adults must have reduced considerably, because nobody puts his or her name down on the list any longer.  In relation to children, there are over 40,000 children on the waiting list for a service. This is unacceptable and still the Minister can go on radio and tell the people that there is an adequate dental service.</P>
    <P>The same problems apply to the optical service.  How ludicrous can we get when we have a situation in one community care area where a person who had optical services provided, in so far as he got his <Col N="2308" /> eyes tested, when he went to the optician who had the contract to supply spectacles at rooms in the same town, was told that he would have to pay for the spectacles there but that if he travelled ten or 15 miles to where the same optician had a similar clinic he could get the spectacles free?  These are the areas to which we should look for improved efficiency.</P>
    <P>In relation to community care services, care for the elderly and psychiatric services, what provision has been made to develop community care services to ensure that more and more people can be treated in the community and can remain in their own homes?  The document <i>The Way Forward</i> recommended that the psychiatric services should become more community based.  We all support that.  During the debate on the Estimate in July the Minister said that he hoped to implement some of that suggestion, but what provision has been made for this?  In the US and in Italy people were pushed out of the psychiatric hospitals into the community.  Community care services were not provided and psychiatric patients ended up congregating in destitute groups and down and out.  We do not want that to happen here.  It is futile to talk about transferring people from hospital to community care services if there is not a service in the community to cater for them.  In relation to the development of community psychiatric services it is important that there be close co-ordination between the family doctor service and public health centred services. I am just a bit worried in case the psychiatric services might develop independently. Care for the psychiatric patients should be developed in co-ordination and co-operation with their own family doctors.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Green Paper on the handicapped, I would ask the Minister what special allocations he made to the health boards for the implementation of the recommendations in that excellent report.  The Minister committed himself to making allocations to the health boards.</P>
    <P>The Voluntary Health Insurance Board also have problems in meeting <Col N="2309" /> their commitments because the cost of their premium is so high.  Much of this cost is the direct result of intervention by the Government in increasing the cost of private accommodation.  We now have a situation in health board hospitals that a private room is more expensive than in the Mater Private Nursing Home or in Elm Park.  The Minister was to collect £1.4 million from the consultants for the use of equipment in public hospitals for their private patients.  We opposed that because it would increase the premium to those who insure themselves.  At the end of the day it would be the consumer who would pay; it would not come directly out of the consultant's pocket.  I understand that that money has not been collected, as we expected it would not be collected.  The Minister promised us legislation on the VHI before the end of the year and we have not heard anything of that.</P>
    <P>On the question of the Family Planning Act the Minister wrote to the health boards requesting them to set up family planning clinics.  The health boards have resisted that request because there has been no demand in their areas for these clinics.  Family planning is a matter for patients and their family doctors.  More and more family doctors are providing a wider range of family planning services. Indeed, many younger doctors have diplomas in family planning.  Yet, at a time when there is no dental service in the health board areas, the Minister requests them to set up a family planning service. I am not surprised that the health boards, with common sense, have resisted that request when they are unable to provide the statutory services in respect of which they have a responsibility.</P>
    <P>I compliment the Minister on having initiated the measles eradication campaign. The Minister has the full support of every Member on this side of the House in ensuring that that campaign will be successful.  We should like to see the highest possible percentage of children having the measles vaccination.  When it comes to the final figures it will be difficult to say what percentage of children between the ages of 15 months and five <Col N="2310" /> years, who needed the vaccine, actually received it.  I do not think any community care area has got up-to-date, correct figures for the number of children who would have had measles.  That fact may not have been notified or, if it was, they may not be in a position to collate the names of the children.  Therefore, the health boards may not have the names of children between the ages of 15 months and five years who have had measles and, therefore, did not need the vaccine.  This means the percentage figure at the end of the day may be lower than the actual percentage who needed the vaccine and who actually received it.  I believe that scheme will be very beneficial in the future to the children of this country. Hopefully we shall have eradicated measles, saving the trauma and upset occasioned by such an illness, sometimes with very serious complications.  Also in economic terms it will have proven to be a worthwhile exercise.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred this morning to the problem in the Mater Hospital.  I agree with him.  I believe it was unfortunate that the discussion should have revolved around one patient.  However, I think it would be fair enough to blame the Minister for that.  He rushed in too hastily to impose a penalty of £25,000 on the Mater Hospital.  I agree fully with the Minister in his wish to rationalise high technology medicine.  I accept that transplants cannot be carried out in every hospital and that we must rationalise the whole area of transplantation.  However, one cannot just make a regulation on 6 November that, in future, all transplants will be done in such and such a hospital because if a hospital where transplants have already been carried out, such as the Mater, has a patient of long standing, in this case 13 years, then the consultants would have a certain obligation to that patient and this has to be considered.  I believe the Minister should have made an exception in that case.  I am very glad that the situation has now been resolved. The Minister did not tell us but I hope that, in resolving the situation, he <Col N="2311" /> revoked the decision to penalise that hospital in the sum of £25,000.  When replying I hope he will be in a position to tell us that he did revoke that decision, that all is now well between himself and the Mater Hospital.</P>
    <P>The fact that Beaumont Hospital has not opened is an absolute disgrace.  The reason is that, in the present Government, there is some sort of a bizarre ideology that would not be accepted by any health care experts anywhere in the world or, indeed, by any patients anywhere in the civilised world &mdash; that a hospital should remain unopened because the Government do not want the consultants to have their private facility on the campus.  In a country where approximately 20 per cent of the people do not have the right to full, free medical hospital services and are obliged to pay for the medical services we have, there is an obligation on the administrators to ensure that facilities are available to them.</P>
    <P>Having said that, the Minister and the Government have decided that there should be no private facility, no private hospital, for the consultants moving there.  The Leader of our party, as Minister for Health, and his successor, Deputy Woods, also as Minister for Health, decided to allocate land to the consultants for such a private facility.  On returning to Government we, in Fianna Fáil, will make that land available to the consultants &mdash; the small amount of land they require &mdash; either by way of lease or sale at absolutely no cost to the Exchequer. Rather would it involve an income because, if the land were leased, there would be an annual income accruing therefrom.</P>
    <P>The reason we would allocate such land is not, as the Minister suggested here some time ago to curry favour with the consultants, but rather in the interests of all the patients in the new public hospital, the one that is now lying idle and not open.  In their interest we believe that consultants should be on the Beaumont campus for as long as possible during the day.  We do not want to see a situation <Col N="2312" /> evolve in which they would carry out their work in the public hospital in Beaumont in the morning and then drive possibly two hours across the city to perform their private work in the afternoon.  Surely nobody could argue from any point of logic that the consultants should not be allowed onto the campus, that it is all right to have a public patient in Beaumont Hospital, and the consultant there with that patient in the morning, then have him drive out to Dun Laoghaire, Mount Carmel or somewhere else in the afternoon?</P>
    <P>While the measles eradication campaign has constituted a step forward in preventive medicine, looking through the Estimates it is always disappointing to note that less than 2 per cent of the total goes towards prevention.  I ask the Minister to ascertain whether more money can be spent in that area.  It is the policy of the Government, and indeed of all parties, that there should be greater commitment to prevention but, when we examine the figures, we find that that policy is not reflected in them.  In that context we should compliment the Health Education Bureau on the excellent international seminar they organised here in the summer time.  Hopefully that will prove to have been of benefit not alone to our people but to the personnel of all other countries who participated.</P>
    <P>The Minister promised us legislation on control of tobacco advertising in 1984. To date there has been no sign of that.  Is the Minister satisfied that the amalgamation of the Medico-Social Research Board and the Medical Research Council of Ireland, and particularly bringing them together into the Department of Health, is in the best interest of the people?  Both bodies do excellent work and the Medico-Social Research Board are involved in many projects of a social nature.  My concern is that if a Minister thought that a report was not going to be favourable to his Government he might say when he has them in his Department, &ldquo;We should not go ahead with that project&rdquo;.  They serve the nation well in their independent or semi-State status and I would like to see that continue.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2313" /> The Minister since he came into office has been promising that we would have a Green Paper on reform of the health services.  There has been no sign of that Green Paper.  As far back as April 1984 he told us that we would have it before the end of 1984.  When can we expect that Green Paper?  From what we have been told here in answer to questions in the House it appears that it contains some radical suggestions.  Some people are concerned that all eight health boards will be abolished and that there will be central control in the Department.  The Minister has referred to the fact that services for the mentally handicapped are outside the health board as are the voluntary hospitals. Naturally, there is concern that the Minister has radical proposals for taking over control of the whole health service. It seems that this Green Paper either will not appear in time for the Minister to implement any of the recommendations in it because an election will be at hand or it will not appear at all in advance of an election.  That Green Paper has been promised for a long time now.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us this morning when we can expect it.</P>

      <P>Let me remind Deputy Durkan and Deputy Brady that the debate on the Estimate concludes at 12.30 p.m.  I presume that both would like to have the Minister in to respond.  I ask them to bear that in mind.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Durkan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and speak for ten or 15 minutes.  I welcome the introduction of this Supplementary Estimate the purpose of which is to allow the Department to discharge their liabilities for the various services.  Deputy O'Hanlon spoke in relation to cutbacks in the health services as health boards generally and as a member of the Eastern Health Board, I must say that that board have done remarkably well over the years in providing services even in a difficult economic climate.  They have provided a very good standard of service and I hope they will continue to do so.  I pay a compliment to the chairman of that health board <Col N="2314" />&mdash; who is not a member of my political party &mdash; who has excelled in impartiality and constructive approach throughout his term of office, as have all the previous chairmen.</P>
      <P>In the change from institutional care to community care which seems to be the general thrust desired by most people nowadays in the health services, one must not forget that community care also costs money and to some extent this may be one reason for the increased visitation rate which I accept has caused considerable concern at health board meetings all over the country.  However, perhaps more people are being looked after at home.  The bad summer we have just had was a contributory factor, but one must remember that in the event of greater emphasis on community care we will in any event be involved in expenditure by way of attendance of public health nurses, doctors etc.  That is as it should be.  One must remember also that society has changed over the last 40 or 50 years. At one time in every household one or two people were at home all day to look after elderly or sick persons.  In many cases now people are at work all day, and then an elderly person, a person who is sick or whatever, has not the attention that his or her counterparts would have had 50 years ago.  Consequently there is a greater call on the services and we must face up to that just as we must face up to changing times.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon said that only 75 per cent of the social welfare bonus was paid at Christmas this year compared with previous years.  He forgot to mention that it applies to a far wider range of people.  Far more people are to be accommodated.  I welcome that proposal which was announced by the Minister some time ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At present a fairly high standard of health services is available here in comparison with many other countries. Maybe we do not always recognise the very high standard of health services available.  Politicians, depending on their stance at a given time, will criticise the lack of availability of service of one kind or another and there may be genuine <Col N="2315" /> reasons for that on occasion, but we must not forget that we have in a very small country with a small economy a fairly sophisticated standard of services which are costing and will continue to cost a great deal of money if we want to have them.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Hanlon referred to the move towards community care in the psychiatric services and the desirability of that move.  I know the Minister's intentions are in that direction and I support fully any move towards community based psychiatric care and away from the large psychiatric institutions where in some cases patients have been housed for up to 50 years.  In the past I have spoken many times about what I have seen at first hand, patients living intolerable circumstances and conditions.  That is not in keeping with the standard we should have at present.  To say the very least, some of the buildings in which they are housed are Dickensian.  The Minister had indicated, rightly, his intention to tackle that problem.  I have said many times that it would do us all good, particularly at Christmas time, to pay a visit to our psychiatric institutions and see at first hand the forlorn appearance of the buildings because of their age and structure generally, and the forlorn appearance in many cases of the patients.  We would do well to ponder the length of time some of those patients have been living in those institutions, some of the more elderly patients for up to 50 years have been living in those institutions, some of the more elderly patients for up to 50 years in a single institution.  Maybe in some cases they have scarcely left the building or even their room over that period.  We should also reflect on the type of patient housed in those places.  Not all the patients are psychiatrically disturbed.  Many of them are elderly or psycho-geriatric. The only reason they are there is that there is no place else for them.  That is a very sad reflection on our society.</P>
    <P>When we hear criticism of alleged cutbacks in the health services, little emotion is generated in regard to the psyhciatric services.  Yet in this city there <Col N="2316" /> are approximately 1,000 people in one major psychiatric centre, St. Brendan's Hospital, where the conditions are not what one would expect at the end of the 20th century.  I do not wish to labour the point but I must appeal to the Minister to change those services and house the people involved in smaller institutions, in modern buildings where staff will have a reasonable chance to spend their time effectively.</P>
    <P>There is no sense in having large numbers of patients in old fashioned, draughtly and sometimes dangerous buildings.  To expect staff to give of their best under such conditions is asking too much.  We have been fortunate over the years in that we have not had a major catastrophe in any of those hospitals.  A few years ago part of the roof of St. Brendan's Hospital collapsed, but, fortunately, nobody was injured and it was possible to relocate the patients.  To date we have been extremely lucky, but we should not tempt fate too much.  The sooner we introduce a system on the lines that the Minister has in mind the better for all concerned.  We will then have a chance to do something compassionate and constructive about the psychiatric service here.</P>
    <P>The Estimate covers provision for domiciliary care and DPMA allowances. I have written to the Minister in regard to a number of cases.  Many community based voluntary organisations are now providing services for the mentally handicapped. For instance, the Irish Wheelchair Association in north Kildare is doing a tremendous job in that area. However, there are problems.  When recipients of DPMA enter a shelter workshop they have their free travel passes withdrawn.  An exception should be made in such cases.  The cost to the Exchequer would be minimal.  For them to lose their free travel passes because they attend such work shops is not helpful and is unfair to them.</P>
    <P>In spite of the difficult economic climate I am pleased to report that the Eastern Health Board have done a fairly good job in getting to grips with the problem of the orthodontic waiting list.  Two <Col N="2317" /> years ago in one county alone there were thousands on a waiting list but we have managed to isolate the problem since. Those who may disagree with that comment should check the figures of four years ago.</P>
    <P>I should like to deal with the question of transplants and the possibility of a duplication of specialisation in our hospitals. I do not think we can afford that. We should be moving towards getting our major hospitals to specialise in one area instead of the hospitals competing with each other.  It would be in the interests of the hospitals, the health boards and the health of our people if that were done.</P>

      <P>Before I call on Deputy Vincent Brady I should like to indicate to Deputy Barnes that the Minister has expressed a wish to get in before the conclusion of the debate at 12.30 p.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="VincentBrady" hpid="Mr. V. Brady Mr. V. Brady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. V. Brady</NameTxt>
      <P>I will be brief and, hopefully, Deputy Barnes will get a few minutes to make a contribution.  It is a pity that the debate on the Estimate for Health which covers such a vast area is limited, but that is something we have to live with today.  The Department cover practically every aspect of life here.  We are all conscious of the effect of the cutbacks in the health and medical services whether in hospitals, health centres and so on.  On the question of orthodontic services I must point out that the health centre in Marino has been without an orthodontist for two years.  I raised the matter in the House on numerous occasions and I was informed earlier this year by the Minister that applicants were being interviewed but nothing has happened since.  Hundreds of urgent cases are on the waiting list.  Many of the children involved are over the age limit and no longer qualify for that service.  I am very concerned about that problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to pay a compliment to the voluntary hospitals who have made a major contribution to our health services down the years.  Like most voluntary <Col N="2318" /> bodies, whether they are involved in education or in health care, we tend to take them for granted, but we owe them great credit.  We owe a lot to the religious orders for their work in those areas. Without their contribution our health services would not have made the progress they have.  We all accept that there has been progress but it is unfortunate that in recent years it has stopped.  In fact, it has been retarded in the hospital and medical services.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to Beaumont Hospital, one of the major scandals in this city.  That hospital on the north side of Dublin cost £57 million to build but it is empty because of a dispute which, in my view, arises out of the ideological views of the Minister.  Not only is the hospital empty but it is costing £100,000 per month to maintain.  From time to time the Department of Health remind us of the cutbacks and restrictions because of lack of funds, but it is a shame that such a facility has not been utilised for a number of years.  Most of us are aware of the history in regard to that hospital.  The Beaumont Hospital Board was established in 1977.  Originally it was to replace the Jervis Street and Richmond Hospitals.</P>
    <P>The north side of Dublin city has been deprived of good hospital facilities for a number of years.  It has had the Mater Hospital which is excellent in every respect but, because of the vast population stretching further northwards, Beaumont Hospital is very badly needed and there is great concern about this in Dublin and elsewhere.  The Minister has not given any indication of when the opening of the hospital might take place.  The excuse being put forward continuously is that he will not waste public funds on private facilities.  The truth is that he would not be spending any public funds on these private facilities.  The consultants made it quite clear in the agreement and arrangements made at the very beginning that they would finance the building and the facilities themselves.  There would not be one penny that the Department of Health would be called upon to provide.  In those <Col N="2319" /> circumstances I fail to understand why the Minister should remain so rigid in this matter.</P>
    <P>The situation on the north side is serious because of the insufficient number of acute hospital beds.  Beaumont was intended to fill this need to a large extent. As my colleague indicated earlier, it appears that the Minister would have no objections to the consultants being provided with rooms on the north side of the city, but that is not workable.  Even as a non-medical person, I can appreciate that the presence of consultants on the campus must be of benefit in a public hospital.  I fail to understand why the Minister should think otherwise.  It appears that the Minister has got himself into a corner and refuses to admit that he was wrong.  I appeal to him even at this late stage to change his mind and open Beaumont Hospital.  He went part of the way some time ago in agreeing to provide 70 beds in that hospital, but that surely is a penalty on the public patients.  It is taking away 70 beds from the public hospital &mdash; 10 per cent of the capacity.</P>
    <P>Under the original agreement favoured by a number of the Minister's predecessors he would continue to have those 70 beds available for public patients and at the same time the facility of a private hospital for those who wish to use it. There are many who, for one reason or another, are not in a position to benefit from publicly funded hospitalisation and they should have that choice.  Who is to say that people living on the north side should not have Beaumont Hospital located nearby?  I ask the Minister to meet the consultants and agree to open Beaumont Hospital without further delay, which would be in the interests of all.  Certainly, the large population on the north side would benefit greatly because this facility is absolutely needed and the Minister would not be going back on his commitment as far as the expenditure of public funds is concerned.  There are setups very similar to the one requested in Beaumont in other hospitals on the south side, such as Mount Carmel and St. Michael's, Dún Laoghaire.  Nobody can <Col N="2320" /> say that those hospitals are any the worse for having these facilities.  Many people in Dublin with a choice of hospitals opt for Mount Carmel and perhaps that is the reason.</P>
    <P>Beaumont Hospital was designed in the same way with the same plans as Cork Regional Hospital.  The purpose was to save time and expense.  Recently I read a report in which the Minister indicated that the plans for Beaumont Hospital were all wrong.  Is he saying that Cork Regional Hospital is wrongly planned? Beaumont was designed to be built exactly the same.  His argument does not carry any weight.  It would seem to indicate that the Minister's view is purely a personal one of ideology.  I wish he would come face to face with the situation and solve this problem once and for all.</P>
    <P>The last item I want to mention concerns dialysis facilities in Limerick Regional Hospital.  I make this point because of having first hand experience of the difficulties caused to patients as a very close relation of mine, who is sadly no longer alive was one of these.  As the Minister will know, the facilities there were provided on a voluntary basis, with something in the region of £80,000 being collected by local people to provide a kidney unit in that hospital.  For some reason, the Minister refused to agree to finance the staffing facilities requires.  I do not know how many nurses would be required there, but I have been told somewhere in the region of six.  That is all it would cost the Department.  There are 18 patients coming from Limerick to Dublin three times a week, travelling 140 to 150 miles &mdash; at public expense, mind you &mdash; having been collected from their homes in the country, brought to Limerick railway station, transported by train from Limerick to Dublin, collected at Heuston Station and brought to St. Mary's Hospital in the Phoenix Park or to Jervis Street.  They spend three to four hours on a kidney machine and then have the same difficulties and painful travel home.  This is happening to people who are seriously ill.  To adopt such policy is not only heartless; it is inhuman.  I am surprised that any Minister for Health, <Col N="2321" /> but particularly a Labour Minister who professes from time to time to be a champion of the people, should allow that situation to continue.</P>
    <P>I invite the Minister on any Monday, Wednesday or Friday to visit Jervis Street Hospital or St. Mary's to meet and talk with those who had to endure such stresses and strains.  If he had done so, I am quite sure he would have relented long ago.  I know facilities were opened in Limerick Regional Hospital two weeks ago, but they are on a very limited scale, benefiting only from two to four patients. This is all wrong from the human, the moral and the financial point of view.  It must be costing the Department a great amount of money to finance these travelling arrangements of 18 patients three times a week.  In the interests of those patients still living, I appeal to the Minister to have a complete rethink on this and to grant full facilities to those living in that area.</P>
    <P>There are many other aspects that I should like to have mentioned, but this debate is limited and I wish to give Deputy Barnes some time and would like to hear the Minister's reply.  I hope we shall have an opportunity at some other time in the House to debate the Department of Health in much greater detail, because it has been drastically run down in recent years, with cutbacks right across the board.  People are suffering all over the country, but particularly in Dublin city; hundreds are waiting to get into hospital, but wards are closed in various hospitals due to cutbacks.  This must be laid at the door of the Minister for Health.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank Deputy Brady for allowing me a few minutes, which is all I shall take.  I know there will be other opportunities to expand on this subject. I did not want this occasion to go by without highlighting a few issues raised, particularly in regard to the statement this morning by the Minister.  I support him absolutely in working towards proposals for change in the GMS and in his negotiations with the Irish Medical Organisation to make the health service <Col N="2322" /> more streamlined and effective which would be to the advantage of the doctors, the patients and the taxpayers, the patients being the priority.</P>
      <P>I want to highlight a few points which the Minister might take into consideration in the negotiations with the doctors.  I share the concern of the Minister that there seems to be an ever-climbing cycle of visits to doctors, aligned with a greater tendency to prescribe drugs, perhaps because the doctors have not the time for longer and more meaningful consultations with their patients.  I was reminded very forcibly of this fact recently at a press conference to launch the Health Education Bureau's publication <i>Women and Health.</i> The two women involved in the research for this publication repeatedly made clear that women, particularly those in the home, suffer from a high rate of depression, yet the fundamental reasons are seldom looked into.  When they eventually go to the doctor, usually they are handed drugs to keep them calm, raise the depression or sedate them.  One of the women who contributed to the book made the point that it has been said that when men come under pressure they usually end up in jail, but when women come under pressure they usually end up with a psychiatrist or sedated with valium.</P>
      <P>That is all part of the cycle which the Minister is trying to being to a halt.  I would join him in asking the Irish Medical Association and the health boards to look closely at this question and to bring the thrust of the health service back into the community, treating people in meaningful consultations without relying too much on drugs to sort out problems. Drugs do not solve the problems.  The cost in human and in financial terms is with regard to the whole area of generic drugs?  There is intensive marketing by multinational companies who have incredible power and financial resources. Are all of these drugs necessary and so many different kinds?  I doubt it.  The whole area of generic drugs and the cost will have to be closely examined.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would refer to the publication <i>Irish <Col N="2323" /> Women: Agenda for Practical Action</i> produced by the Working Party on Women's Affairs and Family Law Reform.  It contains several recommendations, including one on family planning which states:</P>
    <P>General practitioners, public health nurses and hospital doctors should ensure that the needs of the mother in relation to family planning are met. According to the survey results, 48 per cent of mothers had no discussion on family planning with any of the professionals involved in maternity care; 39 per cent of these said that they would have liked a discussion; 48 per cent of Category 1 mothers indicated a need for such a discussion.  As a general rule, it is recommended that the general practitioner in the scheme and the public health nurse should raise the question of comprehensive family planning with the mother and, if she wants advice, should give it to her.</P>
    <P>I doubt if that recommendation is comprehensively carried out and implemented.  I know the Minister has set in train through the health boards an attempt to find out what network of family planning services we have throughout the country.  According to women themselves it is disparate and discriminatory on geographical grounds.  I would ask the IMA to co-operate fully in this.  I was rather depressed to read in a newspaper report this morning that the IMA have asked doctors not to return the forms which were sent to them in order to collect information for this survey.  If this is the case, I deplore it and I ask the doctors to see this matter in the context of health, not only of mothers but of the whole nation.  It is also a right which couples should have.</P>
    <P>I will end my contribution by drawing attention to the needs of women in the area of cancer prevention.  If the organisational, geographical and social criteria are met throughout the country, this disease can be diagnosed and treated in time.  A cancer screening unit set up in Hume Street some weeks ago, with little <Col N="2324" /> previous publicity, already had a waiting list up to February next.  That shows the incredible need for such cancer screening procedures.  I know the Minister will share my view that this type of screening should not be only on an urban base, available to the affluent and the educated, but should be available to everybody throughout the country.  The Minister may not have time to respond to these points but I should like him to think about them.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions on this Estimate and I will refer briefly to a number of points.  I have been very much struck by the fact during the past three years that in relation to health, public reality is very often quite different from perceived allegations about what is going on.  Recently in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> a great deal was written about the Tralee Hospital, that hip and knee implants had suddenly to cease as from the middle of October because the hospital had run out of money; consultants were leaving people in pain and no work could be done.  It was banner headlines in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> and politicains of all shapes and sizes and parties got up on their tippy toes and went berserk at this appalling situation.  A programme manager even wrote a letter to the Department of Health looking for £25,000 to buy this emergency equipment.  There were questions here on the Adjournment. Deputy McEllistrim was in a white tizzy about the situation.  What happened? The hospital has a budget of £9.7 million.  It is a new hospital and they did not carry out any orthopaedic work in 1984.  They began it in 1985 and have carried out about 104 operations.  There are about 80 people on the waiting list but that will be cleared relatively quickly. Somebody said that the things were going too well and it was about time it was stirred up: &ldquo;Let us give Deputy McEllistrim something to have a go at Desmond over&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I share the Deputy's concern but the renal dialysis unit in Limerick could have been opened last year with a little co-operation with the Department and now that the staff got the message over the last few months it is to be opened next Friday by the chairman of the health board.  I will be at the opening somewhat tongue in cheek because I made proposals to the health board 18 months ago on how this could be done and they have now been accepted.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that several units have been opened during my reign as Minister, including Letterkenny and Limerick.  Work on kidney dialysis has advanced considerably over the last few years.  We did not have a Supplementary Estimate in 1983 or 1984 because I decided that we would live within our allocation.  A sum of £9 million was spent on special pay awards which, quite correctly, were not included in the original Estimates because, if they had been, it would have given away our negotiating <Col N="2326" /> position.  The sum of £1 million for the Christmas bonus was never provided for in the Estimate.  When Deputy Haughey was Minister for Health he did not provide for it and it has always been regarded as an end of year adjustment.  We are well within our Estimate for 1985.  Earlier in the year the Southern Health Board claimed that they were facing disaster, that there would be redundancies, ward closures, patients queuing up for operations and so on.  These dire predictions did not come true and the same happened in relation to other health boards.  Some of them claimed that they would be short £5 million or £6 million but at the end of the year they were short of a mere £0.5 million.  Of course the situation is still very tight and will remain so next year. We are preoccupied with putting people into hospital and that is the problem.  Ten years ago when I was a Deputy there were 400,000 admissions to hospitals and this year there will be 600,000 admissions, 50 per cent more, although our population had not grown by that amount.  A number of people go into hospital unnecessarily for prolonged periods at a cost of £50 million per week as distinct from a mere £5 million spent on community care.  The vast bulk of the staff of health boards work in hospitals and if beds were properly used the system would be more efficient.  A great deal can be done in relation to health care and treatment without a person going into hospital.  There must be a sense of proportion in this regard.</P>
      <P>I do not accept the views expressed by Deputy Brady or Deputy O'Hanlon regarding Beaumont Hospital.  Events have passed us by.  The Mater Hospital propose to open, in March, a private wing with 150 beds.  It will be interesting to see how they will be able to finance it but I will not make any further comment on that.  It will also be very interesting to see how the VHI will cope regarding Blackrock, Calvary or the Mater in the weeks ahead but I predict that there will be very big surprises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is an old piece of propaganda that if a private hospital was built on the Beaumont campus it would not cost the <Col N="2327" /> taxpayer anything.  It is about time that that myth was exploded.  It simply means that the budget moneys for the public hospital in Beaumont would be proportionately diminished.  VHI money would not go into the public hospital because it would be siphoned off by a private company for profit.  Indeed, I am quite certain that consultants no longer want to build a private hospital because they are no longer viable and the VHI can no longer absorb that imposition.</P>
    <P>I wish to make a formal announcement now that from 1 January 1986 there will be an increase, approximately in line with inflation, for all hospitals.  The health board rates will increase from £83 to £88 and semi-private accommodation will increase from £60 to £63.5&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The county and voluntary non-teaching hospitals will also increase their rates in line with inflation from £63 to £67 and from £47 to £50 for semi-private.  There will be a very small increase in the rates in district hospitals from £31 to £32 and semi-private will increase from £24 to £25.  These are very modest increases in line with inflation.  I am extremely anxious that the Government's policy in relation to inflation should be adhered to as effectively as possible.</P>
      <P>Deputy O'Hanlon advocated the provision of more funds for preventive medicine and I agree with him.  In 1984 we provided £1.25 million for the Eastern Health Board, in 1985 we provided £1.75 million and the Book of Estimates for next year will be published next week.  I am precluded from commenting on the amount provided but I am maintaining that overall policy.  I want to assure Deputies that I have provided £2.5 million this year specifically for improvements in community services and it was from that allocation that provision was made for measles vaccinations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past three years we have spent about £160 million of capital <Col N="2328" /> moneys on the health services.  Many of our hospitals are far better equipped in terms of redevelopment and reconstruction. I can list a number of hospitals where major development has taken place.  Having served in this portfolio for three years I can say that this £160 million has been well invested and next year there will be a further major investment of capital money in our hospital services to make them more efficient and better places for patients and staff.</P>

    <Title>Supplementary Estimates, 1985. - Vote 38: Agriculture.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AustinDeasy" hpid="Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy) Austin Deasy">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Mr. Deasy)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission and for payment of certain subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This token estimate is required in order to make adjustments to the allocations for certain subheads, including some grants-in-aid, and to provide for expenditure on schemes introduced to assist farmers affected by the bad summer weather.  One of the main items being provided in this Supplementary Estimate is £3 million under subhead D.8 to meet the expenditure in this financial year on <Col N="2329" /> three new schemes designed to provide assistance to farmers with serious winter fodder problems.</P>
    <P>When it became clear by early August that a serious problem was going to arise for many farmers in securing sufficient fodder for their stock this winter I arranged for the introduction of a winter fodder scheme.  The object of the scheme was to induce farmers to make late cuts of silage to replace hay and silage lost as a result of the continuous rain.  The scheme consisted of two elements. Firstly, farmers with not more than 30 cows or 50 cattle were eligible for a subsidy of £35 for a tonne of high nitrogen fertiliser spread by them on grassland by early September.  Notwithstanding the early gloomy prognostications for this measure some 24,000 applications were received and the bulk of these have already been paid.  We are providing £650,000 to cover these payments.  There will be a small carry-over into the next financial year.</P>
    <P>The second element was the provision of grants for first time silage making. Under this measure a subsidy of £4 per tonne, subject to a maximum of 50 tonnes per farm, is payable to applicants from farms where silage had not previously been made.  The response to this part of the winter fodder scheme exceeded all expectations with some 33,000 farmers applying for the subsidy.  The total cost will be about £6 million and it is expected that some £1.7 million will be paid out in this financial year.  The balance of the payments will be made early in the new year.</P>
    <P>Flooding in the River Shannon Valley caused the loss of all or a substantial part of winter fodder supplies on many farms. Under a special aid scheme for the farmers concerned a sum of £20 per livestock unit up to a maximum of 25 livestock units per farmer, that is, a maximum payment of £500, was made available to people mainly dependent on farming and with not more than 60 livestock units.  Special arrangements were made for those who suffered crop losses from the flooding and they too could <Col N="2330" /> obtain payment of up to £500.  Applications were received from just over 2,000 farmers.  Processing of these is now well advanced and it is expected that most of them will be dealt with by 31 December.  The Supplementary Estimate includes £650,000 in respect of this measure.</P>
    <P>Of course, these schemes do not represent the totality of the measures which were introduced by the Government to assist farmers hit by the bad weather. There is also the countrywide feed voucher scheme providing assistance for farmers in difficulty to purchase winter feed.  This scheme will be financed by some £13 million from the Exchequer and 125,000 tonnes of intervention grain at 75 per cent of the intervention price from the EC.  We have received some 90,000 applications under this scheme.</P>
    <P>Last week I announced that I would also be introducing a scheme which will provide a 5 per cent interest subsidy on lendings of £40 million for tillage farmers who were badly affected by the bad weather.  The scheme will cover cereal and pea growers who have suffered serious income loss and also potato growers who have incurred major losses because of flooding &mdash; I want to stress that &mdash; potato growers who suffered losses because of flooding and not people who suffered losses as a result of something like potato blight.  Furthermore, producers whose crops were seriously damaged by the freak hail storm last July will also be eligible for aid under this scheme. The subsidy will be paid on individual loans of up to £10,000 and will operate retrospectively to cover producers who have already sown winter cereals.  Details of this scheme are still being worked out with the financial institutions.</P>
    <P>Turning now to subhead M.3. the additional sum of £9.6 million is to meet the payment of livestock headage grants under the disadvantaged areas schemes to an extra 20,000 applicants this year compared to previous years.  It seemed to me that we should do everything possible to bring forward the payment of headage grants in order to alleviate the effects of the bad weather.  The combined <Col N="2331" /> efforts of the Department's field staff and local office personnel have resulted in a record number of headage payments being processed this year and, in fact, some 90 per cent of applicants under the 1985 disadvantaged areas schemes will be paid before Christmas.  The staff concerned, indoor and outdoor, are to be congratulated on the tremendous efforts they have made to bring forward these payments which resulted from carrying out inspections.</P>
    <P>We have also accelerated non-vote payments of EC premium grants.  Under the 1985 suckler cow premium scheme, we have brought forward by five months payments to some 43,000 applicants who will get over £7 million before the end of 1985.  Under the 1985 ewe premium we succeeded recently in having the EC Commission fix an early advance and as a result some 17,000 applicants in the disadvantaged areas will be paid about £5 million by the end of the year.  All in all, between the disadvantaged areas schemes and the EC premium schemes, an extra £22 million in grants will be paid by the end of this year as compared with last year.  This makes a very substantial contribution to farmers' income and enables them to purchase winter feed. In particular, these arrangements should assist the majority of farmers with beef cows in the disadvantaged areas to retain their breeding stock over the winter and to qualify for the £70 beef cow grant next year as announced in the national plan.</P>
    <P>Under subhead D. 2 £1.4 million extra is provided in respect of payments under the calved heifer scheme.  This scheme ran for the three years 1982 to 1984 and resulted in an increase of 88,000 cows in the national herd.  The original provision, of £3.5 million for 1985 was intended to cover residual payments that would arise this year.  However, participation in the scheme in 1984 turned out to be higher than we had allowed for at the time the 1985 Estimate was finalised.  Total residual payments this year will, in fact, amount to £4.9 million and, as a result, an additional £1.4 million is now required.</P>
    <P>Additional sums totalling £2.781 <Col N="2332" /> million are being provided under subheads A.1, B.3 and B.12 to cover the cost of pay increases, mainly under the 24th round, for staff of the Department and of An Foras Talúntais and ACOT.</P>
    <P>Under subhead G.2 an additional sum of £336,000 is provided in respect of redundancy payments to 17 former employees of the statutory body, the Pigs and Bacon Commission, who were wound up in mid-1983.  These employees had been taken on by the industry-funded Pigs and Bacon Commission Limited when they commenced trading in August 1983.  The company ceased operations at the end of 1984.  My Department had liability for redundancy payments to these employees and the additional sum of £336,000 sought is for this purpose.</P>
    <P>Subhead M.5 covers losses arising on market intervention operations.  The original Estimate for this heading was £1.45 million and the new provision is £3.336 million.  The additional £1.886 million is required mainly to cover the cost to be borne by the Exchequer arising from the Commission's refusal to finance refunds on exports of certain dairy products by An Bord Bainne to third countries in 1981.  The question at issue is whether the export clearance of these products should have been carried out at the Irish ports or at a port of trans-shipment in another member state.  We are satisfied that export clearance at the Irish ports was in accordance with the arrangements approved by the Commission and that the refunds were properly payable to the board.  We have, accordingly, commenced legal proceedings in the European Court against the Commission.  In the meantime, however, the sum of about £2.28 million involved has to be paid to the Commission.</P>
    <P>The total of the additional amounts being provided in the Supplementary Estimate is £19 million.  This is being covered by corresponding savings on subhead M.4: Market Intervention &mdash; Incidental Expenses.  The amount voted for this subhead in 1985 was some £97 million but substantial savings have arisen because of lower levels of intervention stocks than had been anticipated and also <Col N="2333" /> because of lower interest charges than had been allowed for in respect of borrowings for the purchase of intervention products.</P>
    <P>I commend the adoption of this Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJNoonan" hpid="Mr. Noonan (Limerick West) Mr. Noonan (Limerick West)">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Noonan</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I wish to reiterate what has been said by the Minister concerning the staff of his Department, both indoor and outdoor, who are operating the various schemes which were introduced as a result of the disastrous summer.  We appreciate the work being done by the staff to ensure that the schemes are implemented. Although the payments are inadequate, we are anxious that they should reach the farmers as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister that some concern has been expressed by farmers that officials of the Department are not really concerned with the quality of the fodder used for livestock.  They seem more concerned about the quantity of fodder.  As the Minister knows, quality is far more important: a farmer could have a great quantity of fodder but it might be totally inadequate to meet the needs of his livestock during the winter.  I ask the Minister to consider this matter and to request his officials to review their attitude.</P>
      <P>With regard to the interest subsidy to grain farmers and crop farmers, the amount of £10,000 in respect of loans is inadequate.  It should be increased at least to £15,000.  I ask the Minister to clarify if the loan will be applicable only on a once-off basis or if it will apply in subsequent years.  The damage suffered by farmers will affect them for a number of years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I commend the Minister for accelerating payment of the EC premium grants. Some weeks ago I put forward a proposal that grants should be increased to the maximum allowed by the EC on a once-off basis.  This would give an immediate cash flow to the farmers who have suffered losses.  Unfortunately the Minister did not accede to my request.  I do not agree, because most of the costs would be borne by the EC, and there would be <Col N="2334" /> resultant benefit not only for farmers, but for the economy in general.  Even at this late stage I urge the Minister to look again at this scheme.  The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Under the 1985 ewe premium we succeeded recently in having the EC Commission fix an early advance and as a result some 17,000 applicants in the disadvantaged areas will be paid about £5 million by the end of the year. All in all, between the disadvantaged areas schemes and the EC premium schemes, an extra £22 million in grants will be paid by the end of this year as compared with last year.</P>
    <P>I understand that we do not need EC permission to pay these premiums.  At present sheep farmers are owed money by the Department.  The sheep marketing year has been changed and I should like to know how arrears in payment will affect sheep farmers.</P>
    <P>My party always have welcomed increases in the number of breeding stock, particularly in the cow beef numbers. That herd has been reduced drastically. The proposals in <i>Building on Reality</i> included a £70 grant and this is much needed, something that should have been given three years ago.  The Minister spoke about the calf heifer scheme, another benefit introduced by Fianna Fáil.  He said that, as a result of that scheme, there had been an increase of 88,000 cows in the national herd.  That scheme is partially financed by the EC and it is of immense benefit not only to farmers but to our general economy. Surely, it was shortsighted of the Minister to withdraw that scheme.  I am sorry to say that agriculture as an industry has been and is being created as a poor relation by this Government.</P>
    <P>In subhead A, sums totalling £2.8 million will be provided for staff, among other things.  In the Department of Agriculture we have some of the finest civil servants in the world.  This applies also to ACOT and An Foras Talúntais where we have scientists and other experts who know their jobs.  All that is required in the Department is political direction. <Col N="2335" /> Then we could have greater development of the industry.  Many of those civil servants, from the Secretary down, are men of ability and integrity who know what is needed to develop the industry.</P>

      <P>
        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I accept that.  However, I want to emphasise that there is lack of political leadership, and the entire industry is suffering because there is not a cohesive plan.  The civil servants have a vital role to play.  I do not agree that the industry should work towards its own needs and interests or that the people engaged in the industry should determine their own guidelines. The Government and the political head of the Department have a mandate from the people to provide the leadership and the guidelines and to provide a coherent policy for agricultural development.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Subhead G.2 relates to the Pigs and Bacon Commission and here I wish to refer briefly to the pig industry.  We are fortunate in that we have some of the most efficient pig producers in the world but regrettably that performance is not matched by other branches of the industry. There is widespread spare capacity in the factories while standards in the factories are not as high as they might be. Marketing in this area is far below the <Col N="2336" /> optimum level.  There is a great need to rationalise the industry at factory level. We cannot allow a situation to continue where there is a difference at times of upwards of £9 per pig in terms of pigs shipped to Britain from here compared with the prices fetched on the same market by the Danes for their products. The time has come when hard decisions will have to be made to save the pig industry.  Many jobs are at risk in this sector.  We must face the problems in consultation with all those concerned and especially with the trade union movement.</P>
    <P>As spokesman for agriculture for my party I will be bringing forward in the very near future plans for a positive developmental role for the pig industry. We realise the need for the development of this industry, development that would provide many job opportunities both on and off the farm.  Therefore I am very much involved in the production of a worthwhile policy for the promotion of the pig industry.  There are many openings for the sale of pigmeat even on the home market but we must adopt a more positive and aggressive role in the matter of the export of our pig meat.  The leadership and the guidelines must come from the Department first and then from all those involved in the industry.</P>

The Minister tells us that we have commenced legal proceedings in the European Court against the Commission and that the outcome of these proceedings would mean payment to us through the Commission of about £2.28 million.  Is the Minister optimistic as to the outcome of this case and if we are successful will the amount be refunded to the Exchequer?  Can he tell us, too, whether it is customary for interest to be paid by the EC in such cases?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As this is a very confined debate I shall address my remarks only to those items <Col N="2337" /> referred to by the Minister.  I wish particular to make reference to the reluctance generally on the part of the Government to accept the fact that agriculture forms the basis of the country's wealth.  I may have criticised the Minister for Agriculture in the past and rightly so but we must give credit also where credit is due.  I realise that the Minister is working under difficult conditions to the extent that there is a bias against agriculture within the Cabinet but he is learning fast. He is appraising himself of all aspects of the industry.  Some recent announcements by him have shown a surprisingly good knowledge of the industry.  I refer particularly to those instances in which he departs from the supplied brief and speaks as his own man, as it were.  He is learning so fast that he is likely within a very short time to catch up with the Minister of State, Deputy Hegarty, in his knowledge of agricultural matters.  I have some concern regarding the bovine TB eradication scheme.</P>

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> More freedom should be available to the chief veterinary officer in each county with regard to the partial depopulation of herds.  This refers also to the brucellosis eradication scheme.  I understand that a decision with regard to the partial depopulation of herds must be made by the administrative section of the Department rather than by the technical people. If the technical people who are aware of the needs of the locality are denied that, it will slow down the process.  I pay tribute to those people for the approach they are adopting.  The Minister has given a commitment, somewhat late, and I hope moneys will be made available to attack this disease.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2338" /> I now turn to the delay in tackling the problems which arose as a result of the disastrous weather conditions this summer.  The consequences are severe for the whole farming industry, I said at the beginning that the schemes were inadequate and did not meet even in a small way all these various problems.  But for the prompting of the farming organisations and this party, the Government would be very slow to bring in any scheme, but this one is both inadequate and restrictive.  The officers in the field are concentrating on quantity of fodder rather than quality and this has caused a certain amount of resentment amongst farmers most affected.  No amount of poor quality fodder will compensate for quality fodder.</P>
    <P>The Shannon Valley scheme is totally inadequate and farmers are still in doubt as to whether they will qualify for benefit from the fodder scheme.  It is appropriate that the Minister should clarify the eligibility of farmers in this area.  They would appreciate an early positive response to the dilemma in which they find themselves. My opinion is that they should be allowed to participate in the scheme because they have suffered from the disastrous summer weather.</P>
    <P>A new look must be taken at the direction which agriculture will take in the future.  I understand the Minister set up a committee recently to examine ACOT, An Foras Talúntais and farm development services.  When are we likely to have the report of this committee?  When will it be published?  There is widespread concern within these bodies about their future and the proposals contained in the report.  I hope they will be positive and that the Minister will implement them.</P>
    <P>There must be greater coherence and direction in agricultural development. The research arm of agriculture is increasingly vital.  We have achieved much in agricultural research but we must move now into to a new area.  Perhaps the Agricultural Institute are the body who should do this.  The dairy and food industry needs an organisation who will carry out aggressive and positive research and development.  We must consider the <Col N="2339" /> development of new products and whether the products already being produced are meeting consumer demands. There is consumer resistance to fat in dairy products.</P>

      <P>I knew that the Deputy might have difficulty in understanding my intervention and for that reason I looked at the Book of Precedents.

        <i>(Limerick West):</i> I accept that.  I hope to be in a position to bring forward proposals very soon with regard to the development of An Foras Talúntais in the research and development section. The Department of Agriculture and many other parts of the agricultural industry, being guided at present by other Departments, will have a vital role to play in that aspect of development in the future.</P>
      <P>While I may have disgressed at times, were I to confine myself to the strict criteria you have just read out, Sir, I could talk only about whether the Minister or Minister of State was adequately paid or compensated for the job they are doing.</P>
      <P>I hope the Minister will react positively to the few proposals I have put to him.  I like to give credit where it is due and by that I mean I hope the Minister of State will continue to be his own man in the development of this vital industry to our economy.</P>

      <P>To respond to the very positive contribution of Deputy Noonan, I should say I have noted what he said about the Shannon Valley, including what he had to say about participants in the fodder feed voucher scheme.  We are looking into the possibility of doing that.  Probably within a week or so I will be able to respond to the Deputy on that <Col N="2340" /> point.  I should say that, of course, fodder quality is a problem.  In that respect we had to depend a lot on the farmer himself because, in order to get the scheme moving and feed vouchers issued, it was not possible to examine every block of silage, hay of whatever.  Therefore we were really dependent on what the farmer said himself.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, under the farm development service.  Normally there is a very good relationship between them.  If there are variable or controversial cases with which the Deputy is familiar, if he will inform us, we shall have them examined.</P>
      <P>I should say we are optimistic about the court case.  Certainly we believe we are entitled to this refund.  The Deputy mentioned interest rates and so on.  Again that would be a matter for the courts but we are optimistic about the outcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy mentioned the £10,000 limit.  Of course it should be £15,000 or perhaps £20,000.  However, the Deputy will readily appreciate that the amount of money available to us would have meant that fewer people would qualify.  We thought we were achieving a reasonable balance.  For instance, the IFA were <Col N="2341" /> asking for something like £50 million whereas our total package would be upwards of £40 million.  There are many schemes involved &mdash; nitrogen, silage and so on.  I believe our endeavours constituted a fair effort on the part of a small country to achieve so much all in one year.  Let me hope that this will not happen again.  In weather terms it has been the most extreme year we have ever experienced.  The Deputy will appreciate that no Government could continue to give that level of support year in, year out.  I believe we were reasonably generous in what we gave.</P>
    <P>With regard to the marketing year <i>vis-à-vis</i> the ewe premium, the Deputy will appreciate that that premium could not be paid until the Commission had determined the amount.  From next year onwards the sheep marketing year will commence on 1 January instead of 1 April, which means that the current marketing year will be comprised of nine months only.  I am sure the Deputy will be glad to know that steps are being taken to ensure that the appropriate premiums will be paid for the shorter year.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with the Deputy in what he had to say with regard to the pig industry. The Deputy is probably aware that we are making a great effort to improve the whole of the slaughtering scene. Every encouragement is being given to factories to improve and rationalise. Probably the Deputy is familiar with the Munster scene where we are endeavouring to devise some sort of centralised slaughtering, an effort in which the IDA have been co-operating with us.  A small number of centralised slaughtering facilities have been established.  I believe the need for that will grow because of the swing away from beef towards pigmeat and is something for which we must gear ourselves.  I noted the Deputy's remarks about the bovine TB eradication scheme.</P>
    <P>I think that broadly covers the points the Deputy made.  I might associate myself with the Deputy's compliments to the Department, the well deserved tributes.  Whatever about other Departments I am sure nobody on any side of the House could find fault with any of <Col N="2342" /> our officers.  They work extremely hard, very often without much credit being given to them.  They do a lot of slogging behind the scenes for our Minister when he goes abroad, particularly to fight cases in Europe.  We must rely very heavily on their expertise.  Therefore I am indeed proud to be associated with those tributes.</P>
    <P>I also share Deputy Noonan's concern about maintaining the high quality in ACOT and An Foras Talúntais.  Looking into the future there is no doubt that alternatives will have to be found for our farmers, alternatives such as flax, such as the development of cottage home cheeses.  For example I might say that we produce 30 per cent only of our honey. We still import a tremendous quantity of apples and of potato chips and all these areas will have to be examined.  The people best equipped to examine new projects are those in An Foras Talúntais, ACOT and the officers of our Department. We hope we shall be able to encourage them to give us a lead in those areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Communications and certain other services administered by that Office, for a cost alleviation payment and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of 1985 the House has had opportunities for debate on the Estimate for the Department of Communications and on a number of major pieces of legislation relating to the affairs of the Department.  In the circumstances I propose to be brief in my remarks on the purposes for which this Supplementary <Col N="2343" /> Estimate is required.  As Deputies will have noted, this Estimate is a token Estimate for £1,000.  It arises principally to provide additional sums under subheads E and F. 1 and to provide for a new subhead. While the total additional amount required under these subheads amounts to £4,870,000 there is an offset of £2,480,000 in savings on other subheads and increased Appropriations-in-Aid of £2,389,000.</P>
    <P>A sum of £3 million is required under subhead E &mdash; Grants for Harbours &mdash; in respect of grant assistance to the Dublin Port and Docks Board. This arises from the Government's decision in May last to provide the board with grant assistance of £3 million in each of the years 1985, 1986 and 1987 as part of a rescue package to restore the port to financial viability. This matter has been dealt with at some length in the House recently.  I would refer Deputies to the Official Report of 12 and 13 November 1985 &mdash; columns 1942-1970 volume 361 and columns 2215-2256 volume 361 respectively.  Accordingly, I do not propose to go over the ground in detail at this time.</P>
    <P>Briefly the position is that Dublin port has been in a critical financial position for some time.  This has come about for a number of reasons.  The port has, of course, been affected by the economic position and by a fall in certain trades such as oil.  The involvement of the port board through their subsidiary, Dublin Cargo Handling Limited, in stevedoring services has seriously affected the financial position and this situation has been aggravated by industrial relations problems which have caused interruptions and closures.</P>
    <P>Last May, the Government decided on a financial rescue package for the board comprised of grant assistance of £3 million in each of the years 1985, 1986, and 1987; a State guarantee of borrowing up to £7 million and a requirement for the board to take cost cutting and revenue increasing measures and to dispose of assets.</P>
    <P>The State assistance was contingent on the conclusion of negotiations between <Col N="2344" /> Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the dock labour force.  Industrial peace at the port is vital if the port is to prosper.</P>
    <P>I am pleased to say that the major elements of the rescue package have now fallen into place.  I cannot stress too often, however, that restoration of financial stability to the port and docks board will take a little time and is a task which calls for sustained commitment on the part of all those involved.</P>
    <P>The additional sum of £1 million provided under subhead F.1 &mdash; the grant-in-aid to RTE &mdash; equivalent to net receipts from broadcasting licence fees is a technical requirement to enable the amount equivalent to the actual net receipts collected in 1985 to be paid over to RTE.  It is expected that up to £1 million more will be realised in 1985 over the original Estimate of £33 million.</P>
    <P>An additional amount of £450,000 is likely to be required under subhead V &mdash; Payments for bulk carrier &mdash; to meet the essential care and maintenance costs of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> which is berthed in Marseilles pending the final disposition of the vessel which I expect to be settled very shortly.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year I had occasion to introduce a Supplementary Estimate to enable <i>ex-gratia</i> payments to be made to pensioners of Irish Shipping Limited who had service abroad Irish Ships of the company during World War II and who had formerly been in receipt of such payments from the company.  I am glad to say that the Government have decided to extend this concession to all pensioners who had been in receipt of <i>ex-gratia</i> payments from Irish Shipping Limited.  An additional sum of £39,000 will be required to meet the additional expenditure.</P>
    <P>An additional amount of £180,000 is provided under subhead B.2 which will enable the Meteorological Service to purchase a replacement communications computer system: (1) to meet international obligations for the provision/reception of data and (2) to supply essential meteorological reports and forecasts, scientific advice and so on to aviation and other interests, agriculture, marine, industry and so on.  Three <Col N="2345" /> other excesses are foreseen on subheads A.3, B.3 and D.1.  On subhead A.3 an excess of £40,000 is likely to meet: (i) the administrative costs of the Postal and Telecommunications Users Councils and (ii) the expenses of the interim Local Radio Commission.  The costs of the two councils are recouped from An Post and BTE.  The expenses of the commission amount to about £15,000 in 1985.</P>
    <P>On subhead B.3 an additional amount of £60,000 is required to meet the increased costs of postal and telecommunications services for which no provision was made in the original estimate.</P>
    <P>On subhead D.1 an increase of £100,000 is foreseen in the CIE subvention to meet interest charges arising on borrowings by CIE to purchase buses from GAC (Ireland) Ltd.  In March 1985 the Government authorised additional borrowings by CIE of £10 million, non-Exchequer funds, for the purchase of buses and also decided that any extra financial charges incurred on the additional borrowings would be recouped to CIE out of the Vote for this Department. The interest charge arising in 1985 is likely to reach £100,000.</P>
    <P>The new subhead, subhead Y, for which £1,000 is being provided is a token subhead, required to enable the Department of Communications to meet certain residual liabilities from the vesting of the postal and telecommunications services into State companies and the abolition of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. At this stage the bank account of the former Minister for Posts and Telegraphs is still being operated to honour cheques and warrants drawn before 31 December 1983 but not yet cashed.  The total amount in respect of such outstanding cheques and warrants amounts to £181,000 approximately.  It is expected that the bulk of this amount may never be claimed.  The intention is to close the bank account at the end of this year and to surrender the balance to the Exchequer. Cheques outstanding when presented for payment will thereafter be met from this Department's Vote.  I commend the Supplementary Estimate to the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret that the Minister has not been able to come in.  The Minister for the Environment has not indicated to us why the Minister for Communications is not present at this serious time for the transport and communications sectors generally.  There is a Minister of State attached to that Department but we did not get either.  I will start by commenting on subhead X where a paltry sum has been made available for the former workers of Irish Shipping.  That problem has been aired in the House with a certain intensity, especially from this side of the House which regards itself as the creator of the company, and from backbenchers on the Government side.  In my experience in public life as a Minister and a TD I do not think I have ever had the privilege of being canvassed for support by a more dignified, humane, sophisticated and, eventually effective lobby than that of the former employees of Irish Shipping who suffered grievious wrong at the hands of the Government.  I accept I cannot spend a lot of time on this but this side of the House does not regard as any way adequate what has been done for the people involved.  The fact that they are behaving in such a dignified way, persistent yes, but always with dignity, is a tribute to them and to their ethos developed from the war years to the present time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have a desk full of representations from them all argued on the grounds of justice and humanity.  For the purpose of this debate I dipped in and took out one letter at random and I will refer to it.  The husband of the woman who wrote to me worked for the company for 25 years and his redundancy payment was £3,700. That woman listed parallels from the public service to point up the strength of her argument.  She pointed out that the chairman of Irish Shipping, go ndeanfaidh Dia trocaire air, got £66,000 which was approved by the Minister.  In the case of the workers at Verolme Dockyard which was 48 per cent State owned the corresponding figure her husband would have got under the same conditions would be £38,000.  The NET workers were paid five weeks pay per year of <Col N="2347" /> service and the Minister, Deputy Kavanagh, was the one who extended it by three weeks.  In those circumstances her husband would have received £48,250.  In the case of the Dublin Port and Docks Board where, as the Minister mentioned a reorganisation job has been afoot for some time, a redundant worker with this women's husband's amount of pay and service would have got £30,000.</P>
    <P>I should like to withdraw what I said about the Minister and the NET workers; it was the Avoca Mines that Minister Kavanagh was involved in.  The corresponding figure in that case would have been £32,665.  The corresponding figure as far as Irish Steel was concerned would be £23,000.</P>
    <P>As well as that the people involved found themselves in a position that they were not able to pay continuing insurance policies where premiums were as high as £1,600 per annum.  I know that in this House there is a sense of justice and a sense of fair play but there is, unfortunately, at times a tendency to listen to the person who breaks down the door.</P>
    <P>It is on the basis that this is altogether a different kettle of fish that I am appealing to the Government, through the Minister present, and to the House, to see to it that some attempt is made to remedy the injustice under which these people have suffered.  This is a well argued letter and an individual is mentioned whose name I shall not give to the House to whom a gratuity and pension have been paid, who was in the public service and was asked to retire.  The writer makes a very strong point about the taxpayers' money with regard to the AIB-ICI payment, one of our large financial institutions. If this House does not decide, in all justice and equity, to do something about those workers it will be a sad day. I shall not go into the history of the company because the House knows it very well.  It has been repeatedly debated and discussed.  If the House does not do that, this House is not worthy of those who manned our ships during the war and provided us at times with a meagre ration <Col N="2348" /> of goods at risk to their own lives and many of their comrades did die.</P>
    <P>I come to subhead V &mdash; the <i>Irish Spruce,</i> simply because it is linked into the same situation.  I asked a series of supplementary questions on 14 November in the House.  The Minister of State at the Department of Communications was present instead of the Minister. I am not criticising the Minister of State but he did not have the details to allow him to reply on that date.  This morning I received a letter from the Minister for Communications referring to those supplementary questions and supplying me with answers.  The first question was: did the <i>Irish Spruce</i> become the property of the Japanese company on 11 January 1983?  The Minister's answer was: Yes.  The second question was: was this for a consideration from the Japanese of £26.5 million sterling?  The answer to that was: Yes.</P>
    <P>The third question was: who got the money?  I asked did the ISL or the liquidator get it, or did it leave the Japanese pocket at all.  The answer was that none of these got it, that the money was paid to Verolme Cork Dockyard.  The fourth question was: did Irish Shipping Limited lease the <i>Irish Spruce</i> back at £4.9 million per annum over 15 years?  The answer to that was: Yes, under the lease annual payments were set at the yen equivalent of £4.9 million per annum for 15 years. The fifth question was: when the 15 year lease period is over, who will own the <i>Irish Spruce?</i> This is a very important question.  The answer given was as follows: if the lease had run its full course the ownership of the vessel would have passed to Merrion Ferry Tours Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Irish Shipping Limited.  The lease has, however, been repudiated by the Irish Shipping Limited liquidator and the final disposition of the vessel remains to be settled.</P>
    <P>One very important question arises from that.  The division of responsibility with regard to the financing arrangements was as follows: Irish Shipping Limited were to be responsible for 25 per cent; on the Vote for the Department for Communications there was another 25 <Col N="2349" /> per cent; on the Vote for the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism there was 50 per cent.  If Mr. Tempany repudiated the lease as far as Irish Shipping Limited are concerned, who is responsible for the Irish Shipping Limited pay back?  I know there may be a difficulty about replying today and I should be pleased to get a reply in the form of a letter, as I did to my previous supplementary questions, but I should like to get it more quickly than that.  If Mr. Tempany as liquidator has repudiated the lease, upon whom has fallen the responsibility for the 25 per cent payment for which Irish Shipping Limited were responsible? While I am at it, I may as well ask what about the Department of Communications. We have before us a figure which is why I am talking about the Department here.  Is the responsibility still at 25 per cent, or have they to take on the greater share?  I ask the same question about the responsibility of the Department for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism who were responsible for 50 per cent.</P>
    <P>Basic to our approach to this matter has been the desire to have a deep sea fleet, Irish owned.  I said I was not particularly hung up on having it State owned, although in the circumstances it appears now that that is the most likely way of having one at all.  Incidentally, it is not a bad time to be in the market for buying ships because there are good bargains going.  There should be a deep sea fleet, State owned or privately owned, or a combination of these.  I am already on record in the House on that point.  I know a study was conducted in the Department on the desirability and feasibility of a deep sea fleet and I gather they came down positively on the side of having one. One point made was that they rather favoured the handy size rather than the larger vessel for a deep sea fleet.  If it is intended, as it was originally, to carry coal across the Atlantic to Moneypoint, then the recommendation on the handy size would not be at all economical, practical or feasible.  I would appreciate some elucidation of the position of the Minister and the Government on that.</P>
    <P>I had consultation with some people in <Col N="2350" /> this area of business.  If we had a positive decision to start developing again a deep sea fleet, then we would be in a position to have a forward look at it and would be able to contribute by a debate in this House.  The tonnage recommended, of 150,000, was somewhat lower than what we had been talking about &mdash; 200,000 tonnes.  The point is that as of now we do not know where we are and we do not know what the future holds.  I have been asking when the liquidation proceedings will be finalised.  It is important to know. The legal implications of the establishment of another State owned company are important.  The quicker the liquidation proceedings are brought to an end the clearer the air will be and the better will be the opportunity to make decisions on the development of a deep sea fleet.</P>
    <P>On subhead D.1 the Minister has put down £115 million plus £100,000 for the grant to CIE.  I would have welcomed a more explicit statement on CIE.  One of the difficulties is that when questions are put down about the activities of CIE the chances are 100 to 1 against their being accepted.  On 12 November I got a letter from the Chair &mdash; I am not criticising the Chair but simply stating a fact &mdash; saying he regretted tht he had to disallow part of the question addressed by me to the Minister for Communications asking for the timetable for the appointment of executives for the new CIE structures and saying that this was a matter for CIE themselves and that the Minister had no official responsibility to the Dáil in relation to it.</P>
    <P>We have got into a rut with regard to semi-State companies.  When the subsidy from the House was a small proportion of the total finances of semi-State companies, that kind of answer was acceptable. That is no longer the case.  In the case of CIE where £115 million plus £100,000 are being voted by this House, there should be available to the House and to the public the fullest possible account of the activities of CIE.  I could mention half a dozen more questions which were disallowed.  In one question <Col N="2351" /> I wanted to know how the new bus company was structured.  The Bombardier company had pulled out and the GAC had come in and I asked a question about it and I could not be answered.  If there was a sound commercial or financial reason, if this company was in international competition and if giving too much information about it and its workings could damage its activities, then I could see a reason for the refusal.  That is not so.  CIE borrowed £10 million with the permission of the Minister who is agreeing to pay £100,000 interest on it.  All those operations should be opened to scrutiny in the House.  The Committee on Public Expenditure were established by this House and may be able to probe all those areas, but that is not enough. The fullest information about the activities of the company should be available to the House and to the media.</P>
    <P>In the early days when many of the State companies and bodies were established by the late Seán Lemass his reasons for keeping this House out of them for the most part were to give them a chance to operate without interference which would have harmed them financially.  It is still important that they should be allowed to develop themselves fully commercially but if their operations need heavy subsidisation the whole area should be probed and fully open to the House and the media.</P>
    <P>In relation to the problem with the one person buses, if there is a big loss in the Dublin city services the Minister will have to come back to this House to vote the money.  That is a very serious problem. Yesterday the Minister for Labour displayed an open-mindedness and commitment to try to solve the problem and I said in the House that I detected a certain machismo on both sides in relation to this dispute.  It is an Irish characteristic.  There was a strike in Dún Laoghaire that went on for 35 or 40 years in Downeys public house.  The ownership of the pub changed several times in the meantime but the man picketed officially outside for all those years and they used to bring him out a pint on each anniversary.  There is <Col N="2352" /> a certain amount of that in all of us; we do not want to be downfaced.  If somebody is trying to best us we get tough and rigid.</P>
    <P>For that reason if the concessions recommended by the Labour Court are not acceptable to the management and the unions there might be a possibility of bringing in the strong and efficient industrial relations departments in UCD under Professor Brian Hillery and in Trinity College under Professor McCarthy, both of whom have considerable sophistication in this area.  I am not criticising the Labour Court but we should all try desperately to find a way out of this difficulty particularly in the run up to Christmas.  Deputy Ahern mentioned that business in the centre city is suffering badly because people who traditionally come to the centre city are not able to get in.  That will get worse if there is not a resolution before 25 December.  I ask the Minister once more to make one final strong pitch to see if he can resolve the problem before it gets worse.  I know the Minister is circumscribed but at all times of one follows the rules too closely one will not get anywhere.</P>
    <P>With regard to the harbours, I gather that next week the Minister will be bringing an order before the House under the State Guarantees Act and we will have an opportunity to have a further discussion on Dublin port and docks.  The Minister rightly says that we had a very wide-ranging discussion on this recently and he gives quotations in his speech.  I wish to comment on the grant in respect of harbours.  The management &mdash; something to which I have already referred &mdash; criticised the Fianna Fáil Government with regard to the Dublin Port and Docks area and the proposition which the Fianna Fáil Government made in regard to it in 1982.  I repudiate that criticism as there was never any question of Fianna Fáil acquiring that site for less than its market value. The management of the port and docks board and Dublin Cargo Handling Limited should not try to find a scapegoat for bad decisions.  The Dublin Cargo Handling Limited venture was a disaster.  There has been a considerable improvement and I got a letter from the <Col N="2353" /> Minister the other day giving a list of the people now employed there.  I received a letter from him earlier purporting to give the list of those employed but in fact it was a list of those who had opted for redundancy.</P>
    <P>There is an opportunity for development in the port.  I will not repeat the substance of the debate here but it is not so long since everybody was delighted with the way the Dublin Port and Docks Board handled their business.  There was no question of coming to this House looking for money, they paid their own way.  I remember a former Deputy, Seán Moore, who was a member of that board for a long time.  The management of Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the workers seriously damaged Dublin port. Of course there was a spin-off for other ports but the port in the capital city should be something special and now it has another chance.  I recall the criticism occasionally launched at this side of the House by the Government side in regard to investment and if we wished to invest a sum of £9 million we would be told that Fianna Fáil were too flush with funds, etc.  However, we will be debating that next week and I will not make any further comment on it because we now have to decide whether they are entitled to borrow a sum of £7 million.</P>
    <P>The whole thrust of the arguments from the Government side &mdash; and from the Opposition &mdash; is that it is an area capable of development along the lines which I mentioned in a Private Members' motion which was discussed earlier.</P>
    <P>The Minister also said:</P>
    <P>An additional amount of £450,000 is likely to be required under subhead V &mdash; Payments for bulk carrier to meet the essential care and maintenance costs of the <i>Irish Spurce</i> which is berthed in Marseilles pending the final disposition of the vessel which I expect to be settled very shortly.</P>
    <P>What does that mean?  Is the <i>Irish Spruce</i> for sale and, if so, who is selling it?  Is it being adopted as a base unit for a new Irish deep sea fleet?  Must disposal await finalisation of liquidation proceedings? <Col N="2354" /> The Minister has not given sufficient information.  I have already asked a number of questions about responsibility for the yearly payments, a quarter of which have been repudiated by the official liquidator.  I am not saying this aggressively but I should like the Minister to expand on that sentence because at the moment it is tantalising.</P>
    <P>I am glad that the Minister is giving extra money to the meteorological service because, although their work is taken for granted, sailors, farmers and so on rely very heavily on them.  They are in the news at present of course because of Halley's Comet.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden, unfortunately, could not be here to deal with the postal and telecommunications part of the Estimate. I am a little dissatisfied with the paragraph which reads as follows:</P>
    <P>On subhead B.3 an additional amount of £60,000 is required to meet the increased costs of postal and telecommunications services, for which no provision was made in the original Estimate.</P>
    <P>Does that mean that more services will be provided or that there will be more money for the same service?  It is very interesting to note that the old account of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs is still in operation to honour cheques and warrants drawn before 31 December 1983 but not yet cashed.  I note that the Minister will put an end to this account very shortly but these people who are holding cheques are very trusting&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>They are unlikely to be absentminded about something like that but Irish Shipping would have got a land if they had been as trusting.  I hope the Minister will address himself to the questions I asked about Irish Shipping as the workers in that company have been very badly treated.  They are not whining but they have good reasons for thinking that they were badly treated.  I should also <Col N="2355" /> like information on the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and I particularly want the Minister to expand on its disposal.  What kind of money is involved and what are the ramifications <i>vis-à-vis</i> the liquidator and the various guarantors?</P>
      <P>Without damaging himself or the Department, I hope that the Minister will make one autonomous, spontaneous gesture in regard to CIE and their obligations to the community.</P>
      <P>I mentioned how muzzled we are at times and, because of the changed circumstances I mentioned, I think we should bring this to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges in order to ensure that more information is made available to this House.  I would like the six months repeat question to be done away with, now that we have a different system for Question Time.  We are in the old rut and have not thought this through. Three months would be sufficient from now on.</P>
      <P>The Minister referred mainly to Dublin port and I will confine my remarks to that, but there is a much wider area we could discuss.  I know some kind of study about the harbours is being carried out, the development of Ringaskiddy and its importance for a benighted Cork city where the economy has almost ground to a standstill.</P>
      <P>Mainly because of the inadequacy of the money provided for Irish Shipping Limited staff and because of the lack of substantive information about the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and the deep sea fleet, I am inclined to oppose the Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I apologise that I was not here to move the Estimate because of other business but I am very happy to be here to reply to Deputy Wilson's constructive contribution.  I will try to reply to the points he raised as fully as circumstances permit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>First, I will deal with CIE.  As a previous Minister, clearly Deputy Wilson understands the relative role of Ministers <Col N="2356" /> on the one hand and boards and management on the other, and the fact that a Minister is circumscribed, but that in itself is not a bad thing.  Too often in the past the rules were broken and almost always with adverse consequences for the company concerned.  By that I mean not just the financial performance of the company, but the interests of the employees. It is easy to have rules and to take policy stands during the good times, but it is not easy to stand by those policy decisions which have served well when the pressure is on.  Once there is a strike there is a lot of pressure on Ministers to have the strike settled, almost regardless of the consequences. People do not say, &ldquo;regardless of the consequences&rdquo; but it is implicit in what they say.</P>
    <P>I want to reiterate my position.  I very much regret that there is a dispute in CIE and that it has not been found possible by the management and unions to come to an acceptable agreement.  I am also very sorry that the unions have not found it possible to accept the Labour Court recommendations.  I am very sorry that the Labour Court have given the impression that they can make recommendations and if they are not liked that they are prepared to change them.  That undermines the Labour Court itself.  I hope the dispute in CIE can be brought to a speedy and satisfactory conclusion for both sides.  The Minister for Labour who is responsible for industrial relations, said yesterday that he will keep under review how best the industrial relations machinery of the State can be used to bring about a satisfactory solution. It is particularly regrettable that there is a dispute in the days up to Christmas because of the adverse consequences this can have for many people who want to do their Christmas shopping. For that reason alone I want to reiterate the unanimous wish of this House that both sides will make a strenuous effort to bring this dispute to a satisfactory conclusion.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong for this House to push either side into a settlement which was not satisfactory or which did not <Col N="2357" /> bring the benefits which the overall package was designed to achieve.  For instance, if as a result of changes in the package there were no reductions in bus fares, that would be wrong.  If as a result of a change in the package there was no saving to CIE, that would be wrong.  If as a result of a change in the package there were no benefits for the workforce, that too would be wrong.  Of the £11.6 million per year reckoned to be saveable after the fourth year, more than £6 million will go to the workers and the rest will be shared by the fare paying public and CIE, and in due course the taxpayer. There is no room left for change.  It is important that under pressure of immediate events we do not force a settlement which is not satisfactory but that does not diminish the desire, clearly expressed on all sides of this House, for a speedy settlement of the dispute on a satisfactory basis.</P>
    <P>There have been very significant achievements in CIE in the past few years.  Tomorrow is my third anniversary as Minister, first of Transport and now of Communications.  In my view I should not tire of highlighting what went on in CIE during the 15 years before I became Minister.  In 1969 the deficit rose from about £3.5 million to £109.2 million in 1982.  In nominal terms that was a rise approximately 30 times and in real terms the increase amounted to seven times the rate of inflation.  Should we not be asking how this happened?  Should there not be inquiries as to why that happened? Should there not be widespread appreciation of the fact that since 1982 that position has been changed and the deficit has fallen by about 25 per cent in real terms? Instead of increasing by one and one-half or one and three-quarter times the rate of inflation, in the past three years the deficit has come down in real terms, each year, including this year up to the end of November.  We do not know what effect this dispute will have on the final figure. The deficit this year will be of the order of £104 million which is more than £5 million less than in 1982 and if you allow for inflation in the years 1983, 1984 and 1985, you will see the reduction in real <Col N="2358" /> terms.  If you compare this figure with the trend which had been there before I became Minister you will see that improvement is even more astounding.  I do not say that in boastful way, but because we need to be reminded of this fact.  Deputies, the management of CIE and the general public who use and pay for CIE, either through fares or taxes, must realise that there has been a big turn round in the position but there is still a long distance to go.  There is no room for complacency.  What has been done has been achieved without any massive disruption or cuts in services and without any loss of jobs and everyone in CIE should be encouraged by that.</P>
    <P>When people call the Minister hard line because he will not intervene, they misunderstand the situation.  I was a shop steward and a branch officer of a union for many years and I was shadow spokesman for Labour in this House for four years.  I understand very well the processes of industrial relations; I know how they work and do not work and how to mess them up.  If a Minister constantly intervenes, thus undermining the procedures laid down, that is a recipe for disaster.  That is one of the reasons CIE got into such a mess up to 1982.  Any time there was a strike Ministers rushed in to be popular and to be seen to act, regardless of the cost.  That was not the only way Ministers intervened.</P>
    <P>Constant deputations in respect of proposed cuts in bus services and constant interference in the day-to-day operations of CIE not only had the effect of stopping CIE from making the economies they considered prudent, but also gave them a complete excuse for not reaching other targets.  The deficit in the 13 years up to 1982 was one and three-quarter times the rate of inflation each year and when that is compounded it works out at seven times the rate of inflation in those 13 years.  It was a scandal.  The situation is now under control.  We will not go back to the bad old days because the policies we are pursuing are working with signal success.  I am not trying to hog all the credit for that.  Management, workforce and the board of CIE deserve credit and <Col N="2359" /> they deserve to know that their achievement is appreciated.</P>
    <P>In the context of the above I hope my position will be understood.  From the point of view of the financial targets set, of industrial relations and in the interest of the company and the workforce, it would be wrong of me to intervene or to get involved.  That is not the right thing to do.  It is the correct policy for CIE so far as the workforce, the taxpayers and the users of the service are concerned. I hope a settlement, satisfactory to the taxpayers, the travelling public and to management and workforce is arrived at quickly.  The Labour Court have made a recommendation and I hope that sense will prevail so that the considerable improvements in the past three years will be continued in the future.</P>
    <P>With regard to Irish Shipping, I do not have much more to say on that subject other than what I have said in this House and elsewhere in the past year.  The Government decided originally to take on the burden of the <i>ex gratia</i> element of the pensions of those who worked in Irish Shipping or their spouses during the 1939-45 period.  After further examination we found a way to meet the <i>ex gratia</i> element of the pensions of the remainder of the people in Irish Shipping.  Assuming approval by the House of this Supplementary Estimate today, not only will we restore the <i>ex gratia</i> payments but we will pay the sum from the day it was discontinued one year ago.  It will be a nice nest egg and the pensioners concerned will receive the money before Christmas.  I know that everyone in the House will be glad we were able to do that.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, when it comes to claims for extra statutory redundancy we find ourselves in a quagmire.  Many implications, including legal considerations, have to be considered.  The Government have examined this matter thoroughly to find a way to ameliorate the problems of those who have been made redundant.</P>

      <P>We are also dealing with laws relating to bankruptcy.  It is not just a question of waving our hands or wishing the problem away.  If that were the case the problem could have been solved long ago.  There are very serious difficulties and we have not found a way of overcoming them.  I regret I cannot see any way out of the difficulty.  I have had to face hostile picketing from ex-employees of Irish Shipping and their families.  They circulate in my constituency and they hand out leaflets outside Churches on Sundays.  Unfortunately Ministers have to take the rap regardless of who is to blame.  The picketing does not diminish my sympathy for those people and their plight.  They are innocent victims but that does not enable me&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>I would have to get legal advice on that question because it is a sensitive area.  Therefore, I should prefer not to answer it.  I do not see a way out of the problem even in the long term. The Government are very unhappy about what has happened.  However, I am delighted we are able to meet the <i>ex gratia</i> part of the pensions, and those who have not had the <i>ex gratia</i> element paid for the past year will receive that part of the pension next week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2361" /> As Deputy Wilson knows, the <i>Irish Spruce</i> was never owned by Irish Shipping. It was leased by the company from the owners, Jura Shipping Limited, and the lease payments were guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  A complicated deal was worked out at the time which was motivated by the need to keep employment in the Verolme dockyard. As a result of that, Irish Shipping were asked to take a ship there when they could have got a ship elsewhere for a lesser amount.  We decided as part of the package that the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism would carry half of the cost, that the <i>Irish Spruce</i> would bear one-quarter and that one-quarter would be carried by the Department of Transport, now the Department of Communications.  Any remaining cost would be borne by Irish Shipping, the owners of the vessel.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>The final draft arrangements remained when Deputy Wilson left office.  It is an extremely complex document. The owners have the right to dispose of the vessel if they see fit, and it is a matter for the owners to decide its future disposition.  They have the right to refer to the Department of Finance.  It is something I have no control over.  I had hoped the vessel would have been disposed of long ago, but I have no direct role.  If I had been asked this question months ago I would have answered in the same way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked about the strategic shipping needs of Ireland.  I am considering a report on that and the Government will decide in the near future how to proceed.  It is hard to resist the fact that an island country must have a case for a shipping capacity, particularly <Col N="2362" /> in the case of Ireland which needs control over cross-Channel and continental services. It would be my objective to provide for the strategic shipping needs of the nation, but I do not think this should mean meeting our requirements by lumping the taxpayers with the cost.  I have reason to believe that the taxpayers should not be saddled with these costs and I believe such an arrangement can be achieved.  I cannot see any economic or social reasons for subsidising shipping but I think we can have services without calling on the taxpayer.  I do not think the strategic needs of the country should be met by the Exchequer: it should not be thought that we are ready to dole out money.  One of my objectives is that we would have a shipping service without need to call on the Exchequer except in a minimal way.  I hope I have answered Deputy Wilson's queries in this respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>I was about to deal with the other problems which we are trying to cover in the subheads.  Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition &mdash; he featured on page 1 of the newspapers today &mdash; said that the budget this year was fraudulent.  We have submitted Estimates for supplementary sums amounting to £80 million, but Deputy Haughey's statement was a distortion of the facts. This token Estimate represents expenditure of some millions of pounds, but financed by savings in other areas of my vote.  In fact, by 31 December I expect that there will still be a surrender to the Exchequer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>On social welfare, perhaps.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There will not be a penny less for the Exchequer.  I do not want to go into the present position of B &amp; I at any length because proposals are being discussed between management and the union which will be considered <Col N="2363" /> by me and the Department, and ultimately at Government level, and they may call for Government decisions soon. I want to bring these matters under control on behalf of the taxpayers, the customers and all those whose livelihood depend on the success of B &amp; I.  We have tried to do it in CIE and Aer Rianta.  In the case of Irish Shipping there was no alternative.  In regard to B &amp; I, my decisions have been designed to make for the success of the company and the maintenance of employment for the maximum number of workers.</P>
      <P>It does not seem to be sensible, given the state of the company, that the members of different unions would be rushing to go on strike.  That sort of action will only diminish further the company's prospects.  Of course, the company will discuss and negotiate the proposals.  That is in the nature of our society and of industrial relations but there are some aspects which the company have said are unalterable.  In keeping with my policy elsewhere, it is not my intention to interfere in those areas that are proper to the company.  Our efforts are designed to try and ensure a future for the company and to secure the maximum for the workforce. I appeal to all those who work in the company to act in that light.  There is no joy in confrontation or in axing jobs. Jobs will not be chopped merely for the sake of chopping.  The wish of any of us here would be the ability to create more jobs but that can be done only when consistent with the viability of the company concerned.  Therefore, I appeal to everyone concerned, management and unions alike, to work together in an effort to reach an agreement that will give some hope of prosperity for the company and which would protect the maximum number of jobs.  Contrary to what we have read in some newspapers I am not interested in knocking one union or another.  I am interested in ensuring that management do the job they are paid to do.  I am interested also in ensuring that there is nothing in the affairs of the company we cannot stand over.  That is the purpose of what I am doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2364" /> In such companies as CIE, RTE, Aer Lingus and the B &amp; I we will pursue with vigour, with consistency and determination, and I hope with some understanding, the resolution of the problems involved.  Some times that attitude is represented as hard line but that is not the case.  My purpose is to set sensible targets for these companies and to set about achieving those targets.  So far we have had a good deal of success and I trust that will continue to be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McCreevy</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset I wish to compliment the members of the marriage breakdown committee on their report.  It is obvious that a considerable amount of time and painstaking work was involved in the production of the report.  The fact that the committee were set up at all was a step forward in stimulating debate in this area.  Because they encountered difficulties at various stages in the compilation of their report, public consciousness was aroused in the matter of the problem of marital breakdown.  I wish to pay a special tribute to Deputy Michael O'Leary because had it not been for his initiative in publishing his own Bill and being so forceful in a very lonely crusade with which practically 100 per cent of his party did not agree, it is unlikely that we would be discussing this report, at least in this Dáil session.  Deputy O'Leary's initiative appears to have stirred the political parties or perhaps I should say, forced the political parties, to consider seriously the enactment of legislation in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My contribution to the debate will be relatively brief.  Earlier this year I made public my personal situation.  Consequently I consider myself constrained from launching into a normal type debate in this very special area.  As a general rule, legislators should not allow their personal circumstances to influence or impinge on their legislative functions. However, I recognise that it is extremely <Col N="2365" /> difficult for any politician always to draw that distinction because we are all influenced by our personal experiences.  I am not the only politician in the present Oireachtas who has martial problems but those of us who have those problems are merely a reflection of Irish society today. There is no family in the State who do not have a brother, sister or some close relative with similar problems.  For the record I wish to state that I have always believed the constitutional ban on divorce to be wrong.  I would welcome very much in regard to this issue and to similar issues also the non-application of the Whip system in each party.  I am convinced that within the next ten years or so the absolutely rigidity of the party Whip system will change.  There are many general points that I should like to make regarding the application of that system in this House, points both for and against the system, but this debate is not the proper forum for making such points.</P>
    <P>We in Fianna Fáil have been encouraged to make our personal views known on the problems of marital breakdown. Personally I am grateful for that opportunity. I am in favour of divorce legislation and I am convinced that a referendum should be held as soon as possible with a view to removing that provision of the Constitution which prohibits divorce.  I recognise that within all parties in the House there are sincerely held but opposing views.  No party has a monopoly of sincerity in this area.  The same can be said so far as any Deputy or groups of Deputies are concerned.  A number of Deputies believe sincerely that the enactment of divorce legislation would be a disaster.  While I respect their opinions, I do not agree with them. Broken marriages will not cease to be broken, regardless of whether we introduce divorce legislation.  One cannot prevent people dying merely by banning funerals.</P>
    <P>In a normal situation there are many points on which I would base my case to advocate divorce legislation but I will confine myself to just one such point.  I regard divorce as a civil liberty, no more and certainly no less.  The Constitution of <Col N="2366" /> any country should not reflect the thinking of any religious group.  I am a Roman Catholic but I am not here as a Roman Catholic politician.  My religion is my personal property.  No politician should regard himself as being here to reflect the views of any Church.  I do not deny the right of any religious grouping to offer their opinion but I reject being told by clerics that as a Catholic I must legislate as a Catholic.  The logic of that theory is mind boggling.  For instance, it could mean that on every occasion on which there was a change of Government the laws would have to reflect the ethos, values and teaching as reflected in the new Government.  Such a situation could not be tolerated.  The laws at any stage should allow for the exercise of personal freedom subject to the concept of the overall good.  That is why I believe divorce to be a civil liberty.  An argument has not been advanced to prove that the overall good is damaged by the introduction of divorce.</P>
    <P>It is the function of the Oireachtas to legislate for all the people irrespective of religious beliefs.  It would appear from opinion polls that the country is evenly divided on the issue.  Let us put the question to the people and accept their decision.  I would not gamble on the outcome but, as elected representatives, we should not be afraid to face the people on any issue.  When there is a referendum I hope all sides in the debate will avoid the usual hysterical mud slinging that has characterised such debates in the past. On many occasions since I became a TD I have criticised the absence of real leadership. This criticism has been taken as a criticism only of Fianna Fáil leadership. However my criticism was and is against all sides of the House in a general way.</P>
    <P>It distresses me to hear some elected representatives argue that it is not right politically to have a referendum now.  If there is anything I have learned in my political career, to my cost on many occasions, it is that there is never a right time to be brave in politics.  Surely we have learned this in the economic sphere over the past 15 years.  Furthermore, the <Col N="2367" /> controversial social changes have usually been forced on the Oireachtas by the courts.  The original contraceptive legislation arose from a court decision.  Politicians appear to act on the principle &mdash; there goes the mob, I must follow.</P>
    <P>This attitude is an abdication of real leadership.  Over the years I have tried to analyse the cause of this abdication and my main thesis is that the present multiseat proportional representation system is the main determinant for our appalling record in real leadership in all areas.  As a logical follow-on from these principles, as legislators we should not wait around until the opinion polls say that it is politically safe to test the waters on this issue. Notwithstanding the real sincerity of many people who believe divorce is wrong, the legislators would be more respected for braving these issues, based on conviction, even if the majority are against their proposals.  I urge the House to take this issue straight on and let the people decide as soon as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Millions of words will be spoken and written about the case for and against the introduction of divorce. I wonder how many people who have aired their views and who will air their views have taken the trouble to read the comprehensive report which we are now discussing.  I associate myself with the many tributes paid to Deputy Willie O'Brien and his committee for their work on this report.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The report under discussion is not about divorce because the committee's terms of reference were to consider the protection of marriage and family life and examine the problems related to marriage breakdown.  The focus of attention seems to be on marriage breakdown and on whether or not we should have divorce.  Page 120 of the report under the heading &ldquo;divorce&rdquo; states quite clearly that it is the committee's opinion that a referendum should be held.  The question of whether or not we should have divorce rests entirely with the people and can only be decided by referendum.  All that <Col N="2368" /> concerns this House is the best time to hold a referendum.</P>
    <P>Some say this is a bad time because the opinion polls show that the majority do not want divorce and if a referendum were held the issue of divorce would be rejected and buried for decades.  Others believe it should be held now to get the matter decided once and for all.  What has disgusted me is the way in which the problem is being handled like a hot potato and the manner in which the issue has been turned into a political football. The sooner TDs admit to the reality and size of the problem of marriage breakdown, the sooner we will get to the point of working towards a solution to the problem which is causing untold misery for so many people.</P>
    <P>We should consider the known number of broken marriages and the many cases which have not been documented.  We must consider the numbers of separated couples who are living with partners not their spouses, and the people living together without the benefit of marriage because of the attitudes to marriage breakdown.  We must consider the many legal highways and byways taken by the victims of marriage breakdown and the problems they are storing up for themselves and the children of their unrecognised partnerships.</P>
    <P>We legislators continue to run away from the real issue, from our duty and from the real business of politics which is about government and leadership.  Surely this running away is one of the causes of the great apathy of young people towards politics and politicians.  Accepting that there is a problem is a major step.  We must also accept that the Ireland of the eighties is not and will never again be the Ireland of the thirties and the forties when endurance was the only solution to marriage failure.  In we accept that we are an open economy surely we should accept that we are part of a global village and that the technology of communications alone ensures that we are influenced by the ideas, concepts and attitudes of the world, and that we must face up to realities.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2369" /> If we as politicians are to mean anything at all to the people we represent we must clearly state the differences between the civil law and the laws of the churches.  It must be made clear that, if civil law permits divorce, it will not compel any Catholic, Protestant, Jew or Hindu to seek divorce or, if divorced by their partner, to remarry.  They will have their own free choice in the matter and their religious beliefs to follow in taking decisions.</P>
    <P>A further problem is that, when the Roman Catholic Church grants an annulment the partners remain married according to the civil law.  Strangely, the Roman Catholic Church continues to use its considerable influence to ensure that the State does not introduce divorce.  This situation has led to extraordinary confusion and hurt, mostly among those affected by marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>In purely political terms, at a time when we have sought an Anglo-Irish agreement, is it not ironic, cynical and hypocritical to talk of accepting only a unitary State while at the same time postponing action on the issue of divorce which is a civil right for all in the northern part of this country but not in this part? Is it not appalling to use religious beliefs, coloured by political opportunism&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>If there is to be unity of purpose and opinion amongst all the people of this country we must have unity of laws.  It is appalling to use religious beliefs, coloured by political opportunism, for a single political purpose, that is, to attempt to embarrass a Government attempting to deal with a real problem affecting so many people.  It appears that power at any price, even at the price of human misery, is the norm in some circles.  Deputy John Kelly recently expressed the view that this was not the right time to hold a referendum because a lack of consensus would ensure defeat. Perhaps there is something in that.</P>
      <P>Another belief has been put forward by people who do not want to do anything, people who believe there are other, more pressing issues to be dealt with, such as taxation and unemployment.  It is the business of Government and leadership to identify with all the issues of our times. Marital breakdown is such an issue today and is as great an issue as the others that have been mentioned.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach lit a fire of political decency which inspired change in my party and his integrity of leadership has won him many supporters.  It will be noted in history that the leadership of our party faced the real issues of our times. However, all of this must not be lost or extinguished or killed through cynical, political opportunism, native hypocrisy and cuteness, or by the pressure of vested interests, political or religious.  Most of all, it must not be lost through fear, which is the opposite to political leadership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By acknowledging the reality of the problem at present we have made a start and we must now seek solutions, As legislatiors we must seek a sense of fair play for our people, old and young, who want and need to fight against the disillusionment so prevalent after so many years of unseemly, unChristian squabbling where religion and politics are mixed.  People will respond to integrity, courage, honesty and leadership.  Politicians should stand up now and lead and, in so doing, <Col N="2371" /> perhaps restore our dignity which is lost every time we back down in the face of pressure groups.</P>
    <P>If we decide to hold a referendum on this issue I hope it will not go the way of previous referenda, when the public were so confused that the percentage who turned out to vote was low.  In the past I believe that to have been a reflection not only of the apathy of people but of the confusion created over the issues in question.</P>
    <P>Marital breakdown has been a problem in this country for decades and it will not disappear by being ignored.  Even in the early stages of this debate pressure groups are beginning to show their muscle.  In a democracy there is room for pressure groups, but these groups must have respect for the position of other groups within the State and must attempt to understand the opinions of others. Most people accept the right of each person to express his or her opinion in a forthright way.  I hope this atmosphere will continue to grow during this debate on marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>I am conscious that other Deputies want to speak and that this is the last day of this session for this debate.  Chapter 2 of the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown spells out the legal and constitutional position of marriage and the family in Ireland.  Most of us subscribe to this even though some think that divorce is a necessary legal remedy to marital breakdown.  In this chapter the committee expressed concern about illegitimate births resulting from the large number of informal unions brought about by married persons living with married persons other than their legal spouses, or with single persons.  Also, if persons who have obtained a divorce outside the State or an annulment of their marriage by the Church, were to marry and have children, the status of those children is put in question because, in the eyes of the State, these people have not remarried, this is a very confusing, unreal situation which must be examined and a remedy must be found.  Again, this is the result of marital breakdown.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2372" /> Chapter 3 deals with means to prevent marital breakdown, such as the need for education and preparation for marriage. Preparation for marrige should be on the curriculum of every school in the country. Unfortunately, it is a matter which is totally forgotten about as each school endeavours to gain the highest academic standard possible.  Preparation and study for marriage should come from the home, the schools and other organisations as the child develops and should not take place weeks before or after the marriage takes place.  The social, financial and human problems that affect a marriage must be highlighted and incorporated into pre-marriage courses.  These courses must be supported by the State to a greater degree than they have been to date.  I must commend the churches for the way in which they have undertaken this role down the years.  In my diocese in recent years the different churches have set up marriage counselling services which are of great benefit to the people of the area but they have received very little support from the State.</P>
    <P>Chapter 7 deals with legal remedies available in the State, one of which is the decree of nullity which seems to be a long and expensive avenue to be pursued by members of the Catholic Church.  The results of nullity are dealt with in that chapter.  Again the whole of this area needs to be clarified.</P>
    <P>I believe there is a strong case for separating the civil and religious ceremonies of marriage in order to emphasise their completely different roles.  The present combination of ceremonies, religious and civil, causes confusion if a Church annulment is granted because, too often, the results of the Church union include children. Therefore one cannot ignore a couple's relationship or its results.  For me the concept of nullity is very hard to understand.</P>
    <P>Chapter 4 deals with marriage breakdown. In this chapter the committee examine in detail how marriages break down.  In this connection I would like to refer to the pressures of modern living which are forcing so many married women, even those with children, to take <Col N="2373" /> jobs.  In recent years there has been a substantial increase in the number of wives working outside the home for a wage and all the evidence indicates that with the amount of pressure this trend will continue in the years to come.  If we are concerned about the protection of marriage and family life there is a need and opening here for preventive action by the State.  There is a crying need to revise and review the services available to families.  I refer specifically to the need for a comprehensive system of child care facilities to be provided by the State. The pressures on the families of working parents are enormous and, in my experience, have been contributory factors in the undermining of many marriages.</P>
    <P>Therefore, it is important that the Government adopt the recommendations in the report on the provision of child care facilities throughout the State. I do not agree with the belief of the ICTU which was submitted to the committee that there should be extended maternity leave and family responsibility leave. Maybe I am wrong, but I am of the opinion that the present maternity leave which a mother can have, of 14 weeks at the time of the birth of her baby, is more than sufficient.  It results in discrimination against women who are competing for jobs against their male counterparts because employers are not prepared to take on somebody who is going to get 14 or 16 weeks off at the time of the birth of a child.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>Therefore, any suggestion that maternity leave should be extended or that paternity leave should be introduced would be unwise as it weighs against women applicants for jobs.  Secondly, the State cannot afford any extension at present.  In dealing with chapter 4 <Col N="2374" /> let me say that the many crimes of social deprivation such as poor housing and unemployment are contributory factors to marital stress and major threats to the permanency of marriage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephDoyle" hpid="Mr. J. Doyle Mr. J. Doyle">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that divorce is a civil right even though there are many reasons why it may not be socially desirable. In dealing with the family it has been said many times that the availability of divorce in Ireland would encourage people to take marriage less seriously. However, if we make a comparison between the North and this part I am sure that we would not find much difference in the attitudes of the people to family life.  The fact that divorce is available in the North does not seem to worsen the attitude to the family unit there.</P>
      <P>In relation to the family unit, the definition of the family in the Constitution must be redefined to include the single parent with children.  It will be very interesting to see the figure in the next census relating to single parent families.  I believe it will be close to the Northern Ireland figure of 10 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Dealing with premarriage courses and preparation for marriage in general I was amazed to find on page 191 of the proceedings of the committee that Father Kennedy, who represents the Catholic Marriage Advisory Council, informed the committee that in 1983 the council received only £31,000 from the State for marriage counselling and education services and only £27,500 for family planning services.  Those are insignificant amounts of money for such vital services which lay the proper foundations and preparations for marriage.  The State has a responsibility to aid organisations who create a proper foundation for marriage because these organisations are under-resourced and under-financed at present and are competing with attitudes which are being projected through the media which indicate and project the totally wrong image of marriage that we see so often in American &ldquo;canned&rdquo; television programmes <Col N="2375" /> where the permanency of marriage seems non-existent.  Therefore, there is a responsibility on the State to finance the organisations that are attempting to lay a proper foundation for the permanency of marriage.  The projected standards that we get so often from foreign television programmes are doing irreparable damage to the developing minds of our young people and their attitudes to marriage.</P>
    <P>The whole issue of marital breakdown and, more specifically, divorce at present, unfortunately, seems to be a Church versus State clash, which is regrettable. The Church's view was expressed quite clearly by the Bishops in a statement in 1976&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The Catholic Bishops.  I stand corrected.  Perhaps a fault in politicians is that we think there is only one Church and maybe that is coming across in my views.  The Catholic Bishops in a statement in 1976 said: &ldquo;It is not the view of the Catholic Church that in the law of the State principles peculiar to our faith should be binding on people who do not adhere to that faith&rdquo;.  Therefore, those who insist on seeing the issues in terms of the State enforcing or not enforcing their Catholic moral teaching are missing the point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We as politicians should be concerned about the social impact of divorce.  We must decide whether divorce will create greater problems while lessening the problems we have at present due to the absence of divorce.  We must decide on this issue and each person in the State will have to debate it in his mind in the months ahead.  I hope that a referendum will be held to give the people a final say <Col N="2376" /> because it is they who will have the final say, but we as legislators must legislate for all people in the country irrespective of our religious beliefs.  In legislating we must take into consideration the different views of people.  Therefore, I hope that the referendum will be held in the months ahead to let the people decide the issue once and for all, but I hope that the people in deciding will not be confused or stampeded into taking decisions because of political opportunism or misleading statements from different interests.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The issue we are addressing is by definition a fundamental issue going as it does to the root of what is described in the Constitution as the fundamental unit in our society.  The Constitution in Article 41.1.1º provides that:</P>
      <P>The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.</P>
      <P>As it stands, the Constitution under which we operate our laws recognises as a fact that the family has a primary and fundamental role to play.  The family as such is not defined in the Constitution but it is clear from the development of the concept of family, either in Irish law, Brehon law, Roman law or any concept of law, that the family being referred to is the broader definition, not just the narrow unit of parents and their immediate children.  Grandparents and, if they are alive, great-grandparents, are as much a part of the family and the unit we are discussing as are the parents or the children.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is significant that the Irish term for family, Clann, is in a sense the direct equivalent of clan.  The role of a family is not just the role of the husband and wife but of the dependants, as they are described in law, who extend to grandparents and even great-grandparents.  We must recognise that that family where it can be promoted is a very worth-while <Col N="2377" /> and positive unit that should be promoted. In congested areas in our cities we do not have the balancing influence of grandparents.  In settled communities of two or three generations, not necessarily in rural Ireland but in the village communities of this city like the Liberties, one of the most stable elements in those families are the &ldquo;gran&rdquo; and sometimes the &ldquo;great-gran&rdquo; or the grandfather. Compare that with what can arise in newly developed housing schemes such as Dublin Corporation have been promoting for some time.  From the environmental and physical point of view they may be ideal schemes but there is always something lacking.  Some of the schemes that have been regarded here as being disastrous at various stages compare very favourably in terms of the physical planning with what is available in other cities in Europe.  What is missing in many cases is the real family concept involving, understandably, the old &ldquo;gran&rdquo; or &ldquo;great-gran&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I am trying to illustrate that the stability of the family does not depend only on the husband, wife and immediate children. It goes beyond that and in any consideration we should address ourselves to that.  We should take note of the contributions older generations make to stability.  In my experience I can see the way my children relate to their &ldquo;gran&rdquo; and I know what that does for stability when, perhaps, the role of rather infrequent visitors to the home like myself would not necessarily be a great contribution to stability.  Therefore, we must tread rather carefully if we are proposing changes in the way we introduce them in these areas.</P>
    <P>One must have concern for young couples living in a rather detached suburban environment who do not have the benefit of concern, care or advice of their parents or grandparents and who have to face economic pressures and pressures of adjusting with each others personalities. That is where the problem seems to arise. We must look at the secure, stable elements which are perhaps most characteristic of rural Ireland &mdash; I am not making any great boast about that &mdash; but <Col N="2378" /> are also characteristic of the wonderful village communities of this great old city, places like the Ringer, where I taught for quite a while, the Liberties and so on.  It is time we recognised those values and promoted them.  The old Irish saying on a wedding day, &ldquo;Go raibh sliocht sleachta ar shliocht bhur sleachta&rdquo;, &ldquo;That you may have the generations after generations on your immediate family&rdquo; is the real blessing and it is time we recognised it as such.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of talk about rights in this debate.  It is important to recognise that there are rights but rights have always a balancing responsibility.  A right that does not have a balancing responsibility is not a right at all, it is a licence not just one subject to certain regulations but one without restriction.  That is not the type of right we want to consider.  For instance, if we talk in terms of the right of a parent to exercise a separation or divorce and consider that right as being an absolute one irrespective of the rights of some others involved in that contract, the children, we are not then talking about rights any more but a licence in the sense of absolute freedom.  We are not talking about a licence in the sense of a regulated control.  The trend in current analysis on a number of issues is to focus entirely on rights as if they can be discharged, as if the citizen lived entirely in isolation from the society in which he or she lives.</P>
    <P>As I try to gather my thoughts I should like to draw the attention of the staff to the fact that it is a little distracting to hear them talking.  If there has to be discussion I would prefer that it be conducted <i>sotto voce.</i></P>
    <P>Let us consider marriage as a civil contract, because it is that, and leave out the religious aspect, the church ceremony and so on.  It has special characteristics that some other contracts do not have and I hope I can deal with it both ways in terms of what it has in common with other contracts and what distinguishes it from them.  What distinguishes it from other contracts is that the two people who enter that contract bring about a situation in which other people are born, people <Col N="2379" /> who were not there at the time of the original contract but who were a direct consequence of it and have rights as well as being simply accidental consequences of the contract.  Therefore, when looking at the question of whether either of the two original parties to the contract can exercise their rights one must also take into account by definition the rights of those who have come into being as a consequence of the original contract. That is what distinguishes the marriage contract from others.  If Deputy Barnes and myself for a variety of reasons entered into any other type of contract we can freely break by agreement between us what we freely entered into by agreement because it affects nobody else.  If in discharge of our civil contract we affect other people the law will tell us that if the consequence of our discharge of a contract will have a damaging effect on others then we are not quite so free to end that contract because of that.  That must apply by definition in this case.</P>
    <P>That characteristic of the marriage contract is unlike most other contracts. For that reason we have to consider the rights of children, particularly those who are not at an age of being able to express themselves, much less protect their rights.  For that reason the law has always laid down protection for children.  Marriage also has characteristics of any other contract and one of them is that there is a consensus, <i>ad idem,</i> an agreement towards the same end for the same purpose. Where it can be demonstrated that there are no longer conditions which show a <i>consensus ad idem,</i> then we have the end of any contract.</P>
    <P>I have some little experience of this as a lawyer, because I appeared as Senior Counsel before the Supreme Court with Senior Counsel, now Mr. Justice Séamus Egan, in the first nullity decree, to my knowledge, for 15 years or perhaps 20. That was in the early seventies &mdash; 1974 or 1975 &mdash; when I went back to practise after some years in Government.  This decree had been refused in the High Court.  I notice that even in the Law Reports the names are not mentioned. <Col N="2380" /> The basis on which that decree of nullity was given in the Supreme Court was that in this instance the behaviour of the male party almost immediately after the formal contract was entered into on the marriage day was of a nature which was inconsistent with any intention of having a permanent contract, despite the fact that the conduct of the couple before marriage indicated at least a sexual relationship which is characteristic of marriage.  Certainly, by the second night that all ended.  That would be a good base for nullifying a marriage, because no consensus was there.  Since then there have been many decisions in our courts declaring that that fundamental element of consent was absent.  In one recent case it was held that there was undue pressure to marry, which was a very simple, clearcut case.  In the case to which I am referring there was a misleading intention &mdash; one party was conveying to the other the impression that they both agreed about the same thing when they did not.  There must have been since then 40 cases of civil nullities.</P>
    <P>We can certainly bring that element of the law, through the Statute Book, much more into line with reality.  I am not talking about Church nullities which are not a matter of concern to me here; I am talking about civil nullities.  An examination of the consequences of court decisions will show that the least we should do is adopt into legislation what already is decreed in so many consistent court decisions.  I am taking an analytical or philosophical approach to this matter, bit it is not just as easy as using clichés like &ldquo;Let us take our courage in our hands&rdquo;. Broader issues are involved and I hope the Chair and the House will bear with me when I address these issues.  I shall address some false presumptions.</P>
    <P>There is a trend in presentation of referring to all who are enlightened and tolerant &ldquo;in these modern times&rdquo;&mdash; as if every stage in the human experience has not been a modern time.  Perhaps the most beautiful experiences of the human condition occurred 2000 years ago in the then modern times of Athens.  Every succeeding generation must face up to reality <Col N="2381" /> in their modern times.  I find certain presumptions a little offensive, for instance, that if you are enlightened, informed and tolerant you must, by definition, reach the conclusions suggested by certain commentators as. in their minds, the mark of the tolerant person.  The person who is really engaged in deep analysis will go much beyond correspondence columns and instant comment to look at the root of our society and what secures it.  I hope that we would not charge those who have one view as being troglodytes and blind and promote the others as being the only people who care.  There has been a slight hint of that in the debate, both inside and outside the House.  Some Deputies in favour of change, perhaps for good reasons as they see them, are very unfairly accusing those who are trying to protect what they see as valuable in the <i>status quo</i> of being blind and prejudiced and not being prepared to think.  These are accused of closing their minds and being influenced only by the Church. That is not true and it is presumptuous to suggest that only those who argue, for instance, for the dissolution of marriage are enlightened.</P>
    <P>Some very loose phrases have come into use in recent times in discussing issues of this sort.  One phrase which is a contradiction in terms is that of &ldquo;private morality&rdquo; and that is the judgment of deeper and better intellects than mine. There is no basis for the concept of private morality.  There is basis for the concept of private behaviour.  If we suggest that morality is a matter for each individual person, as if that person lived totally in isolation from the other individuals in society whom he or she affects or by whom he or she is affected, we are proposing the ridiculous.  If people suggest that what they do is their business in matters of morality, whether to do with sexuality, public order, religious freedom or whatever, that would be ignoring the whole basis of morality.  It is a consensus towards the standards of the <i>mores</i>&mdash;the customs, habits and consensus in society and this was never better described than in a treatise by the former Lord Chief Justice Devlin of England in <i>The <Col N="2382" /> Enforcement of Morals.</i> He deliberately used to describe himself for this purpose as being a lapsed Catholic.  He was certainly one of the best thinkers in this area for a long time.  He points out that &ldquo;what makes a society of any sort is a communtiy of ideas, not only political ideas but also ideas about the way its members should behave and govern their lives. These latter ideas are its morals.  Every society has a moral structure as well as a political one&rdquo;.  This treatise was published in 1975 and introduced, at my request, into the Oireachtas Library five years ago.</P>
    <P>When we talk about private morality we are talking about private behaviour within private morality.  Let us not tell people that they can develop their own code of morals and do what they like in terms of marriage without affecting the rest of society, for good or ill.  I am not saying that change would be for ill, but let us recognise the reality that any change for any individual will impact on others with whom that individual is in contact.</P>
    <P>I think there would be a consensus that the family is the fundamental unit.  What are we doing to protect it?  The first point is to give to that family the opportunity to work and the dignity which comes with it.  There are great risks nowadays in unemployed families who are under particular pressures.  These pressures are avoidable if we provide adequate work and income.  We must promote and protect the positive elements within the family by doing much more to provide the dignity of work and security of income which families require.  We must order our society in such a way as not to bring unnecessary pressures on families which give rise to marriage breakdown.  When husbands lose their dignity and hang around the house, how can there be anything but tension?  Those people deserve all our sympathy and must get our support in every possible way.</P>

      <P>Perhaps it is right that <Col N="2383" /> Deputy Barnes should always be the watchdog on this, but she should not assume that we are not conscious of the dignity of wives.  The case of which I am most aware was conveyed to me by a wife who told me about the way she had seen her husband lose all his dignity in the home while pretending to be a great fellow outside.  I am as much concerned for the wife as the husband.  Nobody has contributed more than the wife to the dignity of the home and the security of the family and the nation.  For that reason we have special recognition in the Constitution of the special role of women within the home.  The special respect which we accord to the woman in the home is well warranted.</P>
      <P>I do not want to claim that I am holier than the rest but when I was Minister for Finance I took a decision, which I was not required to take under any Supreme Court decision, to give the same rights to women who work in the home as to women who work outside the home.  The Murphy decision applied only to a wife working outside the home and I was only obliged to implement that decision.  The judgment very deliberately did not address itself to the working wife in the home.  Some other case might have arisen later.</P>

      <P>We were doing what was necessary to protect the home.  We were giving the same tax allowances to married couples, irrespective of whether one or other of them worked outside the home.  That is the kind of road we should follow to protect and promote the stability of the home.  We were not forced to do it by judicial direction; we did it deliberately to protect that unit.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="2384" /> I want to associate myself with those who say that what we do here should not be under the control or direction of any Church.  I would reject to the last breath in my body the direct influence of any Church on my thinking or the attempt to tell me as a legislator what I should do.  I have said this publicly on more than one occasion and on television.  I happen to be a Roman Catholic but I do not think that we as legislators should contemplate an attempt by the Church to which we belong to direct us.  I do not think they do, to the extent that is often perceived. There may be individual bishops of individual Churches who tend to.</P>
    <P>I was chairman of an all-party committee dealing with the implications of Irish unity set up in 1970.  I was also a member of the original 1966 committee and I did not like the recommendation of that committee that a person married in one Church could have divorce if that Church allowed it, but could not have divorce if the Church did not allow it.  I dissented from that recommendation because it was denominational, if not sectarian.  The committee I chaired in 1970 was very representative and included the former Chief Justice, Mr. Tom O'Higgins, who is now at the European Court, Deputy Declan Costello, now Mr. Justice Costello, and others.  We met representatives of many Churches openly, honestly and regularly and I became a personal friend of many on the bench of bishops of the Church of Ireland.  We never met a representation from the Roman Catholic Hierarchy, with one exception.  I remember the late Cardinal Conway asking, almost with deference, if it would be all right if he came to talk to us some day.</P>
    <P>There may be some bishops of Churches who use the crozier but, if any Government bowed before them, that Government would not be worth consulting. There is a myth that the bishops are breathing down one's neck all the time. Let certain bishops or archbishops say what they wish.  We have our position.  It must be admitted that the factors which fashion people's thinking and give stability to society are influenced by the inherited prevailing religious ethos.  This <Col N="2385" /> lapsed Catholic, if I may call him so, Lord Chief Justice Devlin, points that out fairly well.  Anybody who looks at how laws are derived would see that point.  I <Col N="2386" /> am not talking about a particular denomination.</P>
    <P>The Dáil adjourned at 4 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 17 December 1985.</P>
