      <P>It is proposed to take No. 12.  By agreement, the Supplementary Estimates being introduced today will be taken immediately after leave has been granted for their introduction and shall be brought to a conclusion forthwith and successively and decided without debate, with the exception of Votes Nos. 23, 25, 38, 41, 46 and 47.  Also by agreement, the following arrangements shall apply: (1) The proceedings on Vote 46 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 12.30 p.m. today; (2) The proceedings on Votes 23 and 25 shall be brought to a conclusion not later than 5 p.m. today.</P>
      <P>Also by agreement, the Dáil shall meet at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow and shall adjourn not later than 4 p.m. and the business shall be confined to Supplementary Estimates and Statements on the Report of the Joint Committee on Marriage Breakdown. If a division is challenged on an Estimate it will be taken at 8.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 17 December 1985 in accordance with Standing Order No. 123.</P>

      <P>Before we give our agreement I want to be clear on the procedures. All of this business has been rather hurriedly arranged.  No. 12 is described on my Order Paper as a motion for leave to introduce Supplementary Estimates.  I take it that means the Minister for Finance will ask for leave to introduce all the Supplementary Estimates. When that leave has been granted, is it the position that the Minister for Finance, on behalf of all the Ministers, will move the Estimates or will the individual Ministers move their separate Estimates?</P>

      <P>In regard to Votes 23, 25, 38, 41, 46 and 47, I understand agreement has been reached between the Whips that Ministers introducing these Estimates will take a limited time in each case so that debate will be able to take place.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order of Business, I wish to direct the attention of the House and the public to the fact that today and tomorrow at very short notice we will take Supplementary Estimates totalling £94 million.  The Government's Estimates for 1985 were understated by an extent of £94 million.  We are reluctantly agreeing to take these Supplementary Estimates at very short notice and with very abbreviated discussion on each <Col N="2111" /> heading.  In fact, we are agreeing to allow through on the nod quite a number of Estimates because there is not time to discuss them.  With regard to Votes 23, 25, 38, 41, 46 and 47, we have agreed to take them with a very short time to discuss them.  This is very unsatisfactory and I wish to protest about it.  There is nothing we can do about it at this stage because these moneys must be provided.  Otherwise, a serious disruption of departmental activities will occur.  A sum of £50 million extra is required for social welfare. If that were not approved here today, the unemployed could not be paid tomorrow.  This is a very bad way to do business.  We will agree to the Supplementary Estimates now because it is necessary in the public interest to do so, but we must ask the Government to arrange their business better in the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I happen to represent the main Opposition party and the party who agreed reluctantly to this procedure. So that discussion of the individual Estimates may proceed I will conclude with two or three further remarks.  The budget based on the Estimates has been shown conclusively, as we predicted at the time, to have been fraudulent, especially in relation to the £50 million extra which is being sought now for social welfare and which we indicated at budget time would be necessary because of the inadequacy of the provision made in this respect.</P>
      <P>The Government have made a great song and dance and paraded their virtue about the matter of Government expenditure but here we are being asked to agree to the provision of almost £100 million extra for Government expenditure in 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I must point out that the Estimates are not yet before the House but having heard Deputy Haughey, it would be manifestly unjust not to give the Minister a hearing.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate the co-operation of the Opposition in handling this matter.  This is the third year in a row in which this has happened.  Likewise, when Fianna Fáil were on this side of the House, they had the co-operation of my party at the same time of the year and on the same kind of occasion to do as we are doing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2118" /> Deputy Haughey has characterised the Estimates as inadequate and has alleged that the budget of which they were the base was fraudulent, That is not the case. The Supplementary Estimates before us total an amount in the region of £90 million.  A number of Estimates are involved for areas in which extra expenditure during the course of the year becomes necessary.  There are also a number of Estimates for areas in which no extra expenditure is involved but because of the proper scrutiny that is required we must place before the House details of transfers and expenditure from one subhead to another.  We do not discuss in the House Estimates for Departments where expenditure is at figures below the budget targets and there are some such areas.  Therefore, for Deputy Haughey to try to pretend that the total extra amount involved is £94 million is a very small, very selective and misleading presentation of the matter.</P>
    <P>I will remind the Deputy that for the past three years, 1983 to 1985, the overrun of current expenditure on the budget target, taking the three years together, will be about 3 per cent outside what was planned at budget time.  During Deputy Haughey's period in Government&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare (Mr. Pattison)</NameTxt>
      <P>The original Estimate for my Department which was passed by the House last May was for £1,323,149,000.  A further £50,000,000 is now required to meet the increased cost of the services administered by my Department and will bring total Exchequer spending on these services in the current year to £1,373,149,000.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate is required mainly to meet the extra costs resulting from the Christmas bonus payments made this month to recipients of long term benefits &mdash; including for the first time this year long term unemployment assistance recipients &mdash; a shortfall of income from social insurance contributions and extra numbers of unemployed. Higher than anticipated expenditure on the disability benefit scheme and an expected deficiency of £1 million in appropriations-in-aid receipts also contribute to an overall additional cost of £59.85 million which is partially offset by savings of £9.85 million on other subheads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the Social Insurance Section of the Vote an additional sum of £14.4 million is required under Subhead E.  The £14.4 million is the additional amount payable by the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund to meet the deficit on the working of the fund.  This is the net position.  All of the contributory schemes of my Department are paid from the fund.  The additional requirement of £14.4 million is arrived at taking account of likely savings and excesses on these various schemes and any variation on the expected yield from contributions by employers and employees.  The latter is by far the most <Col N="2125" /> difficult element to estimate.  Income from contributions this year is now expected to the £30 million less than originally estimated.  Contribution income is affected by many factors which cannot be foreseen and provided for.  In this respect higher unemployment is obviously a major factor.</P>
    <P>The expected £30 million shortfall in income from contributions is partially offset by net savings on the expenditure items of the fund.  In arriving at the net position a number of factors must be taken into account including the additional sums required to meet the cost of the Christmas bonus to long term recipients and the fact that equal treatment measures have not been implemented as early as expected.  The most significant variations are expected to arise on the disability benefit scheme where expenditure will be about £4 million higher than provided for, on unemployment benefit where a saving of £16 million is expected and, arising from the reduced expenditure on unemployment benefit, a saving of £6.2 million is predicted on pay-related benefit.</P>
    <P>In all, the expected net savings on the expenditure side of the Social Insurance Fund total £12 million leaving a net excess of £18 million when account is taken of the expected shortfall on contribution income of £30 million.  The £18 million is offset to the extent of £3.6 million by an adjustment of an overdraw from Subhead E as at the end of 1984.  In regard to the overdraw I wish to explain that final draws by the fund must be made from the Exchequer before the end of each year on an estimated basis because the actual figures of income and expenditure are not available until after the close of the year.  Any overdraw or underdraw resulting is reflected in the amount payable by the Exchequer to the Social Insurance Fund in the following year.</P>
    <P>On the social assistance side an additional £2.5 million is required under subhead G &mdash; Old Age Pensions &mdash; to meet the cost of the Christmas bonus. This is the net figure taking account of savings of £1.7 milion that would otherwise have arisen on the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2126" /> In subhead L &mdash; Social Assistance and other Allowances &mdash; a further £2.7 million will be needed of which £780,000 is due to the cost of the Christmas bonus. The remainder of the excess arises in the main from increased numbers establishing entitlement to the services.</P>
    <P>An additional £39.25 million is required under subhead I &mdash; Unemployment Assistance &mdash; due to a higher live register than had been anticipated at the start of the year.  Also included is an additional £4.25 million for the Christmas bonus for the long term unemployed.</P>
    <P>Subhead I, however cannot be looked at in isolation.  Account must also be taken of the fact that there is a saving in the unemployment benefit provision under subhead E as already mentioned. Whereas provision can be made on an overall basis for any given number of unemployed, it is always very difficult to forecast the precise inter-relationship between the numbers receiving unemployment benefit and those receiving unemployment assistance.  This brings about the saving of £22.2 million on unemployment benefit already referred to.</P>
    <P>The overall additional requirement is offset by estimated savings of £9,850,000 on other subheads.  This total is made up of a saving of £3,830,000 on subhead K &mdash; Miscellaneous Grants.  The greater part of this saving is on the supplementary welfare allowance scheme where the take-up was not as great as that for which provision was made.  A saving of £4,700,000 will arise on the family income supplement scheme where, despite extensive advertising by my Department, the number of people qualifying for supplements are fewer than had been foreseen. Smaller savings arise also on the rent allowances scheme and the Anti-Poverty Agency, the legislation for which has not yet passed all Stages.</P>
    <P>These are, I think the main features of the Supplementary Estimate.  I see the Estimate as highlighting the efforts being made by my Department to provide for the needs of those who have been caught up in the economic recession of recent years.  The provision for unemployment <Col N="2127" /> payments is a clear indication of this &mdash; in 1985 between unemployment benefit and assistance my Department will have paid out over £632 million.  We are all undoubtedly concerned at the continuing high levels of unemployment and the Government are doing their utmost in a variety of ways to alleviate the worst effects of this unfortunate situation.</P>
    <P>It has been customary for a number of years to give a Christmas bonus payment to long term beneficiaries such as pensioners. This bonus was usually double the normal weekly rate of benefit.  This year, in recognition of the needs of the long term unemployed, the Government decided to extend the Christmas bonus to cover those who had been receiving unemployment payments for 15 months or more.  Because of the additional numbers involved the level of bonus was fixed at 75 per cent of the normal weekly rate. I am sure Deputies will agree that this is still a very welcome and worthwhile addition to the income of those who qualify and it will undoubtedly be especially welcomed by the long term unemployed who are receiving a Christmas bonus for the first time.</P>
    <P>I would point out that an amount somewhat in excess of £20 million is being spent on this Christmas bonus.  This accounts for the largest single part of the Supplementary Estimate.  It is not quite accurate to say that there was a miscalculation of £50 million in the Estimate since the Christmas bonus has never been provided for in the main Estimate.  Somewhat less than £30 million is being provided for the other items I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Estimate to the House and I shall be glad to furnish Deputies with any additional explanations they may require.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is certainly a matter of great concern that the Government have had to introduce a Supplementary Estimate of this magnitude at such short notice.  The amount involved &mdash; £50 million &mdash; is a huge sum by any standards. It clearly suggests that the Government <Col N="2128" /> in preparing their Estimates before this year's budget got their figures and projections completely wrong.  If not, one has to look for a more sinister explanation, perhaps a calculated and deliberate attempt to misrepresent the facts.</P>
      <P>When the Estimates were presented our spokesman on finance seriously questioned the validity of certain figures, particularly the projections made by this Department in respect of unemployment. The Government seemed to be quite satisfied that their sums were correct and that there would be no need for additional moneys.</P>
      <P>An additional sum of £2.5 million is being provided for payments of old age pensions and blind non-contributory pensions. While most commentators highlight the increase in the number of young people in the population, there has also been a sizeable growth in the number of old people.  I concede that it can be difficult accurately to calculate claims for this section of the community.</P>
      <P>Between 1961 and 1981 the number of people over 65 years of age has increased by 20 per cent and estimates have been made that by 1990, or thereabouts, there will be a further increase of approximately 10 per cent; while within the overall estimated structure the percentage increase of people over 65 years is expected to diminish over the next few decades, the absolute number will increase and the biggest increase will be among the very old.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on this side of the House believe fervently and sincerely that it is paramount that in any socially just and caring society the cares and needs of the old in particular should be catered for. The State has an absolute obligation to ensure that old people have adequate moneys to provide for their basic needs and to allow them the privilege, honour and dignity of having some luxuries.  It would be tragic if society were to reject in any way the needs of the old after spending so much time and effort to ensure that these people live to a ripe old age.  It would be foolish for society to reject them in monetary terms when they attain this ripe old age.  I do not have to <Col N="2129" /> remind the House that we should never forget that, with a bit of luck, in due course the rest of us will join the ranks of the elderly.</P>
    <P>Let us study the statistics for this £50 million Supplementary Estimate.  The additional sum needed for unemployment assistance stands out strikingly in comparison with the others.  Four fifths of the total, almost £40 million, of this Supplementary Estimate are needed for payment of unemployment assistance.  In other words, four fifths of this Supplementary Estimate are necessary to meet the increased payments needed to compensate those who are unemployed because of this Government's failure to provide jobs for them.  Almost £1 million extra is required for deserted wife's allowance.  Almost £2.5 million extra is needed for social assistance allowance for unmarried mothers.  Almost £0.25 million is required for additional allowance for prisoners' wives.</P>
    <P>The need for a considerable percentage of these additional sums is inextricably intertwined with the changes which have taken place in our society.  Poverty, unrest and unhappiness in families are rampant at present.  The poverty in which many families have to live creates unrest and unhappiness and is the greatest single cause of broken homes and broken marriages. One can imagine the stress, strain and turmoil which can exist in a household afflicted with the disease of unemployment where the hopes and dreams of the future are lost for most members of that family, where money is scarce and where genuine poverty exists.  This is an obvious breeding ground for marital breakdown.  I know of many cases that arose during the past year for which some of these moneys must be provided.  Many wives are deserted because of the hopelessness and despair which have entered into the family home.  Broken homes, broken families and deserted wives are becoming more and more common.</P>
    <P>The collapse of work is a major factor in our society.  Lack of work and the failure by the Government to provide it constitute an economic and social disease which can have far reaching effects.  It is <Col N="2130" /> obligatory on any Government to produce policies and ideas to create a climate in which we can deal with this important issue.  Something over a year ago this Government introduced what has become an infamous and discredited document which they called <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987.</i> I described it at the time as a document which could be more aptly called &ldquo;Building on Unreality&rdquo;.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>Certain things which relate to what we are discussing are contained in that document.  In it the Government made various predictions in relation to the unemployment numbers, the problems, the cost of paying for the unemployment numbers as they existed then.  They predicted that the unemployment number would be approximately 220,000 by the end of last year, that it would subsequently fall back to around 210,000 and would be reduced to around 200,000 by the end of 1987.  These are the figures on which these Supplementary Estimates and the Government's budgetary strategy were based, and these figures were wrong.</P>
      <P>They were wrong and misleading when they produced them.  They are even more wrong now.  Even when this Government produced these wrong and misleading figures they accepted that there was little or nothing they could or would do to deal with the problem of unemployment because they had conceded that the number would still be around 200,000 by the end of 1978.  Since they came into office in December 1982, unemployment has increased from 180,000 to 230,000. In other words, 50,000 more people are roaming the streets jobless and the State must support them and their families. Hence the need for a Supplementary Estimate of the magnitude of this one and £40 million approximately of this is needed to pay for the failed economic strategy and failure to provide jobs.</P>

      <P>A society where the jobless total represents over 17 per cent of our population is heading for disaster. The official figure of approximately 230,000 at present unemployed is totally misleading because the Government have introduced a plethora of schemes which seem to have one purpose in mind, to keep the numbers on the live register down to the lowest possible level.  On odd occasions during the past year the Government have claimed that unemployment figures seemed to be improving, but that is far from the truth.  There are now approximately 38,000 people on job schemes and AnCO courses and for that reason they are not on the live register. At present there are some 19,000 people on job schemes under the aegis of the Department of Labour and a further 19,000 on AnCO training courses.  If one were to add that figure of 38,000 to the figure of 230,000 one would arrive at the true number of unemployed, 270,000 or 20 per cent of the insured population.  In <Col N="2132" /> other words, one in five in this society is officially jobless although the Government are pretending that the figure is as low as 17.2 per cent.  Even that figure is an horrific indictment of Government policies.</P>
      <P>If one were to include those on training schemes and AnCO courses the figures given understate the true position because there has not been any account in any of the figures of those who would join the work force if they thought there was any chance of getting a job.  That figure is growing as married women give up the notion of ever getting a paying job.  On top of that we now have the rising tide of emigration.  It is a real factor in Irish life and the emigrant ship is sailing again.  I should like to remind the Government that, although a person may emigrate and in so doing automatically remove himself or herself from statistics, he or she is still a very real part of the problem here.  Unfortunately, the Government do not appear to have any solution to these problems.</P>
      <P>During the past year the Department of Social Welfare and the Department of Labour introduced social employment schemes intended to take 10,000 people off the dole queue, but so far between 5,000 and 6,000 people have been taken on.  It is unfortunate that that scheme is confined to those over 25 years of age.  In fairness to the young people who have left school and see little hope of finding a job, the Minister should consider lowering the age qualification.  The scheme was launched in February but did not commence until early summer.  While I accept that it has accommodated some social needs and created some environmental improvements, particularly in rural Ireland, the scheme does not provide any long term solution to the problem.  Those taken into the scheme will be employed for about 12 months and, when the year has expired, they will once again have to join the dole queue, that whole league of hopelessness which is our unemployment problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government have had ample time to face up to the problems of the less privileged sections of our society, the old, <Col N="2133" /> the sick, the poor, the unemployed and the disabled, but they have shown scant regard for the needs of that section of the community.  Prior to the last general election Fine Gael and Labour unequivocally promised to produce a social policy which would ensure that the living standards of all those on social welfare would be maintained at least in line with increasing cost of living.  They stated clearly that social welfare recipients would be looked after and cared for.  That was the promise of the so-called social partners of Fine Gael and Labour when in Government.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, this uncaring and inhuman Government have reneged on those promises.  They have turned their backs on those who supported them and implemented policies which have seriously eroded the standard of living of the less well off sections of our community, people who deserve to be treated better. That section of the community have been treated with contempt and disdain by this unscrupulous and uncaring Government. The Coalition have failed to deliver on any promise they made in the general election.  Those promises were made with great aplomb.  For example, in this season of Christmas the Minister for Social Welfare announced that there would be a 75 per cent bonus this year for old age pensioners, the chronically ill and the long term unemployed.  Last Friday those people received their payments and, instead of getting a welcome Christmas present, they received a reduction of 25 per cent compared with last year's bonus.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in his well recognised inimitable and flamboyant style, failed to inform the public that the bonus was 75 per cent of the amount given last year. For years Fianna Fáil gave a double payment at Christmas to old age pensioners, widows, the chronically ill and the disabled. This year those people have suffered a loss of approximately £12 in their Christmas payment.  I should like to remind the Minister that we did not read that announcement in any newspaper. Those recipients were deprived of £12 and that was carefully concealed.  Many of those people protested to us last week. That money was badly needed by them <Col N="2134" /> to give them a little extra luxury at Christmas.  The amount may seem a pittance to the Minister but it is a lot of money to a section of our community who deserve to be treated better.  I implore the Minister to accede to my request to give a genuine double payment to those people.  I have no doubt that if he can be so generous, many old age pensioners, widows, the chronically ill and disabled will have a happier time over Christmas.</P>
    <P>During the year the legislation on the European Equality Directive was introduced with aplomb into this House and subsequently passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas.  Before the summer recess the Minister claimed that 40,000 women would benefit as a result of that directive giving the same rights to them as to men, particularly with regard to social welfare.  He promised that the legislation would be implemented by the end of the summer, or certainly in the autumn, but as time passes there are no indications of the date of implementation. I wonder if he has the political will to introduce it, or if this legislation has been permanently shelved.  I believe he is afraid of some of the political implications involved from reduced payments to dependants of husbands, thereby increasing the unpopularity of the Government with the electorate.  They do not want to face up to these consequences. As the main Opposition party spokesman, I pointed out at the time of its introduction that there were means by which the Minister could ensure that there would be no suffering, hardship or loss of money for any family with regard to social welfare payments.  The Minister failed to take cognisance of that advice and he is now left with legislation which he is afraid to bring before the people.</P>
    <P>What is happening with regard to the child benefit scheme about which we heard so much in the <i>Building on Reality</i> document?  Like the tax credits scheme, the child benefit scheme is supposed to be having major operational difficulties and for that reason its implementation will be delayed.  I presume it has been put into the distant future and may not be <Col N="2135" /> introduced in the lifetime of this Government. It is quite clear that this Government are not interested in the family unit. They ignored the matter of children's allowances when making their budgetary increases.  I do not have to tell anybody in this House that that allowance has become an extra payment, particularly for the mothers of families, to be put aside to buy extras for the children.  It was not an unreasonable expectation that those allowances should be kept in line with inflation, but the Minister and the Government chose not to do this.  That was a cruel and callous decision.  The electorate will not forgive a Government who ignore the family as the present Government have done.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Building on Reality</i> mentioned three major items with regard to social welfare: first, that a new child benefit scheme would be introduced in 1986 to rationalise the structure of child support payments and give particular help to families of low paid workers; secondly, the European equality directive on equal treatment between men and women in matters of social security was to be implemented in 1985; and the third big item was the publishing of a framework for a national income related pension plan dealing, in particular, with pensions for the self-employed. I do not have to tell the House that of those three items not one has been implemented, or seems likely to be implemented in the foreseeable future. Any party or Government producing a programme such as that, resulting in a 100 per cent failure rate on implementation, would have only one avenue open to them, to get out before they were put out by the people and I do not believe that that day is too far away.</P>

      <P>Another item was the family income supplement on which a commitment was given last year by this Government.

I am glad Deputy Bell is present because he <Col N="2136" /> had terrible problems in that regard and wrestled with his conscience to such an extent that he almost contorted himself. However, he was extremely pleased when the family income supplement was introduced, to be backdated a month or so.  He was absolutely satisfied that 30,000 families would benefit enormously from this scheme.  That would satisfy his conscience, clear his mind and give him no problem in dealing with the poor people of Louth.</P>

      <P>This and other Departments have had such a litany of failures that if one tries to think of one success one cannot find it.  The poverty and deprivation created by unemployment and failed Government policies have opened the way for social injustices of a hitherto unknown quantity.  Only last week RTE had two successive programmes on the topic of illegal money lending.  These programmes showed that this was rampant and that poor families on low social welfare payments, without jobs, without hope and without creditworthiness in the banking institutions had to resort for their <Col N="2137" /> essential family needs to borrowing from the financial vultures, the legal and illegal money lenders in most of our towns who charge exorbitant and illegal lending rates.</P>

      <P>This illegal money lending with exorbitant interest rates is rampant throughout the country and the Government have promoted this by creating such poverty.  They should be ashamed of their record.  They should be ashamed of themselves for the poverty they have created and the social injustices which have arisen as a result of that poverty. This Government have had an appalling and unholy propensity for deception which has been well promoted and projected by those well known confidence tricksters known as the national handlers.  I believe they would go to any extent to absolve them from their sins against the public at large.  But, at the end of the day, the failures of this Government mean that the ordinary man and woman in the street will have to pay the piper.  This Government are leading the country into national and international financial disaster.  They are consumed with one single purpose, that being a sort of basic or animalistic instinct of self-preservation.</P>

      <P>It all relates to the policies that have produced the problem obtaining and which led to this Supplementary Estimates having to be introduced in an emergency.  This Supplementary Estimate had to be introduced with amazing suddeness resulting from miscalculations or from a manipulation of figures which were not true. Were it not for the fact that we agreed to take this Supplementary Estimate today &mdash; the coffers of the Department of Social Welfare being dry &mdash; the public would not receive their cheques for employment, disability, invalidity benefit, all of which would not be paid this week.  Obviously, therefore, we had to facilitate them in that respect because we should not like to see that section of the community deprived of the moneys they so badly need.</P>
      <P>The Government are composed of an amalgam of political hypocrites who, as it were, flatter to deceive and whose deceptions have now begun to catch up with them in a big way.  Sooner rather than later the electorate will drive them into permanent political oblivion.  I am glad to see that Deputy McGahon is in such good form.

I have no doubt that this Government, the Minister, all his cohorts and friends will disappear like Halley's Comet into perceptible astrological non-existence and will not be found again for many decades to come.</P>

      <P>The Chair will excuse me for laughing but that was one of the funniest <Col N="2139" /> contributions I have heard in a long time. To talk on a Supplementary Estimate for three-quarters of an hour without referring to it at all really took some doing.  I suggest that the best thing the Deputy could do is send for Senator Martin O'Donogue because he was the guy who promised to eliminate unemployment completely in a period of four years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a pity that this Supplementary Estimate has been introduced without giving us more notice.  I am sure the Department of Social Welfare must have known it was necessary and it is important that we should be given a little more notice.  I knew nothing about it until I came into the House this morning.</P>
      <P>This Supplementary Estimate and the debate on it are important because they highlight a number of areas warranting explanation.  For example, I do not see any reference to the free fuel scheme. Perhaps it is included in the miscellaneous section.  I do not know what is the position of other Deputies but in my county there are many problems with regard to the free fuel scheme and there is much waste as well.  There are four or five different agencies dealing with the administration of the scheme and different interpretations as to how it should be done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There have been many references to savings in the Minister's document.  I assume that part of those savings have been affected through the free fuel scheme.  Perhaps the Minister could give us some information on that.  If that is the case, I assume such savings have been affected by the confusion occurring in the administration of the scheme itself.  For example, vouchers are being distributed at unemployment exchanges forming part of one scheme being operated by the local authority and administered by community welfare officers.  There does not appear to be any set or standard procedure for the application of the rules <Col N="2140" /> or regulations of the scheme.  Some people who have been on disability benefit for the last two years are receiving free fuel this year while others who have been on disability benefit for the last ten years cannot get it simply because they did not get it last year.  I should like to know what the Minister has to say in relation to that matter.  Not alone would one save money but the scheme would be rendered much more efficient if we had one central way of administering it. I would plead that its administration be removed from community welfare officers because, as far as I can see, they operate under different rules and regulations. Each one can interpret the regulations in his own particular, peculiar way.</P>
    <P>I am not too clear either how the rent allowance scheme operates.  For example, some community welfare officers will allow rent allowance where they believe there is hardship while others, in exactly the same circumstances, will refuse to do so.  Again there does not appear to be any standard set of rules governing the operation of the rent allowance scheme.  Some people believe they should have the whole of their rent paid.  Others receive a supplement of £5. Some community welfare officers will tell you, &ldquo;Well, if the Minister agrees, we can pay more than £5&rdquo;.  Certainly I am not too clear on how it operates.</P>
    <P>With reference to the payment of benefits within the Department of Social Welfare the facilities available to recipients or applicants are inadequate.  It must be remembered that the number of people drawing social welfare benefit has quadrupled in a short space of time.  The net result is that the facilities available four, five or ten years ago remain the same.  Certainly in my constituency no improvement has been effected in the facilities available other than spreading the payments over a longer period of time.  They are now paying out on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays and instead of having one long queue we now have four or five long queues.  I am sure that Deputy McGahon will confirm that the same applies in Dundalk.  No capital <Col N="2141" /> sums are being provided by the Department of Social Welfare for the purpose of improving the facilities.</P>
    <P>Social welfare payments are now being made by community welfare officers.  I do not see why they should be responsible for these payments.  People are refused payments of unemployment assistance or disability allowance in the employment exchange and then sent to the other side of the town to be paid by the community welfare officer.  Community welfare officers are not equipped to deal with this and there are now bigger queues outside the health centres than outside employment exchanges.  It is a duplication of work costing millions to administer.  I brought this to the attention of various Ministers for Social Welfare over the last number of years but my pleas have fallen on deaf ears.  The Department of Social Welfare are making no efforts to streamline the system.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Labour Party I welcome the Christmas bonus.  Naturally I would have preferred it to be 100 per cent not alone for those who enjoyed it in former years but also for those who are eligible this year.  It is the lesser of two evils; it is adding an additional £1 million to last year's payments.  We must take into consideration that the long term unemployed are those who have suffered most and we support our colleagues on the Opposition benches who have asked for a 100 per cent bonus next year.  However, I was amused to hear the Minister talk about paying the bonus before Christmas as the money was paid out last week&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps if savings can be made within the system next year the Minister will be able to pay the full bonus. One of the reasons for the substantial over-run is that you cannot budget for a Christmas bonus unless you decide at budget time that you will pay such a bonus.  No Governments, including <Col N="2142" /> Fianna Fáil Governments, who paid the Christmas bonus ever budgeted for it when preparing the Estimates.</P>
      <P>I should like an explanation of the over-run of £39,250,000 on unemployment assistance.  I can understand over-runs under other headings but this is hard to understand because unemployment assistance is normally paid to those who come off unemployment benefit and, therefore, it should be possible to estimate accurately the number involved. People do not go from disability benefit to unemployment assistance and that is why it should be possible to estimate the numbers accurately.</P>
      <P>I should also like the Minister to explain the miscellaneous grants.  As Deputy McCarthy said, I welcomed the family income supplement but I did not accept it in exchange for the elimination of food subsidies.  However, I am naturally disappointed that many people who are entitled to this benefit have not applied for it.</P>

      <P>I know that Deputy De Rossa will have something positive to say in that regard.  Deputy McCarthy referred to the social employment scheme which has been a success.  Of course it is not an exchange for full time employment but it is a help.  One of the biggest problems in regard to that scheme is that if married men with children benefit from it they will lose money and it would be a great help to the Departments of Social Welfare, Labour and Environment if that anomaly could be rectified.</P>

      <P>We are discussing a symptom of the great <i>malaise</i> spreading like a virus throughout the country.  We are talking about a sum of £50 million over and above what the Government projected at the beginning of the year. We are really talking about countless thousands of husbands, wives and children who are affected daily by the appalling levels of unemployment and the <Col N="2143" /> inadequate provision which we are making for them.  We must all recognise that the terrifying reality is that husbands have lost their dignity.  They are ashamed to walk on the streets because they have lost their jobs after 30 or 40 years.  There are wives living with depression day in and day out because their husbands are forced to stay at home, pretending to be supporters of their families, men who contributed for so long not just to the support of their own families but also to the well being of the community.  We see children affected by the inevitable tension which arises from this terrible problem.  It is time that we looked at these people and provided them with what they need to maintain their dignity.</P>
      <P>Ireland has the worst economic conditions of any democratic country in the world, and I am including poor member states &mdash; Greece and parts of Italy.  Conditions here could be so much better because we have magnificant native resources.  It is a great tragedy that this morning we have to support this Supplementary Estimate, if only to ensure that the level at which these people are forced to live will be maintained.  If we did not support this Supplementary Estimate we would deprive them of that prop, which is already totally inadequate. We can talk all we want about crime, tensions and lack of respect for politicians, but until such time as we generate opportunities to tackle this awful problem, we will deserve this lack of respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should do what we promise for at least one year.  In the document <i>Building on Reality,</i> there is a graph which says that at this time of the year we would have an estimated 110,000 unemployed. Even within the first year this document had been proved to be a document of illusion because already the actual figures are way above the projected figures.  In a written reply last January I was told by the Minister for Finance that the budget projections would be adhered to, unlike other Governments, and that they were providing for unemployment averaging 210,000.  The Government were determined to prove that they would adhere <Col N="2144" /> to their projections this year but within months it has been proved that this document is but an illusion.  On page 26 we were told that we had reached a peak of 220,000 at the end of 1984 and that figure would fall back to 210,000 or near the April 1984 level.  This is the document which is the basis for the new economic reality, but the peak they spoke about has been exceeded.</P>
    <P>Throughout the year we had an average of 230,000 on the live register.  I will not repeat what Deputy McCarthy said, that the figures would be much higher were it not for emigration and the schemes which do nothing to restore dignity to our unemployed.  The document went on to say that this will mean &mdash; not might mean or should mean &mdash; that between the end of this year and April 1987 employment creation will have absorbed the whole of the labour force increase and achieved the start of a reduction in unemployment.  It is very clear that it means no such thing.  This is the clearest demonstration that this document should be jettisoned and acknowledged as a fantasy.  Compare what we are doing today with what the Minister for Finance told me at the beginning of this year.  Compare what we are doing today with what the Minister for Social Welfare said at all times.</P>
    <P>At the beginning of this year I met the financial editors of our newspapers and said that the projections in the document, <i>Building On Reality,</i> particularly relating to unemployment, were totally illusory and that there would be a budget overrun in this area.  I put a modest estimate of £30 million on that figure but now the overrun is £50 million.  In my wildest dreams I did not think it would ever reach that figure.</P>
    <P>I agree with Deputy Bell that the manner in which this is being introduced is totally unacceptable.  Three weeks ago the Minister said we would need a Supplementary Estimate to meet the needs of the unemployed.  I did not know until I came here this morning that we were being asked to sanction this Supplementary Estimate.  This is totally unacceptable from a Government who said that <Col N="2145" /> henceforth the business of this House would be conducted on the basis that what was provided for in the Estimate would be adhered to.  They said we would have ample time to discuss normal Estimates, which we have not yet discussed, and they said &mdash; I want to emphasise this &mdash; that there would not be Supplementary Estimates.  The Minister for Finance said at the beginning of the year that they would not introduce Supplementary Estimates, which had been part and parcel of previous administrations, because public expenditure was being organised in such a way as to ensure that they would not be required.  We were told recently that spending was under control.  What do these words mean?  This is the greatest example of spending being totally out of control.</P>
    <P>Apparently the Minister for Defence is chairman of the committee in Cabinet supervising spending.  It is no wonder these figures bear no relationship to reality.  Why have the Government said they will not introduce Supplementary Estimates when today we are discussing one of the biggest Supplementary Estimates we have seen in generations?  What we are doing today is making a token contribution to what is a gnawing misery in our society.  We are abrogating our responsibility and passing the burden to the voluntary organisations.  We all know that were it not for the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the other voluntary organisations, the people we are pretending to help, particularly those on unemployment assistance, could not possibly survive with dignity.  However, even they are in no way capable of coping with this appalling misery that is a characteristic of our society today.  Much as we admire these organisations, we should not have to depend on them to look after the old, the sick, and the unemployed.  That is our job.</P>
    <P>There has been an increase in the numbers obtaining unemployment assistance. In normal times people could hope to obtain employment after six months on unemployment benefit but that hope does not exist any longer.  Most people are now in a state of permanent unemployment, <Col N="2146" /> unfortunately relying on a totally inadequate level of unemployment assistance. That is an indictment of the Government.</P>
    <P>This day will be remembered as the day we erected a monument to the failures of the Government.  The Minister present in the House is responsible only for his Department but the responsibility and the blame must be placed on the Government as a whole.  To Deputy Bell I say that no Deputy here has a more moral conscience than anybody else.  I know the Deputy is concerned but it is time he considered how long more he will prop up a Government who have proved totally and utterly inadequate to meet the problems of many thousands of our people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>I regret very much that the Government have been put into the position where they have to introduce Supplementary Estimates at this time of the year.  To some extent it reflects on our ability to budget properly for a full year.  It has proved difficult not just this year but in many other years.  It has also been a problem for the Opposition when they were in Government.</P>
      <P>Reference was made as to the reasons for introducing this Supplementary Estimate and the high level of unemployment. That high level of unemployment is a reflection on every politician.  We must ask ourselves what are the reasons and how we can pull ourselves out of the morass.  This year total income tax receipts will be of the order of £2,500 million and that amount plus another £300 million will go to pay interest and repayments on foreign borrowings.  They mainly arose in the years from 1977 to 1981&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to the present position it will be exceedingly difficult for us to attack the high unemployment rate.  VAT returns for the current year will be in the region of £1,450 million which is more or less the total expenditure on social welfare.  I sometimes question what return we are getting for that expenditure.  Many people have put forward good suggestions as to how to use the money more effectively.  In the past three or four years there have been many excellent schemes in respect of social welfare payments.  Unless we address ourselves to the major problem of tackling unemployment we will have failed.  It is a crime of major proportion and it is a shame on all of us.</P>
      <P>I welcome the payment to long term unemployed people although perhaps it does not go as far as we would have liked. They were the forgotten people in our society but now they will have an opportunity, through the various schemes, to get back into employment even if only for a short time.  To some extent, it will help to restore their dignity.  I regret that it was necessary to have this Supplementary Estimate but I support what the Government are doing.</P>

      <P>In the few minutes available to me I wish to convey my utter disgust at the attempts of this Minister and the Government to put across that this Supplementary Estimate of £50 million is being used to improve the conditions of those people on social welfare. In his speech the Minister indicated he was looking for an increase of £X million because of the 75 per cent bonus for certain categories on social welfare.  He did not state that the cost of providing this 75 per cent Christmas bonus is £21 million as against a cost last year of £20 million.  There is no real increased expenditure by this Government on the Christmas bonus: in real terms, there is a reduction.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The operation of the Christmas bonus this year means that the poor who are already on social welfare are being asked to assist others who are also on social <Col N="2148" /> welfare.  It is a disgraceful and a disgusting approach to dealing with the poverty that exists in our society.  Over one million people in our country are estimated to live below the poverty line and today the Government introduced a Supplementary Estimate of £50 million which we are told will improve the conditions of people on social welfare.  In fact, it is simply a cover up for a wrong estimation at the beginning of the year of the level of unemployment that would exist at this time of the year.</P>
    <P>In the past year the Society of St. Vincent de Paul have had to make a special appeal for aid because of the huge demand on their funds.  Yet, in the Minister's speech today there is a statement that they have saved £3.4 million in the supplementary social welfare allowance provision in respect of a scheme intended to assist people who are at the very bottom of the pile in terms of poverty.  I do not have the time to express my utter disgust at the approach of this Government towards the poor and the deprived. It is nonsensical for Deputies such as Deputy Bell to come here and whinge about this and that while saying that it is impossible to pay the additional 25 per cent of the bonus between now and Christmas.  The real problem is that the Government have failed to get involved directly in job creation.  They have not used our resources to assist those who are at the bottom of the pile in our society.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I move:</P>
      <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £1 million be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Justice, and of certain other services administered by that Office, and for payment of a grant-in-aid.</P>
      <P>With the permission of the Ceann Comhairle, I propose to discuss the Supplementary Estimates for the Office of the Minister for Justice and Prisons together.</P>
      <P>The Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice is required to meet additional expenditure on three subheads of the Vote &mdash; Salaries, Wages and Allowances, Commissions and Special Inquiries, and Criminal Legal Aid &mdash; as well as for the creation of an additional subhead in respect of the Stardust Victims' Compensation Tribunal. The total additional expenditure amounts to £1.5 million, but £100,000 of this can be met from savings elsewhere in the Vote.  The net additional sum now sought is, therefore, £1.4 million.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A sum of £1 million of the total allocation being sought in the Supplementary Estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice is in respect of compensation to victims of the Stardust disaster and incidental expenses in connection with <Col N="2150" /> the operation of the Stardust Victims' Compensation Tribunal.</P>
    <P>The tribunal has decided on the amount of compensation in approximately 30 cases.  Some awards have been accepted and the remainder are under consideration by the claimants.  The main purpose of the Supplementary Estimate is to enable payment to be made this year to claimants who have accepted awards. Provision, of course, will be made in the 1986 Estimates for payment of a much greater number of awards next year.</P>
    <P>I think that it is appropriate that I should say a few words in general about the Stardust Victims' Compensation Tribunal. The tribunal is empowered to award <i>ex gratia</i> compensation to victims of the Stardust disaster and their families, assessed under the Rules of the Civil Liability Act, 1961.  Copies of the scheme of compensation for personal injuries suffered at the Stardust, Artane, on 14 February 1981, were laid before each House of the Oireachtas on 22 October last. Notice were placed in newspapers on 23 October stating that application forms could be obtained from the secretary to the tribunal in St. David's secondary school, Artane, Dublin.  Accordingly, the tribunal has been dealing with claims and inquiries from its office in Artane since the last week in October.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will be aware, the Government decided to set up the tribunal so that the agony suffered by the victims of the Stardust tragedy and their families could be brought to an end speedily.  The single most important point about the tribunal is that it can act quickly, informally and on the most favourable terms possible for claimants. It can act without causing any of the worry and the unavoidable delays that can be involved in processing claims of this nature through the courts.</P>
    <P>The scheme also avoids the question of the legal liability of the various defendants, as well as questions of contributory negligence, which could arise in proceedings in the courts or even before the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal. In addition, under the Stardust <Col N="2151" /> tribunal claimants can be certain of getting awards, as they are guaranteed by the State.</P>
    <P>In brief, the tribunal places the welfare of the claimants first, and the Government are satisfied that it can settle compensation cases fairly and quickly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increased provision sought for criminal legal aid, my Department have no effective control over the two main determinants of expenditure which are first, the decision by the courts to grant such aid and, second, the cost arising from the grant of it in any particular case.  The courts alone have discretion to grant criminal legal aid and it would simply not be feasible to limit that discretion without changing the statutory, perhaps even the constitutional position. Deputies will probably be aware that there is a Supreme Court ruling to the effect that accused persons have a constitutional right to legal aid in certain circumstances.</P>
    <P>A number of factors contributed to the high rate of expenditure this year.  These include increased recourse generally to legal aid by the courts in disposing of criminal business coming before them and overall, the speedier processing of claims submitted by solicitors and counsel under the scheme.</P>
    <P>I might add that included in the revised allocation sought for this subhead in 1985 is the cost of paying the VAT on legal fees which is currently running at 23 per cent; however, this is ultimately recouped to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>In my speech on my Department's Estimates for 1985 on 6 June 1985, I said that the Estimate for prisons of £49.715 million would have to be revised later in the year to cater for additional expenditure arising from the unprecedented growth in the numbers in custody.  At present there are 1,900 prisoners in custody, though at times this year the number has been more than 2,000.  This compares with a daily average last year of 1,590.  The increase has been achieved, as Members of the House will be aware, by maximising the use of existing custodial accommodation, by taking over Fort <Col N="2152" /> Mitchel on Spike Island from the Department of Defence and by the temporary use of the education units at Cork and Arbour Hill prisons and the work-education unit at Limerick prison as dormitory-type accommodation for prisoners.</P>
    <P>As a society, we can take little pride in the level of serious crime which has given rise to such a large increase in the number of prisoners being catered for in our institutions. That level of crime, a worrying element of which is drug-related, is a reflection of deeper problems in our society.  The identification of these social problems and their alleviation are, of course, matters of priority for the Government but as they encompass a wide range of questions which extend beyond my brief as Minister for Justice, I do not intend to dwell on them here. However, the range of difficult medical, psychiatric, social and personal problems, which the prisoners present to the prison administration, including health problems consequent on drug abuse, are a matter of serious concern to me.</P>
    <P>Imprisonment and the provision of more custodial places is not, of course, perceived by the Government to be the complete response to the crime problem. What imprisonment primarily fulfils is the removal from the streets of criminals who are inflicting pain and havoc on innocent victims.  The seriousness of their offences is recognised by the courts in the length of sentences imposed.</P>
    <P>Imprisonment, however, cannot deal with the causes of crime and that is why I have emphasised repeatedly the responsibility that the community itself carries at local level in crime prevention matters.  Therefore, community based schemes represent an important complementary response to the crime problem. Schemes of this nature which I have in mind are Neighbourhood Watch and the activities of voluntary groups who provide supportive facilities in the community for offenders and young people at risk in association with my Department's Probation and Welfare Service.  As a matter of policy, I will continue to provide all possible support to legitimate community-based activities in this area.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2153" /> Further, because imprisonment represents only one method, the most drastic one, of dealing with offenders convicted by the courts.  I have tried to encourage the development of alternatives to imprisonment and this approach has been endorsed by the recently published report of the Whitaker Committee of Inquiry into the Penal System.  In particular, some offenders who otherwise would have been sent to prison have been dealt with under the community service scheme since it was brought into operation earlier this year.</P>
    <P>Notwithstanding all these efforts, the prison service, as I have already pointed out, has had to cope with a phenomenal increase in a relatively short period of time, in the numbers in custody and in the numbers serving long sentences.  I would like to take this opportunity to compliment the service on the manner in which it has coped with these difficulties. The service performs an important task on behalf of the community and its role in the fight against crime is often overlooked.</P>
    <P>The higher numbers in custody and the limiting of early releases to those cases where special resocialisation programmes have been approved has, however, meant that, in terms of prison administration, the numbers in custody in some of the prisons have been undesirably high.  I am taking steps to ease this situation as much as possible.  A new cell block at Cork prison which will cater for 50 prisoners will be ready next year and I am looking at a number of other possibilities which could yield additional accommodation.</P>
    <P>Extra prisoners, of course, can only be accommodated at a cost, hence the need for this Supplementary Estimate.  The major cost is in respect of the higher staffing levels needed to deal with the additional numbers in custody.  Extra posts have had to be staffed in all the prisons this year in order to maintain good order and security.</P>
    <P>The total additional amount required is £2,810,000 under the subheads salaries, wages and allowances and prison services but savings elsewhere, amounting to <Col N="2154" /> £1,050,000, reduce the net additional amount required to £1,760,000.</P>
    <P>The additional amount required for salaries, wages and allowances, including overtime, is £2,350,000 and I have just referred to the reasons it is necessary. The additional amount required for prisons services is £350,000.  This subhead makes provision for offenders to be fed, clothed, provided with fuel and light, medical care and so on, and the increase in the prison population inevitably means that additional resources must be made available.  In addition there will be a shortfall of £110,000 on the Appropriations-in-aid. This is due to a shortfall in the anticipated receipts from the prisons manufacturing and farm department.</P>
    <P>Savings have been possible under four subheads.  A sum of £300,000 has been saved on subhead B &mdash; trevelling and incidental expenses &mdash; because Garda escorts were not availed of to the extent anticipated and the requirement for uniforms was not as high as had been expected.  A saving of £100,000 has been possible on subhead C &mdash; Postal and Telecommunications. A saving of £500,000 has been possible on subhead D &mdash; Buildings and Equipment &mdash; because certain contracts did not proceed as quickly as anticipated and the final saving, £150,000 on subhead G &mdash; Probation and Welfare Services &mdash; is due to the failure to identify suitable premises for use as probation workshops or hostels.</P>
    <P>The supplementary estimate for the Office of the Minister for Justice also covers the expenses of the Kerry Babies Tribunal which came in course for payment during the current year.  There was no provision in the original Estimate for the tribunal because at the time the Estimate was framed, a decision had not been taken to establish it.  The sittings lasted from 28 December 1984 to 14 June 1985.</P>
    <P>A legal team consisting of a solicitor and senior and junior counsel was appointed to assist the tribunal.  Furthermore, the tribunal allowed similar representation to the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions, to the Hayes family, the three Garda superintendents, and to 25 other gardaí.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2155" /> The expenditure this year covers the fees paid to the lawyers representing the tribunal and the Attorney General and Director of Public Prosecutions and the fees paid to stenographers.  Also included are the cost of certain witnesses' expenses, accommodation costs and the cost of equipping offices in Tralee and Dublin.</P>
    <P>Further significant expenditure will arise due to the direction made by the tribunal pursuant to section 6 of the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) (Amendment) Act, 1979 to the effect that the costs of the Hayes family, the Garda superintendents and the various other members of the Garda Síochána involved be paid by the State.  As these costs have yet to be presented and taxed it is not possible at this stage to state the amount involved.  In any event, payment will not arise in the current year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to delay the House because the time available to us to discuss this Supplementary Estimate is very inadequate.  The introduction at this stage of the Supplementary Estimates for the prison service and for the Office of the Minister is a stark and clear reflection of the state of law and order today.  We have now reached a state of emergency proportions in this respect.  There is no improvement.  The level of protection afforded to our citizens, whether on the streets, in their homes or in public places is totally inadequate. Among the many failures that will be laid at the door of this Government will be their failure to preserve law and order for the protection of the people generally.  That will rank among the major failures of the Government.</P>
      <P>My colleagues will be elaborating on these matters.  I merely wished to offer that personal opinion about the stressful state in which we find ourselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one item in this Supplementary Estimate that I wish to welcome and that is within the heading of G.3 whereby £1 million is being provided on account to meet the compensation being awarded by the Stardust Tribunal.  I am glad to be <Col N="2156" /> able to report that, so far as I am aware, the tribunal is doing its work well.  There is a practice that the applicants are not disclosing the amounts being awarded to them.  I understand that the original idea for this was that if an applicant was not accepting an award and was proceeding to the High Court, he or she would not be at liberty to disclose how much had been awarded by the tribunal.  That rule has been extended to cover all awards so that apparently the applicants are not at liberty to tell us how much they are being awarded.  I am aware, though, that there is satisfaction with the amounts being awarded and with the way in which the tribunal is discharging its very serious responsibilities.  That is a matter of satisfaction all round.  I trust that the tribunal will continue to operate as it has been operating and will continue to warrant the approval and acceptance of the families concerned.</P>
    <P>I wish particularly to express a word of thanks to the Attorney General whom, I think the Minister will agree, was the prime mover in having the tribunal established and being put into operation on such a satisfactory basis.  All of us on this side of the House have occasion from time to time to criticise the Attorney General or perhaps the law officers or the Minister for Justice, but this is one occasion on which we acknowledge gladly that when the matter of the Stardust tragedy finally came to a head, the solution put forward was carefully thought out and the matter was approached with considerable open-mindedness.  All those of us who have been involved in the Stardust question for a number of years are deeply appreciative of the tribunal's work and we hope that this long outstanding and agonising matter may be coming to a conclusion.</P>
    <P>No one will ever make up to the families for the losses they suffered but at least adequate levels of compensation are now being made available to them.  I express my appreciation at and Fianna Fail's appreciation at how the tribunal has worked.  Whereas the legal and judicial establishment cannot look back with any credit on the whole situation, at least <Col N="2157" /> this House was finally instrumental in ensuring that the matter was effectively dealt with.  I am giving hostage to fortune at this stage but I am reasonably confident that the tribunal will achieve what it was established to achieve.  While this House might not have been as expeditious in recognising the problem as we might have been, at least when it finally came to the attention of the House the House dealt with it in an effective manner.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. L.T. Cosgrave Mr. L.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. L.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Like the previous speaker I support the action which has been taken in relation to the Stardust Tribunal.  We are all aware of that great tragedy the aftermath of which still lives with the relatives of those involved.  Due to the cumbersome process of the law and to the fact that it is highly unusual for us to have such a major tragedy, until recently redress has not been found for those affected.  I and other Members of the House received correspondence from individuals affected and to date they have not received any compensation.  We all support the initiative taken by the Minister for Justice, by the Attorney General and their officials to get these cases moving.  I hope that most of the claimants will avail of this procedure which will mean that their cases can be expeditiously and fairly dealt with.  It appears that the process has worked well since its inception about six weeks ago and I hope this will continue to be the case.  We all support the money being voted towards those cases.  By this time next year we hope most of these cases will be dealt with and that people will have received some compensation, although compensation will never make up for the great loss incurred.  I have noted that lawyers move slowly and that it is a time consuming process gathering Garda reports and medical reports as obviously some of the injuries were horrific and possibly needed to be evaluated after a certain amount of time had passed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I reject what the previous speaker said in relation to there being a total emergency. I agree that we have a serious crime problem in certain areas but action <Col N="2158" /> recently taken has helped improve the situation.  When the statistics for crime come out we will see an improvement in the position.  We are all concerned at some of the recent horrific attacks which have taken place.  This sort of attack unfortunately has become part and parcel of today's world.  There have also been many robberies of houses, labour exchanges and banks.  As recenty as yesterday some art works were stolen.  We are all concerned at the crime rate but it can only be dealt with by concerted action and a positive approach towards ensuring that the Garda have the best resources and that criminals become convinced of the likelihood of their being apprehended and imprisoned for their crimes.</P>
    <P>I welcome the neighbourhood watch schemes in many areas.  It is important that these pilot schemes get full support and are monitored.  The Minister and many of us here are aware of the benefits which could ensue from these schemes. It is important to encourage the initiative of concerned people who are aware of the need for crime prevention but we must also educate people who are not so concerned as to the needs.  It is also important that facilities in Garda stations are adequate to deal with the possible extra input from the public.  Basic facilities such as telephones should be working in areas and in the stations.  In some areas only one or two houses have a phone. There must be a link up between the Department and Bord Telecom to ensure that needed phones are provided.</P>
    <P>Many of the robberies that have taken place are drug-related crimes.  While a number of people involved in these crimes have been brought to trial and convicted one worrying aspect of this difficult problem relates to bail.  Individuals who have to face up to 40 or 50 charges are out on bail and are continuing to rob.  We must look at this area seriously.  When a person is charged with a number of offences and has appeared on remand a number of times, something has to be done in relation to the application of bail. While there are rules obtaining as to how and under what circumstances bail is <Col N="2159" /> granted, we must examine that area. Even if only ensuring that money is well spent we should examine the rules of crime prevention because it appears that crime pays many people.  While there have been improvements effected in the overall crime situation it remains serious. Only through concerted effort and support for the Garda over a period of time will we ensure that the number of crimes are reduced.  I hope public support for the Garda will be maintained.</P>
    <P>Another matter mentioned was the moneys voted for the Kerry Babies' Tribunal which lasted a considerable time. We had a Bill here last week providing for an extra judge, which appointment was partly occasioned by the fact that at times there are enormous delays in cases being brought forward.  There have been several tribunals in recent years which has meant that a High Court judge has been taken out of action or prevented from performing his normal day to day duties.  However, in that case, it was important that the full facts be discovered, that the truth be established.  It was important also because it appeared there was a certain element engaging in a witch hunt against the Garda.</P>
    <P>It is important to keep things in perspective. While there have been incidents of misbehaviour on the part of some members of the Garda, that is no reason for us damning the whole force because in any large group of people there will always be bound to be one or two defaulters.  It is my opinion that the vast majority of the force are honest, decent people endeavouring to work for the people and who deserve their support.  I know the present Minister and Commissioner are more than anxious to root out any such defaulters but that is no excuse for suddenly condemning the whole force.  Probably we have all learned from the Kerry babies' case and its aftermath.</P>
    <P>I might refer briefly to our prisons system.  It is important to remember the high cost of maintaining law and order in this country and of imprisoning people, some for quite a long time, some of whom <Col N="2160" /> probably should never be freed again. Therefore, it is important to remember the high cost and also the fall out from the troubles in Northern Ireland.  We are all conscious of the concern that this part of the country should never be used as a haven.  The fact that so many people who have committed crimes in Northern Ireland are now imprisoned down here speaks for itself.  That fact should not be forgotten, particularly in view of the recent initiative which we hope will lead us some way down the road towards peace and stability.</P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will be afforded a few minutes to reply later.  Some items arising are deserving of more than a couple of hours debate.  However, because of the way we order our business, at times some of the more important matters receive less time and others, less important, receive more.  I have in mind the operation of the community service orders scheme.  The Minister might inform us as to how this scheme has been operating.  There is no doubt that some people may be sent to prison who &mdash; if that scheme was operational in certain areas &mdash; could have worked for the greater benefit of the community and themselves under the provisions of that scheme.  The operation of this scheme might be reviewed on a regional or national basis, ascertaining how many of those community service orders have been put into effect and what projects or areas have benefited therefrom.</P>
    <P>We are all aware of the problems obtaining with regard to prison accommodation and its cost.  It is not a simple matter of erecting four walls and locking up people.  We should all condemn the recent attacks on prison officers and public property.  Prisoners who have committed crimes while in prison, damaging property and so on, should be treated the same as anyone else out on the street.  It is ridiculous to see some prisoners giving an interview from a prison roof and here we must get our priorities in order.</P>
    <P>It is important that all of us give the Garda our fullest support.  It is important also that we, public representatives, advocate and facilitate neighbourhood <Col N="2161" /> watch schemes.  We can be of assistance in promoting them, putting people in touch with members of the Garda in our areas, ensuring the prevention of crime. This would bring about the link up in the chain between the public, being the eyes and ears of the Garda, and the work of the Garda themselves in those endeavours.</P>

      <P>I support the Estimate. We have no hesitation in supporting the allocation of moneys in this area provided they are spent effectively.  We should spare no cost in dealing with the present crime situation.  If you have not security you have nothing.  In effect the cost is now being passed on to the house owner and the business person through extra insurance.  We all know that house insurance has gone through the roof.  It has more than doubled and the cost of car insurance has become almost prohibitive. There is a direct cost on the State in providing security and a cost on the individual citizen.  Therefore we have no hesitation in supporting this Estimate.</P>
      <P>At the same time I note that we were presented with a revision in the budget this year when the Minister for Finance claimed that he was making £28 million savings.  He took £1.066 million from the Votes for Justice.  He has lost that.  It has been taken back from him with £2 million in addition, so it is almost £3 million in total.  Admittedly, £1 million of that is for the Stardust tribunal, so in real terms it is £2 million against £1 million cutback earlier.  Only in the context of statements made in relation to this kind of cut at budget time, and when we are told about the feasibility of it do we realise that, in the longer term, the money was more than needed.  We also needed an extra £1 million, and this is what we must deal with here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome the setting up of the Stardust victims' compensation tribunal and the funds provided here for that.  I agree with our party leader that this money has been handled very well on the part of the House.  In the putting forward of a tribunal in the first instance the House played a major part, and now the claims <Col N="2162" /> are to be settled.  It is hoped that this will help the parents, relations and friends of the victims to put behind them much of the suffering, problems and difficulty which followed that tragic event.  However, the House must be aware that the relatives and friends of the Stardust victims feel very strongly that their deaths will have been in vain if the fire regulations are not implemented and higher standards of safety put in train for the protection of ordinary citizens.  That was as important to the relatives of the victims as the mere money aspect, and they made that point very clearly.  I appreciate that the tribunal will put an end to the repetition of many of the details of the tragic event.  The House has played an honourable role in making that arrangement and we have great pleasure in supporting the provision here for the tribunal.  The people on the ground want the House to ensure that this kind of tragedy can never happen again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Woods</NameTxt>
      <P>In the general area of crime there is something radically wrong with the administration of law and order for which the Minister for Justice is responsible.  Violent crime is increasing and the chance of being caught has reached an all time low.  Two areas indicate this very clearly.  Between 1980 and 1984 burglaries in private homes in the Dublin area increased from 6,591 to 12,073 but the detection rate fell from 41 per cent to a new low of 24.4 per cent. In other words, three out of every four or 75 per cent of house burglaries went undetected.  Armed robberies are once again on the increase.  Recent figures from the Department of Justice show that with 457 armed robberies in the first nine <Col N="2163" /> months of this year, only 10 per cent of the money stolen was recovered.  Similarly, in 1984, 90 per cent of the money and property stolen were not recovered.</P>
      <P>This is a hopeless record which this administration seem incapable of facing up to.  If we are to reduce crime then there must be a deterrent.  The potential criminal must know that he will be caught, exposed and punished for his crime.  He must see that his friends and associates are caught.  It must be clear to people that crime will not pay, that if your friends are involved in crime it will not pay in their case and if you are involved they will see that it will not pay you.  Otherwise you create a whole environment in which crime pays.  At present in these respects crime is paying in the Dublin metropolitan area.  Most crime is undetected and the goods are not recovered.</P>
      <P>The Minister mentioned some of his policies in relation to that.  His policy in relation to the adoption of a number of remedies and measures has had every support and encouragement in this House.  Indeed, many of the ideas which have been put into practice came from the House and Members on all sides of the House will give this area their utmost support, but the Minister's policy of confrontation is a disaster.  He needs the support of the prison service, yet he has confronted and insulted them at every opportunity.  Publicly he boasts about how he has humiliated them and in this House he has done the same thing.  He seems to take pleasure in the fact that he has beaten the prison officers in some way.  He said on 9 May 1985, and I quote from the Official Report, column 630, Volume 358:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is part of the folklore which is propagated in statements from the Prison Officers Association, particularly by their secretary, Mr. McEvoy, who because of an industrial dispute in Mountjoy Prison which gave me and the Department and this House control of the prisons again after they had been run by a trade union for many years, <Col N="2164" /> is running a vendetta ever since and he is disseminating incorrect information to Deputies on the other side of the House and to the media.</P>
    <P>That is only one small reference to the kind of thing with which we are all familiar now, the Minister confronting his own prison officers through the media. Indeed, this morning further confrontation and disagreement are reported in the papers in relation to the Portlaoise outbreak.  The Minister comes into the House to ask us for moneys for additional support for the prison service.  He says they are doing a good job catering for a larger number of inmates than ever before, and we have no hesitation in giving that support.  However, publicly he humilitates and confronts them repeatedly.  He should change his policy of confrontation.  It may get good media coverage from day to day but in the longer term it is not a good policy.  These are his officers and he should learn to work and develop the service with them, however hard he must be in doing that.</P>
    <P>The Garda are also frustrated.  They do not seem to trust the Minister.  They see him trying to use the new proposed complaints procedure to deny them their basic right to silence.  They too still await the introduction of new powers of arrest embodied in the Criminal Justice Act. Both of these services urgently need new management thinking and a radical new approach to training.  There is no question about that and those involved want somebody to give them a lead in regard to new management thinking and new training methods.  Until that happens they cannot radically improve their contribution to the maintenance of law and order which is vital.  The Minister in his statement recognises that.</P>
    <P>The devastation of Spike Island gave an insight into the lack of management, the lack of planning and follow-through by the Minister, matters that are far too serious for the Minister to fob off in the way he did.  There was no plan or strategy of support and back-up on Spike Island in the event of a break-out.  Indeed, I understand that there is still no special <Col N="2165" /> back-up for gardaí in that area.  I hope the Minister will outline the measures taken to ensure that we do not have a repetition of those incidents.  The selection procedures were allowed to deteriorate and the lives of civilians and staff were put at risk.</P>
    <P>The Minister has repeatedly refused to put a figure on the damage and we do not have an estimate in the figures before us. That money had to be found and was put into the system without Members being given details of it.  When I pressed the Minister about the cost of the damage he did not give us any figure but said it would be tied up with the new development work on prisons.  It is worth noting that the Minister did not show any such reluctance when he commented on the damage in Mountjoy Prison in November 1983.  On that occasion he attempted to blame the prison officers.  In contrast, he is aware that in regard to Spike Island he has but himself to blame for the loss. Perhaps that is why we cannot get the figures.</P>
    <P>The Minister must change his attitude and give his wholehearted support to the Garda and to prison officers.  He has to take the good with the bad.  He must stand behind them when things are tough at their end even if that involves public relations problems.  Those people must deal daily with the criminal and the bully and must be prepared to take them on. One is forced to ask if the Minister is compromised by the events he engineered. Is he a prisoner of his own confrontations and a cause of mistrust and low morale?  We are adopting a fresh and modern approach to management and training in our State and semi-State bodies and I should like to know why this is not happening in regard to the Garda and the prison service where it is badly needed.  The same type of management techniques which we see applying to State and semi-State bodies are badly needed in the Garda Síochána.  Members of the force are looking for a morale boost and for targets to be set for them by people who know something about management. The Minister should give his attention to this.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2166" /> The Minister's attitude to the drug problem is a cause for concern.  Drugs are still the greatest single cause of crime and our courts and prisons show this clearly with the high percentage of offenders being drug abusers.  However, the Minister appears to be complacent about this problem.  He seems to have lost the drive and sense of urgency needed. Repeatedly he tells us that the heroin problem has plateaued out but that type of talk from the Minister breeds complacency in the services and hence vigilance at ports and airports is reduced, especially at weekends.  The Minister cites the fact that 70 per cent of drug seizures in 1984 were made by gardaí who were not members of the Drug Squad and puts that figure forward as an achievement.  It is an achievement in its own right but does it not show how diffuse the problem has become?  The problem has spread out and ordinary gardaí are coming in contact with the drug problem. The Garda in 1982 and since have been successful in putting well identified big dealers behind bars but many smaller dealers moved in to take their place.  They must be tackled vigorously and shown that there will not be any let-up at any level.</P>
    <P>I was disturbed recently to hear the Minister say, in replying to questions, that he did not know about the position at our ports and so on.  Who is co-ordinating the attack on drugs?  I am aware that a task force was established but we have not heard much about it in recent times. The Minister for Justice should co-ordinate all efforts.  With cutbacks and pressure on overtime other sectors, such as the customs service, may find it difficult to provide the necessary manpower to watch our ports and airports effectively. It appears that that has been eased up. The Minister should discuss the matter with the Minister for Finance to try to ensure that the drive is kept up at all levels.  If vigilance slackens the drug problem will increase rapidly.</P>
    <P>The position in our prisons is still chaotic and it appears that there is little difficulty in getting supplies of drugs into Mountjoy.  In recent times two drug <Col N="2167" /> related deaths occurred in that prison and at the same time it was reported that 20 out of 26 women there were there for drug related crimes.  We have been told that that figure is usually one-third. Reports suggest that the position is similar in regard to male inmates.  The Minister may argue about those figures but it appears that a substantial proportion of those inmates are there because of drug related crimes.</P>
    <P>There is no secure facility for the screening and detoxification of drug addicted prisoners.  We have raised that matter with the Minister on many occasions in the last two years and we learn that the problem is still critical. Unfortunately, it is not until there is a major issue that action is taken.  At the root of our prison problem lies the decision taken by the Minister to cut the estimates for the prison capital building programme by £6 million in 1983 and 1984.  I note that in this Estimate there will be a saving on the prison building programme of £500,000 which will go to offset additional costs.  That seems to indicate that this year the Minister will spend most of the money allocated to him for that programme.</P>
    <P>At the end of 1984 the Minister handed back a further £6 million which was not spent.  This year only £500,000 is being handed back from the allocation.  Belatedly, he is providing capital needed this year, but his cutback in this area has set back the building programme by two to three years.</P>
    <P>I am somewhat surprised that in these Supplementary Estimates there is no provision for a supplementary allocation for Garda pay and overtime &mdash; overtime, in particular.  On being questioned earlier, the Minister said that he would be making a special provision in the autumn so that the towns, rural areas and particularly the cities would be protected notwithstanding the fact that in October he was moving more members of the Garda towards the Border.  We asked him then what measures he planned to ensure the continuance of adequate protection in the cities and the high crime areas, particularly coming up to Christmas.  We see <Col N="2168" /> that it is intended to send more Garda to the Border area and it would appear that one of the effects of the Anglo-Irish Agreement will be fewer gardaí on the streets of Dublin.  We would like to hear how the Minister plans to overcome this problem and provide for an adequate police force, particularly in the major crime areas.  Perhaps he would clarify the position when replying and also deal with the further question of the additional resources which are being committed to that area.  There is a particularly bad situation in certain communities, almost a total breakdown of law and order.  It is to these areas that the manpower must be committed.</P>
    <P>Another aspect is that of the task force. We are told that the Minister is sending a new task force group of approximately 30 members to the Border but we know that as part of the savings in Garda pay and overtime he set about systematically disestablishing the security and intelligence network established by his predecessors. These had proved to be highly effective in dealing with serious crime and subversion.  Armed robbery is now coming back on to the streets, in Dublin in particular.  It is one phenomenon to be seen in recent statistics.  There is a need for this type of task force in the city to deal with armed crime which is not apparently, from the reports given by the Minister, of a subversive nature.  The Minister made a serious mistake when he totally disbanded the task forces and greatly restricted the activities of the special task force based in Dublin.  There was a clear need for reorganisation of the divisional task force, but to disband the 45 units, comprising some 300 members strategically placed throughout the country, was to incur an unacceptable level of risk, especially in the Border area.</P>
    <P>The Minister is now thinking of reestablishing a task force, in what form we do not know.  We must wait and see. Non-subversive robbery is a particularly frightening type of robbery and perhaps the Minister would look at the reintroduction of the special task force.  When media people ask the Minister what he is doing, the terminology that he uses can <Col N="2169" /> be very important.  He kept insisting then that the task forces were not being disbanded and in response to a question said that the Garda authorities had in recent months made certain organisational changes under which the members of those divisional task forces had been integrated with the detective units in the various Garda divisions in which they operated.  The Commissioner happened to say, in an interview reported in <i>The Sunday Press</i> that they had been disbanded, but that was a slip between the Minister and the Commissioner.  Effectively, they were disbanded and their availability was gone.  Their freedom of movement and the overtime available which allowed that kind of freedom were gone.  We want this non-subversive armed robbery curbed before it develops any further.</P>
    <P>I want to raise another question with regard to the Department of Justice.  We have been concerned recently with the investigations carried out by the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; television team on the subject of moneylending and this question has been raised in the House in another context. The Minister is responsible for dealing with this very serious area in which very defenceless people are being tackled by these moneylenders.  The insights given by the members of the St. Vincent de Paul and the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; team showed that people were being required to pay from 64 per cent to 200 per cent interest on loans to buy the normal necessities of life, for Christmas time, for ESB bills and so on.  I am acquainted with one or two cases where people got into difficulties with their mortgages and got into the hands of these moneylenders.  In one of the cases in which I was involved the rate of interest was over 70 per cent.</P>
    <P>People are being canvassed by these moneylenders.  Some of the companies have no licences and are spread throughout the country.  One was named Jordan Estates in Dublin and it had branches outside Dublin for which it was alleged there were no certificates.  They were owned by Enigma Variations which had 50 per cent of funds coming in from the New Ireland Company and 40 per cent <Col N="2170" /> from Guinness Mahon.  There was quite an extraordinary linkage there from the normal financial procedure back to what was shown to be illegal moneylending.  It was shown that Jordan Estates canvassed by letter drops asking, &ldquo;Do you need money for Christmas?&rdquo; Apparently they do not require the signature of a spouse. They admitted to rates of interest in excess of 39 per cent.  In one instance in Waterford there was talk about 64 per cent interest, including a 10 per cent service charge.</P>
    <P>This is an extremely serious matter and we want to see the law enforced in regard to it.  We want the imposition of increased penalties.  Law enforcement is a normal part of the procedure carried out by the Minister for Justice.  He should use the powers that exist under the Act to crack down on these moneylenders who make excessive demands.  Admittedly, these powers can be strengthened and the penalties can be increased.  What investigations has the Minister made following these disquieting disclosures?  Why did the Garda not act in these cases, and act sooner?  We are allowing poor people to be exploited and the police must have known that this was happening.  What is wrong with our society is that these things can happen, people hear about them and the law is not implemented.  If the Minister is serious, this is also an area where the law will have to be implemented. The Act gives the Minister fairly wide authority to make regulations.  He could be taking steps to ensure that this kind of bleeding of people who are in serious difficulties is stopped.  Section 6 (6) of the Moneylenders Act, 1933, states:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Justice shall make rules with respect to the procedure to be followed in making applications for certificates (including the notices to be given of intention to make such an application), and certificates shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the rules so made.</P>
    <P>It also states that the Minister may make regulations.  It is very clear on restrictions on moneylenders.  One is not allowed to canvass or to charge more than 39 per <Col N="2171" /> cent.  It shall also be illegal to charge on any sum on account of costs or charges or expenses incidental or relating to negotiations for the granting of loans or proposed loans.  The illegality of all these actions is clearly spelled out in the Act, but the penalties should be brought up to date and strengthened.  If the Minister would put forward an emergency measure to increase the penalties in this area he would certainly have our support.  This kind of updating should be a matter of routine.</P>
    <P>Specific individuals were mentioned in this programme and I presume the Minister will ensure that any allegations are investigated.  It is suggested that one of these people is an appointee of the Taoiseach to a certain body but nevertheless I am sure the Minister will pursue the matter and examine it in detail.</P>

Such recommendations would have been particularly interesting and valuable in relation to the new complaints procedure which will be <Col N="2172" /> coming before the House shortly for finalisation.</P>
      <P>We have no hestitation in supporting this Estimate because we are quite happy to give the Minister this support in tackling difficulties in relation to law and order and security within the State.  He will have our full and wholehearted support for expenditure in this area.  I ask him to look seriously at the overall management of the law enforcement agencies, the Garda Síochána and the Prison Service, and think about giving them a management uplift of the type which has been given to other areas of State activity.  They are ready and anxious to have it and the Minister should set about it at the earliest possible opportunity.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I also welcome this Supplementary Estimate.  One of my worries is whether we are getting value for money, for example under the criminal legal aid scheme.  The Minister said there was a constitutional obligation to provide legal aid to accused persons arising from a Supreme Court decision.  There is to be a 10 per cent increase in the amount provided for this scheme, bringing it up to £2.2 million.  Having monitored the service in the Cork region, I am very unhappy about the quality of the services being offered to persons under this scheme.  It needs major improvement.</P>
      <P>I have seen cases where accused persons have been brought into court and offered legal aid, their legal advisers have consulted with them for a brief period and the cases have been presented.  The whole thing was haphazard.  A lot of money is spent by the State and I wonder if we are getting value for that money and if people brought before the courts are getting justice.  I am speaking from experience, having visited the courts and seen how the system works.  It is run on a &ldquo;rush in, rush out, and collect your fee&rdquo; basis in many cases.  There are also many honourable people involved in the service. I ask the Minister to consider this whole question in view of the large amount of taxpayers' money involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The whole system of the administration of justice has been causing me <Col N="2173" /> much worry recently.  There are appalling inefficiencies in the system, manifested in recent court decisions.  In a recent case a person was convicted by a jury of serious assault on an elderly farmer and his invalid daughter.  They were beaten to pulp.  The man ended up in hospital and his daughter is still being cared for. Although a person was convicted, he walked free from the court because of a series of legal cock-ups.  When I tried to question it in the Dáil I was told it was none of our business and that it was outside our jurisdiction.  We have very serious obligations to ask questions about these matters especially when people are losing confidence in the court system because of these cock-ups and when the morale of the Garda is seriously affected because of legal games.  When people walk free because of these games it is time to question what is happening in the courts.  I am asking the Minister seriously to consider major reform of the court system.  Can we afford the present system whereby two senior counsel, two junior counsel and a solicitor represent both sides in a case?</P>
    <P>The cost of insurance has gone through the roof not just because of jury awards. The Minister has taken action in that regard and, although such action is welcome, it will not solve the problem because money is being drained out of the system through over-representation by the legal profession in the courts. There is no will to reform and they give very good reasons why there should not be reforms or change.  However, businesses are closing down because they cannot afford insurance premiums.  The Minister should make reform in this area one of his priorities in the months ahead.</P>
    <P>If he did nothing else between now and leaving office he would have done a good job.  The legal profession do not wish to be involved in reform but the Taoiseach is responsible for the Law Reform Commission and he should tell them to introduce proposals for reform and to make positive recommendations which would bring about major changes.  Of course, when politicians raise their voices about reforms in the legal profession, they are <Col N="2174" /> told they do not know what they are talking about, that it is a matter for the profession.  It is not; it affects everybody and if the professions are not willing to implement reforms someone else will have to do it.</P>
    <P>I will give an example of how the legal profession close ranks.  Criticism was made in June by a High Court judge in Cork regarding the performance of the profession there.  Although he half retracted the statement the following day, there are inefficiencies and the President of the High Court, in an unprecedented move, went to Cork outside the court term to tell them to get their act together.  They still denied that there was a problem but there is a problem and until politicians assert their authority the problems will continue.  The Minister must do something in this regard as soon as possible because, if the Garda do not get the support of the courts, their morale suffers.</P>
    <P>The Leader of the Opposition strongly criticised the Minister for his handling of the crime problem.  However, there have been major improvements recently. Spike Island, despite many misgivings, has been a success.  The epidemic of car stealing and rammings in Cork has been eliminated and the people responsible are behind bars.  Except for isolated incidents, the problem has been eradicated by the Minister's positive action.  There were problems in regard to Spike Island but mistakes often follow decisions.  I commend the Minister for his positive action in relation to Spike Island and I am glad there is to be a programme of reconstruction there.</P>
    <P>Even in Dublin there is a 20 per cent reduction in the figures for car stealing and that is an indication that the Minister is doing his job.  I am glad the Minister recognises that prisons are only ways of treating the symptoms of crime and that he is aware that the root causes are deprivation, bad housing, unemployment and other factors which we must continue to tackle.  Until these problems are tackled fully and eliminated, crime will continue and our prisons will need to be expanded.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2175" /> I should also like to refer to the problem which has been highlighted recently of moneylenders.  <i>The Cork Examiner</i> ran a series of major articles long before the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme.  The newspaper alleged that children's allowance books are being confiscated by moneylenders who are also taking social welfare payments.  I should like the Minister to say what liaison there is between his Department and the Department of Social Welfare to eliminate this problem. If there are prosecutions in relation to the disclosures made in the media, will the Minister give an assurance that some of the untouchables will be brought to justice?  Moneylenders come from all classes of society and are the vultures of society, feeding on the misfortunes of the underprivileged.  Unless prosecutions and conviction follow, the system will be brought into question.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Minister on his positive approach to crime in recent years. The esteem in which he is held by the Garda and the manner in which he has refused to become involved in interference with the Garda in recent years is something of which we can be proud. He has re-established the standards we expect from public officials.</P>

      <P>Like our spokesman, Deputy Woods, I fully support the Estimate which the Minister introduced today.  I was very pleased to see our spokesman back in the House and able to take the lead in regard to this very important Estimate.</P>
      <P>This Estimate reflects the rapidly changing scene in society, especially over the past five or six years.  I hold the view that ten years ago the need for a Supplementary Estimate of this kind would not have arisen.  The danger is that the Estimate itself and the vary serious problem which it reflects could pass through this House with the same routine as other Estimates and with a sigh of relief from Members on the Government side that another embarrassing matter has been disposed of.</P>

      <Col N="2176" /> The purpose of the Fianna Fáil contribution to this debate is not to embarrass the Minister or the Government, but rather we consider the House should have an opportunity to debate the very serious deterioration in law and order and, I hope, to give the Minister an opportunity of outlining Government proposals to deal with the problem.  I was disappointed that the Minister did not give the House an indication of any new proposals he might have to deal with the very serious deterioration in law and order.</P>
    <P>The complacency with which increasing crime and violence is being accepted in society today reflects a sense of helplessness and despair by our people and, I am sorry to have to say, a lack of confidence in Government and in this House even to contain the problem.  If we have fallen into the same trap of complacency, then the situation is very serious and the House must insist on the Minister bringing in, as quickly as possible, a programme of action, and I deliberately place emphasis on the word &ldquo;action&rdquo;. This is necessary lest we become a nation in which crime is accepted as the norm and our citizens, young and old, will feel insecure and helpless.  We read in the papers day after day, and we listen to our news bulletins and hear about the continuing litany of crime under various headings.  What at one time would be regarded as a nine day wonder, is now a one or two day wonder, because the next day brings a new headline, a new tragedy. This is a further indication of the very serious deterioration which has taken place in law and order in recent years.</P>
    <P>I am glad Deputy Allen made some constructive comments on this very important Estimate.  Whatever line of defence the Minister takes when replying to this debate he must accept that the deterioration in law and order has reached alarming proportions, that the nature of crime has become more vicious, that there is an element of fear in communities and homes which did not previously exist and that our Garda, despite their best efforts are frustrated in their attempts to come to grips with the crime problem.  A few days ago we heard what <Col N="2177" /> I consider to be an alarming statistic in this House.  The Minister replying to a question about armed robberies said that £2.5 million was taken in 440 armed robberies over the past 12 months.  That is an alarming figure.</P>
    <P>I referred earlier to complacency. When preparing my contribution to this debate I went to the Library to look over a month's papers.  From 19 November to 5 December we had the following headlines: on 19 November, &ldquo;Widow Dies after Brutal Attack&rdquo;; 20 November, &ldquo;Alert for AIDS in Mountjoy Prison&rdquo;; 22 November, &ldquo;Two Die in Arson Attack&rdquo;; 23 November, &ldquo;Garda Probe Drug Involvement in City Blaze&rdquo;; &ldquo;Rapist Jailed for Nine Years&rdquo;; 25 November, &ldquo;Men had Gun and Explosives&rdquo; relating to the very serious attempted outbreak from Portlaoise Prison; 26 November, &ldquo;Warders Beaten up in Portlaoise Prison Search&rdquo;, this arose from the attempted outbreak; &ldquo;Indecent Assault Charge&rdquo;; 27 November, &ldquo;£115,000 Arrest Warrant Backlog&rdquo;, this related to the number of uncollected court fines; 28 November, &ldquo;Hunt for Wicklow Stranglers&rdquo;, we all recall with sadness that particular event; 29 November, &ldquo;Mother Found Murdered&rdquo;; 30 November, &ldquo;Moneylender Slams RTE Programme&rdquo;; 3 December, &ldquo;Many Rape Cases Still Untried&rdquo;&mdash; that newspaper report indicated that half the rape cases since 1979 have not yet been dealt with in our courts; and 5 December, &ldquo;Brutal Attack on Housewife&rdquo;.  Apart from the startling revelation in relation to armed robberies, in less than three weeks those are the kind of tales our national newspapers unfortunately had to record.  I did not go out of my way to pick a particularly good or bad month to find these statistics.  I simply picked out a month's file and went through it methodically. The data in these headlines which I have read into the report are very relevant to the debate.</P>
    <P>I know the Minister will endeavour &mdash; and I do not blame him for this &mdash; to bring forward statistics showing that the level of crime is on the decrease.  As a matter of fact, I saw figures published <Col N="2178" /> some time ago which seemed to indicate that there is a welcome reduction under certain headings.  We on this side of the House, and I am sure Government Deputies as well as the general public, always welcome any indication which reveals a reduction in the level of crime.  Whatever statistics may show, the Minister will have to admit that our newspapers and news bulletins continually unfold a litany of crime, to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The time has come for the Minister to introduce a new co-ordinated plan to deal with crime.  This plan should involve all the relevant State agencies.  However, there is nothing in the Estimate before us to indicate that the Minister is seriously considering the introduction of such a plan to deal with this serious problem.  In my opinion there is a direct link between the level of crime and the social and economic conditions prevailing at any given time.</P>
    <P>In fairness to the Minister, it must be said he is now carrying the can for the Government's failure in their various economic and social policies in the past three years.  I do not think even the Minister would disagree that the present high and growing level of unemployment is a major factor in the crime rate.  It is alarming to note that the policies the Government are continuing to pursue are contributing further to that problem.  In the past week in the newspapers there was evidence of a further frightening increase in the unemployment level.</P>
    <P>I have not the time to deal in detail with the effects of overall Government policy on the crime rate except to say that it is a major factor and the situation is getting worse.  I make the following comment by way of passing reference.  I will give the Minister one small example of where I think the social policy of this Government is totally falling down and is a major contributory factor in the deterioration of law and order.  In the Estimate today there is provision for £50 million for additional social welfare expenditure.  Let us take the case of a family, a husband, wife, two unemployed sons and three unemployed daughters <Col N="2179" /> living in Dublin city or in any of the major urban areas.  If the three unemployed daughters apply for social welfare assistance they will not be successful because they are residing at home with their parents.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that the end of the passing reference?  It has no bearing on the Estimate before the House.  It is not a matter for the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Chair will bear with me for a moment I will demonstrate to the Minister the effect of policies outside his administration on our crime rate.  The only way open to those unemployed daughters is to leave their home.  If they do this they will qualify for maximum unemployment assistance.  Is that not a total undermining of the family unit and an example of a family being put at risk? That kind of social and economic neglect by the Government is a major contributory factor in our crime rate.  I have not the time to deal with the failure of the Government in their various economic and social policies and even if I had it is obvious to me at this stage that the Chair would not tolerate it.</P>
      <P>The almost daily transit of money between one Government Department and another is a matter of grave concern. Surely at this time it is not unreasonable to ask the Minister, in co-operation with his colleagues in Government, to take the necessary action to eliminate the continuous movement of money between one Government Department and another and between the Department of Social Welfare and the various offices. Of its nature this places at risk the lives of public servants.  It puts an unnecessary demand on the Garda Síochána and it necessitates additional security arrangements but the greatest single factor is the risk to public servants, and particularly the gardaí.  We recall with sadness the tragic loss of life as an indirect result of this inter-departmental arrangement where money is transported on the roads every day and we recall with sadness the gardaí killed in recent incidents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even in the past week another robbery <Col N="2180" /> took place in similar circumstances but the Government have not taken any positive action.  I want the Minister to tell the House if this matter will be dealt with in the near future.  I deliberately use the words &ldquo;in the near future&rdquo;.  One of the great problems in this area of Government administration is that we always seem to be reacting after the event.  It is a case of reaction, not anticipation.  In the light of our experience an immediate solution must be found to ensure that the lives of our gardaí and of other public servants are not put at risk.  We owe this to them, as well as to the people who run our post offices, employment exchanges and health boards.  Government performance in areas of economic and social management is always reflected and can be evaluated accurately in the level of crime and lawlessness.</P>
    <P>In any debate it is helpful and logical to analyse the factors associated with any problem and to evaluate the effectiveness of the measures adopted by Government to deal with them.  An examination of the case history of those convicted of crimes, especially young offenders, indicates that the majority come from deprived backgrounds where they have had little control of their destinies, and we as legislators have failed to provide them with opportunities and work to help them to live fruitful lives in their own communities.</P>
    <P>It is true to say that not all of them come from such a background.  There are those who deliberately choose crime as a career and who organise it in a professional manner with total disregard for the lives of the public, particularly of those entrusted with the job of protecting the lives of citizens.  This House must ensure that the full resources of the State will be available to stamp this out.  Prevention is better than cure, and with good economic management and social commitment by the Government, crime could be reduced considerably.</P>
    <P>Having endeavoured to demonstrate the Government's dismal failure in the economic sphere and in the preservation of law and order, I will turn my attention to the Minister's efforts to deal with the <Col N="2181" /> prevention and the commission of crime and with the matter of detention of criminals. The final matter has been a disaster under this Minister's administration and has resulted in the complete erosion of public confidence in our capacity to deal with violent crime.</P>
    <P>Since taking on the role of deputy spokesman on justice, I have had the opportunity to give some serious thought to this problem, and I have met community groups, Garda representatives and members of the Prison Officers' Association.  I do not think I am being unfair when I say that never has there been such a feeling of fear among communities and lack of morale among the Garda and prison officers.  It is at a very low ebb.  This was referred to by Deputy Woods in his contribution.</P>
    <P>The problems I have outlined, which the Minister knows to be correct, form a recipe for disaster.  Communities need protection and the only people who can provide it are the Garda, working in co-operation with local communities.  It goes without saying that if we are to deal effectively with crime we must have an effective system of custody.  If these two elements of State security are in any way undermined we will not win the battle against crime and criminals, and I appeal personally to the Minister to see that his and the Department's relations with the Garda and the prison officers, particularly the latter, will be improved quickly.</P>
    <P>The time has come for an end to the cold war between the Department and the prison officers.  I do not say in a political way that the Minister is responsible because I appreciate his commitment to his work, but he must encourage co-operation between the two bodies I am referring to and the Department.  Both groups do a difficult job on behalf of the nation, but if relations between them and the Minister and his officials are not harmonious, we will not get the level of output or commitment possible in regard to State security.  I hope that in his reply the Minister will indicate that he has plans for an immediate resumption of harmonious discussions and dialogue with the prison officers.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2182" /> The Garda have been going through a difficult period and they should not be discouraged, nor should the public perception of them be coloured by the events which have occurred in the past 12 months.  Neither the Garda nor the public condone such occurrences.  I am afraid we are not sufficiently supportive of the Garda in their fight against crime and violence in our streets.  The Garda are labouring under the shadow of the Garda complaints body whose establishment was advocated strongly by my party.</P>

Defence Force regulations provide that awards of a Military Medal for Gallantry or a Distinguished Service Medal shall be made by the Minister for Defence on the recommendation of a military board appointed by the Chief of Staff for that purpose.  There is no other power to make awards.  While many cases are considered in accordance with the regulations, awards are made only in relatively few instances.  The cases of the victims of the Niemba ambush, with the exception of Trooper Anthony Browne, were not found to come within the circumstances in which awards might be made.</P>

      <P>I would not wish the House or the general public or, particularly, the relatives of the victims to consider that there is any less regard for the victims in respect of whom medals have not been awarded than there is for the victim in respect of whom a medal was awarded.  Neither can it be implied that there was any less gallantry on the part of those victims.  The regulations relating to the awarding of a military medal are very specific.  It is for a board to make a recommendation to the Minister.  That is the only way in which medals are awarded.  At the time the board in question considered a number of recommendations and after a full investigation decided that in accordance with the regulations, and I wish to emphasise that, to make one award.  That does not imply that there was any lack of gallantry on the part of the other victims.  It was merely a question of there not being evidence before the board that would enable them to make awards in the other cases.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The regulations provide for the awarding of a Military Medal for Gallantry or of a Distinguished Service Medal.  It is prescribed specifically in those regulations as to how these awards are to be made.  I can visualise practical difficulties in trying to devise criteria for <Col N="2187" /> the awarding of other medals.  One practical, unfortunate and unwarranted effect would be the suggestion that somehow the other medals were not as meritorious or were somehow second-class compared with the medals awarded in accordance with the criteria specified in the regulations. That is one practical reason.  The fact that a medal was awarded in respect of one victim only is not in any way a reflection on the courage of the other victims.</P>

      <P>I find the Minister's reply extraordinary.  Is he aware that arising from a submission from Senator Brendan Ryan to the Committee on Public Expenditure, that the magazine, <i>World Missile Forecast,</i> indicated that the Ray Rider RBS70 is unsuitable for a country like Ireland because of the inclement weather we experience, can he indicate whether he considers this to be the case and assuming that the information is available anyway in military magazines, can he indicate the cost of the missiles that have been bought?</P>

      <P>Could the Minister give <Col N="2191" /> an indication of the number of people recruited to the FCA so far in 1985, if there has been any increase in the total number of the FCA reserve over 1984 and if he has any plans to encourage and expand the numbers joining the FCA in 1986?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The strength of the FCA at 31 December 1984 was 15,834 men and at the end of October this year it was 15,215.  Recruitment is ongoing and the strength goes up and down, some of it depending on the date on which one takes account.  Recruiting will continue during 1986 to replace wastage which runs at a fairly high rate due to personnel going non effective.  In most units there are sufficient vacancies for the applicants but there are occasional units where there might not be vacancies.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that wastage seems to be abnormally high having regard to the fact that there are 600 fewer FCA men this year than there were last year.  Can the Minister give an indication that the numbers will be restored at least to the figure we had at December last year or if he has any plans to recruit more people to the FCA in view of the large number of able bodied unemployed people available?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>The figure is 600 less because the figure for this year related to October and the figure for last year related to the end of the year.  Recruiting is a continuing process and it could be that by the end of the year the figures could be up on last year's figures.  There is not a need for advertising for recruits. All the units have vacancies and it is well known in the areas in question that there are vacancies and that any young man who wants to join will be very welcome.</P>

      <P>The drop in students attending full time third level educational courses is due to a changed system of sending cadets to university.

    <Speaker pid="SeanMcCarthy" hpid="Dr. McCarthy Dr. McCarthy">
      <NameTxt>Dr. McCarthy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the efforts which have been made to promote Civil Defence during the past year; the amount of money allocated for this purpose, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>During 1985 Civil Defence has been promoted in a multiplicity of ways.  The most noteworthy of these was the national fall-out exercise, &ldquo;Network 85&rdquo;, in March which featured televised addresses to the public by the Minister of State with special responsibility for Civil Defence.  In my addresses, I spoke of the purpose and value of Civil Defence and appealed for volunteers to join the organisation.</P>
      <P>As in previous years, competitions were held for the welfare, casualty, auxiliary fire and rescue services.  The national finals of these competitions in 1985 were held in Dún Laoghaire, Athlone, Dundalk and Wexford town respectively.  The exercises and presentation functions, which were hosted by the Minister of State received widespread media attention and were attended by broad cross-sections of local dignitaries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the purpose of training primarily, volunteers give significant assistance with <Col N="2194" /> events such as the &ldquo;Triathlon&rdquo; in Sligo in June, the scout jamboree in Galway in August and the Nissan international classic cycle race which passed through the Deputy's own county in September. The publicity attendant on these and similar events helped to promote the image of Civil Defence.</P>
    <P>Other activities such as involvement in search and rescue operations, assistance at accidents and the holding of weekend training camps in summer all continued to promote Civil Defence as an active and effective organisation nationwide throughout 1985.</P>
    <P>In regard to cost, the Deputy will appreciate from what I have said that I see the promotion of Civil Defence as a significant element in almost all the activities of the organisation.  It is impossible, therefore, to identify the particular cost of such promotion in the total Civil Defence allocation.  The specific provision for Civil Defence in the Defence Vote for 1985 was £1,720,000, which represented a significant increase over the allocations for previous years.  Early in 1985, a major issue of equipment for Civil Defence, comprising six ambulances, five landrovers, ten lighting and rescue sets and a fire appliance, was made to the local authorities.  The total value of the equipment was in excess of £250,000.  The issue of a new uniform for volunteers, which commenced in 1984, continued in 1985 and has contributed greatly to the morale and image of the volunteers.</P>
    <P>In general, it is the experience of the Civil Defence organisation that Civil Defence is best promoted by a good public perception of the organisation. The perception applies at several levels. At recruiting level, volunteers seen engaging effectively in interesting and worth-while activities is the best recruiting medium.  Again, as the organisation is based on the local authorities, it is important to have the goodwill of the members and officials of those authorities. The support of public representatives and other dignitaries is also, of course, of major importance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Defence the total number of new recruits taken into the Army in 1985 to date and if he will make a statement on Army recruitment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>In the period 1 January to 31 October, 1985, 502 recruits were enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force.  A further 610 recruits will be enlisted by the end of December.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="NoelTracey" hpid="Mr. N. Treacy Mr. N. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. N. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister indicate to the House the percentage increase in the number within the forces represented by the final total on 31 December over this time last year and whether he has any plans in 1986 to encourage further recruitment to our Defence Forces?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickMarkCooney" hpid="Mr. Cooney Mr. Cooney">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cooney</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the exact figures but the numbers will be approximately 350 to 400 of an increase in the <Col N="2198" /> forces.  At this stage I cannot say what will be the recruiting position next year; a lot depends on wastage.</P>

      <P>No, the recruiting procedure is done by way of interview board. Obviously one of the factors which would impress the board, though I cannot say for sure, would be satisfactory service in the FCA, showing an interest in a military career, demonstrating familiarity with the military way of life.  I imagine that would tend to make a recruit attractive although it would not necessarily be a deciding factor.  The information I have <Col N="2199" /> been receiving from recruiting officers is that the standard of recruit offering to join the Defence Forces has been extremely high.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>At present there is a service operated by a small number of full time and part time staff.  I have to say that there are only 11 full time welfare officers operating in eight Departments and offices at present.  Other Departments have a part time service, usually provided by an officer in the personnel section, while some Departments have no service at all but deal with problems that arise on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis.  For some <Col N="2200" /> time the Government have been concerned about this situation.  We have been having discussions with the staff representatives.  We hope to have further discussions with them next week when we will be discussing specific proposals, including the numbers, grading and activities of staff who might be engaged on a full time basis in the welfare service.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Without meaning to be critical, because I am sure this position has been built up over a number of years, and not in any way downgrading the very valuable work done by the present welfare service, would the Minister argue that a staff of 11 just could not carry on the necessary service in a meaningful way?  Will the Minister ensure that an adequate, not over-staffed, but an adequate welfare service will be provided for the Civil Service at an early date?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>This is an area about which I have become increasingly concerned. The welfare service does provide a range of very important back-up facilities.  But the service, because of the numbers involved, can be of a limited nature only although, as I said, the personnel section in Departments where there is not a full time welfare service available, do carry out this work also. The Government, as a good employer, have a particular responsibility in this area.  I hope it will be possible henceforth to implement improvements of a progressive nature, bearing in mind, of course, staffing difficulties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 13 and 16 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in my reply to Question No. 34 on 12 November 1985, the Government, among their White Paper decisions, intend to extend to all commercial State-sponsored bodies the statutory requirement, which already applies to some, whereby the boards of such bodies are required to have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines or Government policy on remuneration and conditions of employment, and to comply with any directives on these which may be issued.  In this way, it is intended to standardise and give a statutory underpinning to the responsibilities in these matters which the commercial State-sponsored bodies are expected to discharge in conformity with Government policy.  The residual control concept is already well established and since 1976 has been extended to individual commercial State bodies as legislative opportunity presented itself, and the matter of discussions does not arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>For the purpose of negotiation and progress, what is the Minister's and the Department's interpretation of it having regard to <Col N="2204" /> Government proposals?  The Minister will be well aware of the concern of the majority of the groups of unions in the semi-State sector that the process of pay determination, collective bargaining and negotiation that has been there for many decades could be under threat if a certain interpretation is put on the White Paper's proposals.  Can the Minister clarify in what way he wants the Government to have regard to present action and to the flexibility which exists and has existed for several years in the commercial State-sponsored bodies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The legislative provision will extend a statutory underpinning to all the commercial State-sponsored bodies. That provision applies to some at present but it will merely apply to them in statutory form a responsibility which they have always had and have always been expected to discharge by successive Governments in relation to Government policy.  There is absolutely nothing new in that except that it is being put on a statutory basis.  There is an obligation upon the Government to ensure that their policy on public sector pay and conditions is carried out and that a properly co-ordinated approach is adopted throughout the public sector.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps it was the way the White Paper was presented, because it was put in as one of the sections at the end and seemed to be something new.  It has been interpreted &mdash; not by me &mdash; by the groups of unions which cover all the major unions in the State as being something new.  Is the Minister saying now that whatever arrangements always existed hold as far as negotiating was concerned in the semi-State bodies, and that there is no further involvement by the Department of the Public Service or the Government than what has been there hitherto?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The semi-State bodies have always been expected to adhere to general Government policy and guidelines on pay and conditions.  That is a reasonable attitude for successive <Col N="2205" /> Governments to have adopted.  In the case of these companies the Government, are, after all, the shareholder acting only on behalf of the general public and it is reasonable for the Government as shareholder in the public interest to ensure that Government policy and guidelines in relation to these matters are adhered to by State-sponsored bodies, otherwise we would have chaos.  That policy has always been expected of the State-sponsored bodies.</P>
      <P>Some bodies have had legislation appropriate to them enacted since the 1976 Gas Act, the first time this provision was put in legislative form.  This provision of residual control has been included, for instance, in relation to the INPC in 1979, to Údarás na Gaeltachta in 1979, to Irish Steel in 1982 and to Fóir Teoranta in 1983.  I hope the House will appreciate that that policy has been implemented progressively since 1976 by successive Governments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>It is necessary to ask another supplementary.  I have a vast amount of correspondence giving different interpretations to this.  Will the Minister tell the House that this new arrangement under the section on implementation in the White Paper, which seems to imply that the Government and the Department of the Public Service seek in some way to have control and to use that control in a way that has not been used up to now in the matter of pay negotiations and conditions in the commercial State-sponsored bodies, is not a changed procedure and that house agreements, union agreements and negotiations which have gone on for decades in a certain manner will be continued and not interfered with?  Is the Minister putting a new interpretation on what has already been done?  He has not clarified the issue and appears to be evading my question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of evasion.  It will, of course, be the intention of the Government that normal negotiations, arrangements, settlements and house agreements referred to will <Col N="2206" /> continue under the collective bargaining system to be operated within each of the State bodies.  However, there is, and always has been, an obligation on the management of those bodies as employers to act in conformity with general Government policy.  What we now intend to do in one piece of composite legislation is to place that obligation legally upon all those managements, an obligation that has been placed upon a number of managements, some of which I have referred to, over the last ten years. It is an obligation that even while it was not in statutory form in relation to a number of the bodies, particularly the older bodies, it was always accepted by the Department under whose aegis they operated and by the Government of the day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that conformity in the area of semi-State bodies could differ in the nature of their business?  Will be agree that settlements and agreements reached at local level may suit the Government and certainly suit the progress of the semi-State body more so than a circular which would say that £X is a fixed sum for all State bodies? The State bodies are different by their nature and their services and commercial involvement is different.  To put them under one set piece of legislation which officials will interpret as meaning that they are bound by it will not be workable. It is not used in that form at the moment. Will the Minister agree with that statement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure that I do, in some of its implications.  If that was the approach to be adopted on all sides it might make the position different but there are a variety of analogues and relativities which are pursued very often in the processing of claims made on behalf of certain groups in different State bodies on the basis that they are in an analogous State employment.  From that point of view an attitude is often adopted which implies that there ought to be a uniformity of approach from the point of view of those negotiating on behalf of the labour <Col N="2207" /> force.  Equally there is a necessity from the point of view of the official offers which can be made by management to ensure that those offers are not in conflict with Government policy.  The Deputy, in the course of his questions, implied that from time to time there might be settlements which would be satisfactory to the Government.  If there were they would be in accordance with Government policy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept the underlying theme in the Deputy's question, that information about services provided by the State should be much more accessible to the public than at present.  It is my aim to ensure that this becomes a reality.</P>
      <P>In the recently published White Paper on the Public Service, &ldquo;Serving the Country Better&rdquo;, paragraph 6.4 states that:</P>
      <P>... in an effort to inform citizens of the services which are available to them, Government inquiry offices will be established, initially in Dublin and, later on, in local centres.</P>
      <P>The paragraph adds that, &ldquo;the possibility of having local authorities provide a wide range of information on the services available from both local and central Government will be urgently examined&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The preparatory work necessary to enable the decision on Government inquiry offices to be implemented is being undertaken urgently within my Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Examination of the involvement of <Col N="2208" /> local authorities in the provision of information is also under way.  This work is at an early stage yet and necessitates discussions with the local authorities and the various Government Departments.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the Minister's concern to make this principle work. He has already succeeded in doing away with the concept of the nameless civil servant by insisting on them identifying themselves.  With regard to the question of lunch time opening of major offices in Dublin city, I should like to ask the Minister to provide a limited service because it seems that major Departments, without naming any particular Department, cease providing a service at lunch time, particularly sections that deal with the public.  People are not always in a position to get time off to call to a Department to collect or deliver a form.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will probably be aware that that matter was also addressed in the White Paper.  The White Paper set out the Government's intention to ensure that offices which are major centres used by the public will be open during lunch hour and, perhaps, at a later time in the evening in order to facilitate those who are in employment during normal office hours.  Discussions are fairly well advanced in negotiations which it is hoped will bring about that type of opening which will be designed to suit the public as much as possible.</P>

      <P>I asked the Minister to outline the type of work they are undertaking. Is the Minister saying that such staff can be engaged in work similar to that of a clerical officer or a clerical assistant of a similar age?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The work they will carry out will be work that is deemed appropriate to their role as trainees.  They are not analagous to any particular grade and it would be confusing the issue entirely if I was to suggest that they were.  The purpose of the scheme is to give them on-the-job training.  The disciplines of clerical work generally will be inculcated in them.  I am referring to disciplines such as accuracy, punctuality and higher output. That will be preceded by a short induction training period and later in the year there will be some further formal off-the-job training which will not, however, be extensive.  The important thing is that the trainees are to get an opportunity to learn how to do work by doing it.</P>
      <P>Also, as I undertook at the outset when this scheme was announced, they will be given experience of more than one type of work during the course of the year.  All in all, it would be a very important year's experience for many young people.  As we all know, very often the problem facing them is that, while they may have a good academic record or appear to perform a good interview, potential employers say they are not inclined to employ them because they have no experience.  At the end of this year's experience the best part of 1,000 young people will have been given a quite extensive range of experience in clerical duties in the Civil Service.  That will be of great benefit to them in seeking employment afterwards, as well as the fact that a number of the trainees will be given an opportunity to compete in the autumn of next year for permanent position within the Civil Service.</P>

      <P>The Government's intention in regard to part time working is set out in paragraph 7.10 of the White Paper <i>Serving the Country Better.</i></P>
      <P>That paragraph states that &ldquo;studies will be carried out to identify areas where it would be more economical to have work performed on a part time rather than a full time basis&rdquo;.  Those studies are at present under way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister have any further information?  This matter was mentioned in the White Paper so there must have been some examination in detail.  What Departments were involved and would these be people who were former civil servants and retired or perhaps left the public service on marriage and would be taken back for a number of hours per day?  There must be some basis for putting this into the White Paper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>First, a number of administrations other than ours employ part time workers extensively from time to time.  Our main purpose in including this provision was that where work of a temporary or seasonal nature may arise, where a particular pressure may emerge for a section or a block of workers within a Department which pressure is not of a permanent nature, it might be better carried out by part time workers.  We had no specific area in mind but merely wanted to indicate that we felt flexibility ought to be adopted in the future to allow that type of worker to be recruited.</P>
      <P>One of the things which all employers will have to do in the future in relation to endeavouring to share the available amount of work as widely as possible is to hang fairly loose in their approach towards different types of employment, hours of work and so on.  It was merely from that point of view that we endeavoured to cover as wide a range of possibilities as possible in that section of the White Paper.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Quite frankly, I have not any more fixed view, except that obviously where it was identified that part time staff might be utilised, it would be obviously on the basis that, from the Government's point of view, it would be more economical and would be providing an additional amount of employment for some extra people, if merely on a part time basis.  I would assume that in that case usually the part time employees would by personal choice have opted to have sought part time employment.</P>

Merit pay is one of the items in the White Paper which requires consultation with the parties affected.  It is my intention that the necessary consultations with staff interests will take place in the new year and the scheme will then be introduced without delay.  As indicated in the White Paper awards will be made to not more than 10 per cent of the staff in any grade or Department.  Awards will vary within a range of 5 to 10 per cent of annual salary depending upon the degree of outstanding performance by the civil servants concerned.

He has also indicated that the problems being experienced by him with Bord Telecom Éireann do not arise from any inadequacy in the legislation but from the board's failure to respond within a reasonable time to his office.</P>
      <P>The Ombudsman has been in communication with the company who accept that the present position is totally unsatisfactory. Special measures are now to be taken by the board to deal with the backlog of complaints that has arisen.

The company aim to have the present situation rectified in a number of weeks.

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to answer Questions Nos. 32 and 34 together.  Following the meeting of the Civil Service General Council on 27 November at which an offer on the 25th round and related pay issues was made to civil servants, both sides agreed to issue a joint statement the terms of which I shall now read to the House:</P>
      <P>Government representatives met Civil Service unions on 27 November under the civil service conciliation and arbitration Scheme to reply to their 25th round pay claim.  The existing 24th round for this group expires on 31 December 1985.</P>
      <P>In opening the discussions the Government's representatives made the following offer:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&mdash;a 25th round agreement of 24 <Col N="2220" /> months duration, i.e. to expire on 31 December 1987.</P>
    <P>the agreement to provide for:</P>
    <P>&mdash;a 9 months pay pause;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a 3 per cent increase from I October 1986;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a 2 per cent increase from 1 July 1987.  </P>
    <P>The offer was subject to:</P>
    <P> (1)  an agreement being reached between the two sides in relation to the phasing of outstanding arbitration findings, the processing under the scheme of claims for special increases already served and the treatment, during the period of any agreement, of claims for special increases not yet served; and</P>
    <P>(2)  meaningful discussions taking place as a matter of urgency about the machinery for pay determination. </P>
    <P>In the interest of dealing quickly with the claim the Government's representatives suggested to the unions that a negotiating sub-committee be set up immediately.  The staff side said they would consider the offer and report back with their response.</P>
    <P>The Government's representatives asked the unions to return to the negotiating table within a week if possible.</P>
    <P>Both sides agreed that no further public statement or comment would be made by either party.</P>
    <P>As will be clear from my reply to the Deputy in respect of a similar question from him on 12 November, I do not accept that the terms of the Government's offer as outlined above can in any way be regarded as a U-turn given the terms of the Government's statement on pay of 14 August last.</P>
    <P>As the questions cover matters which are the subject of negotiation with the staff, the Deputy will appreciate that any further developments on the 25th round and on any of the other matters referred to in the joint statement of 27 November must depend on the response from the <Col N="2221" /> staff side.  I do not intend to, and it would not be proper for me to attempt to, conduct the negotiations in this House.  In view of the last sentence of the joint statement I do not intend to make any further statement on the negotiations.</P>

      <P>The Government statement of August which created the difficulty which has since beset the public service was that the increase for 1986 would be zero.  Any fair-minded person with any degree of intelligence would see that any kind of an increase is a change from that position.  The Minister has now begun negotiations on the 25th round, the special grade increases and the reappointment of the arbitrator.  Is he saying that these three items are on the table and will have to be resolved in one package?  Is that the Minister's negotiation stance?  I am not asking him to give any information of a confidential nature between him and the public service unions.  Are the three items bound together?  Is he saying that an agreement on one cannot be reached without agreement on all three?</P>

      <P>Could I ask the Minister the position regarding the public service arbitrator?  The Minister recently appeared to separate the arbitration scheme from the negotiating stance. There is a Civil Service and teachers' arbitration scheme and there is also an arbitration scheme for local government and health employees, which is slightly different.  By agreeing to meet and negotiate with one body, is he making some distinction and is he prepared to appoint the arbitrator as part of the negotiations?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Is has always been my attitude that I was more than anxious to meet collectively or individually with <Col N="2222" /> public service unions or groups of unions who were prepared to discuss a package which would lead to harmony in industrial relations in the public service during 1986 and beyond.  In that context I must say &mdash; as I did on 12 November in answer to a previous question by the Deputy &mdash; that the Deputy does not seem to have read carefully the Government's pay guidelines of 14 August last.  Those guidelines are materially different from what he has represented them to be and are not substantially different from guidelines issued in relation to previous general pay rounds.  I hope to meet one of the groups to whom the Deputy referred immediately after Question Time today and, in view of the importance of these discussions and others which I hope it will be possible to have with public service groups in the time immediately ahead, I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would be inappropriate for me to go into what are more importantly in the context of negotiations, negotiating matters. It would be inopportune if I attempted to conduct those negotiations which should properly be negotiated with the union representatives instead of with Deputy Ahern across the floor of the House.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister appreciates that I am only trying to find out what he is seeking to do because this has caused widespread problems in the public service over the last three months. Perhaps it would be helpful to have a debate in the House.  Does the item which the Minister seeks to amend in the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme and the teachers' scheme mean that the proposals and the findings of the arbitration scheme will have to come before this House although the local government scheme does not have to be brought before the House as it is a matter for the Minister?  Will the amendment which the Minister seeks to achieve in the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration board prior to his reappointing the arbitrator affect matters coming before the House?  Is that the nub of the non-reappointment of the arbitrator?</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Labour, if, in view of the hardship caused to the people of Dublin by the seriously deteriorating level of bus services in the city and the likelihood that this will increase due to the decision of CIE management to increase the number of drivers being suspended, he will use the power available to him under sections 18 and 24 of the Industrial Relations Act, 1946, to request the Labour Court to intervene and to report to him on the issues involved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the House will be aware, the issue of the introduction of one-person-operated (OPO) double decker and large capacity single decker buses is a long standing one in CIE.  The company's first proposal on the issue dates back to 1967.</P>
      <P>As recently as August this year the Labour Court issued a comprehensive recommendation covering the issue in contention.  I would like to outline the many points which have been agreed. These are:</P>
      <P> (a)  that there will be no involuntary redundancy for any driver or conductor in Dublin city services;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(b)  that OPO will be introduced on <Col N="2224" /> a voluntary basis; this means that any driver or conductor who does not wish to participate in one-person-operation may continue on two-person-operations;</P>
    <P>(c)  that the company guarantee jobs in their own grades in their own garages and on their own routes for marked in drivers and marked in conductors not engaged in one-person-operations;</P>
    <P>(d)  that employees who, as a result of the introduction of OPO, suffer a loss of earnings will be paid lump sum compensation already agreed;</P>
    <P>(e)  that temporary drivers and conductors will continue to be appointed in the normal way;</P>
    <P>(f)  that the training of conductors as drivers on two-person-operated routes will be stepped up to ensure, as far as possible, that vacancies for drivers which in the normal way would be filled by recruitment, will be filled from the conducting grade;</P>
    <P>(g)  that the company will provide adequate facilities for the training of all drivers &mdash; and conductors trained as drivers &mdash; in the techniques of one-person-operation; drivers &mdash; and conductors trained as drivers &mdash; selected for such training may opt on the basis of personal application;</P>
    <P>(h)  that overtime, rest day working, etc. will be allocated on a proportionate basis between OPO and two-person-operation (TPO); all private hire and non-stage carriage services will be OPO;</P>
    <P>(i)  that the procedure for implementation will be that:</P>
    <P>As a preliminary, each driver and conductor will be invited to express their options with a view to determining if they wish to be considered for one-person-operation, two-person-operation and/or conversion payment or voluntary severance. These options will be without commitment by the individual or CIE.</P>
    <P>When a route is planned for conversion to OPO the following procedure will apply:</P>
    <P>Drivers on the route will be <Col N="2225" /> given the option of becoming one-person-operators on the route or taking a conversion payment and moving off the route.  Conductors will be given a conversion payment for moving off the route.</P>
    <P>When a busworker accepts a conversion payment he/she will revert to the spare category and may apply in the ordinary way for vacancies on TPO routes.  </P>
    <P>(j)  that on the implementation of one-person double deck operation employees may be offered voluntary severance terms;</P>
    <P>(k)  that there will be no dual purpose routes, i.e. one-person-operation and two-person-operation buses on the same route;</P>
    <P>(l)  that a conductor converting to driving will have his/her conducting duty held during his/her probationary period as heretofore; the conductor may decide to opt off the route to enable it to be converted to one-person-operation;</P>
    <P>(m)  the amendment of the rule book will be put in hands.  </P>
    <P>The Labour Court has pointed out that there are also a number of unresolved issues, the main one being safety, the risk of assault to drivers particularly if they are carrying large amounts of cash at night.  In this regard the Labour Court has recommended that a safe should be installed on each bus.  The second item is the collection of fares.  At present the driver or conductor is responsible for the collection of fares.  On this point the Labour Court has recommended that passengers should be legally responsible for paying their fares.</P>
    <P>With regard to reduction in working hours, the unions are looking for a five day, 37 hour week for bus workers. Having regard to the direct and other cost implications, the Labour Court has not recommended any reduction in working hours.  However, it has recommended the introduction of a five day working week within two years.  With regard to the DART feeder buses, the Labour Court has recommended that feeder buses should come into operation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2226" /> As regards other key issues, the Labour Court has made the following recommendations: first, the bonus for one-person-operation should be increased to 33 per cent; second, those personnel who agree to transfer from two-person-operation to one-person-operation will receive conversion payments of £300 for the first ten years of service and £30 for each year of service over ten years.  In other words, a driver with 30 years service who agrees to convert from a two-person-operation to a one-person-operation will receive a sum of £900; third, a tribunal should be set up to deal with disputes arising from the introduction of one-person-operation.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court pointed out in the August recommendation that whatever the overall benefits of one-person-operation to the company and the community, it should be clear that there are tangible benefits to bus workers who choose to avail of it.  The proposals are entirely voluntary for each individual.  They contain no threat to job or security of any existing bus worker.</P>
    <P>The Labour Court recommendation was rejected by the unions.  In a further effort to achieve agreement on the outstanding issues the Labour Court met the parties as recently as last Monday.  Talks in the court covered a ten hour period but unfortunately they did not bridge the gap between the two parties.</P>
    <P>It is obvious from what I said earlier that there exists a large measure of agreement on many of the issues involved and I would ask the parties to make further strenuous efforts to come together to try to resolve the outstanding issues.  It is my understanding that the Labour Court is willing to give further assistance to the parties if they require it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>My question specifically asked if the Minister would request the Labour Court to report to him on the outstanding issues and I ask him to respond to that point.  Is he not aware that at this time management have locked out 30 bus workers and put 400 on protective notice and that the question of the one-person-operated system being <Col N="2227" /> entirely voluntary is no longer the case in view of the fact that management are insisting that staff take up training for this purpose or be suspended?  Would he not accept that the question of safety, both of the driver and passengers, is of legitimate concern to the bus workers and the mere fact that a substantial monetary reward is available, and which has not been accepted by the bus workers, indicates the seriousness with which they regard the extended working hours which they are at present obliged to work, and the safety aspect to themselves and the money for which the company insist that they be responsible?</P>

I was asked if I would avail of section 24 or see if section 18 could be used to make the Labour Court services available to resolve this dispute.

I cannot say at this stage who is right and who is wrong, and neither could the Labour Court.  Each side say they do not wish to put the people of Dublin at risk, but would the Minister consider formally calling both sides to the Labour Court tomorrow morning, under the chairmanship of John Horgan, so that we can try to resolve this problem?  It is incredible and unreasonable that the present situation should exist.  The city has almost come to a standstill at what should be the busiest time of the year.

In his original reply the Minister said a great deal had been achieved and that at this stage there is a relatively small number of matters outstanding. While the Minister has indicated that the Labour Court facilities are available, can we be assured that some initiative will come from his Department? The current stand-off position must end eventually and the parties will have to sit down, we hope sooner rather than later, and resolve the remaining difficulties.

      <P>I cannot accept the benign approach taken by Deputy Ahern in relation to who is to blame and who is not to blame in this matter.  I do not believe that one-person operated buses is any longer at issue.  In view of the fact that this is a State company, I ask the Minister to request the management of <Col N="2230" /> CIE to end the action at this time of suspending drivers.  If it were the unions who were involved in strike action I am sure they would be asked to end their action.  Will the Minister at this stage publicly or privately &mdash; I am not concerned which way he chooses &mdash; ask the management of CIE to end the confrontational stance they have taken coming up to the Christmas shopping period so that outstanding problems can be discussed calmly and without the threat of loss of jobs hanging over the bus workers?</P>

As far as I am concerned that would ensure that the path would be open for negotiations between both sides.  Quite clearly, negotiations cannot start if the parties are not prepared to talk to each other.

Seeing that that machinery, namely, the Labour Court, has already been involved and as there is definitely a machismo element both on the management side and on the union side, will the Minister also note that this House subsidises very heavily two large industrial relations departments in Trinity College, Dublin, and in University College, Dublin.  If the Labour Court is not acceptable, will he call on the heads of those departments to try to settle this dispute in order to remove hardship from the citizens of Dublin before Christmas?</P>

I said there is a direct link between the high level of unemployment which is growing at an alarming rate and the level of crime.  I regret there is nothing in the Supplementary Estimate that will restore public confidence.  There is nothing that will allow the people to think their level of protection and security will increase in the months ahead, particularly during the winter which is always a time of great fear for many citizens and particularly old people.  We must not forget the tragic events of this time last year when old people in rural areas lived in fear because of the many attacks made on them during the long winter nights.

We expect the Minister in his reply to inform the House if he has any plans or proposals to help to restore public confidence in our institutions.  This is sadly lacking at the moment.</P>
      <P>I do not want to go over ground already covered by previous speakers from this side of the House.  I should like the Minister to comment on the serious problem of money lending.  It always seems to be a case of reacting too late after an event. Whether the Minister accepts it or not, money lending is a serious social problem particularly in urban areas.  This matter was highlighted on a television programme and has also been highlighted in reports from credible organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the credit unions.  The only people who can do anything about resolving the problem are Members of this House, through the Minister for Justice and his Department. I do not want this problem to remain unattended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Illegal money lending will escalate at grave risk to families and marriages if it is not tackled immediately.  Wexford town was referred to in the recent TV programme. In Wexford no fewer than 5,000 people are having or have had contact with illegal moneylenders.  There are nine moneylenders in Wexford and only three of them can claim to be legal.  I had a letter during the week from a Wexford clergyman who, naturally, is concerned about this despicable practice and its effects on the lives of young people and on marriages.  It does not take any great imagination to see how friction can occur in families or individuals who fall victims to these appalling arrangements, which are widespread throughout the country. <Col N="2265" /> When he is replying, I should like the Minister to tell us what action he has taken since this was brought to his notice. I ask him to do something about it.</P>
    <P>We have been reading in the newspapers in the past three weeks of two deaths in prison of young people from drugs.  It is terrible to see people in State custody losing their lives because of drugs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask the Minister to take some positive action.  Whatever Deputy Skelly may say, this relates to the Estimate because it deals with the prison system.  One young man lost his life while in a prison.  I suggest that prisoners who have drug problems should be segregated from other prisoners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of the opportunity to speak on the serious problems under the Minister's jurisdiction.  I have no difficulty in agreeing with the Estimate because money must be spent if law and order are to be reinstated.  The problem is of huge dimensions and it is escalating. In a few years the amount of money we are voting now will seem very small by comparison with the amount that will be needed to maintain law and order.  We must be honest and face facts.  We are losing the battle despite the valiant efforts of the Minister for Justice whom the Irish nation is lucky to have in that job.  On his admission this week, we are losing the battle against crime &mdash; the criminals are winning.  We have been told that only two out of 84 cases are detected by the Garda Síochána.  That is a horrifying insight into the depth of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will speak briefly of the prison service and the Garda Síochána.  In spite of a <Col N="2266" /> temporary personal hiccough in relations with the Garda, I give my wholehearted support to the job they do, very often with great personal danger to themselves, in their efforts to protect society from the hordes of criminals who are threatening to engulf society.  I pay tribute to them as a general body, but I should like to draw attention to the lack of proper training in Templemore.</P>
    <P>I have been in Templemore and I was impressed with the apparent set-up there: about six months training for a boy who has done the Leaving Certificate and joins the force is not nearly sufficient. After six months he is sent out in the streets of Dublin or some other city.  His training is totally inadequate for that job. A youth of 19 or 20 years has not got the experience, the tact or the sensitivity to deal with the necessity to handle people&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I presume the Deputy will make only a passing reference to this.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>You presume rightly.  I believe that lack of adequate training is a weakness accepted by the Garda.  I suggest that no young recruit should be allowed out on his own until he has served two years: he should be accompanied by a senior officer who would be experienced. There is also a need for upgrading training in civility and courtesy to the public. In this respect, gardaí could learn something from the RUC.</P>
      <P>Money lending is pertinent to the Estimate. I suggest that rather than the public and the political world having to be told of these problems through television programmes, the Garda should be aware of the activities of moneylenders and should be able to build dossiers on money lending instead of reacting when the magnitude of the problem has been exposed on television.  It is a dirty practice and the people most vulnerable to the moneylenders are the weakest in society.  Most are social welfare recipients &mdash; they are the most vulnerable to the advances of these vultures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Hyland suggested that this is a <Col N="2267" /> rural problem but that is not the case.  It emanates from the city of Dublin where the largest firm engaged in this disgraceful practice have their headquarters.  This is a company of apparently respectable business people, many of whom are engaged in the accountancy field.  They use deplorable methods in preying on the most vulnerable people.  This is a practice that should be stamped out ruthlessly and immediately.  The practice is prevalent, too, in the town of Drogheda.  I have been aware of very many unfortunate people who became ensnared in this evil practice and were unable to extricate themselves from it.  I am confident that the Minister will act in this area with his usual speed.</P>
    <P>On the question of the expenditure of £50 million on our prisons, I am a believer in the old fashioned theory that prison should be a penitentiary and not a rest home or a grade three hotel.  We should spend less on such facilities as snooker tables, videos, colour televisions and sauna baths for our prisoners.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>And gaming machines, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanMcGahon" hpid="Mr. McGahon Mr. McGahon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>When prisoners riot and destroy these facilities they should be left among the debris or confined to their quarters but the facilities should not be replaced.  The only replacement should be by way of water hoses because these people should be treated as outcasts from society.  If they cannot behave themselves in jail what chance is there of their behaving themselves outside?  We should consider the reintroduction of hard labour and of flogging because the measures we are taking are inadequate.  We are fighting a losing battle and the main reason for this is the absence of a deterrent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Because there is no deterrent, increasing numbers are being encouraged to break the law and to commit criminal acts which have terrifying consequences for the victims and for the people generally. This is evidenced by the recent despicable murders that have been perpetrated. <Col N="2268" /> Therefore, instead of providing for prisoners the kind of facilities to which I have referred, the Government should think in terms of providing leisure centres in certain areas as a means of combatting crime.  The British Government, in the interests of reducing subversive activity in Belfast, provided five leisure centres in that city.  These are on a par with anything to be found elsewhere in Europe and the experiment has been highly successful. The centres provide an area of recreation and relaxation for many young people who otherwise would be sucked into the maelstrom of crime and violence.</P>
    <P>I realise that my views are considered old fashioned and that they may be sniggered at by the liberals in our society. But the liberals and the apologists for crime are in many ways responsible for the growth in crime.  I suggest to the Minister that, despite his own views as published recently on the question of capital punishment, in America where the liberals had their say for a long time, there is now an acceptance of the reality of reintroducing capital punishment.  If the Minister were to conduct a referendum on this question, I submit that by a large majority the people would vote for the reintroduction of capital punishment here.  The Government have a duty to protect society but society is disintegrating. I accept that capital punishment is not a complete deterrent but neither is jail a total deterrent.  There is no complete deterrent for anything in life but in many cases capital punishment would provide the deterrent that is needed.</P>

      <P>Deputy McGahon's speech must reflect the pain felt in the community by reason of the unacceptable level of crime.  I have here a petition which I received yesterday from the residents of 52 houses in the South Circular Road area.  This number of houses represents only a small portion of that area but the petition is a reflection of the feelings of the community generally.  It is a microcosm of the whole area of Dublin, north and south.  The authors of the petition must speak for every resident in Dublin.  The petition is signed by all 52 householders and reads as follows:</P>
      <P>We, the undersigned, all residents of the South Circular Road area at the addresses as set out hereunder petition you to use your influence with the Department of Justice and the Garda authorities to ensure that a more efficient and uniform system of policing of this area of the South Circular Road is implemented immediately.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Break-ins and general interference with property are now an everyday occurrence, and in particular, there are a number of old people living in the area with whose safety we are gravely concerned.  While we are fully conscious of the present difficulties being experienced by the authorities in the law enforcement situation we submit and petition accordingly that, the safety of ordinary citizens in their homes and their constitutional right to the peace and security guaranteed by the State are given a significantly <Col N="2270" /> higher priority in local policing arrangements than that which they are apparently being accorded at present.</P>
    <P>We trust that in the making of this petition it will be recognised that we demand an improvement in the crime situation which is threatening to become worse.  And we hope that positive steps will be taken towards the furtherance of that end and to ensure that the rule of law becomes an actual fact rather than what it is now &mdash; an empty formula.</P>
    <P>These must be the sentiments not only of the people of Dublin but of the people of every town in the country.  In the seventies I recall speaking out here in favour of the Loughan House concept and being abused for my views.  I said then that the hooligans of today would be the gunmen of tomorrow.</P>
    <P>This week I got a reply from the Minister to my question about armed robberies. In 1984 there were 440 armed robberies and in the first nine months of this year there were 457 armed robberies. A Minister for Justice today has the most arduous job in the Cabinet.  People find it difficult to understand when they hear about prisoners wrecking their television sets and videos and about the items being replaced.  It is incomprehensible to people that prisoners have such luxuries because the reason many of them are in prison is that they have deprived others of those luxuries.  It is understandable that prisoners with nothing to do can become bored and dangerous and that it is in the interests of prison officers and everybody else that the prisoners are kept happy.  However, perhaps it is time as Deputy McGahon said, to review whether or not certain forms of work practices should be extended.  Prison should be a deterrent and we should drop this idea of rehabilitation.  The Minister knows that these people would knife one in a church, given the opportunity, and many of them are destined for a life of crime.</P>
    <P>Deputy McGahon referred to liberals and it reminded me of a book which was sent to me some years ago entitled &ldquo;If <Col N="2271" /> Liberals had feathers, Gee What a Hunter I would Be&rdquo;.  Recently there has been some improvement in the joyriding situation but the problem is still serious. Gardaí are still having their cars rammed. When I see a motor cycle garda out at night, I salute him as a brave man.  For that man's wife or mother it must be a terrible ordeal knowing that her husband or son is out on that motor cycle at the mercy of criminals who show no quarter, who are prepared to kill.  When I heard about the riot in Spike Island my attitude was &mdash; leave them there.  I would have given them 25 suits of underwear between 50 of them and I would have told them to use their excess energy fighting for them.  I would create work schemes for these people so that they would be too tired for joyriding at the end of the day.  The assistant city manager of the housing department of Dublin Corporation said that if the Government gave him the dole money he would not have difficulty in creating work for these people.  If many of these young people who find themselves in trouble with the law had to do a good hard day's work they might be too tired to steal cars and go joyriding.</P>
    <P>Senior Garda officers have stated that there are about 120 ringleaders in the city and I would be the first to vote powers to the Minister in this House to round them up.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BenBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of the court decisions must have upset the Minister. We want to see tougher sentences and if certain justices are not giving tough <Col N="2272" /> sentences they should be moved somewhere else to deal with other types of cases.  When will we get a court set up with two judges dealing with drugs cases? We should have two tough men who show no quarter to the drug pushers.  The concerned parents' assocation is a product of this situation.  If the State cannot protect the citizens they will take the law into their own hands and the subversive organisations will take a hold.  The people will vote for them in return for protection.</P>
      <P>There are a number of questions down for next week to deal with the money lending problem.  I was delighted to see that credit was given to my father who prepared a Private Members' Bill which was later taken over by the first Fianna Fáil Government in 1933 in relation to controlling the interest that these people could charge.  When the Minister replies to my questions next week I would like to know if he is going to update that legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I would ask Deputy Daly and Deputy Skelly to conclude by 4.50 p.m. to allow the Minister in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I was considering whether to concede my time altogether to allow the Minister to reply, because the debate has been messed up so much by the Private Notice Question and by other Members wandering all over the place.</P>
      <P>In relation to the Supplementary Estimate I would point out in the area of legal aid that we are not getting value for money from the legal profession.  The Minister's and the Department's attention should be drawn to this area.  Neither are we getting good professional services. As most people who depend on free legal aid are the deprived sections, they should get a very keen rate and a very good service.  The deprived sections get the worst kind of service from the most junior lawyers who often do not see their clients until they are actually in court.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The amount paid to the legal profession is scandalous.  The medical profession put them to shame as they can <Col N="2273" /> provide the most highly qualified people to give a service anywhere at all hours for a modest outlay.  The legal profession do not do that.  During the debate on the Criminal Justice Bill last year, when fees were discussed, an invitation was issued to the legal profession to provide a reasonably costed service and there was no response.  We need more centres throughout the city of Dublin in particular and better information for the public. I approve of this Estimate but we could get much better value for money and possibly extend the service.</P>
    <P>In relation to the consciousness of the legal profession, I received a letter from the President of the Law Society, Mr. Collins, on 29 March this year seeking my support in which he said that as a profession they were continually trying to improve the services to the public and he said that one cause of complaint against solicitors is delay.  I wrote back to him and said I was delighted to see that he was trying to improve the service and that he recognised the problem of delay. I told him that his placing of the blame on everyone else was unbalanced because he failed to accept responsibility for delays in the legal profession.  I told him there was gross incompetence, inefficiency and protectionism in his profession and that there was room for suspecting that peculiar knowledge is used extensively for the enrichment of the members of the legal profession and that there was also a dreadful laxity on entry into practise by members who are woefully inexperienced and that many of the most outrageous mistakes cannot be checked until the estates are wrapped up.</P>
    <P>I said, furthermore:</P>
    <P>Moneys have been held for extraordinary lengths of time by solicitors when they should have been passed over to the client.  Members of the public cannot even find out whether their case is dealt with between calls or visits to the solicitor.  You and I know that, in the majority of cases, they are not being dealt with.</P>
    <P>I gave him an example of foreign lawyers who in order to save a £10 million deal <Col N="2274" /> for business for this country, had to intervene to speed up the legal process.  Finally I said to him that one of the stinking things about the legal profession, solicitors, is the way they cover up for each other, the rogues being protected by the hard working, decent members.  I then went on to say to him that he could see readily, of course, advantage being taken of the general honourable image of the profession that image being put under strain by irregularities which are often cloaked over by his society, that is the Law Society, and that the Law Society should do themselves a favour and come clean.</P>
    <P>Interestingly, a newly formed union, the Irish Solicitors' Union also wrote to me, independently, saying they were most dissatisfied with our present legal system, that they wanted massive increases and support.  I wrote back to them &mdash; Susan Bowler-Geraghty was the person who had written to me &mdash; saying I was delighted to note that they wanted a fair and just legal system.  I also asked them the following question, &ldquo;Will you also be willing to do that even if it means curtailing some of the excesses of your profession?&rdquo; I said I found her letter heartening in that she recognised the shortcomings.  I said I would be quite willing to enter into debate with some of their union, that I was sure I could inveigle some Members here to participate, when we could both work for real change to bring about a fair and just legal system.  I said she had taken the first important step on behalf of her union to bring about progress in an area which is a cause for shame.</P>
    <P>I have not received any reply or invitations by way of a follow-up to that, because all that the legal profession want is more money.  When one takes up a cause in this House one risks putting oneself in danger by way of one's reputation or character because people tend to take it personally.  They forget why we were elected, that we have responsibilities to carry out.  I think all of us try to carry them out in an honourable way.</P>
    <P>I have witnessed the experience of Deputy Allen who has been disgracefully treated by that profession in that it must <Col N="2275" /> be remembered he has been endeavouring to carry out his duty as a Member of Parliament elected by the people.  I have received letters from people around the country asking me to support him.  I have enough causes on my plate.  I did not want to interfere in what he was endeavouring to do.  I should like to put on the record of the House that I fully support the stance he has taken over the last few years.  We would be doing everybody a great service if we could iron out the irregularities in that profession which is enlitist, a very small group, tending to comprise family members, sons and daughters who progress in it, when all the time the sufferer is John Citizen, the poor unfortunate public.  I do not want to dwell on this.</P>
    <P>I shall omit reference to prisons which I regret &mdash; because of the time factor &mdash; having to do.  But in regard to commissions and special inquiries, we should strive for improvement.  As far as the Kerry Babies Tribunal is concerned we did not get value for money.  I do not think the mandate this House gave that tribunal was carried out.  It is unfortunate that we were not allowed to debate its findings in the House although such debate was called for by Members, leaving a very big question mark over what we are doing here.  I wish the adversarial system would be changed to an inquisitorial system.  The tribunals we set up tend to encourage the gravy train system which we all understand.  These high fees of the legal profession are just not warranted. Nobody else gets guaranteed money as they do.  Nobody gets guaranteed money whether they win or lose. These tribunals are a particular scandal in that often, for a month or two, a solicitor or barrister may not even be needed. Yet he receives his daily fee which is very high.  This is not likely to be said in the House by anybody else but I think there should be some kind of an average worked out because it is a rip-off profession and it should be tackled.  We can do so by streamlining it, by watching costs and insisting that its members conform <Col N="2276" /> to certain standards.  If the House is prepared to vote moneys like these for the establishment of such tribunals, then we should ensure that we get value for those moneys.</P>
    <P>There is one suggestion I might make &mdash; perhaps I should do so privately in order to conserve time and give Deputy Bell five minutes &mdash; and here I refer to the Barra O'Briain report, paragraph 60 of which reads:</P>
    <P>On the first occasion an accused appears in the District Court, the Prosecution should be required by the District Justice to say whether any statement or confession made by the accused will be relied upon.  If the answer is in the affirmative the Justice should enquire of the accused whether or not such confession or statement was made freely.  If the answer is that the confession or statement was not made freely, the accused should be permitted, but not compelled, to elaborate, particularly with regard to any alleged ill-treatment.  The proceedings in the District Court should be duly recorded, and the record (including the original of any statement) should later be available to the trial Court.  We so recommend.</P>
    <P>That would have saved us many problems with regard to that tribunal.  Perhaps I will be given an opportunity on another occasion to elaborate further.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the Supplementary Estimate brought forward by the Minister and congratulate him on doing a very good job in very difficult circumstances.  Likewise we should pledge our support to the Garda Síochána and prison officers who undertake a very difficult task in very difficult times.  Much more could be achieved by the Garda if they received the full support of the Oireachtas and the general public.  Likewise, prison officers have a difficult task. I was involved with one wing of the Defence Forces and I know the difficulties people encounter daily in relation to the maintenance of law and order.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2277" /> In regard to the Garda Síochána Complaints Bill I would very strongly urge the Minister to sit down with the representative bodies in an effort to work out an agreed formula.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJRyan" hpid="An Leas-Cheann Comhairle John J. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>It is important that the Garda should have full confidence, not only in the management of the force itself, but in the parliamentary system.  It should be clearly seen that we, as legislators, are doing everything within our power to safeguard their interests.  The disciplinary code within the force has operated quite well.  I have been looking at the figures produced in the House and it appears to me that more gardaí have been disciplined over the period referred to than people in any other walk of life.  The evidence is clear that they can carry out this task quite well within their own regulations. Before that Bill comes before the House I would appeal to the Minister to sit down with the Garda Síochána in order to work out a more acceptable formula for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda.  Otherwise we shall spend more time dealing with complaints against members of the Garda than we shall with criminals.  Living, as I do, in a Border constituency I have observed the enormous increase in serious and subversive crime.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelNoonan" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan, Limerick East) Michael Noonan">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Noonan,</NameTxt>
      <P>
        <i>Limerick East):</i> I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for arranging to allow me in and I thank everybody who contributed. While people had some critical things to say, everybody supported the Estimate and I appreciate that support.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A number of people mentioned recent murders which have frightened some people and it is worth putting the matter in context.  In 1980 there were 20 murders, in 1981 there were 24, in 1982 there were 24, in 1983 there were 26, in 1984 there were 23 and in 1985 to date 23 with the DPP not having yet made decisions on what he will charge in another four <Col N="2278" /> cases.  Therefore, even though we had recent horrific murders, there is no increase over the past five years.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy Haughey for his contribution and particularly for the kind words he said about the Attorney General in connection with the Stardust scheme.  I endorse what he said about the Attorney General because it is the Attorney General's scheme more than anybody else's and the deserves great credit for it. Deputy Haughey made one point about disclosing the amount of awards.  A condition of the scheme which a claimant undertakes is not to disclose the amount of any award unless he has accepted the award.  Once he has accepted the award there is nothing to prevent a person from disclosing the amount of the award.</P>
    <P>Deputy Liam Cosgrave asked for information on community services.  The scheme was brought into operation on 5 December 1984.  In the first year 990 offenders were referred for reports on their suitability for community service. So far over 500 orders have been made. It is written into the legislation that these can be imposed only instead of a prison sentence.  The average number of hours ordered has been 80.  The cost of a community service order is about £21 a week compared to over £400 a week for imprisionment. Recently I saw some schemes in Dublin which are working very well. The scheme is very good and I hope it expands further.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods argued about what he described as my confrontation on policy with the Prison Officers Association.  I refer the House to the Whitaker Report pages 307-310 where details are given of 44 episodes of industrial action which took place in the prisons in the years 1981-83.  There has been no instance of industrial action since the resolution of the November 1983 dispute in Mountjoy, and that fact speaks for itself.  Since the Mountjoy incident in 1983 not as much as five minutes have been lost in any prison through industrial action.  In the two years prior to that 44 industrial episodes were recorded.</P>
    <P>I do not want confrontation with the POA.  I want good relations with them.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2279" /> There is no doubt who is supposed to be running the prisons, and I am prepared to negotiate with the POA on any occasion in the normal atmosphere of trade unions with no threats on their side and certainly no confrontation on my side.  As I said in my introductory remarks, they are very dedicated prison officers who work in difficult circumstances and we should show our appreciation of them.</P>
    <P>Deputy Woods asked about the extra resources on the Border in patrols, overtime and all that activity which began in September and where the money was coming from.  The money is provided out of savings elsewhere in the Vote, principally out of the provisions for superannuation which were over-estimated last year.  Therefore, we did not have to come in with a Supplementary Estimate on that side even though significant amounts of money were spent.  For example, the 1985 Estimate was £10.7 million and the projected outturn is £12.5 million.  There has been extra expenditure on overtime.  It is worth noting that the December figures always go into the following year.  Once you reach 3 or 4 December you go into 1986, so what we do before Christmas will not be shown in the 1985 Estimate.</P>
    <P>Very little structural damage was done to the prison on Spike Island.  The damage done was to wooden floors and ceilings which were due to be replaced anyway and we were within about six weeks of starting the replacement work. That is why I say it is very difficult to put a cost on it.  The prison fulfilled the objective for which it was opened at the time.</P>
    <P>The question of moneylending is disturbing and many Deputies have referred to it.  A number of oral questions are down to me which I will be answering when next I answer oral questions, so I do not think I should get into detail and pre-empt Deputies in their legitimate rights.  The Garda have been asked to report on the content of the television programme to which Deputies referred and the Garda in Cork are investigating <Col N="2280" /> certain items.  Deputy Hyland talked about illegal moneylending in Wexford.</P>
    <P>The prosecution of offences is not a matter for the Minister for Justice.  It is a matter for the Garda and the DPP I have said previously that Deputies should complain to the Garda so that they can get their files correct and put the matter up to the DPP and let the law take its course.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen talked about the untouchables.  As long as I am Minister for Justice there are no untouchables in this country.  If people break the law they will be dealt with by the Garda and it is for the DPP to decide whether prosecutions will be taken.</P>
    <P>Deputy Allen and other Deputies asked about criminal legal aid.  I have no discretion here.  There is a Supreme Court decision which says that the courts can give criminal legal aid and we must provide it.  I have no discretion either as to how long a case will run or about the nature of the case.  Some of the cases are very expensive indeed.  We seem to get good value for money; certainly it seems to be cost effective in comparison with other jurisdictions.  The net cost has increased greatly.  In 1980 it was £767,000 approximately and in 1985 it is £1.8 million approximately.  These are net figures with the VAT taken off so there is no conflict here with what I said earlier. It is a great deal of money and we must examine the matter very carefully to make sure that the interests of justice, the community and the taxpayer are being served.</P>
    <P>Regarding general crime, the trend is improving.  For example, in the Dublin metropolitan area in 1980 crime went up by 15.5 per cent, in 1981 by 26.5 per cent, in 1982 by 9.3 per cent and in 1983 by 4.9 per cent.  In 1984 it went down by 4.8 per cent and in 1985 it was going down again. All around the country in the same years it went up by 13.6 per cent.  It went up by 22.8 per cent in 1981, by 9.2 per cent in 1982, by 4.9 per cent in 1983 and down by 2.6 per cent in 1984 and again it is showing a minus down this year.  The reduction there is quite big.  I suggest also that there was an increase in the number <Col N="2281" /> of crimes being reported.  People often claim that these are not full statistics because all crime is not being reported, but insurance companies now will not consider a claim for burglary unless you can say on your form that the Garda have been informed.  Therefore, you can be sure now that not only are 100 per cent of burglaries being notified to the Garda but something around 103, 104 or even 110 per cent of burglaries are being notified to the Garda Síochána.  There is no difference between the real statistic and the supposed statistic.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hyland asked about the transport of cash.  We have worked on that and we have arrangements now which are different from previous arrangements, but I do not think I should give out detailed information like that.  I accept what the Deputy said.</P>
    <P>The schemes which were put into effect last year to prevent attacks on old people were maintained, increased, reactivated and strengthened, starting about September of this year and progressed as the nights became longer.  They seem to be effective because the incidence of attacks has gone down.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has been given permission to raise the question of redundancies at Roscrea Meat Products Limited.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>And at Castle Brand Limited, Nenagh.  I regret that the Minister for Labour is not present.  I do not have anything but respect for the Minister for State who is in the House but I had hoped that the Minister for Labour who has been dealing directly with the matter would have been able to give me the up to date position on what is now a very urgent and tragic problem.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to give me the necessary information.</P>
      <P>On 8 October 1984 Castle Brand Limited, Nenagh went into liquidation.  At the time approximately 130 long serving members of the staff who had been contributing to a pension fund, many of them for as long as 40 years, found that not only were their jobs gone but their pension rights also.  After that event we pressed the Minister at considerable length in the House to ensure that the legislation he proposed to introduce would protect the pension rights not just of the workers of Castle Brand but of others who would find themselves in the same position due to the increasing spate of liquidations.  A similar issue arises, unfortunately, in respect of the former employees of Roscrea Meat Products in my constituency which is now in liquidation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will have to deal with the factories separately but I should like to draw a <Col N="2283" /> common thread between them in the first instance.  The two cases have a lot in common.  The employees in both concerns had in many instances been working in the plant for 40 and 50 years.  Anybody with any knowledge of the workers, male and female will recognise that their commitment over the years was of a standard that we are all encouraging workers to reach.  When the blow came in each case the issue arose as to whether those men and women who had contributed for more than 40 years &mdash; in one instance 50 years &mdash; would have any pension rights at all.</P>
    <P>Although I am referring to the two factories my general comment would apply in justice to all such cases and there are far too many of them emerging these days.  I want to ensure that the House and the Government discharges their responsibilities in this regard and see to it that justice is done.  With regard to the Castle Brand issue I should like to point out that since 8 October 1984 many groups, including workers and public representatives, met the Minister for Labour on numerous occasions and pleaded with him to ensure that in every way possible under existing legislation and, if necessary, under new legislation the rights of the workers would be protected.  He was also asked to ensure, if necessary, that those who may have been responsible for under funding of either fund &mdash; for some time in the case of Castle Brand &mdash; would be made amenable to whatever legal action was required.</P>
    <P>I pointed out in the House that the legislation which the Minister introduced almost a year ago, the Protection of Employees (Employers Insolvency) Act, was totally and utterly inadequate.  We pleaded with the Minister not to confine the compensation rights or the ministerial obligations in this instance to 12 months refunding of pension contributions.  We pleaded with him to ensure that he did not tie his own hands and limit the compensation rights of the workers I am referring to.  Unfortunately, our please did not succeed.  The two elements in Government defeated our motion which <Col N="2284" /> sought to extend the liability of the Minister to a period of more than 12 months.</P>
    <P>We find that since then, and after visits to Dublin by many people in their own time, and visits to Nenagh by the Minister on more than one occasion when he gave bland general assurances such as, &ldquo;I am determined to help&rdquo;, &ldquo;I have the resources and I will see that you are looked after&rdquo;, &ldquo;Leave it with me and it will be done&rdquo;&mdash;some of those assurances were given in my presence &mdash; that the issue is one on which the Minister is and has been seeking the legal advice of the Attorney General as to his rights or obligations. I will not make any comment on the Attorney General who was appointed by the Government following the recommendation of the Minister's party, an appointment which gave rise to some surprise in view of his relatively junior status and lack of constitutional experience.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is also directly contrary to what the Leader of the Deputy's party said today in complimenting the Attorney General in the debate on the Estimate for the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The hints, suggestions or words to Deputies of his own party suggest that the Minister is waiting for the view of the Attorney General on legislation he put through the House. That is totally unacceptable.  The Government, who put the legislation through, should have consulted their legal advisers before introducing it and should not now be sheltering behind the fact that they are waiting for advice from their law adviser.  Apparently, the question is whether there was a formal trust deed, whether there is a legally constituted trust document.  From my contacts with the workers, and the current trustees of Castle Brand, I have learned that that matter is exercising the mind of the Attorney General and the Minister and <Col N="2285" /> will do so for a considerable time.  Meantime the workers, and their families, who are frustrated must wait a while longer.</P>
      <P>The Government should not have to rely on whether there was a formal trust document before compensating workers who had contributed to a pension fund. A pension fund was in existence whether or not there was a legally constituted document.  The real issue is whether the Government, or the Minister, are suggesting that there was no pension fund scheme.  If that is the case it is time they said so.  Will they now tell us that those men were contributing to a vacuum?  The Government should recognise that the workers and their families have suffered a lot.  I know many of them very well.  I should like to give an indication of the frustration and bitterness in my home town.  I mentioned to a personal friend of mine, who had been an employee in the factory for 45 years, what I thought was the tragic case of a man who had been employed there for more than 50 years, a person I knew since I was a small boy.  That man could have gone on pension a month before the firm went into liquidation but decided out of loyalty to the concern that he wanted to be the first and, perhaps, the only one, to serve from the beginning to the end and did not go on pension.  He did not go on pension and two or three weeks later he had nothing to recover.  I mentioned that tragedy to a fellow worker of his perhaps five years younger and understandably he felt that my only concern was for the older man and he was quite embittered. We all share concern with every single one of these people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What at this time is the Minister going to tell us?  The trustees of the pension fund now appointed by the court do not know the position: I understand that they wrote to the Minister in September and received a very waffling reply pointing out all the inquiries being made about the legal position.  What we heard, as conveyed by the Minister's colleague, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, at a public meeting of the county council in North Tipperary, seems to suggest that it is not the Minister who is delaying matters but <Col N="2286" /> the Attorney General, as if the Attorney General were not appointed by the same Government from the same party.  This is a collective responsibility of Government. What is the exact position now and what precisely does the Minister propose to do?  What exactly does he want to tell the workers of Nenagh, their families and dependants &mdash; incidentally not just the workers but the whole community who feel outraged at this whole situation. They are appalled that men whom they have respected so long are being deprived of their rights.</P>
    <P>In that context, let me turn to the situation in regard to Roscrea Meat Products. I have to acknowledge that I am not as yet as familiar with the position there, apart from meeting a number of workers who are expressing the gravest possible concern about the position in which they find themselves now that that firm have gone into liquidation.  There are over 200 employees and, like their counterparts in the neighbouring town of Nenagh, these men have worked with the firm for years and are part and parcel of the place.  They took pride in being a part of the firm.  A number of them asked me to find out the position in relation to their rights under the pension fund and what the Minister is proposing to do, what protection, if any they are going to get in the events that have emerged.  In the light of what he and his advisers must know about the position in Roscrea, will the Minister please disclose to us as fully as possible what information he has in relation to that pension fund also and what indemnity will be available for the former employees of Roscrea Meat Products?  I assume the Minister will be aware of the circumstances there; if not I would be amazed.  I assume that he will be concerned.</P>
    <P>I acknowledge that the Minister and the Minister of State present in the House and their advisers are concerned, but concern alone is no good without effective action under the law.  If that action has to be to pursue those who are at fault in order to protect the workers who contributed over the years, let that be done. If that action requires that the Minister <Col N="2287" /> should reimburse the fund, let that be done to whatever extent is necessary, but done it must be.  As we talk here, the bitterness and frustration felt in these two towns, the impact which they are having on families and the tensions they are bringing about are unbelievable.  Here we are, 14 months later, still getting only general explanations about consultation with the Attorney General and no action.</P>
    <P>I want to allow the Minister the opportunity to give me the up to date information and, it is hoped, some news of action at this late stage.  If we are all going to demonstrate that the most fundamental obligation we have is to protect the rights of workers, not alone to employment &mdash; although that is important &mdash; but also to the benefit of their own contributions, it is time that we were seen to act.  Let nobody tell me that we are going to pay them back 12 months' worth of their contributions.  That is not anything like the justice that is required.  What exactly are the proposals of the Minister in both these areas?  I hope that the necessity for me to raise these matters again in this House will not arise.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has regretted the absence in the House of the Minister for Labour. Nobody regrets that absence more than the Minister for Labour himself.  This is an area of his responsibility to which he has paid particular attention and throughout the period during which he has held office it has been one of his priorities.

Throughout his period of office he has taken an interest in the general question of protecting the rights of employees in insolvency situations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I know the Deputy shares as I do, the concern expressed in this debate, at the number <Col N="2289" /> of Irish firms which have gone into liquidation in recent years and the hardship that has been caused to workers, their families and others in their community where those firms find themselves unable to meet their commitments.</P>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, as will other Members of the House of course, that the powers which are on the Statute Book to justify an intervention in these areas are some what limited and that the employers concerned have the primary responsibility in any given case of ensuring that workers' rights are fully protected in the operation of their business. Any complaints that are made by workers, by their trade unions, or their representatives, that the floor of minimum rights conferred by our legislation and initiated over the years by my Department is not being observed are immediately and fully investigated by my Department and arising from that, employers are brought to court if necessary in order to ensure full and adequate compliance with the corpus of relevant labour legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, in the case of liquidation of firms the very insolvency of the employer does, of course, present difficulties in taking legal action to enforce the workers' rights under labour legislation. As the House will be aware &mdash; and Deputy O'Kennedy made reference to this in the course of his contribution &mdash; just about a year ago legislation was introduced, the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, which makes provision for the payment of a range of workers' entitlements direct to my Department in the event of an employer's insolvency.  These include: wages, arrears of statutory minimum wages, holiday pay, sick pay, entitlements under the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act, 1974, the Employment Equality Act, 1977, the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act, 1973, the Unfair Dismissals Act, 1977, and unpaid contributions to company pension schemes. My Department have already this year paid out from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund a total of £3.53 million to meet workers' claims for <Col N="2290" /> unpaid wages, holiday money, minimum notice and so on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>How much for pensions?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeMBirmingham" hpid="Mr. G. Birmingham Mr. G. Birmingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought I was not going to be interrupted.  The Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act does not provide for full funding of occupational pension schemes. The cost of that would be incalculable or certainly astronomical.  The Act does provide for the reimbursement from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund of unpaid pension contributions for 12 months preceding insolvency.  There are difficulties about establishing what the appropriate rates of contributions should be.  Those difficulties are particularly acute in the case of one of the firms mentioned by the Deputy.  In addition, all redundancy payments due by employers to workers which remain unpaid because of the employers' insolvency or any other reason are paid by my Department direct to the workers. A total of £5.7 million in such payments was paid last year.</P>
      <P>In the case of Roscrea Meats, my Department have not received any current complaints regarding breaches of legislation in that firm in regard to workers' rights.  Notice has been received from the liquidator regarding his proposals for terminating the employment of workers on grounds of redundancy. Should those redundancy entitlements not be paid by Roscrea Meats then they will be paid by my Department.  As of now, no application whatever has been made to my Department under the insolvency Act for payment of any other unpaid entitlements of the workers concerned. In the hypothetical event of any such application being received it will be dealt with expeditiously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to occupational pension schemes in firms which are insolvent, the 1984 Act provides for payment to the trustees from the fund of the amount deducted from the employees' remuneration in respect of contributions to an occupational pension scheme during the <Col N="2291" /> 12 months prior to the employers' insolvency but not paid into the scheme and either the outstanding amount due to be paid into the scheme by an employer on his own behalf during the same period or the amount certified by an actuary to be necessary to pay the benefits provided by the scheme on dissolution, whichever is the lesser amount.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Birmingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1984 insolvency Act does not provide for full protection of such pension schemes.  As indicated last year when that Act was being debated in this House, the general question of protection of occupational pension schemes was under consideration by the Minister for Social Welfare.  The Deputy will be aware from newspaper reports that certain developments in that area are imminent.</P>
      <P>The Castle Brand case is an area of considerable complexity and I understand that proceedings are now before the High Court in which the liquidator seeks directions.  The Deputy may correct me if that statement is inaccurate.  The trust deed governing the occupational pension scheme had not been completed and no specific contribution rate was provided for.  In those circumstances it has been necessary to seek detailed legal advice as to the amount payable from the fund.  It is a matter of complexity but it is not appropriate to suggest that all the blame rests on those who have to wrestle with that complexity.</P>

      <P>Given that we have a complex situation, how do we get out of it?  I am not sure whether the Deputy is aware that a pension consultant has recently been appointed to bring his professional talents to bear on the matter and he will of course have regard to the submissions of the trustees and the liquidator. I am pleased to say that the liquidator has promised full co-operation in making available whatever documentation is available in relation to the pension scheme in the company.  I am hopeful that in the near future the information necessary in order to make a decision on the application for payment of funds from the redundancy and employers' insolvency fund will be ascertained.  Representations have been received, including those from the trustees.  I pay tribute to them and to those who have articulated their case.  Representatives of the trustees have already had an opportunity of putting their case to the consultant at a meeting in the Department's offices this morning.</P>

      <P>As indicated in paragraph 7.4 of the White Paper on the public service, the Government have decided that the law should be clarified on such matters as disciplinary action, retirement and dismissal in cases of serious incompetence. This decision is among the subjects which were discussed recently with Civil Service staff interests.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Public Service if he will report to the House on the section within his Department which has special responsibility for women in the Civil Service, its tasks, the programme of action the <Col N="2232" /> section has undertaken; and the changes which have taken place since its inception.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland) John Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>The section within my Department, which was established in January 1984 and which has special responsibility for employment equality serves as a focal point for the co-ordination, development and implementation of policy and as a centre of advice and information over the whole range of equality issues and issues of particular concern to women in the Civil Service.  The principal tasks of the section are related to this remit and include the following:</P>
      <P>(i) negotiations, under the scheme of conciliation and arbitration for the Civil Service, with staff side interests on a range of claims primarily in the areas of equality and women's affairs; (ii) consultation with the Employment Equality Agency on issues of mutual interest; (iii) the promotion, implementation and review of the schemes of job-sharing and career breaks in the Civil Service and in the wider public sector; (iv) the provision of a central advisory service in relation to equality issues and women's affairs generally.</P>
      <P>It will be apparent that the carrying out of these tasks represents a comprehensive programme of action for the section. Perhaps the most important change which has taken place since the women's affairs section was established is the heightening of awareness generally of the importance of women's affairs and in particular of issues relating to equality of opportunity in the Civil Service.  A climate now exists which encourages the discussion and consideration of such matters. This is reflected in the wide range of issues which are being covered in discussions with staff interests and with the Employment Equality Agency.  I believe that the establishment of a section in my Department with special responsibility for employment equality has helped to bring this about.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The change which attracted most attention was, undoubtedly, the introduction of the job-sharing and career <Col N="2233" /> break schemes in the Civil Service and their extension to the wider public sector. These schemes represent a significant advance in the area of equality of opportunity in that they facilitate staff who wish to combine a career with other interests.</P>

      <P>Since I established the special forms design unit in my Department earlier this year, a campaign to improve administrative forms across the Civil Service has been implemented.  The unit, which employs modern computer-aided design technology, has already completed the redesign of some 70 forms. Apart from improvements in quality and intellegibility of the forms in question, this has led to a reduction of some one quarter million pages per annum of printed output, and to substantial savings in costs.  Five forms have been abolished. The unit expects to redesign some 250 forms in a full year.</P>
      <P>The unit has also been heavily involved in the establishment of procedures within Departments to support the forms design campaign.  Measures implemented to date include the following:</P>
      <P>A forms officer has been appointed in every Department and office with specified responsibilities for the control, quality, content and usage of departmental forms.</P>
      <P>A five day training course for officers engaged in forms design work has been developed and presented by the forms design unit.</P>
      <P>Arrangements have been made for the testing of forms used by the public before final designs are adopted.</P>

      <P>At the moment there is no such office.  Some individual Departments, however, have offices which give information on the specific services offered by them to the public.  It is precisely because of the poor information services available to the public that the White Paper on the Public Service, <i>Serving the Country Better</i>, provides for the establishment of Government inquiry offices, initially in Dublin, and later on in local centres. It also provides for the examination, as a matter of urgency, of the possibility of involving local authorities in the provision of information about central and local government services.</P>

      <P>All of the awards in question are now subject to the procedures in the relevant schemes of conciliation and arbitration. As I have already made clear publicly, I have been authorised by the Government to negotiate a comprehensive pay agreement with the public service unions to cover the 25th round and all other pay-related matters and which will take account of the serious Exchequer position.  The treatment of all claims for special pay increases, including existing awards, will naturally fall to be considered in any such talks.  I hope that it will be possible to conclude such negotiations as quickly as possible with a view to resolving all outstanding pay questions to the satisfaction of the parties concerned.</P>
      <P>It would not be appropriate for me at this stage to make any comment on the question of a financial provision.  As the reply to the first part of the question is in the form of a tabular statement I propose to circulate it in the Official Report.</P>

      <P>Information is not available in my Department as to the total quantity of slurry transported annually from the Lough Sheelin catchment.  The details which are available relate to subsidised movements of pig slurry under the special transport scheme introduced at the end of 1980.  Records relate to the period August-April, when slurry movements occurred.  The following approximate volumes of slurry were moved from the catchment since December 1980, with the aid of State subsidy: December 1980 to April 1981 &mdash; 6.95 million gallons; August 1981 to April 1982 &mdash; 15.45 million gallons; August 1982 to April 1983 &mdash; 15.25 million gallons; August 1983 to April 1984 &mdash; 10.74 million gallons; August 1984 to December 1984 &mdash; 4 million gallons.</P>
      <P>Because the State subsidy ended on 31 December 1984, corresponding details of slurry movements since then are not available.  However, I understand from Cavan County Council that an estimated five million gallons of slurry left the catchment in the period January-April 1985.  I am also advised that substantial amounts have been removed since 1 August 1985 but estimates of the quantities involved over the period August-December 1985, will not be available until early next year.</P>

      <P>As indicated in the White Paper, the Government have decided to entend the application of residual control to the remaining commercial State bodies in which it does not yet have a statutory basis.  Indeed, independently of the White Paper decision, residual control is being introduced, as and when legislative opportunity arises, in the case of individual commercial State bodies.  With residual control, the Boards of such bodies are required to have regard to Government or nationally agreed guidelines or Government policy on remuneration and conditions of employment and to comply with any directives on these which may be issued.  The concept is well-established Government policy, having been first introduced in Bord Gáis legislation in 1976.  In the circumstances, negotiations, as such, do not arise in the <Col N="2245" /> extension of residual control to all commercial State bodies by means of a single legislative measure.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 80, 84 and 86 together.</P>
      <P>The questions appear to suggest that the EC Directive requires that, except for those categories of workers named in the Annex, all workers should be given parity in the matter of rights covered by the directive.  My understanding of the directive is that it does not have this implication and that it merely requires that certain existing entitlements of employees, whose employers become insolvent, should be paid from a guaranteed fund.</P>

      <P>As I indicated in reply to a previous Dáil Question, I am consulting the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism as the Minister responsible for the Companies Acts, but it will be appreciated that the question of amendment of section 222 of the 1963 Act raises other issues which require detailed consideration. In these circumstances it would be inappropriate for me to use the provisions of the European Communities Act to amend the Companies Act, 1963, in the manner suggested by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>I am, of course, concerned to ensure that employees of insolvent employers are allowed reasonable opportunity to establish their entitlements under the provisions of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act, 1984, and I am aware of the difficulties that can arise in cases where liquidators claim that they are precluded by virtue of the provisions of section 222 from attending hearings of the Employment Appeals Tribunal.

      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>(a) No prosecutions have been initiated against employers for offences under the Act during the past five years.  (b) RP1 notices are required by the Redundancy Payments Acts and not by the Protection of Employment Act, 1977.  Where an employer proposes to create collective redundancies within the meaning of the latter Act, he is required to notify the Minister in accordance with the Protection of Employment Act, 1977 (Notification of Proposed Collective Redundancies) Regulations, 1977, (SI No. 140 of 1977).  Section 7(2) (e) of the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, exempts from the scope of the Act &ldquo;employees in an establishment the business carried on in which is being terminated following bankruptcy or winding-up proceedings or for any reason as a result of a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction&rdquo;.  (c) There is no provision in the Insolvency Act, 1984, to enable compensation to be paid to employees where notice in accordance with the provisions of the Protection of Employment Act has not been given.  (d) Where there is evidence that a solvent employer has committed an offence under the Protection of Employment Act, 1977, the matter will be submitted to the Chief State Solicitor with a view to initiating <Col N="2261" /> proceedings against him.
