      <P>In view of the fact that there is a reasonably authoritative report in one of the papers this morning from the usually reliable vehicle chosen by the Government for inspired leaks, that the budgetary figures have gone seriously wrong, can the Taoiseach say whether the Minister would be prepared to comment on that matter and when a supplementary budget will be introduced to rectify the position?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell) Jim Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Communications (Mr. J. Mitchell)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1409" /> That a sum not exceeding £131,488,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December, 1985, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Communications and of certain other services administered by that Office, for a cost alleviation payment and for payment of certain grants and grants-in-aid.</P>
    <P>The economic outlook for the international economy is favourable in a number of key respects.  After very strong expansion last year, economic growth in the United States has slowed to a more modest but more sustainable rate, enhancing prospects for continued inflation control.  The Japanese economy continues to grow briskly with even lower inflation.  Real growth in Europe has been associated with an improvement in the underlying conditions for growth &mdash; lower inflation and budget deficits and higher profits and investment.  Taken together, the industrialised economies are now experiencing and economic growth rate of between 3 and 3½ per cent, much the same rate as in the second half of 1984.</P>
    <P>It must be admitted that there are also a number of unsatisfactory features in the international economy.  Unemployment is higher in nearly all countries, and still rising in many.  Indeed, the OECD pointed out recently that unemployment in Europe is at its highest rate for more than 50 years.  Other features which may jeopardise the upswing in economic activity include high budget deficits in a number of countries, the increased volatility of exchange rates, growing international trade tensions and a still fragile economic and financial situation in many developing countries.</P>
    <P>The Irish economy has been performing well by comparison with our trading partners.  In 1984, our gross domestic product grew by about 3½ per cent, one of the highest rates in the EC.  We have clearly learned to crub inflation quite effectively, as evidenced by the results of <Col N="1410" /> the past few years.</P>
    <P>The rate was over 23 per cent at the end of 1981; it was down to 6.2 per cent for the year to mid-February 1985.  This rate is now lower than that of the UK our main trading partner, and close to the average of our EC partners.</P>
    <P>The sustained growth of exports has been particularly encouraging.  The growth has been underpinned by exceptionally strong growth in our manufactured exports.  Largely as a result of the activities of foreign firms, Ireland's share of export markets in the new industries continued to rise sharply in recent years; other sectors have done less well.</P>
    <P>The rapid expansion in exports, coupled with the slower growth, has ensured a continuing improvement in our external account.  Indeed, our external trade account has changed from a position of substantial deficit to one of broad balance.  The Central Bank has projected a modest surplus for this year.</P>
    <P>The encouraging features on the economic front should not cause us to lose sight of problems remaining to be solved. There is no doubt that unemployment is our biggest problem.  Despite the improvements in the economy, no significant dent has been made in the number out of work.  Nevertheless, there have been some encouraging signs recently, with reductions being recorded in three successive months in the number of people on the live register.</P>
    <P>Both the national plan and this year's budget have the objective of improving the climate for job creation.  But our room for manoeuvre is limited.  We have to continue to tackle our serious budgetary problems.  We cannot continue to record high deficits on the current budget.  We cannot continue to borrow indiscriminately.</P>
    <P>There are constraints, therefore in creating a climate conducive to economic growth and job creation.  The national plan proposed a number of special employment creation measures to help improve the job situation.  But if a significant dent is to be made in our level of unemployment, all sectors of the community <Col N="1411" /> have to &ldquo;do their bit&rdquo;.  Government alone cannot create jobs, particularly if there are to be sustainable jobs.</P>
    <P>There is need for significant employment growth in the private non-agricultural sector.  As last month's OECD Report on Ireland put it &ldquo;with agriculture and the public sector accounting for about 45 per cent of total employment, the employment growth in other sectors will have to be twice the likely labour force growth to stabilise the unemployment rate&rdquo;.  The task is daunting but with the combination of the employment measures announced by Government, disciplined economic management, a controlled approach to budgetary matters and competitive wage structures, we can do a lot to stimulate the creation of new jobs and to protect existing jobs.</P>
    <P>It is against that economic background that I introduce these Estimates.</P>
    <P>The Department of Communications, established on 2 January 1984, is now about eighteen months in being.  The total expenditure provided for in this Estimate (approximately £131.5 million) shows a decrease of approximately £2 million on the provisional 1984 outturn.  While this is not a very big saving, it is significant in the sense that it represents a reduction, rather than an increase, in the level of public expenditure, reflecting the Government's commitment to reducing the burden on the taxpayer, without reducing the level of service to the public.</P>
    <P>The present year will see many developments in the transport, broadcasting, telecommunications and postal sectors. This applies particularly on the legislative front.  Already under debate in the Dáil or Seanad are the Air Transport Bill; the Road Transport Bill; The Dublin Transport Authority Bill; and the Canals Bill. These Bills will be followed in the near future by the Customs-Free Ports Bill; the Shannon Ports Authority Bill; the Rosslare Harbour Bill; the CIE Re-structurning Bill; the Transport Bill; the Sea Pollution Bill; the Local Radio Bill; and the Broadcasting and Wireless Telegraphy Bill.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> This year too will see a Green Paper on National Transport Policy, the first of its kind here.  This paper will have two aims, to inform and to consult.  It will inform in the sense that it will describe the current position in the various sections of Irish transport and developments already decided.  The paper will be consultative in the sense that it will pose for consideration possible changes of direction or emphasis in existing policy and will invite public discussion on these and on transport policy generally.</P>
    <P>I do not need to stress the importance of making the best use of our national resources, finding for example, the right balance between monopoly and competition, between public and private transport and between the different transport modes.  Developments in the EC also have to be taken into account.  I will be surprised if the Green Paper does not provoke quite a deal of comment and controversy and be helpful in reaching conclusions on the course future transport policy should take.</P>
    <P>CIE are on a sustained road to recovery. By 1982, there had been thirteen years of losses escalating by a multiple of the rate of inflation.  By contrast, 1983 and 1984 have seen a 20 per cent reduction in real terms in the deficit.  And so far in 1985 we are on target for a further reduction in the deficit in real terms.</P>
    <P>This happy picture is even more dramatic when compared with what the deficit would have been had the trend of the previous fifteen years continued. Moreover, the fact that inflation is down to low single figures and that CIE are still beating it these past two and a half years, is a cause for much encouragement.  With the new above-the-line subvention formula there is a good chance that, when CIE's accounts for 1984 are finalised, they will have broken even.</P>
    <P>This is good news, not alone for the board, management and workforce of CIE, but also for the taxpayer who has to fund it.  While there is no room for complacency, I think it right that these achievements should be recognised and I want to congratulate all in CIE for their efforts.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1413" /> When I came to office.  I said that my first priority for CIE was to create a new environment for it to operate within. What have we done?  First, within six months of coming to office this Government decided on a new five-year approach to CIE's finances and to abandon the wishful thinking, the lack of control, the drift, which characterised Government's relationship with CIE for many years past.</P>
    <P>The Government formula effectively provided that one-third of CIE's expenditure would be paid by the Government provided that expenditure is reduced in real terms by 2½ per cent per annum up to 1989.  That these targets for two years now have been met, and without massive redundancies or cuts in service, is testimony to the wisdom of the approach. Now CIE knows well in advance what their allocation is and can plan to keep within it.  Previously, a figure &mdash; often bearing no relation to reality &mdash; would be notified to CIE two or three weeks before the commencement of the relevant financial year.  This lack of notice and lack of reality were constantly rewarded, not surprisingly, by being ignored.  As a result CIE's finances had rockted almost out of control.</P>
    <P>The improvement now is preceptible and real.  In addition, the Government decided last year to taken on responsibility for the interest charges on DART and also to take responsibility for £30 million of CIE's short term borrowings.  Provision for implementation of the latter decision will be contained in a short Transport Bill which I will be introducing fairly soon.</P>
    <P>These improvements in the financial regime for CIE have been accompained by major investment.  CIE now have a new urban bus fleet and a new electrified suburban rail system.  In 1983 the go-ahead was given for 124 new mainline rail coaches, many of which are already in service.  In addition, the national plan provided for the commencement of the replacement of the rural bus fleet, starting this year and to be completed in three years.</P>
    <P>These provisions have been accompained <Col N="1414" /> by a major overhaul and strengthening of the board of CIE.  The enactment of the Dublin Transport Authority Bill and the Road Transport Bill will be the next steps in the creation of the new environment which I have set out to establish.</P>
    <P>A further major step is now urgent and that is the passage of the legislation to reorganise CIE into three operating subsidiaries under a parent board.  The legislation is in preparation, will be enacted as soon as possible, and in any event before this year is out.</P>
    <P>I feel I should say a few words about the reorganisation for I know that, until it is completed, uncertainty and worry will abound in CIE.  This is already the case.  Indeed, among some sections in CIE it is leading to resistance.  It is important that it should be known that the whole purpose of the reorganisation is not to close CIE, as some pessimists fear, but to ensure its future by organising it in a way best suited to serve the customer whose support is vital to any company's success.</P>
    <P>The completion of the reorganisation is in the best interests of the workforce and the travelling public alike.  I want to appeal strongly to all in CIE to assist in the reorganisation so as to ensure that recent encouraging trends are continued in the future.</P>
    <P>I am very happy to reiterate the Government's decision to approve an increase in CIE wages grade pensions from a maximum of £16.50 per week to a maximum of £34.50 per week.  The intention is to supplement normal social welfare payments so that generally CIE workers receive a pension equivalent to two-thirds of their wages when retired. Subject to there being no sustainable objection, it is planned to make these increases payable to 3,900 existing pensioners from 1 July next.  This improvement will cost CIE approximately £2 million in a full year.  I am delighted that this has been possible, as I know personally many men who have given a lifetime of service to the company.</P>
    <P>I should also mention, that in an effort to ensure the continuity of employment <Col N="1415" /> at the GAC bus building plant at Shannon, the Government recently decided to reschedule the CIE allocation for bus building in the period covered by the national plan; £10 million from the 1987 allocation for bus acquisition is being brought forward to 1985.  This reallocation will maintain employment at GAC for the remainder of 1985.</P>
    <P>Before leaving CIE there remains the major problem of their enormous long term borrowings, about which I am concerned and which need careful consideration. Moreover, I must repeat the need for a sustained improvement in industrial relations in Dublin city services.  Strikes and threats of strikes are the ruination of the Dublin bus services.  If a sustained peace pact could be agreed, I believe a big increase in passengers would be achieved.</P>
    <P>The Vote includes an amount of £400,000 under subhead S to defray the running cost in 1985 of the proposed Dublin Transport Authority.  In my Second Stage speech on the Bill yesterday, I outlined the structure and functions of the Authority, so I shall not go into detail today on the proposals.  I would like to repeat, however, that it will become the road traffic authority for Dublin and will also have important functions in the areas of transport planning and funding and public transport services.</P>
    <P>I intend to establish the DTA and to have them in operation as soon as possible following enactment of the Bill.  The running costs of the Authority in 1985 will not be permitted to exceed the voted figure of £400,000.  This figure is net of the costs of the traffic warden service, which will be transferred to the Authority. The timing of the transfer and the precise number involved have yet to be decided but the transfer will not, in any event, give rise to any net increase in expenditure.</P>
    <P>The Authority will take over from the Dublin Transportation Task Force responsibility for the traffic management strategy which the task force have been pursuing in recent years.  Subhead R of <Col N="1416" /> the Vote contains a provision of £420,000 for this work in 1985.  Of this, £66,000 approximately will be incurred on the installation of the system known as Urban Traffic Control.  This system involves the computerised co-ordination of traffic signals in the city centre.  By optimising the signal timing co-ordination and thereby minimising vehicle stop-starts, UTC improves overall traffic speeds and alleviates congestion.</P>
    <P>Outside the UTC area, a bus priority system known as Selective Bus Detection will be implemented on a limited pilot scheme basis in 1985 at a cost of approximately £315,000.  SBD is an electronic form of bus priority, through which buses are given priority at signalised junctions. The system involves the use of electronic transponders mounted on buses and detectors located at signalised junctions. While the scope for further buslance of the type already implemented in the Dublin area has become limited, there will be a small number of buslance implemented in 1985, and a sum of £39,000 is provisionally ear-marked for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I am sure many Deputies will have read the Road Transport Bill which has completed Second Stage in the Seanad. The new legislation will achieve the completion, on a phased basis over a period of about two years, of the liberalisation of road haulage which was begun in 1971. I am confident that the move away from present quantitative restrictions to a licensing system based solely on qualitative control will improve efficiency and thereby contribute to a reduction in transport costs.  This is an important transport reform measure which I will go into in greater detail when the Bill reaches the floor of this House.</P>
    <P>The liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited was undoubtedly a major blow to the shipping industry and to the commercial State sector generally.  Every possible option was identified and examined in considerable depth before the Government took the decision not to provide additional finance for the company.  The Government did not, however, have any real choice in the matter.  On the basis <Col N="1417" /> of advice from reputable international shipbrokers on the likely trend of freight rates over the period, the total cost to the Exchequer of keeping Irish Shipping Limited going for the next five years would have been about £145 million.  Furthermore, even if the Exchequer met this enormous bill, the company would still have had debts of £59 million at the end of 1989 and there were little grounds for expecting that they would be in a position to service them from their own resources.</P>
    <P>To put this whole matter in a clear perspective, I would point out that it would have cost the Exchequer over £76,000 per job per year to maintain each job in Irish Shipping Limited for the next five years with no real expectation that the company would be viable at the end of that time.  In the circumstances, it would have been economically and socially indefensible to use limited State resources to keep Irish Shipping Limited in operation at such a cost.</P>
    <P>The problems of Irish Shipping pensioners were fully considered in the House during the recent debate on a Supplementary Estimate.  Pensioners of Irish Shipping who served on Irish ships during World War II have now had the <i>ex gratia</i> element of their pensions restored to them; the <i>ex gratia</i> element had been paid by the company before the appointment of a liquidator by the High Court.  I am saddened that legal and other sensitives do not permit me to be more generous with the rest of Irish Shipping Limited's pensioners and former employees.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I company are in serious financial difficulties and have been in a loss making situation since 1979.  During the past four years the company incurred losses of over £40 million and had become almost totally dependent on the Exchequer. To enable the company to continue their operations over this period, the Exchequer have had to provide £29 million in equity capital.</P>
    <P>It was against this background that I recently effected changes in the chairmanship and management of the company. As Deputies are aware, I have engaged the services of a management consultancy firm for a three year period <Col N="1418" /> to review the business and operations of the B &amp; I and to provide a management service for the company.  This aspect of the assignment devolves on Mr. Alex Spain, who has taken up position as chairman and managing director of the company.</P>
    <P>Mr. Spain will have the support services of the management company and it will be his task, with the agreement of the B &amp; I board and my approval, to identify and effect the measures necessary to restore the company to profitable operation by the end of 1986.  In this endeavour, account will be taken of the need to maintain Irish Participation in the provision of cross-channel passenger and freight services.</P>
    <P>Expenditure on essential harbour works this year is expected to total £16.029 million, which compares with an outturn of £6.422 million in 1984.  The total amount of Exchequer assistance for harbours, including voted and non-voted moneys, is £13.623 million, comprising £9.623 million grant and £4 million Local Loans Fund financing.</P>
    <P>The grant allocation includes £4.8 million for the deepwater wharf at Ringa-skiddy in Cork harbour.  Work on this project commenced in 1984 and is due for completion in 1986.  I will be introducing the Bill to establish a free port at Ringaskiddy during the present Dáil session and I am confident that, when the free port is established and the deepwater wharf is completed, new industry will be attracted to the Cork area and increased traffic will be generated through the port. The Government have recently decided on a financial package for the Dublin Port and Docks Board.  The package is comprised of grant assistance, including £3 million in 1985, a State guarantee for borrowings, a requirement for the board to take cost cutting and revenue increasing measures and to dispose of assets. The State assistance is contingent on the conclusion of negotiations which have been under way for some weeks between Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the dock labour force.  Industrial peace at the port is vital if the port is to prosper.  I am confident that these measures will restore <Col N="1419" /> Dublin port to viability and revive user confidence.  As I said on the Adjournment recently, the Government cannot save Dublin port; that is something which can only be achieved by the parties involved &mdash;management and staff.</P>
    <P>Some time ago I met both management and unions and offered both of them timely advice.  The urgency of that advice has regrettably been ignored.  I was most concerned, therefore, to hear that notwithstanding the financial help offered by the Government, the negotiations between Dublin Cargo Handling Limited and the unions have run into problems.  I do not propose to comment further on those problems at this stage because it would not be helpful for me to do so.  All that I will say is that it is imperative that those problems should be resolved very quickly if Dublin Port is to have any future.  Finally, I regret very much the opportunism, inaccuracy and dishonesty of Deputy Bertie Ahern's statement last night which is wholly unhelpful in resolving this urgent problem.</P>
    <P>As announced in the national plan, the Government have decided that a harbour authority under the aegis of my Department should be set up for Rosslare harbour. The harbour is at present owned by the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company.  Implementation of that decision, involving legislation both here and in the UK, will be effected at the earliest possible date.  In the meantime, CIE will continue to be responsible for the management and operation of the harbour and will be pressing ahead with necessary development works.  Grant assistance is being made available this year towards the cost of providing passenger handling facilities at Rosslare.  In addition, a State grant of £132,000 is being made to the RNLI to cover the cost of improved harbour facilities for the Rosslare lifeboat.</P>
    <P>Sligo Harbour Commissioners will receive grant assistance of £470,000 this year in respect of a major dredging scheme at the harbour.  This project, which is being fully financed by the Exchequer and is due for completion <Col N="1420" /> shortly, will enable the harbour to accommodate larger vessels and will greatly improve its trading capacity.  The balance of the grant assistance &mdash; £720,000 &mdash; is in respect of project at the harbours of Drogheda, Dundalk, Foynes, Tralee and Fenit.  The foregoing projects do not include those being financed from the Local Loans Fund, nor do they include projects funded by commercial borrowings or own resources.</P>
    <P>About the air companies, I am glad to report that in the year to March 1984, the total group made a profit of £8.5 million before tax.  This was a very significant improvement after three years of losses. For the year to March 1985, the board of the companies expect to record a further improved financial result, which will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Total passengers on the Altantic route in 1984-85 were up 5 per cent on 1983-84. In Europe, scheduled passengers were up 4 per cent but charter pasengers, mainly outbound passengers to sun destinations, were down 20 per cent.  In the case of cargo, the airline recorded increased of 12 per cent in Europe and 11 per cent on the Atlantic.</P>
    <P>In the current year, Aer Lingus are looking forward to a very good summer due to the pick up in the world economy and the strong US dollar.  Overall, the airline expect to carry an extra 5 per cent to 6 per cent of scheduled passengers in 1985-86.  Aer Lingus anticipate a growth of 9 per cent in the total number of visitors they will bring into Ireland, with a 14 per cent-15 per cent growth in visitors from the USA, an 8 per cent growth in visitors from Britian and a modest growth of approximately 3 per cent on continental European routes.</P>
    <P>The results of the past two years and the growth in passenger numbers projected for the current year are satisfactory, but there is no scope for complacency.  The turnaround from losses to profits was an essential first step. Aer Lingus must now redouble their efforts to earn such profits as will enable the aircraft fleet to be re-equipped.  Only with a good profit record will the airline <Col N="1421" /> be able to attract the funding for fleet replacement.</P>
    <P>There are a few aspects I would like to highlight.  The Are Lingus ancillary activities, outside the transport of their own passengers and freight, are highly successful.  Many of these are overseas such as the Dunfey hotel chain in the United States, the Tara Hotel in London and the Hotel Commodore in Paris. Other ventures involving large scale operations outside Ireland include hospital management projects by PARC and data communications projects by Cara Data Processing, while the Guinness Peat Aviation Group, in which Aer Lingus now hold a 23 per cent shareholding continue as one of the great success stories of Irish aviation.</P>
    <P>By end March 1985, the Aer Lingus Programme of ancillary activities had contributed over £100 million net profit to the airline over a ten-year period.  This has enabled the airline and their group of companies to maintain and increase total employment in Ireland, while reducing by 1,000 over five years the numbers required for air transport.</P>
    <P>In addition to providing maintenance services for other carriers at Dublin Airport, the Aer Lingus activities division has teams of maintenance and flying staff deployed internationally, particularly in Africa and the Caribbean.  Its contribution to the advancement of technology in Ireland in a wide range of activities, including the computer field, is immense. It has shown the enterpreneurship and dynamism that we need from all Irish enterprise, whether public or privately owned.  With the airline facing massive challenges on the fleet replacement front &mdash; irrespective of whether replacement aircraft are to be purchased or leased &mdash; it is clear that the contribution which the ancillary activities can make will be crucial.</P>
    <P>The second aspect of Aer Lingus I would like to refer to is the North Atlantic operation.  We cannot blind ourselves to the fact that the Atlantic operation continues to incur heavy losses and is a major drain on the airline's resources.  The cost <Col N="1422" /> alleviation payments totalling £1.5 million, of which £4 million is provided for in subhead U, will come to an end next year.  No one should underestimate the difficulties of keeping the Atlantic operation going and, if we had any doubts on that score, the recent decision of Transamerican Airlines to terminate their scheduled services is a salutary reminder of these difficulties.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus face major challenges and board, management and staff must strive to make the airline as lean and cost efficient as their major competitors, both on the Atlantic and within Europe.  My Department will be engaging with Aer Lingus in a detailed appraisal of the strategies and options open to the national airline, both in terms of the Atlantic situation and the challenge posed by fleet replacement.</P>
    <P>In the past few years there has been a growing consumer clamour for greater airline competition and lower air fares within Europe.  While this phenomenon was more muted in Ireland than elsewhere in Europe, the publication last June of the Air Transport Bill, 1984, provided a domestic focus for a welcome debate on competition and regulation in the air transport sector.  I have made a number of statement in recent months in defence of the Bill and in support of the strategic need for effective Government control of airline activity.</P>
    <P>However, I have also made it clear that I have been consistently in favour of greater competition, particularly within Europe.  In the ongoing debate in this area, I believe that many commentators have consistently overlooked the fact that my regulatory functions, including those of fares approval, can be applied and have been applied by me to create a more competitive environment.  I do not propose to elaborate in any greater detail on this subject now, as the matter is being exhaustively debated on Committee Stage of the Air Transport Bill currently before the House.</P>
    <P>Aer Rianta's management of the three State airport has been one of the less difficult sports of recent years.  The company <Col N="1423" /> have turned in quite good trading results and I am happy to report that this trend has continued with the handling over to the Exchequer of a surplus of £8 million in 1984, followed by a further £1 million in the early days of 1985.  These results have been achieved despite rather sluggish passenger traffic trends and owe much to the success of the company in trimming their costs.  However, no allowance is made for depreciation or interest charges and more careful analysis prompts the question as to whether Aer Rianta could do better.</P>
    <P>Dublin Airport contribute some 70 per cent of the Aer Rianta surplus.  In 1984 that contribution came to £7.4 million. However, traffic numbers at Dublin are static and this is a matter for some concern, particularly in the light of the substantial investment in a new replacement runway announced in the national plan.</P>
    <P>Shannon Airport have recovered from the losses of the 1979-82 period and turned in a surplus of £3.3 million last year.  The success of the Aeroflot re-fuelling facility, growth in US visitor numbers, expansion of mail order and duty free sales, and the promotion of Shannon as a technical stopping point for re-fuelling, catering, etc., have all contributed to the turnaround.  Tight cost control has also made its contribution.  The 1984 results from Cork were also encouraging, with losses being reduced from a 1983 level of £728,000 to £72,000.  Further concentration on securing cost economies and widening of the traffic base through Aer Rianta's Cork marketing initiative should lead to a surplus at Cork for the first time since the airport was opened in 1961.</P>
    <P>However, as I have said, in looking at the company's results, regard must be had to the fact that no provision is included for interest or depreciation since all the capital assets have been provided by the Exchequer.  On the basis of national provisions prepared in my Department, such charges amounted to £4.7 million in 1984.  The present arrangements do not provide an effective yardstick by which Aer Rianta's financial <Col N="1424" /> performance can be measured.  I have, therefore, set up a small review group to consider what changes should be made in the company's status or financial structure.</P>
    <P>I am allocating a total of £4.1 million for capital works at the State airports this year as compared with expenditure of £2.4 million in 1984.  Provision has been made for commencement of work on the new runway at Dublin Airport, the largest State airport project to be undertaken for sometime.</P>
    <P>Apart from the runway project, a number of airport constructional works and items of equipment, including improvements in passenger and cargo facilities and the replacement of firefighting facilities, will be provided.</P>
    <P>The Estimate includes an allocation of £750,000 for regional-local airports, the bulk of which is earmarked for regional airport development at Galway.  That particular project was to have commenced last year but, because of a number of problems encountered by the promoters, it has not yet started.  A condition of the grant commitment for the project is that there will be a local contribution of 25 per cent of the total capital cost.</P>
    <P>Some £12 million in Exchequer grant assistance has been provided for regional-local airport development in recent years, in contrast with local contributions amounting to only £0.4 million.  In some instances there was no local contribution and I have grave reservations about the merits of some of the projects which were grant-aided.  I am accordingly carrying out a detailed policy review in this area.</P>
    <P>I am making an allocation of £3.05 million to cover the cost of electronic navigation and communications equipment for civil aviation and the marine coast stations.  This equipment is required in order to ensure the safety and regularity of civil aviation and to continue to meet our international obligations.  The principal new projects that will commence during 1985 are two instrument landing systems for Dublin Airport and one instrument landing system for Cork Airport.  New reserve VHF air-ground <Col N="1425" /> communications systems will be provided at Dublin and Shannon Airports during 1985 and a consultant is drafting specifications for new operational and stand-by communications systems at both airports.</P>
    <P>Last March an electrical fault in a component damaged the operational and stand-by communications systems at Dublin Airport.  While the reserve system remained available it was decided to close the airport for half an hour until the extent of the damage had been assessed. At no stage was there a risk to aircraft.</P>
    <P>Over the past four years the total expenditure on electronic equipment was £7.63 million; the total amount originally sanctioned was £9.28 million.  This underspending, which did not give rise to unsafe aircraft operations, was primarily due to staffing problems which included staff association objections to the engagement of outside consultants.  As these objections have since been relaxed it is hoped to expend virtually all of the 1985 allocation during the year.  I am urgently considering how an audit might be carried out on the performance of the various aviation technical services so as to obviate past difficulties.</P>
    <P>It is expected that the Protocol amending the Eurocontrol Convention will be ratified by all the member states before the end of 1985.  When the amended Convention comes into force we will assume ownership of the Eurocontrol facilities in Ireland.  In this context I would wish to tell Deputies that the replacement secondary surveillance radar facility at Woodcock Hill, Shannon, which it is hoped to have in operational service during the next couple of months, will be one of the Eurocontrol facilities to be transfered to Ireland.</P>
    <P>As the House is aware, I introduced a licensing and bonding scheme for the travel trade in November 1983.  From that date it is illegal to trade as a tour operator or travel agent without a licence under the Transport (Tour Operators and Travel Agents) Act, 1982.  That Act provides for severe penalties for illegal trading and other offences.  The new arrangements represent a significant development in the area of consumer protection <Col N="1426" /> for persons travelling abroad.</P>
    <P>It was fortunate that the scheme was in operation in 1984, which proved to be a very difficult year for the travel trade. Capacity for overseas holidays greatly exceeded demand and, in an effort to stimulate traffic growth, some members of the trade resorted to the sale of holiday packages at uneconomic rates.  In terms of earnings the results were disappointing and cash flow problems were experienced.</P>
    <P>A total of five travel firms were unable to meet their obligations to their customers under overseas travel contracts during the second half of 1984 and the statutory rescue arrangements had to be brought into operation.  Happily, the arrangements worked out satisfactorily.  In that regard my Department received ready help and co-operation not only from the travel trade itself but also from airlines, the bond guarantors and other interests. I owe a word of praise and thanks to all concerned.</P>
    <P>Over 2,000 people whose holidays might otherwise have been seriously disrupted were enabled to complete their holidays.  In two cases, the bond moneys were inadequate so recourse was had to the Travellers' Protection Fund established to supplement the rescue funds available under the bonding arrangements.</P>
    <P>Bond moneys totalling £243,000, supplemented by £82,000 from the Travellers' Protection Fund, were disbursed to date.  The final costs of the rescue arrangements are not yet known, as processing of a number of claims has yet to be finalised.  The amount in the fund at a recent date was in excess of £1.3 million.</P>
    <P>The travel trade is naturally very anxious to avoid a recurrence of last year's problems and is aiming to ensure that available capacity will be related more closely to market demand.  This problem was discussed with the Spanish Civil Aviation Authorities last January and both sides agreed that a 10 per cent cutback in 1985 on the excessive capacity provided in 1984 to Spain, the biggest market, was necessary.  Subsequently, the airlines agreed on their respective <Col N="1427" /> levels of participation in the market for 1985.  Further voluntary capacity cutbacks to Spain have since been made by the airlines, as a result of which capacity in 1985 will be at least 30 per cent below that of 1984.  I am hopeful that these cutbacks will eliminate in 1985 the instability which characterised tour operators' activities last year.</P>
    <P>The Meteorological Service have plans for the replacement over the next five years of some of the larger items of their computer and technical equipment which is now nearing the end of its useful life. A start on this programme is being made this year.</P>
    <P>An Post, the semi-State body with responsibility for the operation of the Irish postal service, is just over a year old.  The company is one of the largest employers in the State, providing employment directly or indirectly for nearly 11,000 people spread over 95 main offices and 2,150 sub-post offices.  The strategy adopted by the company, and to which I have assented, is one of growth within a cost-containment programme, involving vigorous marketing with moderation in postal rate increases.  The overall objective of the company is to make the post more competitive with a view to increasing postal volumes and achieving financial autonomy for the postal service at the earliest possible date.</P>
    <P>From the outset, An Post have caught the public imagination through a series of well planned marketing initiatives such as the Penny Post operation and the St. Patrick's Day card ideas.  Other initiatives which have helped to heighten the corporate identity of the new postal company include the new publicity post scheme for unaddressed advertising material, the special 17p Christmas stamp and the love stamp scheme for St. Valentine's Day.</P>
    <P>The accounts for the first year of operation of the company have just been published. They show a loss of £5.37 million for the year, before allowing for the £5 million Exchequer grant provided in 1984.  This was a creditable performance <Col N="1428" /> and better than had been forecast and I congratulate the company on it.</P>
    <P>The long-standing financial target of the postal service was to break even, taking one year with another, and that was broadly achieved in the period up to 1978.  Thereafter, following the prolonged strike in 1979, heavy losses were incurred.  However, following the very steep increases in charges in 1981-82, and a slowing down in the rate of pay increases, the losses in the service were brought more under control.  Provision was, neverthless, made in the 1984 Estimate for payment of a £5 million grant to An Post and this was duly paid.</P>
    <P>The financial performance of the postal service in recent years and its prospects were reviewed in the context of the national plan and the Government decided that, in the light of these and of the difficult position of the public finances generally, financial support for the postal service over the period of the plan should be limited to the provision of £4 million equity capital in 1985 and £3 million in 1986.</P>
    <P>Irish postal charges have been regarded as high by international standards, although they are becoming less so as a result of having been kept unchanged between April 1982 and February 1985. An Post are aware of the importance of maintaining this Government's policy of moderation in postal rate increases so as to increase the volume of traffic carried and so make maximum use of their resources.</P>
    <P>A balance must, therefore, be struck between price moderation and the achievement of financial autonomy.  With these objectives in mind, I approved of proposals by An Post for adjustments in the postal tariffs structure with effect from February last.  The principal attraction of the new package is that the basic letter charges at 22p and 26p, which affect the bulk of postal users, will remain unchanged for the fourth year in succession&mdash;something I have been insisting on since I became Minister&mdash;while postage to other EC states will actually be reduced to domestic levels in the interests of trade and business.  Increases&mdash;where <Col N="1429" /> they occur &mdash; are concentrated in letters over 20 grammes, non-standard items and parcels.  In rationalising rates and bringing them into line with pricing structures in other EC countries, some charges had to be increased substantially, but this was inevitable and reflected the cost of handling the types of mail in question.</P>
    <P>An Post have clearly shown their capacity to innovate.  This will be an essential requirement for the future as the postal service will face competition from alternative message transmission system such as electronic mail and from new electronic fund transfer systems.  I know that An Post have under review what action they should take within their overall legislative mandate to counter these threats, take advantage of the opportunities they present and expand business generally.  I expect the results of that consideration will become evident over the next year.</P>
    <P>Overall, the operations of An Post in their first year have vindicated the Government's decision to entrust the postal service to a new State-sponsered body.  My impression is that there has been a perceptible shift of public opinion in favour of An Post in recognition of the work and initiatives undertaken by the new company, and they are to be congratulated on their achievements.</P>
    <P>In the period since their establishment in January 1984, Bord Telecom Éireann have pressed ahead with improving the telecommunications services.  Last year was a record one in terms of provision of service to customers.  Over 70,000 telephone connections were made, and the waiting lists were greatly reduced, particularly for data services.  The position has now been reached where telephone service is freely available over most of the country, the main exceptions being parts of Dublin and parts of the Sligo region; the waiting lists in these areas are being reduced progressively.</P>
    <P>Improvement of the STD service and repair service, the conversion of manual exchanges to automatic working and expansion and development of the network were also continued.  A new high speed data service was introduced and an <Col N="1430" /> automatic telephone service for use in cars in the Dublin area will be available shortly.</P>
    <P>I would like to congratulate the board, management and staff of the company on their achievements in the first year.  But the job of providing a high quality telephone service nationally is not yet finished and upgrading and expansion of the service is a continuing process, particularly when technology is developing so quickly.</P>
    <P>The company have also been striving to make the business more customeroriented and have made a number of improvements, for example in the customer billing area where a Freephone service has been introduced to make it easy for customers to get information about their telephone bills.  The company are also ordering equipment to enable detailed billing of automatic calls to be provided where customers require that.</P>
    <P>The legislation establishing the company envisaged that the company's monopoly would end at a terminal point in the subscribers' premises and that there would be competition in the supply of equipment beyond that point.  It is the intention to implement this change on a phased basis over the next year or so.</P>
    <P>When the terms on which BTE was to be established were being settled, it was decided that £355 million of the debt capital made available by the Exchequer for development of the services should be converted to equity.  This was on the basis that, over a period of ten years from vesting, the company would pay dividends on the capital equal to the annuities that would have been paid if it had continued to be treated as debt capital.  In practice, of course, the Exchequer has to continue to service this debt.</P>
    <P>When drawing up the national plan last autumn, the Government were faced with the alternatives of increasing taxation to service this debt or requiring BTE to make the necessary contributions in a situation where Government expenditure had already been trimmed to the maximum, prudent extent.  Having weighed these alternatives the Government <Col N="1431" /> concluded, reluctantly, that BTE should be required to make the necessary contributions.  In coming to that decision, the Government believed it was more equitable that telephone users should meet these costs in the short term rather than the public at large, and I believe the public generally will agree that this was the proper course.</P>
    <P>The company will be given full credit, at current net value terms for these contributions against the debt capital taken over by BTE from the Exchequer.  The net effect for the company is that, over time, they will be fully compensated for these payments and they will cost the company nothing.  Much of the publicity about these contributions has been ill-informed and the former chief executive was wrong to so consistently enter into public controversy in a manner that would not be tolerated in any private sector group.</P>
    <P>As a result of the heavy investment in the service in recent years, at a time of high costs, telephone charges in this country are high by international standards. However, there was no increase in charges between April 1983 and April 1985 and the increases, averaging 7½ per cent from last April, were well below the level of inflation.  The aim of the company is to keep increases within the rate of inflation and I would hope they will be able to do this consistently and so make charges here more competitive.</P>
    <P>The company's accounts for the first 15 months of their operations are not yet available but it is expected that, after allowing for interest and depreciation, they will show a heavy loss over the period as they have done in recent years. With the development period coming to and end, however, the company should move steadily into profits.  Telecommunications are a growth service and I believe they have a very encouraging future.</P>
    <P>Overall, on the telecommunications side, much has been achieved but there is still some way to go before the service and all its facilities are in the satisfactory state the chairman of the company and I <Col N="1432" /> would wish.  However, I have no doubt that BTE's future is a very bright one.</P>
    <P>In the major statement on broadcasting matters I issued last March, I reviewed most aspects of broadcasting, both radio and television, and developments in prospect.  I also touched on a number of these in the course of debate in the House in March.  I do not propose, therefore, to dwell in detail on them at this stage but it might be helpful to Deputies, however, if I were to refer briefly to them.</P>
    <P>The changes and developments I envisaged then were as follows: a much greater availability of frequencies over the next six years; the establishment of an interim Local Radio Commission; the introduction of a Local Radio Bill; the introduction of a Wireless Telegraphy Bill; the publication of the Cable TV Systems Report; receipt of recommendations from the the inter-departmental committee on the allocation of a satellite franchise, and arranging a consultancy examination of RTE.  I propose to comment only on those matters where there have been developments since then.</P>
    <P>An interim local radio commission, under the chairmanship of Dr. Colm Ó hEocha, has been established to prepare the way for the speedy introduction of legal local radio when the legislation is enacted.  The commission is a highly competent one and it has been active in undertaking the task entrusted to it.  I have every confidence that the interim commission will do a first-class job.  As the Taoiseach has indicated in replies to questions here in the Dáil, it is the intention to proceed with the Local Radio Bill within the next few weeks and I would hope that it will be possible to have it enacted before the summer recess.  Some indications have been given publicly of the form the legislation is likely to take but, as it has not yet been approved fully and circulated, it would be inappropriate to be speculating on its terms at this stage.  Moreover, the House will have the opportunity of debating the proposals fully when the Bill is under discussion.</P>
    <P>The new Broadcasting and Wireless <Col N="1433" /> Telegraphy Bill, providing for the updating of existing penalties and the introduction of some new ones, has been drafted and will be circulated at the same time as the Local Radio Bill.  When these bills are both enacted, it will enable firm action to be taken to stamp out once and for all illegal broadcasting, and to have order restored to the airwaves.</P>
    <P>The consultants to whom I referred in the statement issued last March were duly appointed and began their work on 6 May.  It is expected that they will complete their assignment next September.</P>
    <P>A new RTE Authority was appointed recently for a five year period beginning on 1 June 1985.  In discussion in the House last March, the Taoiseach made it clear that appointments to the new Authority would be based on the merit and not on political acciliations.  The appointments bear this out and have been accepted by the public as such.</P>
    <P>There should, of course, be no question of debarring those involved in politics from appointments to State boards simply because they are engaged in politics. That would not be in the national interest or fair to those involved in politics. But what is critical is that persons should not be appointed to State boards simply because of their political affiliations and without regard to whether they are the most suitable available for these jobs.  Suitability for the duties involved must be the determining factor and this was the criterion applied in the recent appointments to the RTE Authority, as it has been in other State board appointments by this Government.</P>
    <P>An acting Director General was appointed in RTE last April for a period of six months.  It is expected that the consultants will have reported and conclusions will have been reached by then on the future corporate structure of RTE and it should be possible to decide what are the qualifications needed for the top post in the organisation in the years ahead and to make a longer term appointment. The Government and I were accused last March of acting for political reasons when I asked the Authority not to nominate <Col N="1434" /> anybody for a long term appointment pending the completion of the consultancy study.  It was said at the time by the Opposition that the reason for this action was that the Government man would not be nominated by the Authority. I want to make it clear, beyond any possibility of misunderstanding, that neither the Government nor I had our &ldquo;own man&rdquo;.  My concern then was and my concern now is and in the future will be, to discharge my statutory obligations by ensuring that the person most likely to be able to discharge the onerous duties, of Director General of RTE is appointed, in the interests of the future of broadcasting.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, when the recommendations of the consultants have been considered and acted upon and when the Authority then seek my consent for a long term appointment of Director General, I will be able to give my consent to the person proposed by the Authority.  I very much regret that this sensitive appointment, which should clearly be seen to be above party politics, if the occupant of the post is to be able to discharge the duties to maximum effect, should have been brought into the political arena by the Opposition.  As long as I am Minister no political interference, from any side of the House or from outside it will be allowed to infiltrate RTE.</P>
    <P>The report of the Cablesystems Committee which was chaired by Mrs. Margaret Downes was published last February and interested parties were given three months in which to make their views on the recommendations in the report known to the Department.  That period expired on 31 May and the various recommendations will now be studied and action taken on them.  The report, as expected, raises a number of fundamental issues in relation to the transmission of programmes over cable systems, which could have major financial, industrial and social implications.  It is likely to be quite some time therefore before conclusions are reached on the major recommendations in the report.</P>
    <P>The interdepartmental committee established to oversee the invitation of <Col N="1435" /> tenders for a direct broadcasting satellite (DBS) system and to examine the proposals received submitted their report to me recently.  I expect to submit the matter to the Government for decision shortly.  I do not propose therefore to comment in detail on the matter at this stage, but it is only fair to Deputies to let them know that there has been a slowing down worldwide in the provision of DBS systems and that the euphoria associated with DBS some two to three years ago has been replaced by the legislation that DBS is a very expensive, high risk venture.</P>
    <P>It will be clear from what I have said that, apart from the services provided by my Department, I also have general responsibility for seven of the commercial State bodies.  These bodies employ about 60,000 people, have a total turnover of nearly £1,500 million and total capital employed of over £1,900 million. It is obviously of prime importance that resources of this magnitude, both in terms of personnel and assets, should be used to the best advantage.  That is the policy I have been following since I became Minister.</P>
    <P>I have not interfered in operational matters and I have ensured that only people of the highest calibre have been appointed to the boards.  I have improved communications with the State bodies by regular meetings with the chairmen, initiating a series of twice yearly meetings with each board, and arranging to have regular reports from each State body throughout the year.  These arrangements supplement the system of five-year corporate plans and new investment criteria which the Government have introduced for all commerical State bodies.</P>
    <P>I am firmly committed to the maintenance and expansion of public enterprise. But I want to make it clear that I do so only on the basis that it is operated efficiently: public enterprise is not, and cannot, be a licence for inefficiency, restrictive practies or disregard for customers' needs.</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no fundamental reason why public enterprise should not be as efficient as the private sector, but <Col N="1436" /> some appear to think that public enterprise is there for the benefit of those working in it, without having to give value for money or ensure that the customer comes first.  So far as I am concerned, if there are restrictive practices, failure to provide uninterrupted service, lack of effort or disregard for the customer, continued public ownership of the particular enterprise must come into question.</P>
    <P>The best way to ensure continuation of public enterprise is to have it efficient. Under the arrangements I have outlined, I am confident that we will have an efficient and expanding public enterprise sector that will serve the best interests of the nation.</P>
    <P>I commend these Estimates to the House.  The signs of this efficiency are there in all the State companies for which I have responsibility.  CIE's losses have fallen for two years in a row and are destined to fall again this year.  Aer Lingus, having been in losses, were back in profit last year and expect increased profits this year.  Aer Rianta's surpluses have increased.  An Post have halved the losses of the preceding year and Bord Telecom are doing well.  That is the way I intend to keep the companies for which I am responsible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I had expected that the Minister would end his contribution with the words: &ldquo;I commend this Estimate to the House&rdquo;.  I want to put on record that we are opposing this Estimate to a vote which, as the Chair announced, will take place on 26 June.  I am doing this because of dissatisfaction on this side of the House with the general handling of the Department by the Minister in relation to Irish Shipping with their Irish Continental Line, the B &amp; I and the fact that the capital city's deep sea facilities in the port are at risk.  If we are to believe the statement issued the facilities will close down by next Friday.  I am opposed to the Estimate on the basis of non-clarification of what is happening to the ICL or Belfast Ferries and we are not at all satisfied with the way the Minister has handled Telecom Éireann.  It is significant that it was not until page 39 of his 40 <Col N="1437" /> page speech that the Minister said he was responsible for State bodies that employed 60,000 people, had a turnover of £1,500 million and a total capital employed of £1,900 million.  The Minister elbowed that very important part of his Department's activity into a corner in his mammoth speech.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that it was obviously of prime importance &mdash; prime importance to me is not indicated by picking page 39 for dealing with this area of his Department's responsibility and putting it into one or two paragraphs&mdash; that resources of this magnitude in terms of personnel and assets should be used to the best advantage.  He went on to say that he was committed to the maintenance and expansion of public enterprise. It is possible that that little paragraph is <i>a pourboire</i> for the Labour Party.  The Minister said he wanted to make it clear that he did so only on the basis that it is operated efficiently.  He said that public enterprise was not and cannot be a licence for inefficiency, restrictive practices or disregard for customers' needs.  I know where the Minister got that statement&mdash; from the Fianna Fáil policy document, <i>The Way Forward.</i> Almost the exact words are contained in that document. The Minister changed them around a little but the sentiments and the substance of the meaning are the same.</P>
      <P>The Minister went on to say that there was no fundamental reason why public enterprise should not be as efficient as the private sector and I agree with him on that.  I agree with him in supporting public enterprise and that some people may think that a State company is a form of bonanza that does not need to apply the highest and strictes standards of efficiency.  That idea may have got round but, for the most part, chief executives, and the people involved in running public enterprises, are committed to the type of efficiency which one is led to believe is available across the board in private enterprise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My colleague, Deputy Leyden, will be dealing mainly with telecommunications and An Post but I should like to make a few comments on Telecom Éireann.  I <Col N="1438" /> was involved heavily in making the financial arrangements for the transfer and in putting the legislation together.  The House will recall that I took the Bill through its Second Stage in the House.  I recent very much the attack which the Minister made on the former chief executive of Telecom Éireann.  He is not in the House to defend himself.  He is a man with an international reputation for efficiency. The chairman of Telecom Éireann indicated to me at the time we succeeded in getting this person that we were luckly to get a man from IBM to take over that chore.  For that reason the Minister's remarks are unworthy of him in relation to somebody who has given good service to his board during the time he was here. It is the country's loss that the chief executive has decided not to continue in the office for a further period, particularly for the teething period of Telecom Éireann.  I want to nail another lie.</P>

      <P>I am not saying that this lie was pepetrated in the House.  The Chair jumped me.  Fianna Fáil have been charged with responsibility for the levy which is being extracted from Telecom Éireann.  I was involved in the arrangements and particularly in the establishment of the debt equity ratio for the new board.  At that time the chairman and the acting chief executive were not satisfied with what I could get for them, but in the end I convinced them that they would have to live within it.  They accepted that they would and should live within that financial arrangement.  I want to nail as a lie any allegation that the money which is being extracted from Telecom Éireann now by the Government is being extracted on foot of some arrangement made by the Fianna Fáil Government at the time the financial conditions were being laid down for the transfer.  Telecom Éireann, while they were not satisfied with the arrangement, said they would work it.  I understand, and this nails the lie down even firmer, that those conditions were written into two separate and <Col N="1439" /> distinct corporate plans by Telecom Éireann. Obiviously, they were accepted as being the arrangement that was made.</P>
      <P>I should like to refer to various propaganda set prices that we have been subjected to in this area.  For a period from the early seventies to the early eighties telephone users paid £1.5 billion for the service.  In that period an extra £300 million was received for telephone development from various sources in Europe and elsewhere.  I want the Minister to confirm to me how much was invested over that period in telephone development.  I can assure the House, if my figures are correct, that it fell far short of the amount of money I have just mentioned.</P>
      <P>One of the aggravating things was that the Department of Finance could get funding from Europe for telephone development at a certain rate of interest but before it was used by the then Department of Posts and Telegraphs, the Department of Finance charged an extra percentage to the Department getting the money, in my opinion dubious even in economics and immoral as far as the treatment of the customer and the citizen is concerned.</P>
      <P>I am not going into any more details about what money was paid in 1984 and the acceptence by Telecom Éireann that this was to cater for 1985.  I am prompted to say this by an unprovoked and totally indefensible attack by the Minister on the former chief executive of Telecom Éireann.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will read it into the record of the House. &ldquo;Much of the publicity about these contributions has been ill-informed and the former chief executive was wrong to so consistently enter into public controversy in a manner that would not be tolerated in any private sector group&rdquo;.  What exactly does that mean?  If a man is charged with the responsibility of being chief executive of <Col N="1440" /> such an important organisation as Telecom Éireann, is he not entitled to speak the truth as he sees it?  I think he is and, if this House subscribed to any other philosophy, then this House has gone down a very slippery slope.</P>
      <P>As far as funding is concerned, ITI was set up during the ministry of Deputy Reynolds and, as far as capital funding is concerned, the ITI are bearing the major share in that investment.  Anger advises me not to go any further along that line, but I cannot remain in this House listening to the Minister criticising a distinguished public servant whose service to this country will be remembered, whose services we were lucky to get and who, in future, will be one of the leading men in international business.</P>
      <P>I will take a Cook's tour through the Minister's speech before I get down to specific areas.  The Minister started by giving a conspectus of the economic situation and the background against which the activities of his Department take place.  He referred to the boom in the United States of America and said it was tapering off.  That boom did not affect our economy in the way many people hoped.  It did not show itself in increased employment here.  The most telling impact it had on us was that it enticed thousands of our young people &mdash; I am not exaggerating &mdash; from our universities, regional technical colleges and national institutes for higher education to New York and Boston over the past few years.  These were the people we led to study electronics and computer subjects saying we would provide the type of industry which would cater for them. Many of these young people I have met are very disillusioned and cynical about the exercise which was imposed on them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go into any great detail on it.  Those were the areas we told young people to prepare for.  Last year the Minister for Finance thought there was wealth in the country, but when he looked at the books more closely it had gone elsewhere and we had a big row in this House about the black hole.  I want to tell the House that is the only impact the economic boom in the United States has on this country.</P>
      <P>At the beginning of his speech the Minister took us on a short economic tour.  He said: &ldquo;The rate was over 23 per cent at the end of 1981; it was down to 6.2 per cent for the year to mid-February 1985&rdquo;, but when he spoke of increases in charges near the end of his speech he said: &ldquo;However, there was no increase in charges between April 1983 and April 1985, and the increases, averaging 7½ per cent, from last April were well below the level of inflation&rdquo;.  the Minister should get his officials to look at this and come to a serious decision on whether 7.5 per cent is greater or less than 6.2 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;There was no increase in charges between April 1983 and April 1985, and the increases, averaging 7½ per cent, from last April were well below the level of inflation&rdquo;. Does he mean at that time?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">

      <P>For the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not quite clear.  At the beginning of his speech the Minister referred to the unemployment problem. He said, &ldquo;there have been some encouraging <Col N="1442" /> signs recently, with reductions being recorded in three successive months in the number of people on the live register&rdquo;.  That is a welcome feature but I submit that there should be a closer examination of where the improvement has taken place.  In all the Central Statistics Office bulletins I receive there is an indication of how many people unemployed are under 25 years of age.  If we examine the figures we will see there is a heavy impact there mainly due to the schemes being developed, which are welcomed, but they are not making any impact in any real sense on long term unemployment.  There is no point in using them as a propaganda excercise.</P>
      <P>The Minister said: &ldquo;if a significant dent is to be made in our level of unemployment, all sectors of the community have to `do their bit'.  Government alone cannot create jobs, particularly if there are to be sustainable jobs&rdquo;.  That is precisely what I mean when I say that the figures from the Central Statistics Office must be looked at cautiously.  There must be a climate of confidence to induce investment and that, I am afraid, we have not got at the moment.</P>
      <P>With regard to CIE, I have mixed feelings as to whether I should welcome the euphoria of the Minister's speech or be slightly more cautious in our approach. From the breakdown in the Book of Estimates, we have an indication that £80 million is still required to subsidise the railway system.  In this House there has always been general agreement that we must have a rail system.  We have never really got down to examining how extensive it should be, or on what basis it should be run.  Obviously, the hope that it would be able to run profitably has faded and experience in other countries would indicate that this is very difficult to achieve at present.  Even super-efficient US companies, in a country where there are areas with high density of population, are finding it difficult to make money on railways.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are vast areas of this country which have no rail system whatsoever.  A natural resentment is felt by citizens in those areas who are helping to subsidise <Col N="1443" /> a service for others.  Those areas in which the railways have been withdrawn for some time should get special consideration in the transport field.  There was a great air of promise when the railways were first withdrawn that special attention would be given to roads and bus services.  People no longer believe that to be so.  In fact, a substantial case could be made that development is taking place where the best service, no matter what it is, is available at present.  To those who have, all the time more is being given and where services were withdrawn no attention is being paid by way of investment.</P>
    <P>The chairman of CIE made a statement that he would abolish the freight sector of CIE if it had not by a certain date begun to make a profit.  That is a useful stimulus to that sector which in the past has had some of its losses attributed, unfairly, to the railways.  I spoke about this already in the House on a number of occasions.  I have received complaints from people in the private haulier business that CIE have an unfair advantage in competition, in that they are operating a subsidised company.  Therefore, they could give quotations which undercut the private sector.  The private man running his own trucking business has to think of his bank manager, what he gets for the service and what it costs to provide it.  I have a number of letters of complaint by people pleading in their own cause.  One had to approach what they say with a certain caution, but in at least one instance I was convinced that there was an unfair quotation and that CIE could not, in fact, provide the service without aid from their general subsidy.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to GAC at Shannon. GAC succeeded the Bombardier company in the assembly of buses at Shannon.  What is the legal relationship between GAC and CIE?  Is it the same as that which obtained between Bombardier and CIE?  CIE apparently own the premises and all the equipment there and Bombardier had the use of premises and equipment and sold the buses to CIE.  I put down a question on this matter and it <Col N="1444" /> was refused on the basis that the Minister had no responsibility in the matter.  This is a common retort when one puts down a question.  I thought we were over that. It was a fair reply when semi-State bodies were making a profit and when this House had not to be asked for money to support them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not invoking a golden age.  I am simply saying there was a time when certain semi-State companies were making a profit and when this House was not asked to subsidise them or, if they were looking for money, they were looking for it in the money markets.  When this House is asked, in time of crisis, to supply money, then this House shares some of the blame if things go wrong but it is not entitled to the information.  That is the only point that I am making as far as this and other companies are concerned. I have a list of very courteous letters from the Ceann Comhairle's office refusing to accept questions on the basis that there is no ministerial responsibility.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that is so, because of our personal relationship.  My letters do not smell or smack of the type of process Deputy Kelly is talking about. I think there is a personal touch there.  I attribute that to the fact that the Ceann <Col N="1445" /> Comhairle and I were born, if not on the selfsame hill, very near to each other.</P>
      <P>What is the general productivity at Shannon in regard to GAC?  What is the productivity in the school bus field at the moment?  Would the Minister make some comment on those in his reply?  When I was in the Department for eight or nine months, or so, there was strong talk from Bombardier about developing an export business in Shannon to exotic places like Baghdad and Cairo.  I believed them, but was waiting for results.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did a lot of my research among those who operated them and they indicated to me that they were reasonably well satisfied.  The general belief was that their availability, which is very important, was about 92 per cent.  I am talking now about the end of 1982.  With regard to what is happening in the export area, I read an article in which it was stated that GAC might be building buses for a company in the United Kingdom.  I should like to hear from the Minister if there have been any developments in that connection.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has indicated that he will be bringing in fundamental and &ldquo;permanent&rdquo;&mdash; I put that word in inverted commas &mdash; legislation to deal with the three companies.  One will cover the Dublin city services, one will deal with <Col N="1446" /> provincial bus services and one will deal with the railways.  We will await the legislation with interest.  The one point I should like to make at this stage is that when the Minister is putting the legislation together it would be desirable that CIE should not be in a position where they will have an unchallenged monopoly and where they can operate without a sense of justice <i>vis-à-vis</i> other people in the transport business.  I made that point already so far as the freight section was concerned.</P>
    <P>The Minister was euphoric about CIE, particularly with regard to finances.  It may be a good propaganda exercise.  It may be a good thing to try to instil some confidence in them now that they have a new chairman chief executive and when they are starting out on a new road.  When the Minister introduced the Dublin Transport Authority Bill yesterday he said he expected that industrial relations should improve when there are three smaller companies dealing with the workforce. Again, one awaits with interest to see if the Minister's expectations will be fulfilled.  It should be possible when one is dealing on a smaller scale to keep more in touch with industrial relations.</P>
    <P>People are wondering whether the dispersed system of management which obtains at the moment will be dispensed with by the Minister.  Is it his intention to dismantle some of the regional management structures that exist at present?  I should like him to give some indication of his views on that matter.  In his speech the Minister dealt briefly with the Dublin Transport Authority Bill which we discussed yesterday.  I want to reiterate what I said then, namely, that the Bill is totally inadequate.  I hope the Minister will accept amendments which will strengthen that Bill.  It is not a very purposeful exercise to have it as it is.</P>
    <P>With regard to the wages grade pensions, with a certain amount of caution I say that the improved offer with regard to the pensions is to be welcomed by the House.  I have noted that one prominent trade union leader has gone on record already as stating that he found the offer <Col N="1447" /> inadequate.  I went into this matter in some detail when I was Minister.  There were divided opinions among the workers. For some people the ideal seemed to be the type of pension scheme available in the public service, that is to say, a lump sum payment on retirement and a maximum 40/80ths of the retiring annual income for pension.  The people already on pension would not lose out by that because, when the contributory pension was added to the basic pension, at times they had more than 40/80ths of their income on retirement.  I should like the Minister to let me know how the contributory pension plus the sum of £34.50 relates to 40/80ths of the income on retirement of a CIE worker.  That is the crunch point for the staff.</P>
    <P>There is also an anomaly that was not referred to in the speech and which I refer to only in passing with regard to CIE workers who have been promoted and who lose out on social welfare payments. I should like the Minister in his reply to this debate to deal with that anomaly.  I ask him to indicate if he has any plans to improve the position of people who are being penalised for having been good enough to get promotion in their jobs.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister deals briefly with the DTA Bill.  We will have a further opportunity to deal with that as the measure goes through the House.  I have made my own views known on it.</P>
    <P>On the question of urban traffic control, I should like the Minister to be more specific in telling the House where it is at, to use a modernism.  In 1982 we were talking about urban traffic control, the computerisation of lights and improved traffic flow.  I should like to know what has happened in this regard.</P>
    <P>In his speech the Minister spoke about the new Bill dealing with road transport. We have been waiting for this measure for a long time and the slow progress has caused considerable hardship among people involved in that business.  I have had discussion with the Irish Road Hauliers' Association, with IOTA and with others during the years.  As the House <Col N="1448" /> knows, there was in operation a system of selling plates and people were very confused about the situation.  Many of them who wanted to get into the business did not know if they should invest in plates or if their usefulness would have ended before they had cleared what they had paid for the plates.  In putting the Bill before the House the Minister has indicated that this uncertainly will be at an end.</P>
    <P>There are fears with regard to the legislation. The Irish Road Hauliers' Association are worried about a number of areas.  One such area is the own account operation.  There are many fairly large such operations, particularly in co-operatives, where there is a peak season for business and where there is a very slack period.  Individual members of the Irish Road Hauliers' Association are worried that in the slack season these fairly heavy economic units will be brought to bear on them and that will be put out of business in that way.</P>
    <P>Enforcement of the regulations is nonexistent. They claim that if the law is not enforced when the Bill is on the Statute Book bankruptcy will be the order of the day for many legitimate and well established road hauliers.  I am convinced by the evidence I have from them that the will be the case.  I am aware that the Garda have all kinds of demands made on them which they should not have in a normal society.  They are under a lot of pressure.  I am aware of that in my constituency. It is well known that there are hauliers who are flouting the law and are never challenged.  The Irish Road Hauliers' Association feel so desperate about this that they have made suggestions as to how the law should be enforced.  They say that a corps of inspectors should be appointed to enforce the law at least in the initial stages of its operation.  The economic implications are very serious.  I should like the Minister to address himself to the problem in co-operation with the Minister for Justice.  He might comment on that aspect.</P>
    <P>As regards Irish Shipping, the Minister made the case he originally made to justify its liquidation but action which <Col N="1449" /> leaves us without a deep sea fleet cannot be defended nor should any attempt be made to defend it.  In an exchange with Deputy Kelly I reffered to the fact that this company was a profit making one for many years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>It was a shining deed in a naughty world.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not resent the Deputy's intrusions as I find them stimulating. However, we are not discussing that but rather Irish Shipping.  Mistakes were made by management.  The House finds itself in the position of blind man's buff as far as the operations of this company are concerned.  At the time if anyone said we should have been inquiring into Irish Shipping the legitimate retort would have been: &ldquo;Why?  They are doing exceptionally well and the House, by intruding into their affairs, can do nothing but harm.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Federated Workers Union of Ireland made a submission to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies before the debacle occured.  In that they stated:</P>
      <P>There are problems with the management structure of Irish Shipping Limited and these problems need to be addressed.  In the main, we feel there is a bunching of the managerial functions in the hands of a small number of people.  It is true to state that very important and far-reaching decisions are being taken by two or three people with little if any reference down the line.  Since 1973, the Irish Shipping management group has been reduced from seven to five and at present six management functions are vested in two individuals.  It is astonishing to note that the general manager, since his appointment last year, continues to carry the full functions of administration manager and personnel manager.  This is entirely inefficient and likely to lead to decisions which will cause the company considerable discomfort.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There may be little <i>post factum</i> wisdom <Col N="1450" /> in that even though the ballon had not gone up at that time but obviously the dogs in the streets were barking about the management of Irish Shipping when that submission was made to the committee. I would welcome from the Minister a commitment to an Irish deep sea shipping company within the terms which he stated to day of what he expects from the State companies.  I would welcome his commitment to either a State company or a joint State-private venture with good management and the objectives of the company set out.  I call on the Minister to make that commitment.</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the treatment of the workers.  As far as I know, the Supplementary Estimate brought before the House covered ten of the 47 people involved.  We should not be satisfied with the sop, in the form of <i>ex gratia</i> payments, that was given to those who had war service.  I should like the Minister to commit himself to restoring the pension expectations of all the people who found themselves summarily dismissed as a result of the Minister's action.  What happened was not just, and the Minister should remedy it.  When the Supplementary Estimate was being debated in the House I asked about the two weeks pay which was owed to the workers.  For the period 1 November to 14 November 1984 the workers were not paid.  Have they since been paid?</P>
    <P>The term &ldquo;<i>sub judice</i>&rdquo; is a grand umbrella at times.  We cannot talk about matters that are <i>sub judice.</i> Now we have a new phenomenon.  We are told that because the receiver or the liquidator is dealing with some matter, we are precluded by law from commenting on it. This is another modern umbrella under which people shelter.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to indicate a commitment to slim down the deep sea Irish fleet and to have a fleet with good management and, secondly, I should like him to consider again the plight of those Irish Shipping personnel who became unemployed at the end of last year.</P>
      <P>One must refer also to the education and training implications of the demise of our deep sea fleet.  This is an area which carries implications through to the next century.  A person of 18 who is interested in following that type of career will be working for the next 50 years but if we cut off the education and training facilities, our students will either have to go abroad &mdash; though there are few if any places for them to learn seamanship abroad &mdash; or they will have to give up the idea altogether.  In that event, and should this Government or any future Government decide to establish a deep sea fleet, we will have to depend on foreigners to man it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is admitted generally that the management of Irish Shipping made grevious mistakes.  We did not know about these mistakes at the time they were made. There should have been machinery and facilities available to the Department that would have made them aware of the position. It would be desirable that we would have our own trained personnel to man any deep sea fleet we might establish. There are plenty of people who have reached the rank of captain and who are now unemployed but I would not be too concerned about those.  My concern is for the other personnel involved.  The whole original purpose of the establishment of Irish Shipping seemed to have been defeated by referring to the fleet as an Irish fleet when the vessels were flagged in Panama or in Hong Kong and crewed by Taiwanese or by people of some other <Col N="1452" /> nationality.  Our vision should be of a fleet that will be Irish owned, whether publicly or privately or by way of a mixture of both, Irish flagged and crewed by Irish personnel.  In the cold hearted, bloody nosed capitalist philosophy one might say, &ldquo;we have the ship and we will flag it and crew it at the lowest cost to ourselves&rdquo;.  I do not think that should be the purpose of an Irish deep sea fleet.  It was not the purpose of an Irish Shipping and I do not think it would be an approach that would be acceptable to the House.</P>
    <P>I note that in the Book of Estimates there is a figure of about £1 million in respect of the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> I should like the Minister to indicate what the exact position is in regard to that vessel.  It was the ship that was to be used by Irish Shipping to bring coal to Moneypoint. When the blow fell the ship was at Marseilles, having a propeller changed so as to improve its economic performance.  I am anxious to find out who owns the vessel. I hope that under an Irish captain, with an Irish crew and with a contract from the ESB, the vessel can be put into the service of the country.  Very often the best way to start is with one unit rather than with a large purchasing plan.  A fleet can be built up from that point.</P>
    <P>In <i>The Irish Times</i> of 17 July 1984, not quite a year ago, in an article by Gary Culliton there is the following comment:</P>
    <P>Irish Shipping expects to make a large profit carrying coal to the Moneypoint power station.  The state-owned shipping lossmaker has won a contract to supply half the Shannon utility's fuel needs and General Manager Niall McGovern expects the ESB deal to pull Irish Shipping out of the doldrums when the contract starts next year.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Despite quoting a ridiculously low rate for carrying coal to Moneypoint, our ships will bring in net earnings of $11,000 a day,&rdquo; says Mr. McGovern. &ldquo;It is an extremely profitable deal from Irish Shipping's point of view.&rdquo;  This contrasts sharply with most of the cutrate cargo business available at the moment.  Deliveries will start early in 1985 at about 100,000 tons of coal per <Col N="1453" /> annum.  This will increase to half a million tons per annum at the end of the decade.  There follows the quotation from Mr. Lang of the ESB that:</P>
    <P>There is always government pressure to use Irish firms.</P>
    <P>I am proud that we try to exercise that pressure.  Mr. Lang is reported as having said also that we try to keep business in this country as long as it does not involve too great a loss.  The report continues:</P>
    <P>The five-year contract will be a godsend to Irish Shipping, a company that has been battered by the notoriously volatile deep water cargo trade.  Shipping coal out of Baltimore and New Orleans will be a profitable staple trade on which the fleet operator's hopedfor recovery will be based.</P>
    <P>It was Irish Shipping's ambition to carry coal that got it into trouble in the first place.</P>
    <P>Mr. Culliton goes on to indicate why the company expanded so quickly after the development of the oil crisis.  There is a justification there of a kind for the chartering.  The reason I am quoting the article is that I am anxious to find out the status of the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> What is the Minister's and the Government's plan for the use of the vessel?</P>
    <P>I know that some of the personnel who were employed by Irish Shipping were putting forward a co-operative scheme for its handling and management.  Will the Minister tell the House what if anything has happened in that regard, or whether the Minister has in mind to establish it as unit number one of a new deep sea fishing fleet?  The liquidation is the end of the affair in a certain sense, but the <i>Irish Spruce</i> is the heart of the matter as far as setting up a new deep sea fishing fleet is concerned.  I would like to know about the Belfast car ferry.  As an Ulster man I have a special interest in that.  Recently we read newspaper reports about the Reardon Smith line which had a relationship with Irish Shipping.  What is the situation with regard to the Reardon Smith line and for that matter the position of <Col N="1454" /> the AIB who owns 25 per cent of the Ocean Bank development?</P>

      <P>I was summarising what I was suggesting with regard to Irish Shipping and seeking a commitment from the Minister to establish a deep sea fleet either wholly State owned or partly State owned.  I asked also for another look at the parlous plight of the people who were employed by Irish Shipping when the company was liquidated.  The workers were naturally bemused by the payment of six weeks' pay multiplied by years of service to one of the management when they only got half a week's pay multiplied by their years of service up to 41 years and after that a week's pay instead of a half week's pay.  It is as well for the House to know that Irish Shipping Limited never had industrial disputes.  It is something that this House should commend and commendation without backing it up by proper treatment of the workers only induces cynicism.  I understand that the <i>Irish Rowan</i> was sold by the liquidator to the Yugoslavs in what was more or less a State trading contract.  In the context of having a deep sea fleet I cannot see how the Yugoslav company having purchased it at a low price will operate it profitably. The ship was supposed to be worth £15 million and it was sold for £2.5 million.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>There are all kinds of implications in that.  In relation to the Dublin Port and Docks Board, the Minister has shown in his speech that he is far too complacent about what is happening. The Minister said that he has laid down certain ground rules and that if they are adhered to certain succour, aid and support will be forthcoming from the Minister. While this nice talk is going on we are being told that the deep sea section of Dublin Port is being closed down not in some vague and nebulous future but tomorrow.  The House is not alerted to the implications of this.  As far as I can gather from the public print, 113 of the dockers have agreed to redundancy terms.  That is no small achievement in an area where industrial relations have traditionally been very difficult indeed. The Minister should emphasise that achievement in his speech and guarantee Dublin Cargo Handlers and the Dublin Port Authority, while biding their time, <Col N="1456" /> to improve on that if possible.  What is happening is that an intransigence has developed in the unions, and an instransigence is obviously being developed by the Minister.  The result is that the major port of this country which had been carrying on the major export and import burden will be closed down.  The urgency which should attach to this is not being attached to it either by the Minister or the House.  I am calling on the Minister to back off the instransigent position he has taken up, to say to Dublin Cargo Handlers, to the port authority and to the unions, &ldquo;Do not go as far as to close down&rdquo;.  One does not know what might happen if we start going down that road. I know that they are having problems.  I know that business had shifted to Drogheda, Greenore and as far north as Carrickfergus and Belfast, but the Minister's approach at present is not the appropriate approach to deal with this very serious problem.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and I do not think this is good enough as far as the major port in the capital city is concerned.  All right, there may be inflexibility but the inflexibility did not go to the extent of blocking all redundancy agreements. There are 113.  There are complaints &mdash; I do not know what substance is in the complaints &mdash; that the figure is shifting from the management point of view, that each time the redundancy agreement numbers have increased the ante has been upped by the management.  I do not know whether that is a fact, but if there is suspicion, if a climate of hostility has developed, the Minister has a function to try to dispel that hostility, to keep the ship <Col N="1457" /> moving until final agreement is reached. There may be brinkmanship in it and there is a danger in that.  In the Communist Manifesto there is an advocacy of brinkmanship but they have always been much too clever to go over the edge. Here as far as Dublin port is concerned we are going to go over the edge.  This is very serious and the Minister has a serious responsibility.  I am not saying this for any political reason.  I am saying that we should not sit smugly in this House and allow the port of Dublin to close down.</P>
      <P>The Minister knows the figures better than I do.  I think Dublin Cargo Handling are about £9 million in debt and the whole setting up of the Dublin Cargo Handling operation was a bona fide exercise to improve the operation, efficiency and&mdash; most important of all &mdash; reliability of this port.  In his speech the Minister mentioned the loss of time, strikes and trouble, and the workers must share the responsibility there, but they have faced up to this in a responsible way.  If they had taken an irresponsible attitude then 113 agreements could not have been made, 113 people would not have been willing to accept the redundancy scheme that was worked out.  If the purpose of the Minister, Dublin Cargo Handling and the Dublin Port and Docks Board is to put the screw on workers by the threats that we have been listening to, I do not accept it.  Economic blackmail is involved in that situation and this House should not support it, we should decry it, and I am asking the Minister to make an attempt this very afternoon to save the docks from the final position of closure of the deep sea area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Before the new system was introduced I had a question down and perhaps I can get a reply under the priority provision but circumstances seem to be outstripping me.  It is &ldquo;To ask the Minister for Communications if he accepts the recommendations of the Horgan report on the Dublin Port and Docks Board and if he will make a statement on the matter&rdquo;.  I put down that question ages ago.  I had hoped that the crisis which has arisen now would not have arisen.  I will not delay <Col N="1458" /> any longer on that but I intend to pursue it.  Deputy Ahern made a statement on it last night and again the Minister attacked him in his speech.  I understand that a good part of Deputy Ahern's&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The other major shipping company are the B &amp; I and the Minister has referred to them in the course of his speech.  Before I say anything about them I want to do something that I think the Minister should have done in his speech. He may have done it elsewhere but he did not do it in his speech.  He was very concerned with the justification of what he has done with regard to the appointment of a new chairman and managing director and management consultancy firm.  On this side of the House we are very sceptical about the necessity for the huge investment in chairman and managing director and consultancy firm as far as this company are concerned.  Before going any further I want to pay tribute to a man whom I got to know and respect who was the outgoing chairman of B &amp; I, that is Mr. Frank Boland.  In laying the kind of groundwork of defence for his action in appointing Mr. Spain and the consultancy firm Zeus the Minister forgot to indicate that Mr. Boland had been striving manfully as part time chairman to pull the B &amp; I company around.</P>

      <P>Everybody knows that the former chief executive of Telecom Éireann was Mr. Tom Byrnes.  I am not attacking anybody. I am simply saying that a successful businessman, whose politics would not be my politics, gave service to the B &amp; I for a number of years to try to bring the company around.  I was simply paying a tribute to him in this House because of the manner in which the new man, mentioned as a Mr. Spain, was appointed and because in addition a consultancy firm was appointed, as mentioned in the Minister's speech.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only about half way through my speech.  The hotel and tourist industry in the Rosslare area is not satisfied that the timing of the ships suits them.  They have legitimate complaints about the lack of consultation.  I spoke to <Col N="1462" /> employees of both B &amp; I and the new privatised Sealink company.  When they are making arrangements they should enter into consultations and take into account the immediate needs of an area like Rosslare.  I intended to deal with the Rosslare Harbour situation.  I visited both the strand and the harbour.  The Minister said in his speech that he is setting up a Rosslare Harbour authority.  I appreciate this and feel it will be to the advantage of the area.  The Minister also has obligations regarding Rosslare Strand where there is a very serious problem of erosion. There is a relatively inexpensive way of dealing with this problem which I would recommend to the House.</P>
      <P>I wanted to talk about financial controls on the ships owned by B &amp; I but I have no time to expand on this matter. I have already spoken about it in the House.</P>
      <P>I now refer to suitable train linkages for B &amp; I in the UK.  I would ask the Minister and his Department to keep an eye on whether train linkages are more suitable for the new American company than for ours.</P>
      <P>The PAMBO people seem to be out on a limb.  Perhaps the Minister's new CIE legislation will help them to decide on their investment for the future and what place they will have in the new set up.  Deputy Kelly may expand on this point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to fleet replacement for Aer Lingus.  This is a major problem and the Minister should state his view and that of the Government regarding funding.  Regarding Aer Rianta, the Minister announced in his speech a new system of looking at the accounts.  That is a valid type of exercise on the Minister's part.  Aer Rianta have been rightly praised for their management of the airports.  Concealed in the £8 million which, according to the Book of Estimates, was returned this year, is the fact that all capital investment is not governmental and that interest is not taken into account.  They are doing a good business job and I am very pleased that the Aeroflot business to Shannon has expanded to such an extent that it is <Col N="1463" /> making a significant impact on the economic position of the airport.</P>
    <P>I have spoken previously about catering facilities at Dublin Airport.  It should be a show place for Irish cuisine since the best of our Irish dishes are very highly appreciated in other countries.  An effort should be made to make it a show place for Irish food, along the lines of the effort made by the IFA in Paris some time ago.</P>
    <P>We will have an opportunity of expanding on the subject of road transport when the Bill comes before the House.  I have referred to various problems in this area.</P>
    <P>Even if the Minister succeeds in stopping the closure of Dublin port tomorrow it will take a while to solve the problems there.  The development of various ports and harbours along the east coast is very important.</P>
    <P>I regretfully conclude, having lost some time through my wish to see 20 Members in the House.  Airports other than Cork, Shannon and Dublin are another subject which we could usefully discuss.  Taking the long view, unless vertical take-off aircraft are developed at a reasonable cost, these airports will be a very useful investment in future.  I am sorry that I do not have more time to discuss this very wide area.</P>

      <P>The difficulty in which Deputy Wilson finds himself in not having enough time in one hour and a half to deal with the subject matter of the Estimate neatly makes the point that the Minister presides over a gigantic area of economic activity.  It is so big it bears out my belief that it would be possible to do business in the State not with 15 members of a Government but with ten or 11, backed up by about eight second row office holders. I do not care what they are called, I prefer the old title of parliamentary secretary and I do not like uptitling ourselves just to impress our neighbours.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is possible for the Minister for Communications successfully and without injury to his health or efficiency to preside over this enormous administrative empire, it should certainly be possible <Col N="1464" /> to consolidate the functions of a few other Departments under a smaller number of office holders and to give good example throughout the public service. When the public service see the political side of the governmental area expanding as it did in the late seventies and early eighties they do not believe that the Government are serious in trimming costs and cutting down on the general burden of the State apparatus.  I sympathise with Deputy Wilson's problem.  I had forgotten he was limited to an hour and a half and if I realised that I might not have interrupted him so often.  He made a very vigorous set of points in the time he had&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The second interesting feature of the Minister's position, apart from the enormous extent of governmental functions for which he is responsible, is that he presides over a baffling range of monopolies.  He is the only Minister with any contact with the purely economic sphere who does that.  I am not comparing him with the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Justice because, in the nature of things, there can be only one system of defence and justice.  However, if you put him alongside the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the Minister for Energy or the Minister for Agriculture, it is clear that while all these Ministers have monopolistic organisms subject to them, or at any rate looking to them for money, this Minister has a unique battery of monopolies under his aegis.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there is such a personage in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, or Poland as Minister for Communications, he would not have any greater function or powers and the organisms subject to him would not be any wider in their authority than the bodies which are subject to our Minister. It could even be that the Minister for Communications in Yugoslavia is envious of our Minister who presides over an empire in which private enterprise barely <Col N="1465" /> gets a look in.  In Yugoslavia, one is entitled to run private enterprise in any sector provided one does not have more than ten or 12 employees.  That signifies the beginnings of a compromise between strict socialism and a private enterprise. For all I know, it may easily be that the Minister for Communications in Yugoslavia, if he is an empire building kind of man, would be glad to find himself in Deputy Mitchell's shoes.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer to the question of monopoly in its dimensions represented by the bodies for which the Minister is responsible and about which he has been talking this morning.  I should like to remind the House that monopolies in this State, under the Constitution, are highly suspect because they are contrary in their nature of the values in the Constitution which the Irish people gave themselves nearly 50 years ago and which they uphold.  I see that The Workers' Party are missing again today, two days running, although I would have thought that our discussion on Dublin transport yesterday and this Estimate today would have concerned them deeply.  Clearly, local elections take priority over their duties here for all the high minded contempt which they lavish on the other Members of the House.  However, even The Workers' Party, if they were interested in arguing the point, would scarcely contend that Article 43 of the Constitution not only guarantees that the State will not abolish the right of private ownership or the general right to transfer, bequeath and inherit property which means the right, among other things, to do business, or question that the second clause of the second section of Article 43 envisages the State interfering with property rights only in order to reconcile their exercise with the common good and not in pursuance of an ideology.  I appreciate that the expression &ldquo;common good&rdquo; will have different meanings in the mouths of different people.  In my mouth it may be different from Deputy Mac Giolla's meaning.  I am not trying to make short work of a serious argument by falling <Col N="1466" /> back on a couple of words like this.  However, the whole context of the Constitution and the primacy which it gives to individual people and their right to breathing space, economic breathing space as well as to breathing space and privacy in their families, in their human relationships and in their right to personal liberty and so on, is essentially not reconcilable with a system of monopoly, whether State or capitalistic.</P>
    <P>Article 45 is a special Article not cognisable by the courts and is merely expressed to contain directive principles of social policy for the general guidance of the Oireachtas.  Although these general principles cannot in general be called on &mdash; although they are being called on now by the back door so to speak &mdash; they cannot in general be deployed in order to invalidate a law enacted here; they are handed to us for our general guidance. This happened almost 50 years ago and I have not heard a suggestion that they should be changed.  I am not going to read these principles but Article 45.2. iii. mentions the question of monopoly and what it envisages as undesirable, that is monopoly in private hands, the monopolisation or concentration of the ownership or control of essential commodities residing in a few individuals to the common detriment.  I am against that too, but to concentrate the ownership or control of essential commodities or services in a single set of hands, even though they are publicly owned hands, may be just as much to the common detriment and against the general interest of the people.</P>
    <P>In case anyone thinks I am regarding too much into a few words, let me refer to two other clauses of the same section. One of them speaks of the distribution of the ownership and control of the material resources of the community among private individuals.  It specifically envisages the distributions among private individuals of the resources of the community. A further part of the same Article of the Constitution, 3.1º speaks in the following way about private initiative &mdash; private enterprise in other words: &ldquo;The State shall favour...&rdquo;, not shall disfavour I would say to Deputy Mac Giolla, Deputy <Col N="1467" /> Taylor, the Minister for Labour or anybody in the Labour Party who thinks like this &mdash; not disfavour, not look down its long nose at, not take a dim view of but shall favour private initiative and where necessary supplement it, but only where necessary.  The state has no role in providing initiative of its own on the economic plan except where it is necessary to supplement private initiative.  That was Mr. de Valera's faith.</P>
    <P>I have read more than once every line of the Constitution debate held here in June and July 1937.  I do not recall a single Deputy dissenting although to be fair the thing got damn little attention, good or bad.  The whole Constitution went through in three weeks of debate along with a whole lot of other things like the Pigs and Bacon Act, an Army Pensions Act and the usual raft of questions, adjournment debates and everything else.  But I do not recall a single Deputy questioning the essential correspondence and agreement of the principles here expressed with what the ordinary Irish people, rich and poor wanted.  Even the humblest Irish citizen sees himself either as owning something, or as aspiring to own something, and aspiring to lifting himself up by his boot straps to a position in which he will leave his children better off than he is himself. That is what this State is about.  That is expressed in the Constitution, in Articles 43 and 45 and it is latent in many other parts.  That suggests a State, the essence, nature, core and guts of which is something to which monopoly, whether privately or publicly owned, is essentially repugnant.</P>
    <P>A monopoly in a State like this has to justify itself from the Word &ldquo;go&rdquo;.  It has to justify itself by reference to the inadequacy of private initiative sufficiently to serve the interests of the common good. And I do not dispute that there are such contexts.  In particular I do not dispute that in the early days of the Irish State such contexts abounded.  I would not dispute that for a second.  It is true Irish agriculture had a prosperous few years in the days of the First World War but the <Col N="1468" /> twenties were a poor, raw time in this country.  It was certainly the poorest State in Western Europe, and by a long chalk. The photographs left over from those days, and even things which I can remember from my own childhood, not certainly in the twenties but in the forties &mdash; I think I have shreds of recollections of the late thirties &mdash; testify to those days.  I can remember the look of the place.  I can remember seeing newsboys running barefoot around the streets of Dublin, even after the war.  It is hard to recall these things now.  It is hard to make someone even of the generation of Deputy Leyden believe it.  This was a very, very poor place.  It needed self-confidence, it needed a lead from its Government, who were bursting with confidence and initiative, independent initiative, not looking cravenly over their shoulders at what the English were at.  That goes both for Mr. Willie Cosgrave's Government and for Mr. de Valera's early days.  It needed a bursting self-confidence and drive on the part of those Governments to get things going in the country for which no one had the stomach, for which what little private enterprise and business there was here had no stomach.  There was no here capable of setting up a postal service&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I will not go anywhere like an hour, Sir.  I suppose I am nearly at the half-way mark already, perhaps not quite that, but I am not far off it.  I only want to say that that monopoly here, leaving one's own personal ideology out of it, if <Col N="1469" /> one is going to respect the Constitution under which we function, must justify itself from day one onwards.  What we have in this State is a set of monopolies, some of them undoubtedly understandable and justifiable in their origin, some of them perhaps still justifiable.  There are some services which perhaps can scarcely be envisaged except in terms of a monopoly.  But just in the way that the principle of zero budgeting is applied, or said to be applied, now in Government Departments, that they have to build up the Estimate from scratch, from the first sixpence every year and cannot just start taking last year's outturn as the floor, in the very same way a monopoly, every single year when it comes to present its report, should be scrutinised by a Government with what I might call the zero budgeting principle in mind.  Is there still a reason to preserve this monopoly? That goes particularly for the postal, telecommunications and transport monopolies over which this Minister presides because they are the most conspicuous ones.  Naturally it applies to Aer Lingus, the air transport monopoly as well.  They are the most conspicuous monopolies in the whole battery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The CIE monopoly &mdash; I know CIE are perhaps a cheap or easy shot, as I said here before; they are a bit like Muiris Ó Súillebháin's <i>Fiche Bliain ag Fás</i>, in the early chapter of which there is a description of a day at the Ventry races.  He went to the Ventry races with his uncle.  On the way into the fairground, which was appertinent to the races, there was a black man, either a real black man or somebody made up as a black man, in a barrel.  For a penny one got three wooden blocks and could have three throws at the black man in the barrel.  This child, the future writer, noticed that all his neighbours, cute Kerryman though they were, were unable to hit the man with the wooden block.  So he waited until the black man was submerged in the barrel, then threw his block and the black man emerged from the barrel to meet the block full in the face.  It may be that CIE in debates of this kind are in somewhat the same position as the stock black man <Col N="1470" /> in the barrel that everybody feels they can have a cheap shot at.  I do not want to do that.  I travel on CIE nearly every day and I have the utmost respect for the patience of the people who work there, particularly those on the buses.  I do not know how any human being sticks the job of either a bus driver or conductor, the difficulties with passengers, with traffic, plant, and with everything else.  I have the greatest respect for CIE personnel. I know that the great majority of them do their level best, do not like to see their company run down and would be glad to see it do well.</P>
    <P>As I was saying yesterday, before I had to report progress &mdash; I will be back to the theme, I hope, again &mdash; the new DART service, whatever about its economies, is a credit to CIE.  I have some small criticisms at the edges.  I do not want to be taken as having a cheap shot at CIE also.  It has to be said that every public transport undertaking in Europe, so far as I know, requires Government subsidisation of one kind or another.  Even the Germans, whom I deeply admire and know very well, who run a superb transport system, have a railway system which loses absolutely astronomical sums of money.  I do not know how they do it because it does not seem to me to be consistent with their efficiency.  It is an extremely efficient, very fine service. Although it is very well supported by the public it loses absolutely astronomical sums of money.</P>
    <P>CIE are right to point out, and to have pointed out on their behalf, that they are not alone, that they are not perhaps even the worst case.  Even though they are not alone, the feature of losing public money, of having to be subsidised is common between themselves and probably almost every other transport undertaking in the free world, certainly in Western Europe. We still must look at whether we necessarily must acquiesce in this continuing loss now running &mdash; I am talking about the level of subsidy which this House must provide them with &mdash; at a rate of over £2 million a week.  I admit that that figure has not increased by very much in the last few years and the Minister is <Col N="1471" /> entitled, and right, to give the Government credit for having adopted a new system of dealing financially with CIE. He explained that system in the course of his speech and I do not need to go back over it.  The Minister is right to compliment CIE in having made headway but it is still costing the taxpayer more than £2 million per week.</P>
    <P>The CIE subsidy accounts for almost 60 per cent of the entire Estimate which the Minister has introduced.  All the rest, the ports, airports, pensions and so on are in the ha'penny place compared to the CIE subsidy.  The estimate for this year for CIE is £115 million out of a total Estimate of £196 million, almost 60 per cent, or about £2 million per week.  We do not necessarily criticise the company because it costs the taxpayer money.  All public transport operations do that, but is there any way of getting this down?  Is there any way of freeing ourselves or, perhaps, doing a bit better than the Belgians, the Dutch or the Germans?  We usually think we are doing all right if we are doing half as well but could we do a bit better in this regard?  Could we take advantage of some features in the Irish infrastructure such as the fact that we have an enormous road network?  We have a most extravagant road network.  There is nothing comparable on the Continent.  It makes sense for an Irish farmer, even if he lives at the end of a two mile boreen in some god-forsaken townland that even the postman has forgotten the name of, to keep a car because he has an extravagant network of roads, most of which were built in the old days for relief purposes, on which he can go anywhere relatively quickly.  The roads may be bad roads, may have potholes and may not be comfortable to drive on and I am not trying to minimise the complaints of people who live in Connemara and other parts where the road service is particularly bad, but here is something in transport infrastructure which makes possible a style of communication which is not possible for the people who live in the larger contimental area and not even possible in England.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1472" /> I am not sure what the figures are but I believe we have a length of tarred road far greater than any country in Europe. That is something that gives me reason to think that perhaps we do not need the density of public transport we have, that we do not need to supply services of a kind which most people could make shift to provide by some type of co-operative means or, if we were to remove the monopoly, by some form of localised enterprise. I find that instead of looking at the matter in that light the Minister is talking &mdash; as yet he is only talking &mdash; about splitting CIE into three different components all of which are to be public monopolies.  I wonder if he is coming to grips with our problem at all.  Those two new companies will be new structures into which CIE will be subdivided.  I suppose that even at this minute some little graphic designer is putting together cute little logos for three different companies and, for all I know, there may be people who have their eyes on the top executive positions who are spotting out comfortable office accommodation for themselves, perhaps conveniently situated. That is not going to change the picture very much.  I cannot see that merely restructuring the management in this way, of making a public monopoly into three public monopolies will change things very much.  I should like to know why the Minister does not, if only as an experiment, hive off, hand out or yield up to private enterprise a slice of the CIE monopoly.</P>
    <P>I made that suggestion before and the answer I got from somebody who is not listening to what I have been trying to say is that if we handed it to private enterprise we know what would happen, private enterprise would be in like a shot to relieve us of the No. 6, No. 7a and No. 8 bus services which I take for granted make money but nobody would want to run the twice weekly bus from Galway to Manorhamilton via some circuitous serpentine route.  My answer to that is: do not hand out just the profitable bits, experimentally cut the CIE operational function into what might be called decker sandwiches or layer cakes in which there <Col N="1473" /> would be a slice of profitable service, a slice of break even service and a slice of unprofitable service and sell them off as a whole, rent them out or deal with them as concessions as a whole.  We should say that one cannot be taken without the other.  We should see if a private operator would take that risk and would say he will take on a profitable Dublin route, a break even inter-suburban route and a grossly unprofitable country route and guarantee to maintain them at a certain frequency, at a certain standard of cleanliness, maintenance and so and see how we will get on.  I cannot understand why that is not done.  I suspect that the reason is because of fear of the unions who see that a private operator will not tolerate the continuance of, for example, two-man buses because he could not afford to.  Being a private operator he would be out of business but the poor old sow whose situation is often deplored here, the poor old Irish State and the taxpayer who has to keep a roof over his head, naturally can always be fallen back on for so long as there is a publicly owned monopoly which the State essentially cannot close down.  We cannot close down CIE and everyone knows that.  At least we thought we knew it until Irish Shipping was closed down but I take it for granted that nobody contemplates the State closing down CIE.</P>
    <P>I cannot see why experimentally we should not slice off a bit of the CIE function in this layer cake or decker sandwich mode I have described and see how it gets on.  Instead of talking about that the Minister scarcely made any gesture or obeisance to private enterprise in the transport context except at the end of his speech where he said:</P>
    <P>There is, of course, no fundamental reason why public enterprise should not be as efficient as the private sector, but some appear to think that public enterprise is there for the benefit of those working in it, without having to give value for money or ensure that the customer comes first.</P>
    <P>They are tough words but there are not enough of them.  I know what the Minister <Col N="1474" /> means but unless one had followed his speech one might have missed those few words.  It is not enough to say about a publicly owned company that it is not there for the benefit of the people working in it but that it is there for the benefit of the general public and if the service it is providing can be more cheaply and efficiently provided privately the public interest requires that the public purse, including the purse of the workers who are also taxpayers whether they like it or not, should be spared.</P>
    <P>The postal monopoly is in a similar condition.  I had strong misgivings about An Post and Bord Telecom when they were set up and I made elaborate fun of their names here.  I still think that the name Telecom is ridiculous but I must say that I have noticed in my own experience, and in the level of complaints I have been getting from constituents, that, whether they were the cause of it or not, the advent of these two bodies has been accompanied by an improvement in those services.  Certainly, the level of complaints about telephones has fallen off very steeply.  I am sure every Member has had that experience.  It may be that that was going to happen anyway.  It may easily be that P &amp; T finally had got their act together and that the cabling system and installations were on full steam at the time the function was handed over but I must admit, for what it is worth, that the complaints about telephone installations have virtually ceased.</P>
    <P>I did not so often get complaints about postal services but I observed how unsatisfactory the system was in several respects.  In my view, the new management appear to be trying to save money, to think up new ideas to attract business and to give the whole operation more life than it used to have.  I wish both organisations well and I am sure they will survive any remarks I have made about them.  I will be the first to commend them if they show continuing success.</P>
    <P>At the same time everything I have said about monopolies goes for them as well.  They require to justify themselves as monopolies.  I tried to put down amendments to the Bill to prevent An <Col N="1475" /> Post from becoming a monopoly and to preserve the position of private couriers, but I had to withdraw my amendments for one reason or another.  The proposition that there is anything inherent about carrying post which requires it to be confined to a State owned monopoly is unsustainable.  I cannot see why that should be so.  I recognise that there should be a State service with a State guarantee behind it and a Minister responsible for it and that people should have an option to use the State service, but if somebody wants to compete by providing a cheaper or different form of service I cannot see why they should not be allowed to do so.</P>
    <P>The reason we have this postal monopoly is because the British left it behind them.  If there is another reason I would like to hear it.  We inherited this system. The same officials no doubt were in the post office when it was rebuilt after 1916 and they continued to do the same job and carry out the same policies.  The system dragged on year after year and remained a monopoly.  It was only after the outrageous Post Office strike in 1979, which lasted five or six months and which did untold damage to Irish business, not to speak of the private injury which it caused individuals, that courier firms began to provide a service.  When the postal service did resume it was never up to the same standards and most courier firms were able and could be relied on to provide a better and quicker service for roughly the same cost as the official postal monopoly.</P>
    <P>The Attorney General prosecuted one firm &mdash; Paperlink.  I do not know why that firm was singled out and the other firms were not similarly proceeded against.  In their defence Paperlink raised the unconstitutionality of the idea of a monopoly in a State like this and Mr. Justice Costello held against them.  They did not appeal to the Supreme Court, so there was no Supreme Court authority on that point.  It is nearly an impertinence for me to offer a commendation of praise on him.  I can scarcely imagine there is a more respected judge on the bench &mdash;<Col N="1476" /> and I say that quite sincerely &mdash; but with the greatest respect to him, I think he was wrong in his decision on the Paperlink issue and I would have liked to see it litigated in the Supreme Court.  There is one consideration which did not loom sufficiently largely in that case, and perhaps that is why the judgment did not focus on it, and that is what happens when a public monopoly ceases to function? How can it be said that the public monopoly, which did not provide a service for five or six months, subserves the common good?  Surely the common good is very severely injured by a public monopoly which closes down in conditions where nobody else is allowed to supply the same service?  That is a monopoly, the effect of which is deeply injurious to the public interest.  That side of the question was not explored sufficiently and I would have liked to hear the Supreme Court's views on it.  My own view, which even the Supreme Court would not change because they change their minds occasionally, is that there is no room in this country for the proposition that the State has only got to declare a monopoly and that is that.  When that monopoly provides a bad service or no service at all, whatever shred of justification which might have existed for a monopoly disappears.</P>
    <P>The same thing goes for the air waves. They are a commodity which can be exploited for business purposes and for making money.  That is approved of by our Constitution and unless Deputy Mac Giolla produces a majority in this House big enough to sponsor a Bill to change that, and persuades the people to vote for it, that is going to remain one of the bases and fundamentals of this State.  The air waves are a natural resources subject to the same principles in the Constitution and they have to be shared among private individuals, subject to obvious considerations of public order and public morality. In the case of the air waves, where there is a limited supply of frequencies consideration of public order is very obvious.  I do not deny the State's entitlement to run a broadcasting service, but what I deny is that the State is entitled to <Col N="1477" /> keep everybody else off the air.  The State is entitled to insist on licensing to operate only on a particular frequency, and the operator will be punished if he strays off the frequency or operates without a licence, but to deny <i>ab initio</i> the right of a business or anybody else to get on the air does not make sense.</P>
    <P>RTE and the Minister require to justify that monopoly.  If, as it is reported, there is conflict between the Government parties on this matter, and that that is the reason why this Bill is so long in surfacing and why the scandal of private radio has been so long tolerated, I have to say that I think the Labour Party are absolutely wrong, and they have only to open the Constitution to see that.  I have bought dearly my right to say these things by retreating to the back bench.  There is no constitutional way of keeping private enterprise, private business and private opinions off the air waves except in the interest of public order.  I unreservedly accept that the State not only may but must maintain a régime of order on the air waves because we cannot all jam one another &mdash; that is effectively what it would mean &mdash; but I deny the State's right to say that these air waves, which like the air we breath are a natural resource, will be controlled by an Authority appointed by the State and nobody else can be involved.</P>
    <P>I wrote to the then Minister, Dr. Cruise-O'Brien, to make these points when private radio broadcasting began.  I said there was no constitutional way we could protect RTE's position by keeping everybody else off the air.  I got a letter, not from the Minister but from a person who was, I think, in charge of the broadcasting section in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs.  He gave seven or eight reasons why no one else could be allowed on the air.  Five or six were relevant enough, to do with the limited number of frequencies, the danger of interrupting vital services, interfering with navigation, ambulances and so on. I accept all that.  However, the last reason was the one which interested me.  It was because we must protect RTE's position.</P>
    <P>That was the official attitude of the <Col N="1478" /> Department of Posts and Telegraphs around the year &mdash; I am speaking from memory &mdash; 1976.  That position is altogether legally wrong, in my opinion.  I have said my piece about the Labour Party and do not want to repeat it.  They are completely in the wrong if they are impending this Bill in order to keep private enterprise off the air.  I would make it an issue on which the Minister should say &ldquo;Either I am allowed to produce this Bill, or I resign&rdquo;, and see what happens.</P>
    <P>That Bill must include &mdash; it cannot lawfully exclude &mdash; some room for private enterprise.  In the old days of the Posts and Telegraphs Estimates, the Deputies used to come into the House and, if they had nothing else to say, had an opinion about RTE.  I know that the Minister is not responsible for RTE's programme or day-to-day operation, but having spoken hard words about their illusion that they have the right to a monopoly of the air waves, I want to say that of the monopoly which they have they make, on the whole, very good use.  I have no serious fault to find with the station.  I do not look at television or listen to the radio very much.  I listen to the radio certainly in the morning and occasionally look at television in the evening.  Such impressions &mdash; and I admit they are not exhaustive &mdash; as I have tell me, at least, that RTE put out programmes that are not, by a long shot, as vulgar and cretinous as those coming from some of the English stations.  That may be a negative phrase which would not flatter RTE very highly, but they certainly have a long way to descend before they could reach the absolutely moronic level of what I sometimes see my children looking at on one of the British frequencies.  If they can even keep clear of descending to that level, they will have deserved well of the people.  I am not speaking about vulgarity in the sexual sense, but about vulgarity in the general sense and moronic programmes such that it would make you ashamed of your species to be caught looking at them.</P>
    <P>I would make one plea, if it is proper to do so in the course of this debate: when an advertising agency deliver RTE a <Col N="1479" /> jingle, particularly a radio jingle, for use in promoting some product, that jingle is permitted to live on the station for a maximum of six months.  I do not know if the House shares this prejudice or that perhaps the Ceann Comhairle has a more placid temperament than I have, but one of the minor irritations of my life is to turn on the radio and hear for the seventeen thousand eight hundred and thirty-second time &mdash;&ldquo;You-made-us-what-we-are, the-people's-choice&rdquo;.  I am not going to mention the company responsible for that jingle, but whoever is responsible for keeping it on for so many uninterrupted months should be shot.  It is fit to drive one out of one's mind.  There should be a time limit of six months on every advertising jingle, because the effect on the listening public is absolutely infuriating. I do not think I have ever heard anyone complain in here about this before and perhaps I am less tolerant than others, but it would not be too much to ask the advertiser to change his tune every few months.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I have had the same volume of very sober and temperate complaints, considering the hardship, from Irish Shipping employees about the situation in which the developments at the beginning of this year left them.  I realise that the Minister had to make a hard decision and I support it, as I think every Deputy on the Government side, with greater or lesser resignation or reluctance, does. We recognise that there is a limit to what can be done to rescue even a body with as good a record as Irish Shipping when they get themselves so deeply into trouble.  I join with Deputy Wilson in asking the Minister to keep in front of his mind the hardship caused to people who feel that they have been, certainly through no fault of their own, treated in a way that they could not possibly have avoided after having, as Deputy Wilson quite rightly said, turned in so many years of profitable operation and of flawless industrial relations.  Not that anyone should perforce be compassionate from that sort of consideration necessarily, but <Col N="1480" /> I would like the Minister and the Government to be mindful of that relatively small number of people who have been left in situations of such hardship in regard to pensions, not to speak of unemployment.</P>
    <P>It may be that the State operates some system of preferential treatment in a way that once upon a time, and perhaps even yet, service in the Defence Forces was regarded as giving you a preferential claim to State employment.  If such a thing still exists, it should be extended to categories like Irish Shipping employees. I am speaking about those looking for new State employment who have had to leave State employment for reasons for which they themselves are not answerable. I would not at all say the same about a concern whose workforce shut it down. Certainly, a workforce like that of Irish Shipping is not in that situation.  I am sure this is near the Government's heart and I hope they will find some way of treating them with more effective compassion than has seemed possible up to now.  I am sure the Government are not short of compassion.</P>

      <P>We shall be opposing this Estimate from the Department of Communications. We cannot accept it on the basis that there is no provision whatsoever for supporting the organisations which are responsible to the Department of Communications.  The Estimate does not take into account the serious crisis which is developing within the semi-State organisations under the Minister's control &mdash; namely, Bord Telecom Éireann, An Post and RTE.  Over the past year the Minister has failed dismally to live up to his responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Resulting from the Government's document <i>Building on Reality</i> Bord Telecom Éireann are facing a serious financial crisis.  This has been clearly demonstrated by the resignation of the chief executive, Mr. Tom Byrnes, on 31 May 1985.  This was a major blow to the company.  The grounds for his resignation were clearly stated by Mr. Byrnes at the time.  I regret that the Minister saw fit in here today to criticise the former chief executive, <Col N="1481" /> when Mr. Byrnes had to leave the country as a result of that Minister's mishandling of Bord Telecom Éireann and the financing of that company.  It is unprecedented that in this House a Government Cabinet Minister would take the opportunity, during the Estimate for his Department, to criticise the former and first chief executive of Bord Telecom Éireann, a man who contributed so much to the launching of that semi-State company on 1 January 1984.  Before that time he served on the interim board which resulted in a transition from a State company to a semi-State organisation.</P>
    <P>Let us place on record that Mr. Tom Byrnes made a major contribution to the establishment of Bord Telecom Éireann and its efficient running since 1 January 1984.  The State would have invested in Mr. Byrnes a considerable amount of money in relation to the expertise which he built up over a period of five years. That has now been lost to the State as a result of the Minister's and the Government's decision in the document, <i>Building on Reality.</i></P>
    <P>Surely the Minister is aware of the crisis within Bord Telecom Éireann?  I want to recall that financial crisis in detail.  By the end of March 1985, losses will be in the region of £70 million.  The levy of £180 million imposed by the Government as a method of raising further taxation and included in the 1985 Finance Bill to prevent legal objections posed by Telecom Éireann will sink this company.</P>
    <P>We should bear in mind the crisis in Telecom Éireann at this stage.  In 1984 they borrowed £180 million for their capital programme and this year they are borrowing £160 million also for their capital works.  In addition, they propose to borrow a further £130 million in 1986 to complete their capital investment programme.  It should be noted that £30 million allocated by the EC in 1984 for telecommunication purposes was retained by the Government for other purposes. In 1984 the Government received a contribution of £94 million from Telecom Éireann and this has resulted in higher charges.  It will affect adversely <Col N="1482" /> the viability of the company and the many firms who rely on Telecom Éireann for telephone and telex services.</P>
    <P>I note that the unions propose to oppose the policy of the Government.  It is more than likely that the chairman of Telecom Éireann and other directors will shortly resign in protest unless there is a change of policy by the Government in relation to the funding of Telecom Éireann. This organisation will become a white elephant unless the Government change their attitude.  They are forcing the organisation to raise further borrowing to provide funds for the Government. It is a form of taxation on telephone and telex subscribers who are not able to carry the extra cost at this stage.</P>
    <P>I welcome the publication this week of the first annual report of An Post for the year ended 31 March 1984.  The publication in such a short time is an example to other State companies of the efficient way they are handling their affairs.  I congratulate Mr. Fergal Quinn, chairman, and Mr. Gerard Harvey, chief executive, for their fine performance in the past 12 months.  In addition, I should like to congratulate the 9,000 staff and the 3,000 sub-contractors, postmasters and so on for the work they have done.  They have made dramatic improvements in the postal services since the establishment of An Post on 1 January 1984.  I had the honour of serving in the Department of Posts and Telegraphs for nine months and I was quite confident that the calibre of the people in the Department and throughout the service would ensure that An Post would be a magnificent success.</P>
    <P>I note the overall trading loss of £377,000, taking into account the Government subvention of £5 million in 1984.  This was predicted as the service was a loss-making one.  However, they have arrested the decline, particularly with regard to the volume of mail.  There has been a 5 per cent increase in that area and that is most welcome.  This is happening at a time when there is an overall international decline in postal business.</P>
    <P>I regret that the Government have decided to reduce the overall commitment <Col N="1483" /> of £50 million for capital works which was included in the 1982 Bill dealing with postal and telecommunications services.  The reduction is a major blow to An Post.  The state of the buildings and the vehicles transferred by the Department of Posts and Telegraphs in 1984 was not up to standard.  Throughout the country the cost of maintenance in respect of buildings and vehicles has been quite considerable.  We must compare that with the quality of the buildings transferred to Telecom Éireann and the investment in relation to new buildings for that organisation.</P>
    <P>I know from my inspection of post offices that the quality of the buildings is very poor.  It would require far more than £50 million to bring up the standard of those buildings to modern requirements. Some of the sorting offices are in very poor state and the staff have to work in very bad conditions: some of the buildings are in a very dangerous condition. I take the opportunity to request the Minister to appeal to the Government to review their commitment in relation to capital works.  It is only fair and reasonable that An Post should benefit from the commitment given in 1982.  If the staff were aware that the Government were proposing to renege on their commitment, I do not think the transition would have been as peaceful and as orderly as it has been.  Unless this investment takes place the quality and the future of the service will be damaged.</P>
    <P>I say to the chief executive, the chairman and the staff of An Post that they are being too quiet and orderly regarding the failure of the Government to allocate the £50 million to them.  I hope they will adopt a more independent approach, perhaps similar to the approach adopted by Mr. Tom Byrnes.  When he worked with Telecom Éireann he spelled out clearly and publicly his position in relation to charges imposed by the Government.  I have no criticism of the chairman of An Post.  He tends to rely on good public relations in relation to his performance and perhaps it is time he took a more <Col N="1484" /> active role in pointing out to the Government their responsibility in connection with the commitments they made.  He does not need to protect the Government or the Minister.  He should fight for the staff with regard to the kind of buildings in which they work.  He may wish to keep on good terms with the Government knowing the fate of other executives of semi-State organisations.  He may think that if he offers too severe a criticism his future as chairman could be in doubt.  I say he should accept his role on the basis that he is working on behalf of the 9,000 staff and 3,000 sub-contractors and he should take their side.  He should not cover up for the fact that the Government are not carrying out their responsibilities in relation to the capital allocation, which commitment would have been honoured by Fianna Fáil if they were in Government.</P>
    <P>I welcome the innovations by An Post in respect of special Christmas stamps and the production of cards for St. Patrick's Day and Valentine's Day.  All of those promotions are welcome.  However, I favour the printing of stamps as opposed to the card and stamp.  The production of St. Patrick's Day cards has placed Irish manufacturers in some difficulties. I urge An Post to have special stamps for Christmas, St. Patrick's Day and Valentine's Day and also to have stamps for Easter.  This would encourage people to send more cards through the post.</P>
    <P>In relation to charges generally, there were hidden increases in February and now the people are realising what happened.  Today I received a letter addressed to me at Dáil Éireann which carried a 26p stamp.  It was a reasonable amount having regard to the size of the envelope. However, an additional charge of 20p was made, making a total of 46p for this relatively small piece of mail.  Since February there has been a major change with regard to cost.  The public are only now becoming aware of the hidden increases that were imposed at that time.</P>
    <P>I receive regular complaints particularly from businessmen who send items <Col N="1485" /> through the post.  The receiver is surcharged if the mail is over a certain weight.  I appeal to An Post to inform the public exactly what size, shape and weight of mail is covered by a 26p stamp and a 22p stamp.  I know of a county councillor who sent a letter to his local authority on behalf of his constituents.  He put a 26p stamp on the letter but this was not adequate and the county council would not accept the letter because there was a surcharge of 50p on it.  He was surcharged when he received the letter back.  The new charges have been implemented but I do not believe the public are aware of the new regulations regarding size and weight.  An Post should embark on an advertising campaign to acquaint the public of the changes.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to inform the House about progress in relation to the introduction of the post bus.  This was introduced in County Clare during our term in office.  There is much to be said for this service.  It is a magnificent utilisation of transport in rural areas and I urge An Post to expand this service.</P>
    <P>Television licences are a serious bone of contention between RTE, An Post and the Department of Communications. There are 720,000 licensed television sets.  At present a licence costs £52 per annum.  Although the charge is high the payment of the amount at one time is what is causing difficulty.  Stamps which allowed for the easy payment of television licences were withdrawn as a result of fraud but it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for An Post to device an easy payment method.  The number of unlicensed sets make it imperative that the method of payment be made as simple as possible.  I should like the Minister to make some comment about that and request An Post to introduce such a service to the public.  As regards free television licences for old age pensioners and others, they are only entitled to a licence for a black and white set.  This should be extended to cover coloured sets.  The majority of sets are now coloured and the fact that free licences cover only black and white sets is petty.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1486" /> I regret the Minister's interference in relation to the running of RTE over the last 12 months.  It is obvious to all concerned that the Minister wishes to exert total political control over broadcasting, particularly in current affairs.  The proposal to split up RTE will be opposed by us as it is a method to privatise sections of RTE.  The strength of the organisation lies in the unity of radio and television broadcasting and the combined news gathering methods used by RTE which are second to none.  Any changes in this area will be opposed by the staff of RTE and the public.  RTE as a semi-State organisation and our national broadcasting organisation are doing a fine job as far as broadcasting is concerned.  However, there is room for improvement in any organisation.  We are not getting enough regional participation and there is not enough emphasis on regional news nor is there sufficient utilisation of the regional studio network.  I welcome the extension of the network and the provision of electronic news gathering devices in Galway, Castlebar, Waterford and other areas but there should be direct news broadcasts from the regions on a weekly basis.  That would provide a proper regional service and I appeal to the Minister to indicate publicly if he would be in favour of this.</P>
    <P>The recent appointment of the new RTE Authority is open to question.  The Minister said that the new Authority was appointed on 1 June 1985 for a period of five years.  He also said that in discussions in the House last March, the Taoiseach made it clear that appointments to the new Authority would be based on merit and not on political affiliation.  He also stated that the appointments bear this out and had been accepted by the public as such.  They do not bear that out and are as political as any of those previous Coalition Governments made.  Mr. Frank Flannery has been appointed.  As is well known, he is one of the national handlers. The appointment of such a prominent party activist casts doubt on the impartiality and independence of the RTE Authority. It is obvious the Minister will have his own people there to ensure that the <Col N="1487" /> Government side will be looked after at all times.</P>
    <P>The non-appointment of the outgoing chairman.  Mr. Fred O'Donovan, who has served the Authority well over the last few years is regretted.  It has been a precedent that retiring chairmen were appointed to the Authority because of the expertise they could bring to the job. The non-appointment of Mr. Con Murphy, Mr. Crosby and Mr. Barry are also regretted.  By their action the Government are guaranteeing that the Authority will have the Government slant at all times.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that a broadcaster of the calibre of Mr. Pat Kenny would accept an appointment from the Minister for Communications.  A broadcaster engaged in current affairs programmes must not only be impartial but be seen to be impartial.  I admire the work of Mr. Kenny in the broadcasting area.  He is very bright, intelligent and has contributed greatly to the popularity of RTE current affairs and musical programmes. However, he will have to work twice as hard in the future to prove his unquestionable impartiality.  He has expressed reservations about talking on the job and has stated that he will have to opt out of meetings of the Authority when they are discussing pay and conditions of other broadcasters in that area.  He has prejudiced his own outstanding and known impartiality in relation to broadcasting matters because he has accepted this appointment.  It would be difficult for a broadcaster in a current affairs programme to adopt an impartial approach in relation to a man who appointed him as a member of the board.</P>
    <P>Because of my admiration for Pat Kenny and the work he is doing I regret that he will now have great difficulty in proving his impartiality in the broadcasting area.  He cannot be accepted as a workers' representative on the board of RTE because he has not been elected by fellow workers.  On that point, I should like the Minister to indicate why the Government have not seen fit to introduce worker participation in relation to <Col N="1488" /> the appointment of members to the board of RTE.  In addition, I am disappointed that the Minister of State did not see fit to ensure that someone from the Connacht region was appointed to the board.  So far as I am aware no member of the board has a farming background and since agriculture is our major industry, it is regrettable that there is no one on the board of RTE who has a knowledge of farming and who would be able to assist in relation to certain programmes.</P>
    <P>Regarding the appointment to the Authority of a Northern representative, Dr. Stanley Worell, who was appointed to the Authority by Fianna Fáil, was replaced subsequently by the Coalition's appointee, Mr. Frank Flannery.  At that stage the Government had very little commitment to the appointment of a representative from the Northern part of our country.  In principle I welcome fully the appointment of Northern representatives to the boards of semi-State bodies.  However, the appointment to the RTE Authority of a leading member of the BBC in Northern Ireland, Mr. W.D. Flackes, is a cause of some concern in regard to the motives that may be behind that appointment. For a long time the distinguished person was the trusted voice of the political establishment in Northern Ireland. One must ask whether the appointment is part of the pattern of trying to increase British and Unionist influence in Ireland, a pattern that seems to be part of the Government's policy at this stage?</P>
    <P>Recently this person produced a book entitled, <i>Northern Ireland &mdash; A Political Directory.</i> This publication has a very subtle but definite anti-nationalist bias. The journalist in question has the highest professional credentials but I am concerned about the publishers of the work and about the usage to which the directory is intended to be put.  It has been noted that this work of reference was published by Ariel Books but I must ask whether this company have any connection with the Ariel Foundation.  The name is fairly unusual.  In a recent book by authors Black and Fitzgerald there is the allegation that the foundation is intended to be a fund for British intelligence. <Col N="1489" /> We would be happy to be reassured that there is no connection and that the use of the rather unusual name, Ariel, in both instances is purely coincidental. Otherwise the implications would be alarming.</P>
    <P>In relation to the broadcasting area generally and having regard to this being International Youth Year, I suggest that RTE promote further talent within the broadcasting area both in respect of radio and television.  I am not saying that we are becoming tired of the constant use of the same broadcasters.  Even during the summer schedule when such well known broadcasters as Gay Byrne are on holidays, the broadcasters being used are ones who have been around for quite a while.  These are all very popular broadcasters but it would seem that there is some kind of circle within RTE by which they ensure that there are no new faces emerging.  For a country of our size it is a great credit to us that we have produced people of such undoubted ability in the broadcasting area as Terry Wogan, Henry Kelly and Eamon Andrews.  The leading broadcasters in Britain are of Irish origin but it is remarkable that there seems to be a shortage of new faces in so far as RTE are concerned.  Surely in this International Youth Year RTE should embark on a talent spotting competition with a view to bringing forward new talents for the years ahead.  Popular as the present front runners may be, no one is irreplaceable and the public are crying out for changes in regard to programmes generally.</P>
    <P>I compliment RTE on the changes that have taken place in the area of current affairs programmes.  The two new programmes, &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; and &ldquo;Today at 5&rdquo; have been very widely accepted and are very popular.  They are here to stay.  The morning programme attracts a very large listening audience and there are some other very good RTE current affairs programmes also.  Some may say that we have a little in excess of the number of such programmes required but the audiences will decide which programmes will survive.  My only appeal in this regard is that there is a fair contribution from all sides, particularly on the <Col N="1490" /> political side.  In a brief survey conducted at the beginning of the year we found that from early January to the beginning of April in respect of the &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo; programme there were more than 37 interviews with Fine Gael Deputies or Senators, 24 interviews with Fianna Fáil Deputies or Senators while the figure in respect of Labour was about 15.  Independents and The Workers' Party were interviewed also for that programme.  We were in a minority situation with 24 interviews as against a total of 52 and that is not a fair balance as between the Coalition and Fianna Fáil.  Therefore, I am saying to the producers of that programme that I am not satisfied with the number of Fianna Fáil people being invited to contribute to the programme, compared with the Government side.  I am not saying that the programme is biased in any way and while I congratulate the producers on the fine work they are doing, I must inform them that I am watching the programme from the point of view of the proportion of participation of non-Government spokespersons, whether they be Deputies, Senators or councillors.  I am asking only for fair play. As a party who achieve more than 50 per cent of the popular vote we are entitled to at least 50 per cent of participation in such programmes.  The programme is very popular and it has contributed greatly to an awareness on the part of the public of current affairs generally.</P>
    <P>The Government have failed dismally to introduce the legislation for the establishment of an independent local radio broadcasting authority.  On 29 November 1984, the Minister for Communications wrote in a letter to me that regarding my inquiry, he was hoping to be in a position to circulate the Bill within the following weeks.  We are now well into the month of June and the Bill has not been published yet.  This morning the Minister told us he hopes the Bill will be passed before the summer recess but having regard to the programme of legislation before the House it seems unlikely that the Bill will become law before the autumn session.</P>
    <P>I believe the reason for this delay is <Col N="1491" /> that there is total division within the Cabinet in relation to the introduction of an independent local radio authority.  In this area there is an ideological split between the Labour Party on the one hand and Fine Gael on the other in relation to the participation of public service broadcasting in respect of local radio.  People are crying out for the services of legalised, local radio.  The present position is totally unacceptable and has been for some time.  There is a demand for independent, local radio.  Yet legislation has not been brought forward to allow people to participate in that area on a legal basis.  The void has been filled by the pirate stations &mdash; illegal as they may be &mdash; which have been welcomed by the public.</P>
    <P>The responsibility for the delay in bringing forward legislation rests with the Government.  After two and a half years in office they have failed dismally in this respect.  It is evidence of the inactivity of this administration, that they are not prepared, are not capable of and not sufficiently united to introduce legislation to establish legal community radio.  With the assistance of a Minister of State with responsibility for communications, Deputy Nealon, surely after two and a half years this Government are not still arguing about the composition of the relevant authority.</P>
    <P>The confusion between the Minister himself and his Minister of State is quite evident.  The Minister of State suggested that over 30 local radio stations could be established while the Minister himself mentioned a number of seven.  I do not think anybody has decided finally on the number, which will depend to a greater or lesser extent on the demand for licences throughout the country.  It will be difficult to place a limit only on the basis of the actual wavebands involved.  During this local elections campaign it has been brought to my attention by a number of people that communications are so important and that local radio would put people directly in touch with each other. I believe we are now missing a major opportunity and have done so over the last four or five years.  There are so many <Col N="1492" /> young people who would be in a position to gain good employment in this area, both on the technical and broadcasting fronts.  It would also serve as a training ground for new talent in relation to our national broadcasting services, radio and television.  Local radio services would provide people with a great opportunity to be involved in the broadcasting area, people who could graduate from there to our national broadcasting service.</P>
    <P>It is unlikely this Government will ever bring forward an independent local broadcasting authority Bill.  I look forward to the early return to office of Fianna Fáil.  I can assure the House that within four months of our returning to office we will have a Bill passed by this House, the relevant authority established, with legal stations on the air within six months of our return to office.  That is the type of work time scale I believe to be quite manageable.  But the Government have failed in this as in other areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to long wave radio broadcasting I would ask the Minister to support the submission by RTE to the Department of Communications to establish a long wave radio broadcasting service on frequency allocated to Ireland by the Regional Administrative Broadcasting Conference of 1975.  This would provide further opportunities to our broadcasters, producers and technicians and create export earnings from advertising.</P>
    <P>In relation to television deflectors I believe the Government could and should bring forward legislation to provide for the establishment of licensed television deflectors to provide multi-channel viewing in rural areas where cable systems would not be feasible.  The fact that the Government have refused to bring forward legislation to legalise deflectors has again resulted in the illegal erection of deflectors in rural areas.  I have made it quite clear, that as far as I am concerned, there is no technical reason that deflectors cannot be legalised. Legislation could be introduced in this House to allow people in rural areas to avail themselves of the same services as are enjoyed by those in urban areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1493" /> Department are totally opposed to the legislation of deflectors.  I know they will advise the Minister that it is not feasible. I believe it is the civil servant's right to advise but it is the right of the Minister to bring forward policy.  If the Minister himself feels it possible to introduce legislation, then he should not be deterred. From my experience in the Department dealing with communities throughout the country, there is a great need for the introduction of legalised deflectors to provide multi-channel viewing particularly in rural areas.</P>
    <P>In relation to satellite broadcasting I note that the Minister has studied the position very carefully.  It will be a major decision on the part of the Government to award a franchise to the company involved and it is only correct that this be given a fair hearing.</P>
    <P>We shall oppose this Estimate on many grounds but principally because it does not provide proper funding for An Post and Telecom Éireann.  Neither does it provide the proper policy framework in relation to broadcasting generally.  The Minister has failed dismally to provide any funding whatsoever for the establishment of a local radio service.  Within this Estimate there is not one provision for the establishment of a local radio authority. It is quite obvious that the Minister and the Government have no commitment whatsoever to bringing about a situation in which an independent local radio service will be set up.  We shall oppose this Estimate on that basis because we feel it to be inadequate in its provision for services over the next 12 months. Over the past 12 months the semi-State organisations, particularly RTE, Telecom Éireann and An Post have been deprived of proper leadership by the Minister.</P>

      <P>In the course of the debate on this Estimate I should like to deal primarily with the question of aviation policy which I regard as of fundamental importance to the general economic well-being of this country in <Col N="1494" /> terms of tourism, one of our most important industries, and in terms also of manufacturing industry and, in particular, exports.  I want to relate what I have to say to the damage which I believe the existing regulatory policy in this country does to the overall national and economic interest and to ask that that be changed. In the past month or two we have had the opportunity to talk about different specific aspects of that on Committee Stage of the Air Transport Bill but as you, Sir, and other occupants of the Chair from time to time have correctly pointed out to me, one cannot speak in general terms on Committee Stage.  It is open to me to speak in general terms rather than on just specific points.  One of the matters I want to deal with in the course of what I have to say is the controversy that arose out of remarks which I made here at the opening of the Committee Stage of that Bill on 1 May last.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that manufacturing output has fallen quite considerably in the recent past and that the latest figure is 8.6 per cent in January alone followed by .5 per cent in February and that the number of manufacturing jobs lost over the past two years would be somewhere in the region of 30,000?  Would the Minister also agree that the impact of the question is that there is not enough investment available to manufacturing industry to restore the balance in so far as output is concerned?</P>

Deputy Reynold's question relates to investment, and investments made earlier are yielding very much bigger outputs than they were in the year or the year after they were made and there continues to be a rapid increase in industrial output.</P>

It is quite unsatisfactory that the most recent figures we have for industry as a whole relate to 1981.  There is a need to update the figures produced by the CSO.

      <P>As the Deputy is aware, an informal steering committee was established by the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges to facilitate consideration of the report &ldquo;New Technology for Leinster House&rdquo;.  In January 1985, following detailed consideration of the report, the steering committee submitted an interim report recommending the areas which should be given priority in the application of new technology.  I have already indicated to the House that the priority areas identified in the interim report are:&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash; the improvement of Library and research facilities.</P>
      <P>&mdash; a computer-based information system on Oireachtas procedures and practices, Library material, Oireachtas debates, legislation, etc.</P>
      <P>&mdash; the sound system</P>
      <P>&mdash; word processing in the reporting of debates, preparation of reports, structuring of the Order Paper, etc. </P>
      <P>It was also recommended to the Committee on Procedure and Privileges that a consultant be engaged to obtain the best technical advice available on the type of equipment most suitable to needs, bearing in mind likely further developments and to prepare costings.  The Committee on Procedure and Privileges agreed to the proposals in the interim report on 6 February 1985 and terms of reference of the committee were amended on 30 April to give CPP the power necessary to engage consultants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Arrangements are underway for the appointment of a consultant.  It is the intention that the consultant will carry out a large part of the study during the Summer Recess, when officials of the <Col N="1498" /> Houses will have more time available to devote to the exercise.</P>
    <P>I would expect that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges should have the consultants report by the beginning of the next session.</P>

The recommendations which I would be implementing under the Restrictive Practices Act, when amended, are the following: the recommendation for a restrictive practices order prohibiting the agencies and solicitors from refusing to treat with non-solicitors involved in conveyancing, and an order to make it unlawful for lending agencies to charge their solicitor's fees to the house buyer.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Bruton Mr. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the IDA employ a comprehensive system for authenticating grant claims.  All claims for grant payment must be submitted to the IDA by the grant-aided firms' auditors. The auditors must certify that the appropriate capital expenditure has been incurred.  The IDA's grant inspectors also examine the grant-aided assets on the firm's premises together with the relevant suppliers' invoices.  This ensures that grant payments will be made only on assets which have been purchased and paid for by the grant-aided company.</P>
      <P>While, at present, individual paid cheques may also be inspected in banks on request, I am informed by the IDA that the proposal of the associated banks to discontinue facilities for the inspection of paid cheques may create difficulties for auditors in giving absolute certificates regarding payments made by their clients. In view of the difficulties which may arise, the IDA are examining, in consultation with auditors and with the banks, possible alternative methods for authenticating grant claims.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the circumstances which gave rise to the issue on 5 July 1982 of a statement by the then Minister for Trade, Commerce and Tourism regarding the PMPA Insurance Company Ltd.  The statement was issued following a press report which could have seriously damaged confidence in the company and hence the interests of their policyholders.</P>

    <P>The subsequent appointment of an administrator to the PMPA Insurance Company Ltd. in October 1983 was designed to safeguard the interests of policyholders and claimants on insurance policies of the company.  Unfortunately, because of the serious losses of the PMPA, the shareholders have no prospect of recovering their investment.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have answered these concerns fully in reply to similar questions in January last.  I, too, am concerned, as are the Government, at the cost of liability insurance.  The Deputy will be aware that since my last replies, the Government decided to modify the right of access to decisions by jury on the extent of damages for personal injuries, and that the Minister for Justice will be bringing detailed proposals before the Government on the matter in the near future.  However, as I have also stated, improved safety precautions on the part of employers are also an important factor if we want to contain claim costs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the availability of insurance cover, I have arranged with the representative <Col N="1506" /> body of insurers an agreed procedure for handling any case where a company or organisation have difficulty in obtaining cover.  However, I must stress that while all such cases of difficulty are investigated and pursued, my Department cannot perform the role of insurance broker.  My primary role as Minister in charge of the insurance sector is to ensure that insurers meet their legal solvency and reserving requirements. The premiums charged by insurers must reflect the claims incurred and provide funds to meet these requirements.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister does not address himself to the question.  This is just a repeat of a reply to a question of a similar kind.  Is the Minister aware that in the woodworking industry alone, for every £100 of wages paid up to £20 of insurance has to be paid on each individual. In the case of steelworkers up to 25 per cent of the wage bill has to be paid out in insurance.  In the farming sector the cost of insurance in the liability area has risen by some 500 per cent.  There are other areas such as the hotel industry where there has been an increase of £1,000 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister is aware of these savage increases, has he made any arrangements with the insures to provide a more realistic type of cover for industries generally?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not questioned the source of the Deputy's allegations. I do, however, accept that the cost of insurance is higher in Ireland than in England. It is more difficult to compare our level with that in Europe because of the different type of system there.  Underwriting losses in this area increased sixfold during the period 1979-1983, rising from £5.94 million in 1979 to £35.87 million in 1983.  Therefore it will be obvious to anyone that the insurance industry in this sector has had an unfortunate and deteriorating underwriting experience.  A <Col N="1507" /> number of factors have been mentioned such as the high level of jury awards and the increased incidence and frequency of claims.  It has been suggested that the level of Irish awards can be between two and four times higher than the level in England.  I stated in my reply that the Government are to consider the right of juries to hear personal liability claims. Two other important points must be stressed.  The employers have a responsibility in this area as well.  The report of the Commission of Inquiry on Safety, Health and Welfare at work made that point quite clearly and was critical of the employers' role in this regard.  I am pleased to note that the Minister for Labour has stated his intention to introduce legislation in this area as soon as necessary consultations have been completed. The second point is that for a number of years there has been undercutting in the market place which has exacerbated the underwriting losses and the increased level of premiums is perhaps a reflection of a more realistic premium level which is needed if serious underwriting losses are to be eliminated.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very interesting question.  In the first instance I cannot give assurances that if, for instance, juries were abolished and a matter was heard and decided on by a justice the level of award would fall.  I cannot guarantee that.  I do not like answering hypothetical questions.  If the level of awards arising from court actions were to fall generally, then I would take that factor into consideration when dealing with applications for price increases in the light of the underwriting losses then occurring.  If there were to be a fall in awards if would come to my attention in the normal processing of price applications.</P>

      <P>The Minister concedes that there is a difficulty in PL and EL cover. Is he aware that 18 per cent of total claims paid goes on legal fees, inclusive of the 23 per cent VAT on the fees of solicitors and barristers?  The Minister lists the factors which help to make premium costs so high.  Will he now confirm that what he might have in mind in changing the jury system is out of line with what the Department of Justice have in mind and that this is the reason no proposals are being put forward to change the jury system in any way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I simply made a statement based on logic that I cannot guarantee the outcome of a change in the hearing of liability cases.  No matter what system is adopted &mdash; for instance, a justice might advise a jury; a justice might act alone or there might be some form of judicial tribunal to hear liability cases &mdash; I cannot give any assurance as to the level of settlements.  I should like to see awards which would be equitable from everybody's point of view.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If anybody holds another view, I should like to hear it.  For instance, two recent awards made in Northern Ireland under a non-jury system were rather high but is anybody saying that they were not justified in view of the injuries suffered by the people concerned?  I cannot be definite in regard to this matter, I am merely stating that, no matter what system is used in adjudicating on liability cases, awards must be equitable and I cannot indicate if they would be lower if <Col N="1509" /> a justice was dealing by himself with the case or indeed under any system.</P>

In this regard, the IDA have available for industrial purposes two factories in Finglas of 28,300 square feet and 44,750 square feet which have been provided through an arrangement with a private developer.

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1516" /> The Government accepted a recommendation of the report of the Sectoral Development Committee on the Clothing and Textile Industry that Ireland should favour renewal of the MFA, which expires at end July 1986.  In this context, discussions have been held with the EC Commission in recent months and the Irish case for renewal of the MFA has been vigorously pressed.</P>
    <P>I understand that the EC Commission expects to submit shortly a proposal to the Council of Ministers on the position which the Community should adopt in the forthcoming discussions in the GATT on this issue.  We will be urging our Community partners to press for the renewal of the MFA.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to hear the Minister say that the Government will be pressing this matter because it is of great significance to the clothing and textile industry.  Is the Minister aware that this multi-fibre arrangement accommodates about 80 per cent of world trade in clothing and textiles and that some 10,000 jobs have been lost in Ireland in the last ten years in those areas?  Is the Minister aware that about 300,000 jobs have been lost in the EC in these areas?  Will the Minister give a guarantee to the House that there will not be a return to the GATT arrangement and that he will insist, on behalf of the Government, on having the multi-fibre arrangement renegotiated in its original terms when it runs out in July 1986?</P>

      <P>I indicated quite clearly in my reply that we favour a renewal of the MFA.  Indeed, I had the pleasure of being the Minister responsible when the present multi-fibre agreement was adopted in 1981.  Obviously, we would like to see this derogation from the normal GATT rules continue.  I agree with the Deputy, and I am sure the House understands, that without the MFA we would have a very difficult situation in the market place because of substantial and uncontrollable imports of textile and clothing from low cost countries which would completely distort the market in <Col N="1517" /> Europe.  I cannot comment on the possibility of having exactly the same type of agreement.  For instance, the United States is certainly changing its attitude on international trade and has become somewhat more protective.  The House will understand that this is a highly complex measure which includes a large number of bilateral agreements to be entered into by this country with low cost countries within the general framework of an MFA.  While I can say that in principle we are in favour of a renewal of the MFA I must point out that I expect negotiations leading up to an agreement to be long and complex.</P>

In the region of 25,000 people are involved in clothing and textiles here and I ask the Minister to bear in mind that while exports from that sector were at about £167 million last year there is no doubt that if the Minister fails to have the MFA negotiated to our satisfaction the whole clothing and textile industry will be put in jeopardy.

      <P>I accept that the commission will shortly make proposals to the Council of Ministers.  I should like to say in relation to the Irish clothing and textile industry that it too will have to compete and modernise to meet the demands.  The question of trade within the EC is a matter for the EC as a whole <Col N="1518" /> in relation to its own free trade and competition rules.  I should like to reiterate that we are in favour of a new MFA and the House can be assured that whatever steps are necessary to protect Ireland's clothing and textile interest within the confines of that MFA will be fully represented at the negotiations.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism if he is satisfied that the agencies for dealing with restrictive practices, the Restrictive Practices Commission and the Examiner of Restrictive Practices, are functioning satisfactorily; and, if not, the action he proposes to take on the matter.</P>

      <P>The existing functions of the Restrictive Practices Commission and the Examiner of Restrictive Practices are being carried out satisfactorily by them.  However, there is considerable scope, particularly by means of new institutional arrangements, for strengthening the administration of competition policy generally.  This matter was dealt with in some detail in the national plan, in paragraphs 3.18 to 3.22.  Work is proceeding in my Department on this matter and I expect to be in a position to submit appropriate proposals to the Government in the near future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I certainly do.  If there was a proposal designed to achieve maximum delay in taking action it would be difficult to improve on our restrictive practices code.  In the first place the examiner examines the matter and presents a report which, in turn, is presented to the commission who hold hearings on it.  They, in turn, present it to the Minister who alone can act on it, having consulted his Government colleagues.  To my mind <Col N="1519" /> that procedure is not conductive to dealing effectively with competition policy and that is precisely why we want to reform it.  I am glad to say that the proposals for this matter are with me at the moment for transmission in the near future to my Cabinet colleagues.</P>

I mentioned rationalisation of arrangements regarding inspectorates and the progressive decontrol of prices, but in view of the fact that there has been a debate on this matter in the Seanad and that there will be a debate in the Dáil, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to go into individual recommendations.

      <P>I do not propose in the circumstances to comment on the position of the company, nor would it be appropriate for me to disclose the contents of the administrator's reports.  I am unable to say at present when the company's audited accounts for 1984 will be published.</P>

      <P>My question asks something different.  I am asking about the extent of the liabilities of ICI.  I am drawing the Minister's attention to the Official Report, 27 March 1985, column 700, where the Minister, Deputy Bruton, stated that in six weeks he expected to have the extent of the liabilities available to him.  I am asking the Minister if he knows what that liability is, yes or no, and if a preliminary figure was made available to him by the administrator or by those appointed to carry out the investigation?</P>

      <P>While a six week period was mentioned by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, it has not been possible for the administrator to give an absolute and definitive assessment of the company's position.  This will only become available authoritatively when the audited accounts for 1984 are submitted.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister of State confirm or deny that the figure of liability is far in excess of what was suggested by the Minister, that is between £50 million and £120 million?  Will he say if the sudden death clauses in reinsurance contract clauses are being applied because if that is the case, the figure will not be £120 million, but could be anything up to £500 million sterling?  Will the Minister confirm or deny that these sudden death clauses in the reinsurance of ICI are being applied?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not intend to discuss any particular aspect of the administrator's business in regard to ICI at this time.  What I am saying to Deputy Flynn in a very responsible manner is that a proper, definitive and authorative examination of ICI is being carried out by auditors in respect of the audited accounts for 1984.  When the audited accounts are available they will be published in the normal way.  These audited figures will present a precise and definitive picture of the company and any other figure would not be proper for me to discuss in the House at this time because the company is under administration and is answerable to the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the English operation of the company, the examination of the figures is more complex than at first thought and I hope the audited accounts will not be delayed because of that.  These are the only authorative figures for ICI in <Col N="1524" /> administration and when they are submitted they will be published.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is playing with words.  The reinsurance recoveries of ICI and the London office are not working out to the Minister's satisfaction.  It is not good enough to give the House two commitments, as Minister Bruton did &mdash; one that we would know in six weeks and the other that the taxpayer would not be asked to bear the burden.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism the steps he has taken as a supervisory authority to improve the monitoring of insurance generally; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Mr. E. Collins Mr. E. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>As the practice of insurance &mdash; whether in the local marketplace or in the wider international markets &mdash; evolves and develops, so also must the function of supervision.</P>
      <P>I would point to several changes in monitoring procedures implemented over the past ten years.  Many of these have resulted from EC Directives &mdash; for example, more detailed annual returns to ensure compliance with harmonised solvency requirements.  Others, such as restrictions on the admissibility of particular assets for technically reserve purposes, have derived from the perceived needs of my Department as supervisor. Those improved procedures are already in place for non-life companies and are in the process of development for life undertakings.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Additionally, the application of sophisticated statistical techniques through consultancy exercises has enhanced my Department's ability to exercise their functions in this area.  In the recent debate on the Insurance (Miscellaneous <Col N="1527" /> Provisions) Bill, I referred to my Department's need for in-house actuarial expertise and I am at present addressing this issue.  To date I have initiated a programme for the computerisation of the supervisory function and this new facility will play an important role in the practical exercise of insurance supervision in the future.  I am also, of course, concerned that the primary responsibilities of directors and managers of insurance companies and the duties of auditors should be properly exercised.  Legislation to meet these concerns will be expedited.</P>

Will he finally tell the House when he will introduce legislation to control the actions of intermediaries, namely, brokers?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of issues have been raised by the Deputy, and quite rightly so.  First, in relation to my supervisory powers, my Department are not responsible for the management, accounting or auditing functions of insurance companies.  There is a grave responsibility on those who are engaged in the industry, especially the auditors, to ensure that the figures submitted to my Department are examined fully.  My Department examine in very close detail the returns made to them.  Where necessary, we bring in consultants in respect of any aspects of a company's returns which we feel need to be examined further. Minister Bruton made reference to the need to strengthen the staffing in the insurance division.  I would concur with him that there is a need for strengthening in order to ensure that the supervisory functions of the Department under the European Community's Non-life Insurance Regulations of 1976 and European Community's Life Assurance Regulations of 1984 are complied with.  We are <Col N="1529" /> becoming more complex in our administration of the insurance industry and continue to need, on a year in year out basis, to reassess the Department's needs in this area.  A submission has been made by the Minister in this matter and I would hope that we would strengthen our insurance division.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the division staff carry out their duties to a high level of professionalism and, where necessary, we buy in consultancies to examine any queries we may have in respect of aspects of companies' returns.  We are quite satisfied that we are capable of carrying out these examinations, where necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to continue my remarks in regard to the effort earlier this year of Dan-Air to provide competitive and cheaper services on the Irish Sea routes, in particular between London and Dublin and also Dublin and Cork.  In the debate in this House on 1 May I pointed out that Dan-Air had decided not to proceed with their application in the sense of formally filing or lodging it with the Minister for Communications because of things that had been said to them by Aer Lingus.  At the time and subsequently there were denials of that by Aer Lingus. On the last occasion when the matter was debated in this House, on 22 May, the Minister for Communications told the House I was wrong in substance and in fact in what I had said.  He said I should withdraw my statement and should make a personal statement and an apology.  I maintained what I had said was correct and, therefore, that there could be no question of withdrawal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since then two newspapers have taken up the matter.  Two articles appeared in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> and one in the <i>Sunday Independent</i> of 2 June.  It appears from the articles that the newspapers concerned caused inquiries to be made and as a result of those inquiries they were satisfied that what I said in the House in relation to the matter was correct.  I made further inquiries and they indicate that not alone was what I said correct but that the situation is worse, if anything, than I had originally indicated to the House.  In so far as I was in error, I was in error <Col N="1562" /> simply by understanding the extent of the problem and the threats.</P>
    <P>It now appears arising from the newspaper reports and inquiries carried out in conjunction with them that not alone was my statement of a threat to withdraw computer booking facilities for Dan-Air and to withdraw ground handling facilities correct, but that in addition two further threats were made.  I was not aware of this at the time until the further investigations were carried out.  Those threats were that if Dan-Air were to persist and make a formal application to the Minister, all co-operation on central banking arrangements for ticket payment facilities would be withdrawn from them.  In other words, they would have to go out and collect what was due to them from each individual travel agent, which is practically an impossibility.  It would be very time-consuming and it would make it scarcely worth their while.</P>
    <P>A fourth threat was apparently made, namely, that the interchangeability of tickets &mdash; a normal feature of cartel arrangements &mdash; between Aer Lingus and Dan-Air would be brought to an end. Therefore, a person holding a Dan-Air ticket could not use it on any other airline. Naturally this would cause considerable inconvenience to Dan-Air passengers.  These four threats were very serious and they caused Dan-Air to rethink their position.</P>
    <P>At the time that these four propositions were put to Dan-Air they had already got the approval of the British Civil Aviation Authority for their proposed fares as between London and Dublin.  I was not aware of that when I spoke in the House on the last occasion. I suspected that they had and I think I said it but I was not aware of it as a fact. In addition, they had got the reluctant agreement of British Airways, the other operator on the London-Dublin route and on Irish-British routes.  The agreement was given reluctantly but nevertheless it was given because they regarded it as British official policy due to the fact that the British Civil Aviation Authority had agreed.</P>
    <P>Aer Lingus were approached at that <Col N="1563" /> stage and they refused.  They then set out the four actions they would take if the proposal was proceeded with.  It appears at that stage that, because of the board decision of Dan-Air, that airline were prepared to go ahead with their proposal notwithstanding the strenuous opposition to which they were subjected.  At that stage a further approach was made in Britain by Aer Lingus &mdash; I know the name of the official who made the approach &mdash; to a senior person in Dan-Air.  He was told that if Dan-Air proceeded the consequences for everyone would be very serious, that Aer Lingus would not take it lying down and would implement the threats already made.  Then, in a conciliatory gesture, the official concerned on behalf of Aer Lingus put an offer of settlement to Dan-Air.  He said if they would withdraw their proposals for cheaper flights Aer Lingus would allow an additional daily flight to Dan-Air from Gatwick to Dublin.  From what I can gather the board of Dan-Air discussed the matter in the light of that verbal communication.  Of their nature, all these communications tend to be verbal because things of this kind are never put down on paper.  The Dan-Air board decided that in the circumstances where they were reliant on Aer Lingus for handling and computer facilities they would not proceed at the moment with what they had intended to do.</P>
    <P>Two newspapers in three articles checked out the situation and they have borne out what I said.  We should look for a moment at the consequences of that scenario, because many people in this county believe it is the Minister for Communications and his Department who make the decisions on who goes where, on the price and so on.  We are told that constantly but the reality is very much otherwise.  The reality is that decisions as to who will fly a particular route, what capacity they will have and what fares they will charge are decided between the IATA cartel airlines behind closed doors at their private meetings for this purpose, which meetings they hold twice a year. The Minister and the Department have <Col N="1564" /> little or no say in the matter in reality in spite of what they might think or say. These kinds of arrangements, commercial threats and offerings of routes without reference to the Minister or the Department to settle disputes are on the face of it clear breaches of a number of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome, in particular Articles 85, 86 and 90.  I am no expert in this field but it seems very likely to be in breach of British anti-trust law. In connection with that it is worthwhile adverting to the progress of the case taken by the liquidator of Laker Airlines against British Airways and a number of other IATA cartel airlines for conspiracy to put Laker out of business.  A substantial offer for damages in settlement has been made by British Airways to try to settle the case.  It was interesting to see reported in the <i>Financial Times</i> on Tuesday that the Midland Bank was added as a defendant in those proceedings, although one might have thought they were at a distance from the original proceedings.</P>
    <P>The Minister informed me in a written reply last week that he is facing action in the European Court under Article 169 of the Treaty of Rome for failing to give the Commission information which, in fairness to him, he may not have been able to obtain in relation to pooling arrangements between airlines and certain routes out of Ireland which are dominated by the cartel arrangements of the IATA airlines.  The Dan-Air case will hardly improve the Minister's position in the prosecution which has been brought against him under Article 169.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>No, it is seven.  Ireland is one and there are six others.  They are the more conservative administrations in air transport terms in Europe.  They do not include countries like Britain, Holland and Germany.  The Minister should be under no illusion as to where British law stands on the application of the anti-trust legislation to aviation matters.  He should remember that the considerable desire of British Airways to settle with <Col N="1565" /> Laker before the privatisation of British Airways is not due to British Airways wanting to make friends with their own rival but rather because the market has decided that British Airways owe Laker a lot on money because of the way they conspired to put him out of business. British Airways will be privatised for far less if the Laker case is not resolved before British Airways is brought on the market.</P>
      <P>There can be no doubt that the Dan-Air case, which I brought to light here and which it transpires is now more serious than I originally thought, has certain similarities with the Laker case and based on the precedent of the Laker case which British Airways are engaged in almost daily efforts to settle, Dan-Air would be likely to succeed if it took a similar case in the British courts against Aer Lingus.  That is regrettable but nevertheless it is the position.  The British courts would be the appropriate venue for any such action because the threats and the offers involved were all made in the UK.  In all these circumstances and in order to obviate further difficulties and loss to the economy as a whole, the Minister should contact Dan-Air directly and discuss and accept their proposals or some variation of them which could be implemented at the earliest possible time.</P>
      <P>Sometimes it is suggested that I or other people who have a closer connection than I have with the aviation industry are inaccurate when we say from time to time that the real decisions are not made by the Minister of the Department but somewhere else.  There might be people who would think that it could not be the case that a Minister and a Department established for the purpose of regulating air routes, air capacity, air fares and charges would abdicate their responsibilities and allow the real shots to be called by someone else.  However, that is the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As evidence of that I do not just present my assertion or the assertion of many thousands of people involved in aviation but internal evidence from Aer Lingus about how they function in regard to these matters.  This evidence is the best <Col N="1566" /> possible because it is the evidence of Aer Lingus and is an internal Aer Lingus memo dated 6 July 1982 addressed to PIAM from GIAS.  These letters stand for particular functions or titles within Aer Lingus.  This memorandum, together with a lot more, have come into my possession and that of other people as a result of a High Court case between Avair and Aer Lingus.  The High Court made an order of discovery of various documents and communications relating to matters that were relevant to the points in dispute between Avair and Aer Lingus.  Accordingly, this document has now become a public document.  I do not want to be accused of having obtained it in an improper way.  It is on record as a result of High Court proceedings.  I will quote three paragraphs from it.  It bears out what I have been saying for some time.  It states:</P>
    <P>I want to convey to you my disagreement with the decision to oppose the granting of traffic rights on Cross Channel routes to minor UK (P) points to an independent Irish carrier; and to express concern at the implication.  As I see it the logical outcome of such a course of action would be to oppose everything that moves (other than Aer Lingus), and we would soon lose our credibility and our power to influence the Minister's decisions.</P>
    <P>As you know, the Government Department responsible for aviation in Ireland, (currently the DoT) has never found it necessary to establish a licensing authority, but has relied largely on the informed comments supplied by Aer Lingus.  As the person responsible for conveying these comments to the officials concerned over the past ten years or more, and indeed of formulating the comments (with, of course, management approval where necessary), I have built up a good working relationship with those concerned, and a good feel for &ldquo;what we can get away with&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Our comments have, naturally, ranged from &ldquo;no objection&rdquo; through a considerable range of light, medium</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1567" /> and heavy objections to total opposition. The rapport, to which I refer, and which has been built up, ensures that when Aer Lingus have real and genuine cause for concern, the Department officials are on our side, and if I may say so we have had more than our share of success (our failures being largely for political reasons outside our control).</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>And I regret to have to say that it was no different for a number of years before then.  As I said here on a previous occasion, I was a Government Minister for eight years and I cannot recall any time during those eight years these matters coming before the Government. I have no reason to believe that the position is otherwise now.  That memorandum in its tone and content sums up precisely the reality of Irish aviation policy.  It is as we suspected and that is the proof.  The matter is very serious and very regrettable.  Unfortunately when one seeks to dissect and analyse the situation as I do, the exercise is seen in personalised terms.  It is not considered in the context of whether it is right or wrong, of whether it is in the national interest or otherwise.  Instead, it is regarded totally in terms of whether one is for or against Aer Lingus.  The national interest is equated with Aer Lingus at all times. Therefore, if one is against the way Aer Lingus operate in respect of certain matters, one is therefore considered to be <Col N="1568" /> against the Irish national interest and since no one wishes to be seen in that light, very few speak about the issue.</P>
      <P>There was a debate on the Second Stage of the Bill on 27 June last year and at that time a number of backbenchers on both sides of the House but particularly on the Government side spoke after I had spoken in fairly broad agreement with what I had said.  I recall one of them describing the whole matter as a can of worms which was then being opened up and which needed to be opened up.  Several others spoke in a similar vein.  Unfortunately we have only had some hours of debate so far on Committee Stage but with the exception of one or two backbenchers who spoke for a couple of minutes, no other spoke to indicate whether he was for or against the Bill.  I understand the position to be that they had been told not to speak.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It is unlikely that they have changed their views since they spoke last year.  However, they have not been speaking despite the degree of public interest that has been engendered in this whole area and despite the fact that the problems associated with this area are far greater now than would have been the case 12 months ago.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The situation which has been made clear by the clarification of the Dan-Air dispute and the proof of the thinking in regard to aviation matters is evidenced by the memorandum I have read from.  This should help Members of the House and the public also to put into some better perspective than has been the case up to now what should be our objectives in relation to aviation policy generally.  No country in Europe has a greater vested interest in ease of and in freedom of access than we have.  Therefore, the official policy we should follow is the policy of trying to generate the highest degree possible of ease of access because if we do not have ease of access to and from Ireland we stand to lose more than any other country.  That should have been <Col N="1569" /> obvious for some time but for the reasons I indicated in the earlier part of my remarks today we do not pursue that kind of policy.  Consequently, we put ourselves in the ridiculous situation where we limit access to this island very severely by limited capacity and by some of the highest fares in Europe, if not in the world.</P>
    <P>From time to time we receive offers of the provision of competitive non-cartel fares from cost efficient non-cartel airlines. There are two on the table at the moment.  One is the Dan-Air one which has been withdrawn, temporarily I hope, and the other is a proposal from Virgin Airways who would envisage a return fare between London and Dublin of £72. It is in our interest to do business with these kinds of airlines.  We are in the extraordinary situation as is indicated by the Aer Rianta press release published in last Monday's newspapers, of having no growth, taking one year with another, in the use of our airports.  The only airport in which there has been growth recently is Shannon in respect of which there was a worthwhile increase last year.  This was due to the much more competitive situation on the Atlantic routes where the IATA cartel has broken down to a large extent.  As Aer Rianta point out constantly, due to the unattractive fare structure there is no growth in either Dublin or Cork airports.  There are fewer people using those airports than was the case six or eight years ago.</P>
    <P>As Aer Rianta point out further, we are almost unique in Europe in that respect. Our national interest cannot be served by a continuation of that no growth scene when there is growth everywhere else in Europe.  We simply cannot continue along that path.  If we do, we are keeping people out of here, we are harming our tourist industry and we are harming our manufacturing industry because of the difficulties that exist in relation to cargo and business travel.  The reaction of the Minister and of the Government has been to introduce the legislation which has very intermittently been debated on, I think, three occasions in the past 12 months.  That is running counter to everything that is happening <Col N="1570" /> in the world elsewhere and to all the developments in Europe, at Commission level and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>I quoted in the House &mdash; I think Deputy Wilson also quoted &mdash; some of the things that Commissioner Sutherland had to say in regard to trying to open up and create competition between airlines in Europe.  I recommended at the time that the Government here would be well advised, that it would be in our national interests, to follow the line recommended by Commissioner Sutherland.  Since then I see in the current issue of <i>Community Report</i> for June 1985 an article based on remarks made by the Transport Commissioner, Mr. Stanley Clinton Davis, at the Labour Party Conference in Cork &mdash; which he attended as a fraternal delegate &mdash; at which he advised very strongly the Irish Government to liberalise their approach to air transport, to follow the example of certain European Governments.  I quote:</P>
    <P>He told a news conference during his visit that many air fares in Europe were grossly unfair to customers.</P>
    <P>He said that the Commission did not want to replace the present system with an open skies policy on the US model, but it was pressing for more realistic charges.</P>
    <P>There had been resistance to change from some airlines and governments but he pointed to agreements between British, Dutch and German airlines to show what could be done...</P>
    <P>Mr. Clinton Davis said the central aim of the Commission's proposals was to remove the various veto rights which governments or airlines could exercise over the setting of fares.  If these were removed then innovative airlines would be in a better position to bring about the changes which are necessary to benefit customers.</P>
    <P>The next 18 months or so would be crucial.  The Commission was prepared to negotiate towards an agreement, but if member governments were unwilling to introduce the necessary flexibility then the Commission would have to act.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1571" /> He is the second Commissioner within the past month to have said exactly the same thing because, in substance, that is what Commissioner Sutherland has been saying also.  What are we doing in response to it?  We are doing the direct opposite to what they are asking us to do. We are going back even further into the old protectionist mode even though we see it breaking up all round us.  We are doing it at great detriment to our own interests.  It is worth looking at those who find it difficult to support the present policy and are critical of the traditional policy which is now being copper-fastened in the legislation before the House.  They are a wide-ranging list of people who are affected by it, or represent those affected by it, one way or the other.  They include people like Bord Fáilte, very much opposed to the traditional aviation policy here, Aer Rianta who time and again make statements making it clear that they are very much opposed to the traditional policy here, various tourist interests, like the Irish Hotels Federation, and various other people who speak for tourism who see quite clearly, as most of us do who think about it, that a change in policy would enormously benefit our tourist industry and economy generally.</P>
    <P>The Confederation of Irish Industry in the last couple of months issued a statement to this effect, the Association of the Chambers of Commerce in Ireland who are very much opposed to the present policy, and so on.  There are large numbers of such bodies.  Still the overall interests of the economy at large are subsidiary to the institutional interests of one organisation.  That is wrong.  I am not anti-national in saying that.  I am pro-national in saying it.  I am pro-national in saying that we must not allow the institutional interests of one organisation to stand in the way of national economic growth, but that is what we are doing. The Minister now realises he is on the wrong track.  I know it is awkward for him to back-track from where he started, but he would win a great deal of respect were he to do so.  He should give very</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1572" /> serious consideration to that possibility.</P>
    <P>I want to point out one consequence that is overlooked very much by people who talk about these matters, one consequence of the maintainence of the cartel arrangement on the Irish scene between Britain and the Republic of Ireland. There is, of course, no cartel between London and Belfast.  Even though Belfast is further from London then is Dublin, the fares between Belfast and London are half or less than half of those between Dublin and London.  One of the consequences of maintaining the extremely high fares constantly being described by people in the industry as among the highest in the world &mdash; between London and Dublin at £200, between London and Cork at £232 and between London and Shannon at £232 &mdash; is not simply to prop up Aer Lingus and give them very substantial profits, as they have, on these routes but equally to prop up British Airways, giving them very substantial excess profits on these routes, enabling them to operate low and competitive fares in other places where they are subject to competition such as London-Belfast, London-Glasgow, and so on.</P>
    <P>It is forgotten by people who seek to argue that this is being done in the institutional interests of Aer Lingus that Aer Lingus are in a cartel pool on the Anglo-Irish routes and that British Airways get half of everything that goes into that pool. This, being the inevitable result of a European system of air cartels which we go to such lengths to maintain in this country but which the British themselves are not prepared to maintain on other routes, must be causing British Airways to laugh all the way to their stockbrokers when they consider the impact on their privatised share price of the resolutely-maintained official Irish policy and the consequences of the Bill at present before this House.</P>
    <P>I wonder whether any Minister has come into Dáil Éireann before to introduce a measure which he says is in the national interest, when with a minute's thought it would be obvious that half the revenue from the excessive charging for passengers, freight and mail on routes <Col N="1573" /> between Britain and Ireland, would accrue as super-normal profits for British Airways.  It has been estimated by cost efficient airlines that it is possible to operate the Dublin-London run for £100 or less, return fare.  That is half the existing standard cartel charge.  That means that there is a degree of overcharging on that route of about £100 per passenger, where the full fare is paid.  That figure is borne out by the EC Cascade studies which indicate that on average a charter type airline could provide the same service as a scheduled operator on the same route for between 34 per cent and 37 per cent of the scheduled charge.</P>
    <P>We have the extraordinary situation that British Airways are benefiting enormously from the level of charges which are being maintained under the cartel operation because they are getting 50 per cent of everything in the pool and as between Dublin-London, Dublin-Shannon, Dublin-Cork, everything is going into the pool.  Would the Minister seriously consider that?  Is it in the national interest that half of all that money is unnecessarily going into the coffers of British Airways at a time when British Airways are doing all they can to maximise their profits because they are about to be privatised in the next few months?  It is a ridiculous situation and if one thinks about it it is quite indefensible. Half of the high profits on this route are going to British Airways even when Aer Lingus carry more than 50 per cent of the passengers on the route, as they do from time to time.  I would be interested to hear how the Minister justifies that.  Is not the truth of the matter that British Airways can offer very competitive fares on other routes, domestic routes such as Belfast and Glasgow and international routes such as Amsterdam and various German destinations because they have, among other things to fall back on, the supernormal profits they obtain from their cartel booking arrangement with Aer Lingus on the Anglo-Irish routes? I do not grudge the people of Belfast, Glasgow or Amsterdam the fact that although they are further from London than Dublin&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on average fares are about half of what we in the Republic have to pay and those in Britain have to pay to get to the Republic, but we should not perpetuate that system because it is largely at the expense of our economy. We should not be prepared to tolerate it. Whether or not the Minister likes it or whether or not Aer Lingus like it, big changes will come.  I quoted at length the views of two members of the European Commission and the views of various officials of the Commission.  Changes will be made and we should take advantage of the situation and not fight this futile rearguard action against our own interest and the interest of other countries and other competing airlines to retain what has now largely gone out of date.</P>
      <P>Members of the House or members of the public who are interested should read an article which appeared in <i>The Irish Times</i> on 16 October, 1984 which was written by Mr. Martin Dully, the chief executive of Aer Rianta.  In the article he discussed in some detail the damage that has been done to our economy and to the overall national interest by the pursuit of present policies and he advocated change, broadly the kind of change that I am advocating, and he outlined in some detail how it would benefit our economy. There are phrases in that article which are unexpected but they show the extent of his concern and his feeling of frustration. The chief executive is the person in the best position to judge the effects of aviation policy and the damage being done by it to the country, because he is in the centre of operating our airports on an almost daily basis.  That article is well worth consideration and I hope the people will give it consideration and will come to realise that in trying to bring about change in the policies being pursued I and many others who agree with me are doing so in the national interest and because we are annoyed and frustrated at seeing no growth in incoming air tourists.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputies for their contributions to this debate.  I will start with Deputy O'Malley's contribution.  The allegations made by Deputy O'Malley are very serious and they are all the more serious because they come from a Deputy who is a highly respected Member of this House.  The Deputy made allegations during the course of the debate on the Air Transport Bill which were not only denied by me but were denied by statements from Dan-Air and Aer Lingus. The Deputy has repeated his allegations this afternoon and has gone further.  So far as I have been able to check what he has said, almost everything is untrue.  It does not stand up.  It does not relate to the facts but in view of the fact that the Deputy has made these allegations again and I am sure the Deputy is not deliberately trying to mislead the House, I will arrange for Deputy O'Malley to see with me the chairman of Aer Lingus and, if necessary, the chairman of Dan-Air to <Col N="1576" /> clarify this once and for all.  It would be most regrettable if Deputy O'Malley were to come in here and state as a categorical fact what turns out to be untrue.</P>
      <P>I can deal with some of the points he made.  He said in the course of his assertions here this afternoon that Dan-Air had been threatened with being removed from the computer system.  This is not only not true but it could not be true.  I am informed that Dan-Air have independent access to the computer system and they could not be threatened with being cut out of that system.  Moreover, most of Dan-Air's traffic &mdash; the great bulk of it, I am told &mdash; is UK originated and, therefore, the computer which would be of most concern to them would be the UK computer which is not under Aer Lingus control.  Secondly, Deputy O'Malley said that Dan-Air had got approval already from the UK authorities, something that he did not know what he spoke the last time in this House.  I had officials check just a while ago what he said here and I am informed that Dan-Air not only did not get approval but did not seek approval from the UK authorities. Therefore, the question of approval never arose.  Obviously, we can check this.  If it turns out that Deputy O'Malley has come in yet again on the question of air transport and made untrue assertions&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I want to know the truth as much as he does.  Having had these matters checked, I am told that what he said is not factual.  In the course of debate over the last year Deputy O'Malley has made a number of allegations which turned out not to be true.  He made many of them in this House in the course of debate, especially on Committee Stage of the Air Transport Bill, and any time I go to rebut him I am told it is a personal attack.  I am not attacking Deputy O'Malley. I have a great deal of admiration and respect for Deputy O'Malley.  What he says is taken seriously, but I must say that in the course of that debate, in moving an amendment that we insert the word &ldquo;maximum&rdquo; so that the control I would have be only over maximum fares he said that this was a power which many other countries had.  I asked him to name one country.  He could not.</P>

      <P>It will be pursued.  He alleged in the course of his contribution today that the Government backbenchers were silent on this matter.  That is categorically not true.  In the course of inquiries, research and discussion on this matter every Member of this House has been persuaded of the wisdom of the Air Transport Bill except one, Deputy O'Malley.  He is isolated, a lone ranger jumping imaginary fences in the debate on Committee Stage.  It seems that Deputy O'Malley may be falling into a trap of making wilder and wilder allegations to justify his wrong stance on this Bill.  I have made the offer and I want to know the facts.  If there is any doubt whatever about any of the facts or anything that I am saying &mdash; because I am saying what I am saying after checking and getting advice&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have had these checked but the Deputy is still making allegations which I am told are not factual. I want to establish this once and for all and we can see then whose credibility will be lost.  I do not propose to deal any longer with what Deputy O'Malley has said.  I have made my offer and I will pursue that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the course of this debate many points have been raised by Deputies and I will seek to answer as many of these as possible in the time available.  Deputy Wilson raised the question of road freight transport on own account.  As regards the proposals to allow own account operators to carry for reward, most people seem to miss the point that the own account operator will not be allowed to carry for reward unless he has a licence to carry for reward and he will not get a licence to carry for reward unless he satisfies criteria identical with those which apply to the person who wants to take up haulage as an occupation.  The purpose of this approach is to ensure that own account undertakings with spare mileage on their vehicles and willing or able to allow that <Col N="1579" /> mileage to be used for haulage are not prevented from doing so by restrictive legislation.  The fears expressed about this proposed development are much exaggerated.  I am conscious also that law enforcement in relation to road freight transport is a cause of concern to licensed hauliers.  The questions that arise relate not only to transport law in relation to vehicle standards, taxation and behaviour in traffic.  The enforcement question is uppermost in my mind and I am giving very serious consideration to the representations I have received on the subject.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked about the relationship between CIE and GAC and also about the export of buses.  The relationship between these two concerns is a matter of day-to-day activity as far as CIE are concerned, and the Deputy is well aware that Dáil questions in that area are not in order.  Moreover, GAC are a private sector concern for which I have no responsibility.  I am not in a position to give the Deputy the information he seeks any more than I would be in the case of any other supplier with whom CIE might have an arrangement.</P>
    <P>Like Deputy Wilson, I have been hearing allegations about unwarranted price cutting by CIE road freight.  People ought to clear their minds about this type of complaint.  In the transport area competitive behaviour by CIE is very much to be welcomed.  A vigorous commercial approach by CIE must be beneficial to transport users and also to the taxpayer who must invest so much in support of CIE services.  As far as alleged unfair practices in the freight transport area are concerned, I remind the Deputy that direct subvention is not payable in respect of road freight transport and I am determined to ensure that indirect subvention will not occur.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson asked about CIE pensions. The intention is to supplement normal social welfare payments so that generally CIE workers receive a pension equivalent to two thirds of their wages when retired.  The level of these pensions is broadly comparable to pensions payable elsewhere in the public sector which <Col N="1580" /> provide for maximum of half pay plus lump sum or two thirds pay.  Let me say again that I am delighted at being able to increase the maximum pension from £16 to £34.  Many people who have given a lifetime of service need an increase of that sort.</P>
    <P>On Deputy Wilson's question regarding UTC, at present 125 junctions are operating with urban traffic control facilities. Dublin Corporation anticipate that preparatory work on the remaining 66 junctions will be completed by September 1985.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get the number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>There are 125 junctions already in operation and the preparatory work on 66 junctions will be completed by September 1985.  It is intended that between September 1985 and mid-1986 all phases of the UTC system incorporating elements such as Bus Transit automatic counting etc. will become fully operational.</P>
      <P>Deputy Wilson remarked on the so-called monopoly position of CIE.  It is difficult to consider seriously the suggestion that CIE, who are beset on all sides by competition from other professional carriers, own account freight transporters and the private car, are enjoying anything like a real monopoly.  Certainly I would not wish CIE to enjoy any unjustified degree of monopoly or protection which would give then an unfair advantage over other operators.  I can assure the Deputy that CIE are not in any sense afraid of competition or afraid to operate competitively. It is important to make this clear. Competition is a healthy thing but we will not get very much competition on those many routes which are intrinsically loss-making and CIE have to bear the cost of these.  There will be plenty of people who will go for the nice, juicy route &mdash; and the same holds for air transport.  People will be interested in the high volume routes but not in the low volume, off-peak routes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Kelly also referred to monopolies and dealt at length with the whole philosophy of monopolies from various <Col N="1581" /> standpoints.  He raised questions as to whether State monopolies were justified in a situation where they were costing the taxpayer so much.  I regard that as quite a legitimate point to raise.  It is fair to point out, however, that most of these services are not monopolies in the strict sense.  They have to compete with alternative systems of transport and communications. I expect the fundamental concern of Deputy Kelly is that the State-sponsored bodies should be operating fully efficiently.  That is my concern too. It is my abiding passion because I believe in State companies and State enterprise and believe it can be and ought to be efficient.</P>
    <P>The transport policy document to which I referred in my opening statement will be raising the general issue of monopolises and State ownership, and the question of whether changes made will be reviewed in the light of the public debate.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson criticised me for keeping my comments on my general responsibilities in regard to semi-State bodies to the end of my statement and inferred that in so doing I was relegating these bodies to an inferior position.  I can only conclude that Deputy Wilson is under some misapprehension.  Most of my statement deals with the activities of the State-sponsored bodies under my control.  I made comments which were a statement of my general philosophy in regard to State-sponsored bodies and I believe that having dealt with the activities of the individual bodies it was an appropriate point at which to give overall comments.</P>
    <P>Questions in regard to shipping were raised by Deputy Wilson and Deputy Kelly.  The position in regard to redundancy compensation for the former employees of Irish Shipping Limited is a matter for the liquidator to be dealt with within the terms of the Redundancy Payments Acts.  There are no funds available from which compensation payments other than statutory redundancy entitlements can be made.  The position of the former Irish Shipping Limited employees is no different from that of other workers who have found themselves redundant in <Col N="1582" /> similar circumstances.  It is a most tragic consequence of the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited that the employees and their families are innocent victims of the situation.  I am saddened that the legal and other sensitivities in this area preclude me from doing anything else to help these unfortunate people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Workers in other situations did get much more than the statutory payment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson mentioned the £66,000 gross, or £27,000 net, which was paid to the late Mr. O'Neill when he retired as chairman.  He had a contract of employment which had two years to run and he was paid his salary until the end of that term so that he would go.  That was done after a lot of heart searching and advice as the best way and this was before we realised the full extent of the problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Wilson will know that all these cases are quite different and that bankruptcy law precludes any preference for one creditor over another.  It is a regrettable fact about which I am very sad.</P>
      <P>The payment of wages due to the employees of Irish Shipping Limited is a matter for the liquidator of the company. The employees are preferential creditors of the company in relation to wages due to them and in the event of wages remaining unpaid they would have first call on the assets of the company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The matter of Irish Shipping pensioners was raised during the course of the debate on the Supplementary Estimate. My colleague, the Minister of State, explained on that occasion that when the Government were considering the restoration of the <i>ex gratia</i> pension element, the possibility of extending this concession to all pensioners of the company was considered.  Due to the financial and legal sensitivities involved it has not been found possible to do this, however much we would like to do so.  The present <Col N="1583" /> position in relation to World War II pensioners is that final arrangements are being made for early payment of their pensions.</P>
    <P>Regarding the question of a strategic fleet, I would refer Deputies to my statement to Dáil Éireann on 14 November 1984 in relation to the appointment of a liquidator to Irish Shipping Limited.  I then indicated that the Government had given careful consideration to the question of a strategic fleet and were satisfied that the winding up of Irish Shipping Limited was not a cause for concern in terms of our current strategic needs.  I have recently initiated a review of maritime transport policy in my Department and it will address the question of a strategic fleet, among other matters.</P>
    <P>The question of what to do with the 75 per cent shareholding of Irish Shipping Limited in Oceanbank Developments Limited, which owns Irish Continental Line, is now a matter for the liquidator. Irish Continental Line is, in turn, the owner of Belfast Car Ferries.  The 25 per cent shareholding held by AIB in Oceanbank is, so far as I am aware, unchanged since the liquidation of Irish Shipping Limited.</P>
    <P>Irish Continental Line is a successful and profit making company even if it has been affected to some extent by the recent recession in tourism.  There is, to my mind, no reason why it should not continue as a going concern.  I do not foresee its being forced into liquidation or receivership.  Presumably the liquidator's objective will be to dispose of ISL's shareholding in the company to the best advantage of the creditors of Irish Shipping Limited.  Certainly the Government would be concerned that there should be an Ireland-Continent ferry service but there is no reason why such a service cannot be provided by a private enterprise company operating profitably.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson inquired about the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> The acquisition of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> was funded by a consortium of Japanese leasing companies and the vessel was operated by Irish Shipping Limited under a bareboat charter which <Col N="1584" /> was fully guaranteed by the Minister for Finance.  The total amount guaranteed by the Minister at current exchange rates is approximately £39 million.</P>
    <P>I am at present considering proposals regarding the future of the <i>Irish Spruce.</i> I have been approached by the Irish Marine Services Co-operative Society Limited, which was set up by former Irish Shipping staff, regarding a possible contract for the management and chartering out of the <i>Irish Spruce</i> and this aspect is one of those under consideration.  In the meantime the vessel cannot be moved without the agreement of the Japanese owners.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson also mentioned the possible contract for the carriage of coal to Moneypoint for the ESB.  I wish to make it clear that there was no such contract. I understand that some negotiations had taken place between Irish Shipping Limited and the ESB but these negotiations were not concluded.  There was no contract.</P>
    <P>The B &amp; I company concluded a pooling agreement with Sealink some months ago.  The arrangements between the companies are for 1985 initially and are to be reviewed later this year.  The rationalisation arrangement is a matter falling within the day-to-day management of B &amp; I and I do not interfere in such matters. I understand that the company have discussed the arrangements with tourism interests who sought such discussions.</P>
    <P>Deputy Wilson referred to the arrangement under which a consultancy firm providing the full time services of Mr. Alex Spain were engaged to bring about a recovery in the finances of B &amp; I The general deterioration in the company's finances had been a cause of concern to me and the Government and led us to the conclusion that a fresh approach was needed.  As a result of many inquiries, we came to the view that his extensive financial and management experience fitted Mr. Alex Spain in a particular way to undertake this onerous task.  It was also a factor that he could call on the expertise and advice of his highly experienced partners in his new consultancy firm.  There is no criticism involved of the way in which the <Col N="1585" /> former chairman and his board carried out their duties; I and the Government were, however, satisfied that a new approach was required.</P>
    <P>I have already paid ample testimony to the commitment of the outgoing chairman who was acting in a part time capacity and now that the job has been made full time the nature of the appointment has changed.  However, the services of Mr. Boland will be retained in the public sector in another important appointment which will be announced shortly.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden raised the question of the <i>rationale</i> behind adjustments in postal tariffs on 25 February last.  There has been no increase in the normal letter rate since 1982 and there will be none this year.  I decided, very soon after coming to office, that there would be no increases and that our policy must be to keep our postage rates steady and to go for volume growth.  That strategy is beginning to pay off and the adjustments in postal charges on 25 February last involved maintaining unchanged for the third year in a row the existing basic 22p and 26p letter rates, as well as a reduction in letter rates to other EC member countries.  Increases, where they occurred, were concentrated in letters over 20 grammes, non-standard items and parcels.  The Postal Service User's Council, on which there are representatives of industry, services etc., were consulted in advance about the adjustment and were in agreement with the approach proposed by An Post.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden also raised the question of capital investment requirements of An Post.  The provision in the legislation relating to making moneys available to An Post for capital purposes was a purely enabling one and did not reflect a measured assessment of the real capital investment needs of the company. Because a sum of £50 million was mentioned in the Bill, some people seemed to think that that money should be spent on An Post.  However, that is not the case.  For example, when you say that the borrowing limit of a company is a sum of £200 million, that does not mean that that sum will be granted and it is the same in <Col N="1586" /> regard to An Post.  Some newspapers in the last few days also raised this point saying that we did not invest as much as we said we would.  We have a duty to the taxpayer to make prudent investments as and when required, taking into account the finances of the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leyden also inquired about the extension of the post bus service.  To date, the post bus service in west Clare in 1982 has been successful even if the contribution to the finances of An Post has been limited.  This experience is not, however, an adequate base for coming to general conclusions and experimentation with further post bus services in other suitable areas is essential.  Further areas have been identified as meriting consideration and the Department of Communications are pursuing the question of their inclusion on an experimental basis with An Post.</P>
    <P>Deputies Wilson and Leyden referred to the contributions to be paid to the Exchequer by BTE and claimed that it was unfair to require BTE to make them and that their financial position did not allow of these contributions being made.</P>
    <P>From the outset, it was never intended that BTE should get handouts from the Exchequer.  It was always the intention that telephone users would have to pay for the service and that the general taxpayer would not have to subsidise it.  That was the position over the years.  When it was decided in April 1982 to convert £355 million Exchequer debt capital to equity, this was done, as I explained in my introductory statement, on the basis that dividends would be paid to the Exchequer by the company over a period of ten years from vesting that would equate with the costs continuing to be incurred over that period in servicing the debt in question. I am sure that Deputy Wilson will agree that what I said in my opening speech and am saying now is accurate.</P>
    <P>It was envisaged at that time that the company would become profitable quickly and could pay the dividends needed to service the capital.  That has not happened and is not likely to be the case for a few years.  The Exchequer <Col N="1587" /> would, therefore, be continuing to service the capital without getting compensatory payments from BTE, which would involve extra taxation.  The Government decided that, instead of levying extra taxes, BTE should provide money that would enable the capital to be serviced and the contributions are designed to do that.</P>
    <P>BTE will, as I explained this morning, be compensated fully for these payments on a present net value basis by allowing equivalent credits against the Exchequer debt taken over by the company at vesting. In time, the contributions will not cost the company anything and it is important that this should be clearly understood.  BTE will be returning losses in the short term but, as they move shortly from the development to the consolidation stage, that position should change quickly.  The company have a very bright future, given good management and the willing co-operation of all involved.</P>
    <P>There is, therefore, nothing sinister or unfair in the requirement that the company should make these contributions, In a better financial climate, they could probably have been avoided but none of those who criticised the decision to require these contributions indicated how they would service the debt involved and there is an onus on them to do so.  I did not make any charges against the Opposition in regard to these contributions and I do not see that this arises. However, the Opposition are criticising the fact that contributions were called for and are trying to make political capital out of it.  How would the Opposition finance the Exchequer debt if the contributions were not required?</P>
    <P>I am sorry that I have not had time to deal with all the points raised but I will endeavour to write to Deputies regarding those which I did not mention.  Deputy Leyden talked about bias in RTE programmes and I think he specifically mentioned &ldquo;Morning Ireland&rdquo;.  As he knows, the Minister has no role in the contents of programmes or in regard to bias and that is the way it should be.  I also regret <Col N="1588" /> his remarks about some members of the incoming authority, all of whom are highly respected and worthy people.</P>
    <P>I wish to thank Deputies for their comments and indeed for their criticisms. Some have substance but others were unfair and unjustified.  This is a year of major change for transport.  There will be at least ten major transport Bills, four are already before the House and two more will be introduced over the next couple of weeks.  At the end of the year, when all that legislation is passed &mdash; as well as the publication of the Green Paper on a national transport policy &mdash; my belief is that we will end up with a vibrant, efficient transport system.</P>

      <P>Deputy O'Kennedy has been given permission to ask the Minister for Finance if the Government propose to nominate solicitors in private practice to act as solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1589" />
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am obliged to the Chair for allowing me to raise this very important matter dealing with some very fundamental issues in the legal arrangements in the office of the solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners.  Everybody will recognise that we are very anxious to ensure that in every State office, including that of the solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners, the maximum degree of efficiency and productivity obtains.  The fact is that due to the burden of work that has been imposed on that office, and all offices of the Revenue Commissioners, particularly in the last two years due to the increasing appetite of the Government for tax, there has been a backlog of cases as there has been in all branches of the Revenue Commissioners.  Because of this the Department of the Public Service are in the process of conducting, if not concluding, an examination of the effectiveness of the Revenue Commissioners generally but, in this instance, the solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners.  In fact, they have been pursuing this examination for some time.  My information is that the report from the Minister for the Public Service in respect of the practices and efficiency of the office of the solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners will be available fairly shortly to the Minister for Finance.</P>
      <P>We all recognise that it is necessary to do this important job but I am anxious to know if the Government propose, in advance of that examination being concluded, to appoint solicitors in private practice outside the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to do work that exclusively is the role of the Revenue Commissioners and their solicitors.  I acknowledge that the efficiency in the office is not all that it might be in view of the importance of the work and I should like to give the reasons why this is the case.  I understand that at present there are seven or eight solicitors and 16 law clerks conducting the business of the Revenue Commissioners in the office.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I invite any Member to consider how adequate such a number is having regard <Col N="1590" /> to the burden of work they have to discharge on behalf of the nation and the taxpayer.  There are many private offices in this city with much more professional personnel than seven or eight solicitors and 16 law clerks.  When one considers that the office of solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners is confined to that number, is it any wonder that we have had delays, frustration and, as will be recognised by the staff, inadequacies in terms of processing proceedings for the courts?</P>
    <P>I understand that those 16 law clerks deal on average with something of the order of 600 to 700 files each.  Any system that would pretend one could deal efficiently with that number of files is ignoring the reality.  I understand that the most basic office equipment is not available to the law clerks, and, perhaps, also to the solicitors.  In this day and age we find that while most of us use dictaphones even in this House that does not often claim to be well equipped with modern facilities, the law clerks in the Revenue Commissioners are confined to writing manuscript letters in respect of the legal proceedings being considered.  They do not have the facility of an adequate number of tape recorders to help them to discharge their responsibilities.</P>
    <P>In the light of all that, and the failure to provide adequate facilities, staff and overtime, it is not surprising if it is suggested that they are not coping adequately with the huge extra burden of work that has been transmitted, particularly in the last two years, from the Revenue Commissioners to the solicitors' office to take legal proceedings.  In our dealings with the public most of us know of the increase in demands or threats of legal proceedings against business people who may not have sent in returns of VAT or PAYE. They have become a constant feature. For that reason the least we should do is to provide the office charged with responsibility with adequate staff, facilities and, if necessary, adequate overtime.</P>
    <P>I should like to give some examples of the position that obtains.  Apparently, no overtime is available in the office.  I understand that after a question was <Col N="1591" /> raised in the House by Deputy De Rossa or Deputy Mac Giolla last January about delays in bringing proceedings and overdue tax &mdash; it may be a coincidence &mdash; there were 14 consecutive weeks of overtime for staff.  Up to then they had been told that overtime was out of the question. That practice discontinued about two weeks ago.  Overtime has been curtailed again and, as a consequence of that, and of the lack of staff, facilities and professionals, the office of the solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners is not able to cope adequately with the work. That office cannot be blamed for that position.  There has been a considerable increase in the amount of work being referred by the Revenue Commissioners to that office and that is not surprising.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to the reason why the increase has occurred.  In the last two years total tax revenue alone increased by 40 per cent, from £4,053 million at the end of 1982 to a projected £5,704 million this year.  We are all aware that the figure I have given for those years does not reflect the growth in the black economy &mdash; people who are trying to evade their taxes.  I am not talking about avoiding taxes because that cannot be made liable to legal sanction but where there is an actual growth of tax from £4,053 million to £5,704 million in a little over two years you can see the burden of collecting taxes due.  People are trying to avoid this crushing burden which will grow enormously and each element of the machine is creaking for want of efficiency and adequate facilities to cope with this growing burden.  In the same period income tax and income levies have grown from £1,491 million to £2,295 million, as astronomical increase of 54 per cent.  As the world knows from OECD official records, we are at the top of the taxation league.</P>
    <P>With the tax burden growing at that rate, perhaps it is not surprising that so many people are either failing to pay or are trying to evade their tax liabilities.  It is not surprising either that many more cases are being referred to the office of the solicitor of the Revenue Commissioners <Col N="1592" /> to take proceedings against those who are evading or avoiding payment of their fair share of tax.</P>
    <P>In 1980 income tax as a proportion of total tax represented 25 per cent; this year it will represent 23.7 per cent or 24 per cent.  The growth in income tax in the first quarter in each year is significant but from the figures for this year we are seeing the consequence of either diminishing returns or people unable or unwilling, or both, to meet their tax liabilities. The indications are that revenue returns for the second quarter will be very far short of Government targets, and may be so far short as to warrant a mini-budget of the kind the Government said would not be necessary in their time.  Those are the sad facts as they relate to income tax but let me make another point before coming back to the burden on the office of the solicitor of the Revenue Commissioners.</P>

      <P>The people we are discussing have to deal with the consequence of this growth and if this is all we are providing them with they will not be able to cope.  In 1980, of total tax revenue 6.3 per cent represented servicing of our foreign debt; in 1984 that had more than doubled to 13.2 per cent and growing&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me come back to the impossible task we are asking the office of the solicitor of the Revenue Commissioners to cope with.  If there is an increase in the tax take, and there has been, and if there is a considerable increase in the amount of outstanding tax, and there has been as a natural consequence of the increasing tax burden on those who are unable or unwilling to pay their fair share of tax, then there have to be adjustments in the office to try to cope. <Col N="1593" /> If I am wrong, perhaps the Minister will tell me but I believe it is proposed that from now on claims of less than £100,000 will not be proceeded with in the High Court.  It is important to realise that a special day is set aside in the High Court list&mdash;I think it is Wednesday&mdash;to deal with cases being brought by the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I thought the Deputy was concerned with the appointment of further solicitors and how they were being appointed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about solicitors who are employed at present. Perhaps the Minister would confirm if what I have said is true, or let us know if such instruction, regulation or suggestion has been made.  It is vitally important to ensure that whatever tax is outstanding, whether it be £100,000, £50,0000, £25,000 or £20,000, the machinery will be there to collect that tax.  If we have got to the point where anything less than £100,000 is not worth going after, then we are in very serious trouble.</P>
      <P>My information is that in view of this enormous backlog and the inability of the office to deal with it because of lack of staff and facilities, it is proposed to appoint solicitors in private practice to do work which should exclusively be the role of solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners and that from now on proceedings for sums between £15,000 and £50,000 will be delegated to solicitors in private practice.  That raises two fundamental issues.  First, there is the Official Secrets Act.  There appears to be a tendency to have everything published and the new land tax legislation proposes to publish lists in the Garda stations, with the taint that goes with that.  It is time that we took real account&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We must take into account how confidential these matters are and how they should be dealt with. Secondly, we are not satisfied that these <Col N="1594" /> matters can be confidentially dealt with by people who are not subject to the Official Secrets Act.  Of course, there will be a bonanza for some solicitors in private practice, but if such people are appointed, the implication will be that they are friends of the Government.  If I am in Government I do not want to have the possibility of such a charge directed against me or anyone in my party.  I do not want to have it said that I appointed solicitors in private practice to do the job of the solicitors to the Revenue Commissioners.</P>
      <P>Confidentiality, secrecy and efficiency demand that what has served us well should be adequately provided for in this office.  I cannot imagine that seven solicitors and 16 clerks are adequate to cope with a growing tax bill, the outstanding element of which could be anything up to £1 million.  I cannot imagine that we should pass on responsibility to the private sector instead of properly applying the facilities needed in the public sector. I refer to a letter from the Director General dated 19 April, addressed to a citizen in the Curragh.  It goes as follows:</P>
      <P>I note that you have failed to furnish repayment for the above month.</P>
      <P>The month in question was that ending 5 March 1985.</P>
      <P>Accordingly, you have rendered yourself liable to penalty proceedings.</P>
      <P>In addition, late payments incur interest charges equivalent to 15 per cent per annum.  If you wish to avoid being selected for court proceedings, you must make the payment for this and any other outstanding months immediately.  From P30 should accompany each payment.</P>
      <P>That letter came two weeks after the amount was due, with the threat of legal proceedings.  I think we need to get the thing right.</P>

I do not know which, but I can speculate.  The Opposition Front Bench Spokesman, a lawyer himself, has allowed himself to fall for that. He cannot be doing his job.  I have never heard, even from that Deputy, such misinformation and innuendo as he has just delivered himself of.  I shall give a couple of examples.  The Deputy alleges that amounts of tax outstanding could be as much as £1 billion, when he knows just as well as I do that the figure is nothing like that.  It is nowhere near a figure of that order.  He uses it cynically here to score a point, but does not himself believe that the figure is anything like that.  He has done himself, his party and the House a great disservice.</P>

No such direction has been given and no such direction would ever be given by the Revenue Commissioners or by their chairman, unless they had completely taken leave of their senses.

He does it to create an atmosphere of suspicion and to get the innuendos going.</P>
    <P>It is idle to pretend that any backlog of Revenue cases arose only in the last two years.  As the Deputy knows, having spent a short time in the office which I now have the privilege to hold, the backlog was not suddenly invented at the beginning of 1983.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That practice of getting private solicitors to deal with these fairly large volumes of proceedings has proved satisfactory, particularly as it has added to the capacity of the Revenue Commissioners to take proceedings against defaulters.  The increase in the number of cases where the arrear is in excess of £15,000 has created a situation where an increasing number of cases must be referred to the High Court.  The Revenue Commissioners are now looking at the <Col N="1599" /> possibility of referring some of the High Court cases&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;to solicitors in private practice.  The Revenue Commissioners have not arrived at a conclusion on that, nor, obviously, have they made any approach to me for sanction for such a proposal.  I would not see any objection in principle to engaging outside solicitors simply because the jurisdiction was the High Court rather than the District Court or Circuit Court.  As I have said, the Revenue Commissioners are considering the matter in relation to proceedings which come to the High Court.  That is a fact which is known to the staff in the office of the Revenue Commissioners. They have been informed that that matter is being examined and that if sanction were given for such a course the Revenue Commissioners would intend to proceed along that line.  For all the reasons that I have outlined, and which have been there since 1975 with the other element to which I have referred.</P>

      <P>The Government's objectives on tourism are to optimise the economic and social benefits to Ireland gained by the promotion and development of tourism while ensuring an economic rate of return on the resources employed.  In this approach emphasis is put on: the job creation potential of tourism; the quality of life and development of the community; the enhancement and preservation of the nation's cultural heritage; the conservation of the physical resources of the country; tourism's contribution to the programme of regional development.</P>
      <P>The Government consider that the job creation aspect of the tourism industry is crucial and they will be seeking to ensure that this aspect will be kept to the forefront of Bord Fáilte and of every other State agency directly or indirectly involved in tourism.  The steps to achieve the targets set out in the document <i>Building on Reality 1985-87</i> will be indicated in a Government statement on tourism policy which, I hope, will be issued in the near future.</P>

      <P>The earlier question referred to from the Deputy asked details of the means assessed against a person.  The reply stipulated that the amount of the means was assessed at £28.76 and indicated that the means consisted of an assessment of one half of the weekly value of the pensioner's holding.  The income from the holding was assessed at the net income after various items of expenditure were deducted from the <Col N="1547" /> items of gross income.  A summary of these items is as follows:</P>

      <P>I understand that a very small number of boys have so far not obtained a place in <Col N="1557" /> a second level school in the Bishopstown area.  I am having this matter investigated by my Department.  One of the reasons for the shortage of places is that pupils from other areas go to Bishopstown.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 87 and 88 together.  The conveyance of dangerous substances by road and rail in this country must meet the safety requirements of sections 25 and 62 (1) of the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972.  These statutory provisions require that all practicable steps to prevent risk of injury to persons or property shall be taken in the conveying, loading, unloading, storage, labelling and packing of dangerous substances.  The provisions of the Act apply at present to petroleum and a list of 25 other substances declared to be dangerous under the Dangerous Substances Act, 1972 (Part IV Declaration) Order, 1980.  I propose to extend this list <Col N="1559" /> of 25 substances very shortly to include a far wider range of substances.</P>
      <P>In so far as my Department is concerned, the transport of dangerous chemicals by road is controlled by the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Petroleum by Road) Regulations, 1979, the Dangerous Substances (Conveyance of Scheduled Substances by Road) (Trade or Business) Regulations, 1980, and the 1980 Declaration Order which I have already mentioned.  This legislation provides for the protection of persons and property against the hazards associated with the transport of dangerous substances. Such protection includes the labelling of tanks, containers and packages, display by vehicles of appropriate warning signs, training of personnel, the selection where practicable, of routes which avoid areas of high population density and areas where contamination by a scheduled substance may affect water supplies and the action to be taken in the event of an incident involving those dangerous substances.</P>
      <P>In order to ensure as far as possible that this legislation is complied with, the industrial inspectorate of my Department has been carrying out road checks on vehicles transporting dangerous chemicals by road.  Training courses are being provided by AnCO for drivers of vehicles transporting dangerous substances to meet the training requirements specified in the Regulations.  In regard to the transport of dangerous substances by rail, I am informed that the dangerous chemicals transported in this way are ammonia from Cork to Arklow and acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate from Dublin to Ballina. In addition, petrol is conveyed by rail occasionally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Recommendations on the safety measures and operational procedures to govern the transportation of dangerous chemicals by rail were adopted following in-depth studies and consultations committee out by an inter-departmental committee representing the Departments of Communications, Defence, Environment, Health, Justice, and my Department, the Garda Síochána, CIE, the IIRS and the <Col N="1560" /> companies concerned.  CIE operate safety arrangements in regard to rail transport which conform to the international arrangements for the carriage of dangerous goods by rail.  The Minister for Communications, who is responsible for the enforcement of these recommendations and the operation of these safety arrangements, is satisfied that current arrangements relating to the transport of dangerous substances by rail embody all reasonable and practical elements. Nevertheless, having regard to recent events, he is having another look at all aspects of the matter to see if improved controls are possible.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the question of transporting acrylonitrile and methyl acrylate by sea to the Asahi plant was fully considered and was rejected due to the unsuitability of local ports to receive vessels of the size required and the hazards in regard to this type of transport arising from storms on the west coast in the winter.  I am aware that the local emergency services, including the fire authorities, health boards and the Garda, have taken, and continue to take, measures to ensure an effective response to emergencies involving dangerous substances. The Department of the Environment have issued comprehensive guidelines to local authorities for dealing generally with emergencies.</P>
