      <P>A statement about what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make my position clear on this.  I am making a statement to the House because on occasions in the past when I had a statement to make on energy policy and energy matters I held a press conference before the statement and I was accused by the Opposition of not informing the House. I am trying to oblige the Opposition in this regard and their spokesman on Energy will be informed in advance.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Chair would prefer to deal with the Order of Business first.  I thought the question was in some way related to the Order of Business. Are the arrangements for No. 19 agreed? Are the arrangements for tomorrow's sitting agreed?  Agreed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>Without wishing to be in any way contentious or even tendentious I should like to ask the Minister for Energy if we could have some idea of what the statement is about.  I appreciate that he is making this statement in the House rather than outside and for this small mercy we are very grateful, but could we at least have some idea of the nature of the statement so that we may prepare ourselves for the shock, or for the good news, or at least be in some sort of position to respond to the important statement he is about to make?  Is that unreasonable?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DickSpring" hpid="Mr. Spring Mr. Spring">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Spring</NameTxt>
      <P>It is slightly, yes.  I accept the Deputy's thanks for the small mercy; I am always glad to oblige.  If I was to make a statement at 10.30 a.m.  I would be now making it, but it is more appropriate that it be made at 1 o'clock, the time the Whips feel it most appropriate.  The Fianna Fáil spokesman on Energy will be <Col N="1313" /> informed beforehand and have a copy of the statement to give him time to prepare to make his reply.  I do not think I should divulge any further information at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have any intention of discussing the matter but may I make a passing comment that it is rather extraordinary that we cannot be told even the nature of the statement, whether it deals with Energy, the Tánaiste's business as Leader of the Labour Party, or the new Secretary General of the Labour Party.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Taoiseach to say that it will be published before the end of this session and, as I presume we will be having the usual Adjournment debate at the end of the session, I should like to know if it will be <Col N="1314" /> published in time for us to have some consideration of it before that debate?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I have difficulty in answering that question without notice because I am trying to recall various dates.  We will certainly endeavour to do so, but I am not in a position to give that assurance at present.  I will check that out and see if the present printing timetable looks like allowing that.</P>

      <P>I should like to ask if the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism will take steps to prevent the threatened closure of O'Reilly Foods scheduled to occur tomorrow.  The Minister, and his Department, made great play last week in announcing the creation of 28 jobs in Waterford but omitted to say they were going to close 50 other jobs.</P>

    <Title>Industrial Development Bill, 1985: Second Stage.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton) John Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>I <Col N="1315" /> move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Industrial development is critically important to our future well-being.  Our industrial policies must be such that the proven flair and entrepreneurial talents of our people are used to the full.  There is no point in making excuses about excessive energy prices, declining markets, competition from low wage-cost countries, protectionism and so on.  We are a small open economy and we must regard these problems as given realities and devise methods of exploiting these realities to our own benefits.</P>
      <P>We have proven in the past that we have the capability to take on and beat the best in the world.  Over a 30 year period our economy has been transformed from being predominantly agricultural to the industrial society we have today.  Over the next 30 years we must absorb the latest technological developments, improve our competitiveness on world markets and provide employment and a good standard of living for our people.</P>
      <P>Over 90 per cent of total world scientific knowledge has been developed in the past 30 years.  This will double again in the next 15.  This is the pace of change that we have to contend with.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The primary function of Government in this scenario is the generation of an environment that is conductive to risk-taking. The Government's achievements over the last two and a half years in this area have been many: inflation, a key influence on risk and the probability of success has been reduced from 18 per cent in 1982 to 5.5 per cent in 1985; steps are afoot to rationalise our cumbersome industrial relations procedures; the development of our telecommunications services has been continued at full pace; major road bottlenecks have been alleviated and further substantial developments are planned; the expansion of key elements of our third level educational system designed to provide the appropriate skills and business acumen to industry has been escalated; systems have been put in place through the industrial costs <Col N="1316" /> monitoring group to monitor and advise the Government on the implications of Government actions for industrial costs.</P>
    <P>During the latter part of the seventies and into the eighties there was a major debate on industrial policy.  This debate included the publication of the Telesis report and the National Economic and Social Councils' comments on the report. In July 1984 the Government published their White Paper on Industrial Policy, responding to the NESC reports and the IDA's strategic plan, and outlining the Government's policy for the decade ahead.</P>
    <P>The primary objectives of this industrial policy are: (i) to create and maintain the maximum number of sustainable jobs in manufacturing and international services; (ii) to maximise value-added in industry and retain the wealth created for further employment-creating investment; (iii) to develop a strong internationally-competitive industrial sector in Ireland made up of both Irish and foreign industry; (iv) to promote the rapid development of our natural resource-based industries; (v) to integrate foreign industry into the Irish economy through greater linkage with Irish industry and the educational institutions; and (vi) to improve the rate of return in the commercial State companies.</P>
    <P>The creation and maintenance of employment is the most important of these objectives.  The overall target set for job creation in the White Paper is for the growth in manufacturing employment of between 3,000 and 6,000 jobs per year.  This is a very ambitious target in the light of past trends here and in other countries.  All Government agencies concerned with manufacturing, whether in the investment, export or technical support areas, are being required to use their resources in such a way that together they will assure the achievement of these targets over the ten year period of application of the White Paper.</P>
    <P>The national linkage programme is one of the most important of the job-creating initiatives.  The objective of the programme is to develop a successful subsupply <Col N="1317" /> industrial base in Ireland.  This will correct the current unsatisfactory position where only 33 per cent of industry inputs are manufactured locally and will ensure that the spin-off benefits from the purchases of the important firms attracted to Ireland are retained in Ireland.  In pursuing these objectives the programme is, of course, addressing itself to the recent OECD comment concerning &ldquo;the dualism of the Irish manufacturing sector&rdquo; whereby strong growth by export-oriented foreign firms was not creating significant linkages to indigenous firms.</P>
    <P>This programme will be a key source of new manufacturing employment and the IDA, who have responsibility for the programme, have appointed a former managing director from the electronics industry of an international company to spearhead the programme and to initiate linkage development in the electronics industry initially.  Specifically, a linkage team have been established consisting of representatives of the IDA, the IIRS, SFADCo, AnCO and Údarás na Gaeltachta. Within the next six months 50 multinationals will be involved and 25 suppliers will be in the developmental phase.</P>
    <P>In addition, the programme has already begun to expand to include multinationals outside the electronics sector by virtue of the fact that different sectors have similar requirements and because suppliers have customers in different sectors. While the initial focus will be on information technology, companies in telecommunications, consumer products and engineering are now also participating as a result of the recent decision.</P>
    <P>I am anxious to see the programme extended to other sectors and I expect proposals to that end to be approved shortly.  The linkage programme, while initially focused on developing small Irish companies to service multinationals here, should not be seen solely in that light. We have a fairly diverse multinational sector here and if a company can be developed who are capable of meeting the quality standards and demands of the multinationals in Ireland, it is a very small <Col N="1318" /> step indeed for them to start servicing similar multinationals in, say, Britain or continental Europe.  What we are really doing is using sales to the multinational sector here as a jumping off ground, so to speak, for the development ultimately of export-oriented companies.  It is not a simple case of import substitution in the limited sense of that term.</P>
    <P>The major aim of Government policy is to build up strong indigenous companies capable of taking strategic decisions, developing their own R &amp; D programmes within Ireland and of achieving strong market positions.  The company development approach is one of the main planks in achieving this aim, encouraging overall planning by companies and putting the financial and non-financial services of all State agencies behind companies which adopt the approach.  The IDA are working closely with CTT, the IIRS and other agencies as appropriate and to date 101 companies have participated.  Of these, 55 have had development plans approved.</P>
    <P>This emphasis on assisting indigenous industry is the motivation behind the regionalisation of the small industries programme.  This has been completed since June, and the first Regional Small Industry Advisory Council meetings were held in May.  In addition, small industry boards in all regions are now meeting on a monthly basis and work processed during the year to date gives confidence for believing that the target of increasing small industry project approvals by 25 per cent over the 1984 level can be achieved.  Indeed, the fact that some 4,000 jobs in 300 projects were approved by IDA in the first half of 1985 is an indication of the potential of the small industry sector.</P>
    <P>The one-stop-shop initiative is an equally important initiative in this context. I am pleased to be able to respond to criticisms that they are nothing more than shelves of information booklets in the State agencies by pointing out that IDA and SFADCo offices in all the regions, except the south-west, will soon be able to accommodate to the extent required the representatives of the IIRS, CTT and <Col N="1319" /> also other agencies.  Some of the agencies' services will be provided on a visiting or clinic basis.  For logistical reasons, the necessary changes cannot take place as quickly in Cork, but I am satisfied that all parties are co-operating to bring the IDA, the IIRS, CTT and other agencies under one roof in Cork as well, at an early date.</P>
    <P>It is critically important in the case of small industry that people be able to get quick decisions and have a good personal interaction with individuals in the agencies with which they are dealing, rather than have to deal with faceless bureaucracies in Dublin where files are constantly referred from one officer to another before a decision is taken.  The decentralisation of the small industry function is crucially important in this regard.</P>
    <P>Ireland's very good export performance in recent years is familiar to the House.  While it is reassuring to note that this is continuing, with real growth of up to 10 per cent expected in 1985 and in 1986, nonetheless the White Paper identified shortcomings in the marketing capabilities of Irish firms.  I have been attempting to redress this situation by arranging for CTT to introduce specific marketing initiatives to assist exporters to develop the necessary expertise.</P>
    <P>The most innovative of these schemes is the market entry and development scheme which is designed specifically to help exporters with the various expenses incurred in breaking into new markets or undertaking major developments of existing markets.  The other schemes deal with:</P>
    <P>&mdash;building marketing strengths in firms,</P>
    <P>&mdash;market research proposals, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;design and product development proposals.  </P>
    <P>In implementing these schemes CTT are focusing on the need to develop a market-led approach by our manufacturers which implies precise identification of customer needs and setting out to meet them as regards design, quality, pricing, <Col N="1320" /> after-sales service etc.  To assist in this, CTT grants cover marketing managers, sales personnel recruitment, specialised management training programmes and marketing training seminars.</P>
    <P>All of these initiatives are well under way and are beginning to show encouraging results.  However, I would stress that the basic emphasis here is the long term development of marketing strengths in indigenous firms so that they may compete successfully on international markets.</P>
    <P>One of the major contributory factors to the industrial strength of the United States is the thriving venture capital market in existence there.  Most European countries have in recent years been trying to emulate the American experience. In Ireland we have the business expansion scheme, which provides income tax relief to eligible individual investors.</P>
    <P>The scheme provides that individuals who purchase shares in unquoted manufacturing companies or companies providing internationally traded services should be able to write-off up to £25,000 per annum against their taxable income. An individual paying 60 per cent tax who makes a qualifying investment of £25,000 will find that the net cost of that investment is only £10,000.  The business expansion scheme resulted in more than £3.5 million of new investment in industry during the 1984-85 tax year, in its introductory phase.</P>
    <P>The Second Stage of the National Development Corporation Bill was completed in the House last week.  This Corporation is a further vehicle for State involvement in, and promotion of, industrial development.  The principal objective of the NDC will be to assist, by means of investment in industry, in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State.</P>
    <P>I know that some Deputies are concerned that there may be an overlap of functions between the NDC and IDA.  I want to repeat what I said in the House last week to allay any fears that there may be about an overlap or duplication of functions between the NDC and the <Col N="1321" /> IDA.  It is my intention that there should be an operating agreement drawn up between the two bodies which will be subject to my approval.  This will allow the NDC and the IDA to co-ordinate their respective functions and to act in complete harmony, thus ensuring the creation of the maximum number of viable jobs.</P>
    <P>The principal function of the NDC will be to take an equity stake in industry by investing in suitable projects with a capability of providing sustainable and viable employment opportunities.  They will not be empowered to make grants available to industry as the IDA are, and their power to give loans will be limited to the extent necessary to complement their overall effort and may be exercised only in the specific circumstances set out in the Bill.</P>
    <P>The IDA have of course taken minority equity stakes in industry in small number of cases where this was necessary to formulate an overall package of aid to a particular project.  We should not forget, however, that the IDA's principal statutory function is to contribute to the industrial promotion effort by means of providing grant-aid to industry.</P>
    <P>The Management Committee on Industrial Policy was established to ensure the prompt implementation of the policies outlined in the White Paper.  The committee, under the chairmanship of my Department, is comprised of representatives of the principal industrial development agencies and the Department of Finance.  In its regular meetings to date it has reviewed submissions from the agencies on many of the White Paper initiatives.  By doing so it has ensured, and will continue to ensure, that there is no slackening in efforts to put the new policies speedily in place.</P>
    <P>The Bill now before the House is a further stage in the implementation of the White Paper policies.  The opportunity is also being availed of to consolidate all existing industrial development legislation into one single comprehensive code.  The Bill will, therefore, repeal and re-enact with amendments the Industrial Development Authority Act, 1950, the <Col N="1322" /> Industrial Development Acts, 1969 to 1981, the Undeveloped Areas Acts 1952 to 1969, and the Industrial Grants Acts, 1959 to 1969, omitting provisions which are obsolete or no longer necessary.</P>
    <P>Following detailed reviews of the structure and administration of incentives for industry in Ireland, the Industrial Development Act, 1969, resulted in the formation of the Industrial Development Authority in their present form.</P>
    <P>Established in 1970, the new Authority were given power to offer a wider range of incentives to indigenous and overseas industry.  Their new package of incentives and services to industry incorporated grants towards the capital costs of new industrial projects, reequipment grants to assist industry to adapt to free trade conditions, special grant assistance geared towards the development of small industries, training grants, interest subsidies, loan guarantees, equity shareholding, R &amp; D grants, the development of industrial estates and the construction of advance factories.</P>
    <P>The Industrial Development Authority have served us exceptionally well since their formation.  Their flexibility and efficiency in encouraging industrial development are the envy of other countries. The re-definition of IDA's role in section 11 of the Industrial Development Bill will ensure that the IDA will be enabled to continue their good work into the future.</P>
    <P>The primary role of the Industrial Development Authority is to act under the Minister as a body having national responsibility for the implementation of industrial development policies and in the exercise of their functions to act in accordance with policies set out for them from time to time by the Minister.  The Industrial Development Authority, together with the other agencies involved in industrial development, such as the IIRS and Coras Tráchtála will have executive responsibility for the implementation of industrial policies.</P>
    <P>To ensure that industrial policy evolves in an ordered and planned manner, and that Deputies are made aware of the costs <Col N="1323" /> and benefits of industrial policy at regular intervals, the Bill includes in section 6 a new provision for a review of national industrial performance every three years. These triennial reviews and the conclusions arising from such reviews will be laid before each House of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>The Bill for the first time will provide in section 13 for the issue of directives of a general policy nature to the Authority, subject to a number of safeguards.  Such directives should not apply to any individual industrial undertaking or to the location of an industry other than as part of a general review of industrial policy for the country as a whole.  Copies of all directives given by the Minister under this section must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas within 21 days.</P>
    <P>Section 21 of the Bill sets out the new selectivity criteria under which the Authority will provide grant assistance to industry in respect of fixed assets. These criteria will also apply to leasing grants, rent subsidy grants, loan guarantees, interest subsidies in relation to fixed assets; training grants, the new technology acquisition grants, the incentives for enterprise development and equity participation.  Other grant programmes such as research and development, international services and the incentives in respect of restructuring of industry will remain subject to their existing criteria.</P>
    <P>The new grant criteria were outlined at paragraphs 5.2 to 5.4 of the White Paper and have been substituted for the criteria set out in the two-tier grant system in sections 33 and 34 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969.  The new criteria overlap with the old in respect of the necessity for financial assistance, the permanence and viability of the firm, the provision of employment, use of natural resources and technological content. There will be no change in the maximum rate of grant which may be made, which will remain at 60 per cent in the designated areas and 45 per cent in the non-designated areas.  However, the average level of fixed asset grants will be gradually <Col N="1324" /> reduced so that savings may be applied to technology acquisition grants and the new marketing initiatives.</P>
    <P>This is quite important because the industrial White Paper clearly envisages a shift in resources from fixed assets to technology acquisition marketing and this reduction must be made to effect that shift.  In addition, the new selectivity criteria will focus on the need to develop and increase linkages between overseas and indigenous industry and in particular the development of import substitution projects and export markets.  Employment creation and maintenance, in addition to the new emphasis on output growth and generation of value added within the economy, will continue to be the main focus of State assistance to industry.</P>
    <P>The conclusion in the White Paper on Industrial Policy was that grant assistance should be directed to remedying perceived weaknesses in Irish industry in the areas of marketing, management, research and development and innovation. Companies approved for grant assistance will, therefore, have to demonstrate that they will comply with the new criteria, have suitable company development plans and also that the equity base-financial structure of the company is adequate.</P>
    <P>It is now generally accepted that we can no longer rely exclusively on overseas investment as a means of improving the level of technology in Irish industry.  The White Paper on Industrial Policy stated that the IDA would be empowered to give grants not exceeding 50 per cent towards the costs of acquiring new product or process technology.  Section 30 of this Bill will enable the IDA to give such grants and sets out the costs which will be eligible for grant assistance.  Product or process technology for the purpose of grant assistance will include patents, designs, trade marks, trade secrets, copyrights and proprietary and non-proprietary know-how.</P>
    <P>There is a wealth of invaluable technical expertise available in the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards.  It is <Col N="1325" /> my belief that this expertise will prove a major asset in identifying suitable projects for assistance under the technology acquisition grants scheme as well as for research and development grants generally. Accordingly, I intend that the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards will be consulted by the Authority on all such projects.</P>
    <P>The Bill also makes a number of significant changes in the IDA's R &amp; D grant programme.  Under section 24, costs eligible for assistance in future will include the salaries and wages and travel and subsistence expenses of those engaged on the project or in identifying product or process development opportunities within the company.  Secondly, in order to encourage the smaller industrial undertaking to make greater use of the R &amp; D grants, it is proposed to allow the Authority to make advance payments of up to one-third of an R &amp; D grant to small industry.</P>
    <P>It is intended that this provision would apply to small companies employing up to 50 people and with fixed assets of less than £0.5 million.  It is now recognised that small companies are often more innovative than the larger companies, yet at the same time do not have the financial resources available to devote to a concerted and systematic research and development effort.  This new provision will assist the smaller undertaking involved in research and development and considerably ease their cashflow and working capital requirements.</P>
    <P>It may surprise the House to know that we are already spending about £40 million a year on research and development grants to Irish industry and we are getting about £30 million for the same purpose from the EC.  Yet, relatively speaking, we have a very low level of research and development activity in industry by comparison with other countries. There are notable exceptions to this and I recently visited one in Deputy Daly's constituency, a company which would not exist but for the enormous research and development efforts they made to develop new products.  Considering the amount of money we are spending <Col N="1326" /> on research and development we do not seem to be getting the results that we should and it is my intention to look a lot more closely at our total research and development efforts in industry in future. I hope that the new freedom conferred by the amendments contained in the Bill will be of assistance.</P>
    <P>In recognition of the important role which AnCO play in industrial training, section 28 of the Bill provides that in future all training grant expenditure by the Authority shall take place only following consultation with AnCO.  This will help ensure that training grant expenditure will become more cost effective and that the maximum value is obtained from State resources in this area.  In addition training grant expenditure must contribute to the attainment of the objectives set out in the new selectivity criteria.</P>
    <P>Provision is being made in section 4 of the Bill to allow the Minister to make a more flexible use of the designation instrument.  I have been concerned that no objective or systematic review of designation has taken place since it was first introduced in 1952.  I believe that a detailed and objective analysis of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the designated and non-designated areas is essential if designation is to be used as a flexible policy instrument for the future.</P>
    <P>At my request the National Economic and Social Council have just issued a report recommending objective criteria, based on labour market imbalances, to determine designated status.  They have further recommended that designation status should be of limited duration and coverage and subject to regular reviews. I have accepted in principle the broad thrust of the NESC recommendations and I have asked the Economic and Social Research Institute to advise me on what changes would be appropriate in relation to designation employing the critiera specified in the NESC report.</P>
    <P>A number of other minor, technical or general amendments have been made in regard to grant schemes, incentives and equity participation powers of the Authority, the Government's powers in regard to grants, the period of appointment of, <Col N="1327" /> disqualification of and declaration of interest by Authority members, and the delegation of functions to boards and committees.  It is also proposed that a new limit of £700 million be set on the total expenditure by the Industrial Development Authority as from the coming into force of the legislation.  This will enable the Authority to carry out their functions for a further three to four years, and will allow the Oireachtas to review the operations of the IDA, in accordance with standard practice, in about three or four years' time which will coincide reasonably well with the completion of the first triennial review of industrial policy.  I will be happy to elaborate further on Committee Stage on these provisions, which are primarily of a regulatory or controlling nature or are designed to make explicit, provisions which are already implicit in the existing industrial development legislation.</P>
    <P>A number of provisions in the old legislation are not being re-enacted including the IDA's re-equipment grant scheme which was of special significance during the seventies in the modernisation of industry to assist it to operate in free market conditions.  During the decade over £450 million was approved for Irish industries under the programme.  The programme helped Irish firms to adapt to the free trade conditions brought about by the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Area Agreement and Ireland's subsequent entry to the EC.</P>
    <P>The programme was phased out in the early eighties and ceased in 1982.  The Industrial Development Bill repeals these provisions permanently on the basis that they have served their purpose and continuation of the measure could no longer be justified.</P>
    <P>Similar considerations apply in regard to the IDA's powers to provide and arrange housing for employees in industry. I am satisfied that it is no longer appropriate that the IDA should retain this power which is more appropriate to the local authorities, the National Building Agency and the private sector.</P>
    <P>The remainder of the eighties and the <Col N="1328" /> early nineties will be characterised by:</P>
    <P>&mdash;rapid technological change,</P>
    <P>&mdash;relatively high unemployment levels throughout the EC,</P>
    <P>&mdash;slow rates of growth in economic and world trade, and</P>
    <P>&mdash;more intensive competition for international mobile investment.  </P>
    <P>This Bill, and the other policy measures in the White Paper on Industrial Policy, will help us to face these daunting challenges with confidence.  The greatest challenge facing us is unemployment. Manufacturing employment has been declining sharply in recent years, not only in Ireland, but throughout the developed world.</P>
    <P>The policy initiatives introduced since the publication of the White Paper in July 1984 have contributed to moderating the rate of decline in manufacturing industry. I am confident that in 1986 we will see for the first time in many years some growth in manufacturing employment. This Bill provides the framework for further improvements in manufacturing industry in the years ahead.  I commend the Bill to the House.</P>

      <P>There has been an annual net loss of approximately 7,000 jobs and the registered number of unemployed stands at 250,000.  This does not take account of the unemployed people who are not registered and those who have emigrated.  While the value of our exports is increasing due to success in the high-tech and pharmaceutical side of industry, the volume of our exports has been significantly reduced.  In the light of those few details one would reasonably expect an industrial Bill of innovation and substance with clearly defined sections to redress the present unacceptable position. Instead, the Minister has introduced a Bill that is a major disappointment.  It is a bookkeeping exercise and the problem of unemployment has not been attended to sufficiently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Are the Minister and the Government bereft of ideas or suggestions to deal with the problem?  Is he satisfied to continue to preside, as he has done for the past <Col N="1329" /> two and half years, over the demise of all sectors of industry?  Is he satisfied to see the structures of industry toppling while he is Minister?  He is depressing morale and he is not giving hope to anyone.  He is dismantling and destroying industrial development with the assistance of the Government.  I am talking of industry that was painstakingly built up during the years by capable, competent and committed leadership following the example set and the foundation laid for industrial development by the late Seán Lemass. Yet, this Minister had the gall and temerity to refer last week in a most inappropriate way to the integrity of Seán Lemass at the conclusion of the debate on the NDC.</P>

The Minister is chasing around the country, announcing a few jobs here and there but, at the same time, closures are abounding.  That is not a good record. The propaganda exercise will not succeed. Putting literature on the windscreens of cars outside churches, television advertisements telling people to phone in looking for jobs and enclosing leaflets in <i>The Cork Examiner</i> will not be sufficient to arrest the declining electoral support of this Minister and this Government. Almost daily we have requested here on the Order of Business appealing to the Government and to Ministers to save jobs.  Yesterday and the day before it was Mallow.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the new policy directions and incentives for industry set out in the White Paper on industrial policy published in July 1984.  That White Paper was a major disappointment, as is this Bill.  When the White Paper was introduced it failed to meet the challenge posed by an unemployment figure of 211,000.  Now, some 18 months later unemployment is in excess of 230,000. The White Paper did not contain any new important decisions and little new thinking and the same applies to the Bill. There is no indication of a commitment to recreate the dynamic industrial growth that took place in the sixties and seventies, a growth that is essential if we are to solve the social evil of unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The objective set out in the document <i>The Way Forward</i> published by Fianna Fáil was to provide employment for our young people, with a labour force growing by some 17,000 a year, and to create at least half the employment needed in manufacturing industry.  I shall refer to that document very often because it is the only document that takes account of the facts.  The same cannot be said for the Government document <i>Building on Reality</i> which was discredited within a month of publication.  The targets set in that document cannot be attained.  <i>The Way Forward</i> accorded key importance to manufacturing industry and it said that the development of that sector will continue to be the critical element for the <Col N="1331" /> development of the economy and the expansion of employment opportunities.</P>
    <P>Between 1977 and 1979 employment in manufacturing industry increased by more than 20,000.  The White Paper was wrong when it said that during these years there was a strong rise in domestic demand largely financed by foreign borrowings. In fact, our foreign debt increased by more than £500 million in those three years, the same amount that the Coalition borrowed abroad in 1976. After telling the electorate before the general election that they would discontinue foreign borrowing and reduce deficit budgeting, there is higher foreign borrowing, higher deficit budgeting and higher unemployment.</P>
    <P>The collapse in foreign investment in 1983-84 has been notable.  IDA jobs were halved in 1983.  Manufacturing employment fell by more than 13,000, twice the level of the previous two years, a figure last recorded as far back as 1975.  Investment in the economy as a whole has been set at its lowest level for many years.</P>
    <P>The White Paper passes over the absence of foreign investors, and this Bill does not address itself to means of providing investment in manufacturing industry. The White Paper fudges the disastrous performance of the Government in respect of new industrial investment since the Government came to office.  As a Government economic policy document, the White Paper is totally deficient in basic information about what has been happening recently.  It tries to obscure the significant failure to achieve industrial job creation.  Nothing can hide the fact that mobile international investment is not being attracted to Ireland in the way it used to be.  Part of the reason is the exceptionally high level of personal taxation and service charges.</P>
    <P>We will not be able to sustain our high rate of exports and industrial production without new investment.  The White Paper states bluntly in the second paragraph that the state of Government finances does not allow for a real expansion of expenditure on job creation.  That <Col N="1332" /> sums it up: in that statement lies the true position.  It is a reflection of the lack of performance by the Government.</P>
    <P>The present level of spending on industry has been reduced drastically over levels obtaining between 1979 and 1982. This represents a radical change of policy and a lowering of the priority given to job creation by successive Coalition Governments.  The Bill is designed to give effect to the first paragraph of the White Paper which is confined exclusively to bookkeeping.  The Bill is purely a bookkeeping exercise, a moving of the goal posts.  The object of the White Paper, according to itself, is to maximise the benefits from existing industrial incentives and thus ensure that the benefits from them will exceed their costs significantly.</P>
    <P>Employment is not mentioned.  Fianna Fáil want the best value for money from any given level of expenditure, but to define industrial policy purely in those terms rather than the potential contribution to employment creation is to refuse to acknowledge the real challenge to our social structures that unemployment represents.</P>
    <P>The White Paper projects a doubling of manufacturing output during the next decade.  The basis for this projection is not clear: we have not been told whether it is based on a detailed analysis of the likely performance of the different manufacturing sectors.  Therefore, it is difficult to judge whether the objective is realistic. As indicated in <i>The Way Forward,</i> our objective was to increase industrial production by 9.25 per cent annually, accompanied by employment growth of 9,500 jobs per year in the manufacturing sector up to 1987.  Partly, no doubt, because of failure to attract new industrial investment, this target has been lowered in the Coalition White Paper to 7.2 per cent in the next ten years.  The White Paper is one year and a half old and the projection then, in 1984, has been confirmed by the position we find ourselves in now.</P>
    <P>Net employment in manufacturing industry could be increased, according to the Government, by between 3,000 and <Col N="1333" /> 6,000 a year, depending on productivity. The Minister made that assumption in his speech today.  He said that the increase in productivity through, for example, the use of new technology and the lower rate of employment, may well be higher rather than lower in the next decade, which suggests that job creation is likely to be closer to the lower figure.  It is understood that in an earlier draft of the White Paper only 1,000 new jobs were projected.  Of course that was politically unacceptable, and now it is the reality that what was projected initially has been realised in the intervening period.</P>
    <P>The Government state that it is difficult to predict growth in manufacturing and that few countries are making such predictions. It is not clear on what factors, if any, the Government objectives are based because there is no proper breakdown of targets between indigenous and foreign industries.  The White Paper does not contain any of the detailed targets which had previously been set, and that means there is very little by which to measure performance.</P>
    <P>We agree with the White Paper when it rejects the Telesis recommendation that the level of grants should be reduced drastically.  However, it should be pointed out that this is contrary to a statement in the Joint Programme for Government, which stated:</P>
    <P>In the provision of grants to foreign firms account will be taken of the Telesis recommendations with regard to the scale of grants.</P>
    <P>In any language, that is a contradiction. I will deal briefly with re-equipment grants.  In 1981 we decided to retain these on a restricted and selective basis.  The White Paper proposes to terminate them, but it states that much of Irish industry needs additional investment in new technology to survive.  The White Paper suggests that it is clearly unwise to terminate re-equipment grants completely.</P>
    <P>We must consider selectively in this matter, but despite some advance media publicity about backing winners, there is little evidence of any such approach in the White Paper.  Concentration on specific <Col N="1334" /> high technology factors is not highlighted, and in general the role of new high technology in industry is played down.  Basing grants on a company development plan was already a feature of our industrial practice.</P>
    <P>There is nothing new in the White Paper.  This morning we received the NESC report concerning the designation of areas for industrial policy. obviously I have not had the opportunity of reading the report in any detail, but I shall comment briefly on it.  At first glance it appears that the former regional emphasis of the IDA's activity appears to be more or less abandoned.  Job targets for individual towns seem to be dropped. That will be a grave disappointment to scores of towns and larger villages.</P>
    <P>There is no clarity in the White Paper on the future of designated areas but the Bill introduces a section dealing with such designations.  In the NESC report there is the comment that the practice whereby large sections of the country are designated virtually for ever without review should be ended.  In our present circumstances up to 99 per cent of the country should be designated.  Therefore, I trust there will be no question of restricting or reducing designation.  The Minister of State tended to be parochial.  He said he would look after Waterford so it is only right that I should try, against all the odds, to look after Cork.</P>

      <P>The designation in respect of Cork city was not designation in the usual sense.  Grant levels were set between the designated and non-designated regions and applied only to specific locations within the city.  As mentioned in the report, even with such limited designation, the effect has not been shown to be of any advantage in that area so far.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Many of the proposals outlined in earlier drafts of the White Paper, for instance, the reduction in employers' PRSI contributions and the abolition of tax on oil for industry, are omitted now. We must acknowledge the hurried face <Col N="1335" /> saving effort recently in the form of some concessions to employers and industrialists on the PRSI aspect of development in employment.  We always acknowledge any little conversion on the part of the Government especially when the concessions concerned result from our promptings and encouragement.  The issue of reduced electricity prices to industry is fudged in the White Paper leaving the Government's intentions in this regard totally unclear and presumably reflecting disagreement within the Coalition.  That would be nothing new.  A recent study indicated that Ireland's communications costs are the highest in the EC.  This whole area of industrial costs is of paramount importance to our competitors. Many of these costs are within the control of the Government but they have failed to take any decision on the matter of the reduction of some of these costs, a move that would improve our poor business environment.</P>
    <P>The limited reference to natural resources as part of our industrial policy is an indication of the inadequacy of the Government's attention to this area.  Our marine resources are not even referred to in the White Paper and neither is there any elaboration of policy on hydrocarbon development.  Only one sentence is devoted to that aspect and this again reflects the ideological <i>impasse</i> that has been reached regarding the development of offshore oil.</P>
    <P>Recently we discussed the National Development Corporation.  We read in the White Paper that part of the <i>rationale</i> for the NDC was that they would become involved in areas which the private sector are not willing to become involved in. The corporation will be able to operate only as a source of risk equity in conjunction with the private sector.  Successful operations will be sold off or privatised after a relatively short time.  There is no intention on the part of the Minister to allow any permanent expansion of the State sector.</P>
    <P>All of the functions proposed for the NDC could be carried out by the NEA. As was said by other speakers subsequent <Col N="1336" /> to my contribution to the debate on the NDC, if it were established that there were elements of the NEA's operations that they are incapable of fulfilling but which the NDC could fulfil, there would be some point in the new development. But if that is the case could the matter not have been rectified by other legislation or by a ministerial order to give to the NEA whatever powers or capital might be required to enable them to fulfil all their functions?  Have we not all said that the NDC is no more than a piece of political nonsense?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill and the White Paper are other indications of the poor quality of the government of this Coalition.  What has finally emerged once again is the lowest common denominator between the parties.</P>
      <P>I suggest that high productive investment is the key to more jobs and improved living standards.  Investment in the economy at present is stagnant.  In part, this stems from a general reluctance on the part of individuals and groups to risk capital.  This reluctance stems from the complexity of legislation, the locked in nature of any investment.  We have dealt with that aspect in the debate on the designated trust funds Bill.  I said at that time that I welcomed the removal of some of the barbed wire from the 1984 proposals, but we have not gone far enough.  Investment to date of something over £5 million is an indication that the position is not encouraging for individuals and groups to risk capital.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1337" /> Investment is the life blood of industry and there is a need for an annual investment of about £1,000 million to sustain an 8 per cent to 10 per cent manufacturing growth rate.  At present little more than 50 per cent of that amount is being invested.  While much of this investment could be funded by retained earnings, loans and Government grants, there is a requirement for new industrial equity of £300 million per annum.</P>
    <P>Personal taxation is exceptionally high and is a disincentive to initiative and effort.  It is causing major difficulties in recruiting, retaining and motivating staff. It is impacting on pay negotiations, absenteeism, willingness to accept promotion or to work overtime, it is increasing the attraction of the black economy, and the cost of essential industrial services such as energy, transport, communications.</P>
    <P>The most serious element of industry and services today is the insurance problem. Firms, large and small, are unable to get insurance coverage.  First they get quotations but they are so high that they are out of bounds.  The problem of public liability insurance in industry is not being addressed.  This is a massive problem and I appeal to the Minister of State with responsibility in this area to address himself to this problem and to examine the situation because it is at a critical stage. Employers and industrialists seeking insurance have lost all hope of ever getting any.</P>
    <P>The primary aim must be to improve the climate for enterprise at individual and company level and the creation of conditions which will stimulate a much higher rate of investment in job creation in the economy.  It is desirable that new projects which have employment creating potential are supported.  The high cost of borrowing is a major deterrent to new investment, particularly by small firms. We are all aware that the hopes and possibilities of turning our economy around lies with the development and success of small firms.</P>
    <P>We must address ourselves to making <Col N="1338" /> investment available to them, to encourage them to save what is left of our economy and to set it on the road to reach a status we all wish for it and so create a viable economy which will provide the hundreds and thousands of jobs which are required.  I recommend that a 5 per cent interest incentive be made available to small manufacturing firms for additional investment in fixed assets or working capital.  Let us show faith &mdash; what a word to use emanating from other areas &mdash; in the small firms by giving them that incentive.</P>
    <P>This morning the Minister dealt with many areas except, sad to say, tourism, which is a major earner of foreign exchange and has major links with all strata of industry &mdash; food, hotels, restaurants, clothing and fashion, jewellery and craft; the list is endless.  This industry should be treated in the same way as manufacturing and internationally traded service industries.</P>
    <P>Investment in brain power remains low by international standards and the OECD report on innovation Ireland commented adversely on our position in that regard.  Yet many of our graduates and highly qualified and skilled personnel are emigrating due to a shortage of opportunity at home.  There is, therefore, an urgent need to create job opportunities by imaginative policies with emphasis on correcting the downward trend in recent years of job losses in manufacturing industry which, as I said at the outset, are averaging 7,000 per annum.  In the construction industry there has been a loss of 25,000 jobs since that industry went into decline in recent years and, in addition, there have been innumerable losses in service and supporting firms who ceased trading or reduced the number of employees, numbers which have not been calculated with any degree of accuracy.</P>
    <P>I began this discussion on a critical note but I have spent the last few minutes making positive comments and I will continue in that vein.  We must tackle the difficult and necessarily long term educational task of raising the general level of economic literacy in our community. By all means let us debate fundamental <Col N="1339" /> political philosophies but let us do it on the basis of understanding the economic issues involved and the beginning must surely be an understanding of economic reality.  We must clearly distinguish between economic growth and the distribution of economic goods and services.</P>
    <P>In the long run it is a truism to say that a community can only divide among its members the aggregate added value earned by the community on the home and export markets.  The position can be clouded in the short term because of foreign grants or foreign borrowing, but any rational assessment of the situation will show that neither of these sources can continue indefinitely.  What is needed now to develop the economy is a clear focus on economic activity.  We must focus on our development objectives and identify the resources we can use to create jobs and enhance living standards.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed with this Bill considering the situation we are in.  We must take action to turn our aspirations into economic reality.  Any impartial assessment of our position will show that we have the human and material resources to be an economic success.  From our history we can see that we doubled our real standards of living in terms of output per capita during the sixties and seventies. We must repeat that performance. We must all meet the challenge.  The sectors which can operate to our advantage must be identified and consistent and vigorous action taken.  It would be easy but wrong for us to wait for an improvement in international economic conditions and I hope we will not hear more of that kind of contribution from the Government side who are prone to say that our economic ills are caused by outside influences.</P>

I have no doubt that we can overcome our difficulties if we focus on solutions.</P>
      <P>There are no solutions indicated in this Bill and I regret that.  If we co-operate in a spirit of confidence and reliance, we can approach our problems with thoroughness and consistency in every area of economic activity.  This concerns every citizen.  We should say that Ireland is a body corporate of which we are all shareholders.  The size of our dividend will depend on how much we invest in terms of skills, other resources and the quality and effectiveness of management. We will get out of it what we put into it. That is why I ask the Minister and the Government to give leadership and bring the will of the people with them.  We will play our part in salvaging the remains of our economy and will do what is needed in order to get one quarter of a million people back to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Neither the White Paper nor the Bill convinces me that the necessary requirements are being fulfilled and I appeal to the Minister and the Government to address the situation.  This Bill is a bookkeeping exercise, a major disappointment and one would consider opposing it because of its inadequacies.  However, <Col N="1341" /> I am hopeful that our promptings and encouragement to the Government will enable them to see the <i>rationale</i> of our contribution towards this Bill and will encourage them to give leadership and a commitment to reverse the trend in our economy and restore confidence and get the unemployed back to work.  They should set a headline for those still at school who feel hopeless about ever getting employment.</P>
    <P>This debate must address itself to the situation and encourage the Government to reverse the economic trend.  The Government should use the opportunity given by this Bill to create a new atmosphere and a dynamism which has been lacking in the Government.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill.  The invigorating policies contained therein have not been heard in this country for quite some time.  Industrial policy pursued by successive Irish Governments over the past 20 years has been remarkably successful.  Despite the removal of tariff barriers, the performance of Ireland in terms of industrial output and employment has been better than any other European country.</P>
      <P>I am amazed at the gloom and doom that I have heard for the past 20 minutes from across the House.  If that Deputy realised the position of Irish industrial development in comparison with that of its EC neighbours he would not be making the wild statements he has been making here in the past half hour. Throughout the recession of the last decade total employment in the economy has held up better here than elsewhere. The growth in unemployment is due mainly, I emphasise to my learned friend across the way&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The primary contribution to the maintenance of manufacturing employment has been made by new overseas industries.  In 1975 foreign owned manufacturing firms accounted for 50,000 manufacturing jobs.  Today foreign owned firms account for approximately 85,000 jobs.  In three years that is an outstanding success.  If Deputy Lyons has any doubts about that he can get the facts and figures in official records to prove it.  I can only describe Deputy Lyons as a doubting Thomas when he has no faith in this country, in this Government who were democratically elected and in our superb workforce which is second to none in Europe.</P>
      <P>The Deputy referred to inflation as a keynote to the success of industrial development. It is a pity this Government did not think of that in the 1977-81 period and again in 1982 when they were returned to office.  When we took over the reins of office at Christmas 1982 inflation was 27 per cent.  Today it is under 5 per cent, thanks to three years of very good, sound, effective government from the Coalition parties.  What have Deputy Lyons and his party to offer against that creditable performance of only three years?  They had the monopoly of power for the 60 years since the State was formed.  They were in power for 45 of the 60 years. What did they do?  They borrowed rampantly and <i>ad lib</i> to set up phoney industries in the sixties that toppled and disintegrated a few years after they had been built up.  The truth is bitter at times.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we are experiencing certain difficulties here in this period of Government we have faced up to our responsibilities. We have given the people a lead as regards government.  Every new factory creates additional demand for local services, such as subcontracting, component supply, electricity, telecommunications, transport and computer facilities, banking, insurance, maintenance and construction facilities.  I could go on for another ten minutes outlining all the ancilliary matters that stem from a very <Col N="1343" /> sound industrial policy.  Thank God this country at long last has that sound industrial policy through our able Minister, Deputy John Bruton, and his Minister of State, Deputy Eddie Collins.  We are proud of their achievements today and they can stand over them with pride when they are taken into consideration against the haphazard achievements of the Fianna Fáil administration.  Irish success in attracting new overseas industries is the envy of many countries throughout the world and of some EC countries.  Our achievement against intensive international competition is remarkable.</P>
    <P>New foreign owned industries spend more on research and development than established industries and they recruit more highly qualified staff.  I believe that this Government should continue to encourage, foster and attract the foreign industrialist, the man of stability, whom our IDA managers are well able to assist. We should go overboard to attract such people because they are an asset to our economy.  The future of industrial development here will lie on their shoulders.</P>
    <P>Irish manufacturing output must be doubled in the next few years if the employment needs of this economy are to be met and the gap in living standards between Ireland and other EC countries is to be reduced.  In other words, we must streamline our industrial output and gear it to such an extent that it will be able to meet and beat the best of competition from our European and world partners. I have the greatest faith in our industrial development directors, their excellent Irish workforce and their ability to achieve this goal.  Conditions must prevail which will encourage the expansion of existing industry and the attraction of further new industries from abroad.</P>
    <P>The progress of recent decades should instil confidence in our ability to achieve the more rapid rate of industrialisation which is necessary to eliminate the scourge of unemployment.  The more industries we can establish the more employment will accrue to our young population.  Controversy about the interpretation and co-ordination of statistics <Col N="1344" /> should not be allowed to detract in any way from the remarkable contribution which over 800 foreign owned firms are making to the economy.  Those foreign industrialists deserve praise for setting up industries here and giving very valuable employment.  I should like to warn those who embark on a course of criticism that continued controversy here only damages the attractiveness of Ireland as a location for investment by foreign industrialists.  Those who pursue that controversial course will find that their comments are used by our competitors to sow the seeds of uncertainty abroad.</P>
    <P>The primary objective of our industrial policy must be to create the type of economy that will promote rapid growth in industry and attract a continuing flow of overseas investment.  I accept that we are a long way from that desirable objective, although it is good that we are able to report progress in some areas.  The lead given by the Government in eliminating the controversial aspects of industrial development here has been outstanding. Employment creation, not the protection of living standards for those of us who are at work, should be our national priority. We should discard the &ldquo;I am all right Jack&rdquo; attitude and try to create industrial development.  Without vision and drive by our people our rate of progress in industrial development will slow up significantly and that would prove detrimental to our economy.</P>
    <P>We have an opportunity in this period of change to adopt an effective overall approach to industrial development.  We must adopt a proper approach to stimulate growth in industry so that we can show the world that, although we are a small nation, we can stand side by side with the best.  We need policies in regard to income, taxation, credit, investment and social services.  They must be integrated into one policy.  We must give priority to higher added value in the production of goods and services thereby creating more employment opportunities. There is little point in approaching this matter in a half hearted way.  It deserves the attention, drive and direction <Col N="1345" /> it is getting from the Ministers responsible.  I urge those Ministers to intensify their efforts and endeavour to achieve the highest standard of industrial production possible.  To date they have travelled a considerable distance along that path and they have a long journey to go before they reach their final goal, but work begun is work half done.  At last we have the necessary leadership and determination from our Ministers that we lacked in the past two decades.</P>
    <P>I do not want to see the smart-alec foreigners from Amsterdam, Düsseldorf or Cologne or even smart-alec native entrepreneurs availing of generous IDA grants &mdash; money that is collected from the hardworking PAYE sector &mdash; and after a few years closing their plants and taking the first plane out of the country. We must ensure that that practice stops and that the indiscriminate waste of public money down the years does not occur again.  I note that the Minister has omitted IDA's powers to investigate the effects of protective measures and to examine proposals in relation to the imposition or revision of tariff or quotas. I note he proposes to make those who avail of IDA grants subject to triennial reviews of industrial performance.  That deals with the fly-by-night operators and discourages them from collecting money from our taxpayers and bailing out when their pockets are well lined.</P>
    <P>We want industrialists, foreign and native to come forward, but we do not want men with feet of clay.  We need people of courage and determination to get involved in industrial development. We need reliable people to play a role in the future development of industries here.  The Minister should ensure that applicants for grants are investigated before any money is paid to them because for too long there has been an exploitation of the grant system.  That must stop.  I wonder how much of Irish taxpayers' money has vanished in that fashion in the past two decades.</P>
    <P>Future industrial policy becomes very important in the context of high unemployment, a problem which is not unique to us.  Other industrialised countries have <Col N="1346" /> similar unemployment problems.  The policies which serve our industrial development in the sixties and seventies are no longer adequate for the harsher climate of the eighties.  In an open trading economy we have little choice but to respond to the changes forced on us.  We can and must develop a deeper understanding of what is involved if we are to respond effectively to that challenge.  The cure is in our own hands.  We must remember that nobody else can give it to us.  We must be competitive on world markets and I emphasise that word &ldquo;competitive&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that our very well trained Irish workforce are fit and organised to meet any challenge in industry. Thanks to our very good AnCO training schemes and to all the educational facilities that have been made available to our young population, they are on a sound footing to face the future with confidence in industrial development.  Our workers are as good as, if not better than, their European counterparts, if given a fair deal and the incentive to increase production. That incentive must be there is we are to top the scale in industrial production in Europe.  Under the capable responsibility of our Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, Deputy Bruton, and his Minister of State, Deputy Collins, that goal will be achieved.</P>
    <P>It is also necessary that the State should not milk the coffers dry as far as industrialist entrepreneurs are concerned.  They, too, must get an incentive to invest their money here and have faith in our industry. There is no gain from over-taxing or over-burdening the industralists who are willing to come here in good faith to give the necessary employment that we so badly need.  There must be an incentive for the factory owner, the managing director and assistant directors down along the line to the workforce.  All must work in harmony to ensure that industrial development will continue to prosper in the years that lie ahead.</P>
    <P>For the first time in the six years since we joined the European Monetary System our inflation rate is moving into <Col N="1347" /> line with that of our partners, a remarkable achievement of the Coalition Government.  It is amazing that such a change has been brought about by their good housekeeping.</P>

We saw the boom of the sixties which was built on sandy foundations and the depressions of the late seventies and early eighties.  We have weathered the storm remarkably well over the past three years.  With the turn of the tide let us hope that a bright future is dawning for industrial development.</P>

      <P>It should be realised that in three short years we reduced inflation from 27 per cent down to 5 per cent.  No other Government in the world has made <Col N="1348" /> such progress in such a short time.  That is why the Americans, Japanese and people of all nationalities are today turning their attention to the miracle in the Irish economy under sound leadership from the Coalition Government.  No longer have we the haphazard policies followed in the past two decades by an Opposition party that did not know which way to trun with regard to industrial development.  They brought out a manifesto in 1977 which badly affected the country's industrial and financial position, bringing it to the lowest level as far as credibility in Europe and the world was concerned.</P>
      <P>We should not, however, rest on our oars as far as reducing inflation is concerned. I appeal to our Taoiseach and his Cabinet to continue the good work which they have started and to aim at conducting their affairs in such a way that will reduce the inflation rate down to 3 per cent, a rate which prevails in more disciplined countries in the EMS.  The Opposition, when in power, did not understand the word &ldquo;discipline&rdquo;, I doubt if they understand it today.  An inflation rate of 3 per cent will play a major role in the success of our industrial expansion.  Since 1975 the output of the Irish economy has expanded by approximately 40 per cent, compared with a growth of 27 per cent in the European economy as a whole. Employment in the Irish economy is now over 60,000 greater than in 1975, despite the impact of two major international recessions and our rate of population growth, which is greater than in any other EC country.  This is a remarkable achievement in three years.</P>
      <P>Emigration was filling the bill when the Opposition were in Government over many years.  Today, although there is a certain amount of emigration, Irish youth are full of hope and courage, believing that this country in a very short time will be able to offer them ample employment when we take our place as an industrial nation amongst the greatest in Europe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I stress the necessity for good planning in relation to industrial development.  For years the policy of successive Fianna Fáil administrations was to build up and <Col N="1349" /> expand the capital city, Dublin.  It has now reached the point where over one-third of the total population of the State are living in Dublin.  Surely this showed a lack of forward planning for industrial development.  Regions throughout the west from Mizen Head to Malin Head were bereft of industries and Irish boys and girls, if not lured to the emigration ships, were lured to the bright lights of Dublin.  The city has grown at such a rate that a monster has been created.  Rural Ireland has been neglected.</P>
    <P>Bantry Bay in south-west Cork is one of the finest natural harbours in the world but is devoid of any industrial development, barring a venture in the past two years in the mariculture sphere.  It is the finest bay in western Europe, if not in the world, in which at one time Her Majesty's Government boasted they could hold the entire British fleet.  They are gone now and only the seagulls and gannets are left. This is due to the inadequate industrial policy pursued by successive Fianna Fáil administrations.  The giant tankers of the world were able to turn within the bay with little difficulty.  The natural advantages of this bay should be recognised by any Government.  There is no need to dredge the bay because there are no difficulties regarding the waters there. However, we have the major difficulty of lack of industry.  I urge the Minister to ensure that Bantry Bay is regarded as a priority area for industrial development suitable to its magnificent harbour.  The area has been badly neglected since the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Lyons talking about infrastructure and transportation in regard to industrial development.  In the early fifties his party pulled up our railway system which ran from Bantry to Cork and on to Dublin.  They sold it to some black state in Africa.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>They are a national disgrace in the way they have treated the people of south-west Cork.  They are a very tolerant people who endure that <Col N="1350" /> kind of treatment from native Governments. A certain party has had a virtual monopoly on power since the foundation of the State, but they forgot about the people of south-west Cork and cut the only life line they had by taking away the railway system.  They added insult to injury by not allowing us even one mile of national primary road.  Was that progress?</P>
      <P>The south-west and west of Ireland cannot and should not be forgotten as far as industry is concerned.  By all means let there be a free port in Cork but special concessions should also be given to industrialists attracted to Bantry Bay.  The people in that area cannot live on fresh air and cold water and those responsible must realise the importance of locating new industries there.  Bantry and west Cork are job starved.  The only new development has been in relation to mariculture and fish farming, for which I believe there is a good future.</P>
      <P>I would point out that there are two other bays in that area of south-west Cork which would be equally suitable for mariculture, namely, Dunmanus Bay and Goleen Bay.  Both of them could easily absorb to good effect an injection of funds for mariculture and fish farming.  If fish farming and mariculture were developed here to the extent that they should it would create a vast potential for employment because the market is unlimited for these products.  The Japanese are light years ahead of us as far as fish farming and mariculture are concerned.  We should take a lesson from them in regard to investment in that sphere and make sure it is given a fair share of attention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should also like to remind the Minister that Bantry Bay and Whiddy Island are the only areas in the country with ready-made facilities for the storage of crude oil.  There are mammoth storage tanks, owned by Gulf, on Whiddy Island and if and when there is a major discovery of &ldquo;black gold&rdquo; I would expect that the storage capacity on Whiddy Island will be utilised to the full, as a result of the discovery of oil wells, for redistribution of oil to other refineries in Europe.  We <Col N="1351" /> have no shipping problems in Bantry Bay.  It can cater for the biggest tanker in the world but we need industry there and I spelled out in no uncertain fashion to both Ministers this morning that I will be looking at their Departments with an eagle eye to see that development is brought to that part of the country when the time is ripe.</P>
    <P>The sooner this oil is brought ashore the better.  I urge the Minister not to be dilly-dallying in regard to oil.  We either have it or we do not.  The companies drilling for oil off our shores should ensure that proper information is given to the Government.  Delays are dangerous and many of the oil companies concerned could be sitting on this black gold until such time as it would suit them financially to bring it ashore.  The Minister must be vigilant in that respect and make sure that no delays will be allowed in bringing this benefit to the economy.</P>
    <P>I have already mentioned aid for industrialists. We should ensure that all industrialists are well vetted when they apply for IDA grants because for far too long many of them received assistance which would not have been granted if there has been a through investigation into their background.  Perhaps the Minister should consider the possibility of giving them a 50 per cent and a 50 per cent interest free loan instead of giving them <i>carte blanche</i> for development that may not yield dividends. This is a very serious matter and must be corrected.</P>
    <P>I agree for once with Deputy Lyons when he said that tourism should get the fillip it needs.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree that tourism has been treated as a Cinderella industry by successive Governments, including Fianna Fáil, over the years.  I am amazed that an industry which has such potential for employment is not geared to meet the demands which should be made on it, for instance, in relation to continental visitors coming here.  I congratulate the <Col N="1352" /> Minister and the Government for giving us the green light in relation to a financial contribution to the Swansea-Cork ferry. I hope it will be in operation soon.  I cannot see any difficulties in that regard as the financial side is secure.  If the ferry service is restored it would benefit our economy as far as tourism is concerned.</P>
      <P>I was listening to the charade which went on last night in the House regarding the closure of a factory in Mallow but, against that background, I believe that there should be a future for proper vegetable production in this country.  Everybody knows that all our vegetable factories were geared to dehydration instead of deep freezing.  It is important to realise that the market for dehydrated products has dropped practically to nil all over the world and that the market for frozen vegetables has accelerated at such a pace that it now accounts for 85 per cent of our total imports of vegetables. We must correct this in the years to come and I ask the Minister to make sure that all avenues are explored in an effort to re-open our vegetable plants in a different capacity so that maximum employment is given.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fastnet factory in Skibbereen closed under a Fianna Fáil Government. The briars and the bushes are growing around its doors but if the necessary machinery and plant had been installed for the deep freezing of vegetables it could still be a buoyant success in south-west Cork.  We must devote our energies, time and responsibilities to creating that kind of climate for industrial development. I should also like to point out that co-operation is the key note to success.  I appeal to the Opposition not to criticise the viable policies of the Government. Instead, they should row in and play their part as a constructive Opposition.  Playing party politics will not be an asset when pursuing industrial development.  Neither should party affiliation mean that a person is deprived of IDA assistance.  We had years of that.  If a person did not have strong party affiliations his chance of getting an IDA grant was nil.  I am glad that under our able leadership that say was gone forever.  A man is judged on his <Col N="1353" /> ability and on the plan he puts forward to the IDA when there is a question of receiving grant aid.  Nowadays class, creed or party affiliations do not dictate whether he obtains such aid.  Both Ministers concerned must be thanked for the clearcut policies they have set out for their Department.</P>
    <P>IDA regional directors must be given every encouragement and support to solve our industrial problems in these difficult times.  I should like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Cork regional manager, Mr. Denis McCarthy, on the magnificent work he has done.</P>

      <P>He has done magnificent work for the people in the south west.  It is up to us to forget our past differences and to work as a team to attain the targets we have set.  The two Minister responsible for the industrial revitalisation of our country have set a headline and I am proud to be associated with what they have done.  They have overcome difficulties in very difficult circumstances and on many occasions the circumstances were outside their control.  They have listened to appeals by entrepreneurs and workers and have been sympathetic in their approach.  I have no doubt they will continue with their good work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are vast opportunities in respect of the further development of our fisheries.  We should employ eight people for every fisherman but instead the ratio <Col N="1354" /> is only three to one.  We have a long way to go if we are to realise the full potential of this industry.  In supermarkets there are shelves full of brands of imported fish.  There are herrings in wine, herrings in olives and herrings in cider, all imported from Germany and other European countries.  In many case the raw product was caught off our shores, probably landed in Castletownbere, Killybegs, Burtonport or at landing centres along the western and eastern coasts, put into articulated lorries and exported to the Federal Republic of Germany where it was processed and reimported here.  It is a downright shame that our authorities and successive Fianna Fáil administrations allowed this to happen.  It was because they did not build one decent canning or smoking factory from Killybegs to Castletownbere.  They failed to capitalise on the raw materials we had and they will be indicted for generations to come for their lack of interest in the matter.</P>
    <P>In the year I was born my father exported cured mackerel to America.  He gave seasonal employment to 138 people in the little village of Goleen in the south Cork area and did that without getting one penny of State aid.  However, he worked hard; he had enthusiasm for his job and love for his country and his fellow countrymen.  There was no unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance at that time.  He had the will to survive and, if that same will had not been shared by his fellow countrymen, this State would not have been founded.  The patriots who died for the freedom of Ireland did not do so to earn the treatment that native industries have got from successive Fianna Fáil Governments.</P>

The principal element of that package, which was subsequently the subject of a formal agreement signed by the respective parties on 4 February 1985, was a commitment on the part of Gulf to rebuild the jetty at the terminal which had been severely damaged in the <i>Betelgeuse</i> disaster in January 1979.  Among other elements in the package agreed was a commitment on the part of Gulf to maintain at the terminal a quantity of 160,000 barrels of crude oil on behalf of the State.</P>
      <P>Following intensive negotiations, the Government have decided to conclude with Chevron, the ultimate owners, through their ownership of Gulf, of the Whiddy Ireland oil terminal, a new agreement which will supersede the February agreement.  The principal elements of the new agreement will be that:</P>
      <P> (a)  Chevron will pay to the State $44 million in cash in consideration of release of the obligation placed on them by the February 1985 agreement. This is additional to the $2 million paid by Chevron to the State earlier this year and</P>
      <P>(b)  Chevron will transfer ownership of all the assets of Gulf Oil Terminals (Ireland) Ltd. at Whiddy to the State. The principal asset of the company is the oil terminal, comprising jetty, tank farm and lands. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Chevron will be permitted to remove the remaining crude oil from the terminal. The necessary legal drafting work on the text of the new agreement will now get <Col N="1356" /> under way and I would expect that the document would be ready for signature in a matter of weeks.</P>
    <P>For the benefit of the House, I would like to explain the background to this matter.  Subsequent to the signing of the February agreement preparatory work for the rebuild project was set in train by all concerned.  On the part of the Government, an inter-agency co-ordinating group was established with the objectives of establishing close liaison between those Government Departments and State agencies which had an interest in the various aspects of the project in order to ensure that the reconstruction of the jetty would take full account of the findings of the Costello Tribunal of Inquiry into the 1979 disaster.</P>
    <P>The Institute of Industrial Research and Standards were retained by my Department to advise and assist those Irish companies seeking a share of the project against the background of a Gulf declaration of intent to maximise the use of Irish goods, services and personnel. On the Gulf side, a planning application was prepared and lodged in June 1985 and planning permission, although now the subject of appeal, was forthcoming from Cork County Council in August 1985.  Gulf were also engaged in the engineering design work prerequisite to a jetty re-build and in lining up potential contractors prior to selecting those who would actually do the job.  In addressing the House on 19 July 1985 in relation to the Estimates for my Department, I made reference to the fact that this type of preparatory work was then in train. Deputies may recall that the target date for completion of the rebuild project was the end of 1986.</P>
    <P>Over recent months, Gulf have been looking beyond the rebuild of the jetty at the future prospects for the terminal. They recently concluded that they now see no prospect, in current or foreseeable circumstances, of operating the terminal themselves or of attracting others to use it.  With a view to eliminating the waste of economic resources which would be involved in constructing facilities for which no commercial future could be <Col N="1357" /> seen, Gulf put forward other proposals as an alternative means of discharging their obligations to the State, while recognising at all times that the Government, on foot of the February 1985 agreement, could insist on the rebuilding of the jetty.</P>
    <P>After due consideration, Gulf's assessment of prospects for future utilisation of the terminal is accepted by the Government as being well founded.  There is currently, and is likely to be for the foreseeable future, a ready availability of vacant crude oil storage capacity at more attractive locations in other parts of Europe.  The current state of international oil movements, and current and foreseeable conditions on international oil markets, are accepted as also impacting very adversely on the outlook for future commercial use of the terminal in an international trading mode.  In the circumstances, and conscious of the fact that although the company could be obliged to rebuild the jetty, there is no means by which they could be obliged actually to operate the terminal, the Government have decided that rather than insist on Gulf rebuilding the jetty it would be preferable to accept Gulf's discharge of their liabilities to the State in a manner providing more options to the Government and greater benefit to the national interest.</P>
    <P>The choice before the Government, when considering the revised proposals which form the basis for the package I have just outlined, was a straight forward one.  The Government could have &ldquo;dug in&rdquo; and insisted that up to $60 million be spent on rebuilding the jetty notwithstanding the very bleak outlook for usage of the terminal and in the hope that at some indeterminate time in the future commercial possibilities might arise which could enable it to operate.  On the other hand, the Government could have elected, as they have done, to resolve the matter in a manner which, on the one hand takes account of international oil market realities and, on the other, maximises both the magnitude and the certainty of direct national economic benefit.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1358" /> There is no doubt that this deal is far superior, in national economic terms, to the rebuild agreement.  The terminal will be transferred to the ownership of the Irish National Petroleum Corporation, as the State's agent, and will be maintained at minimum cost by the corporation against future eventualities.  Thus the integrity of the terminal's oil storage capability will be maintained should it be required in the future, although I wish to make it quite clear that there are no plans at present for the State to put it into an operational mode.  If, however, opportunities arise in the future which hold real promise of economic utilisation of the terminal, appropriate courses of action can be considered at that time on merit and in the light of circumstances then obtaining.  The sum of money which the State will receive, in one early payment, is very substantial.  The magnitude of this receipt and the fact that it will be both early and direct compares very favourably with the indirect and short term benefits which would accrue form the reconstruction work, if that were to be undertaken in the face of the economic realities.</P>
    <P>In permitting Chevron to remove the remaining oil from the terminal, we will be taking a small drop in our level of strategic storage.  This drop in storage levels will be equivalent to about 1.5 days national oil requirements.  The burden of this is minuscule in comparison with the benefits to the State, in cash and kind, which are to be provided under the agreement. I should mention that notwithstanding any stockholding-security of supply elements in relation to the Whiddy issue my Department are in the course of conducting a comprehensive review of this country's oil stock-holding arrangements.</P>
    <P>I would also like to take this opportunity to inform the House that the INPC are shortly to conclude a crude oil supply arrangement with Chevron which will provide the INPC with an option, exercisable at any time over a two year period, to purchase a significant quantity of North Sea crude oil at attractive prices. In terms of magnitude, the quantity of <Col N="1359" /> crude oil which would be involved in this arrangement would cover by more than six times the quantity to be removed from Whiddy.</P>
    <P>It is clear that this deal is, in national terms, a very good one.  I recognise, however, that in the Bantry area, there will be disappointment at the fact that the reconstruction project will not now go ahead.  Accordingly, the Government are examining, in consultation with relevant Departments and State agencies, the prospects of promoting additional investment in the Bantry region.  As far as industrial investment is concerned, the IDA are in negotiation with prospective promoters regarding their 24,000 square feet advance factory and their two smaller factory units at 3,700 square feet each in Bantry.  The IDA will continue to promote vigorously their 7.5 acre development site in the town.  It would also be my intention to consult with local interest groups.  For reasons of confidentiality it has not been possible for me to do so heretofore, but I would welcome discussions with such groups with a view to an exchange of ideas whereby measures could be adopted to offset the loss of the rebuild project.</P>
    <P>At a more specific local level I am well aware of the fact that about 30 people are currently employed by Gulf at the Whiddy terminal.  Gulf have at no stage attempted to shirk their responsibilities to these employees and at this moment are advising them of the nature of the deal with the Government which I have just outlined.  They are also informing their employees that they will shortly initiate discussions with them as to the manner in which the company propose to discharge their responsibilities to them.</P>
    <P>Finally, bearing in mind the comments of certain Deputies on the occasion of my Department 1984 statement to the House in relation to Whiddy, and given that the deal which I have outlined today surpasses, in terms of national economic advantage, the deal which I outlined then, I wish to state emphatically now, as I did then, that this deal involves no &ldquo;trade off&rdquo; or &ldquo;back room&rdquo; arrangement <Col N="1360" /> of any kind in any other policy area.  The proposals which form the basis of this deal were advanced and negotiated on their own merits, and exclusively in the context of the rights and obligations of the State and Chevron in respect of the Whiddy facilities.</P>
    <P>Before concluding, I want to pay tribute to the Secretary of my Department and the other officials involved in these negotiations.  Without their skill, dedication and commitment, the outcome would not have been as successful as it has been.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>Springing items like this on the House at such short notice is a very poor way to do business, particularly to deal with a matter of such magnitude. On 12 December 1984, we spoke here about a deal to rebuild Whiddy involving a $60 million package.  The short notice given at that time coupled with today's announcement does not augur well so far as doing business is concerned because there is very little time for those concerned to read through the script and try to make a sensible evaluation of the arrangement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's announcement is a sad and disappointing blow to the Bantry area and to the Cork region generally.  It is very disappointing, too, in terms of national confidence and also in terms of the confidence with which the Minister made the announcement in 1984.  Confidence in our total offshore oil exploration business must have waned significantly since then.  When the Minister made his statement to the House on that last occasion, I expressed two grave reservations about the deal.  I expressed apprehension about the confidence with which the Minister announced that a job of such magnitude, costing about $60 million and providing 250 jobs in construction and 100 permanent jobs thereafter, would be in operation by the end of 1986.  I said then that nobody in his right senses would make that sort of announcement with such confidence having regard to the various aspects, such as planning permission and so on that would have to be dealt with before the work could begin.  I called <Col N="1361" /> then for the implementation in full of the Costello recommendations and I said that the work could not be completed within the period outlined.</P>
    <P>My second reservation was even more serious.  It related to the timing of the announcement.  I had good reasons for doubting the figure of $60 million because, under the foreshore lease that Gulf had got from the Government originally, they had a legal obligation to rebuild the jetty to its former status.  At that time I made the House aware that actions resulting from the explosion on the <i>Betelgeuse</i> were about to be heard in the High Court in London.  I expressed the view then that the figure being mentioned for the development could be used legitimately to bolster up compensation claims in that court case for Gulf Oil. The rebuilding was to involve a mooring system rather than the original system, in other words, it would accommodate smaller tankers without the need to incur the very significant expenditure that would be involved in restoring the jetty to its original form.</P>
    <P>Therefore, for a much smaller investment than the figure mentioned then, the job could have been done.  This contention is based on estimates I had drawn up during my time in the Department in 1982 and at a time when Gulf were thinking of pulling out.  We were all only too well aware that the announcement about the agreement was prepared for a devastated region in the run up to the local elections.</P>
    <P>The reservations I expressed in 1984 have proved to be correct.  Subsequently the High Court actions were settled in London and I have little doubt that the arrangement reached with the Irish Government for a $60 million package played a significant part in the level of the compensation awarded to Gulf in settlement of the case.</P>
    <P>On one or two occasions since I have pressed the Minister to tell us how soon the operation would be got under way. After a considerable time, planning permission was applied for to Cork County Council but that matter has not been finalised yet.  However, what is more important is to ask what has happened in <Col N="1362" /> the whole oil industry since.  Such big corporations as Gulf do not take major decisions lightly.  They look well ahead into the future as to what their strategic corporate planning ought to be before committing themselves to such expenditure. One must ask, therefore, what has resulted in their changing their minds. They have got their adequate compensation so one must ask what has changed in the internal operations of Gulf Cheveron.</P>
    <P>As we know, Gulf have been taken over in the meantime by Chevron for a sum in the region of $13 billion so we are now dealing with a much larger corporation. Many changes have taken place in the Gulf operation since they were taken over by Chevron.  If they had not made up their minds on their long term strategic planning at that stage, changes would have taken place in relation to the package, but they proceeded to apply for the planning permission.  We know that the price of oil has dropped in the meantime but a corporation of the size of Gulf Chevron do not have much regard to hiccups in the market in the short term.</P>
    <P>When I raised this matter before I sought the memorandum of agreement and I am grateful to the Minister for having lodged the document subsequently in the Library of the House. The agreement contained a couple of release clauses.  One of these confirmed the doubts I had then.  It was that the Government would assist Gulf Chevron in selling the lease.  I thought that a very strange clause to include in an agreement if the intention was to rebuild the terminal at a cost of $60 million.  However, it appears that Gulf Chevron have changed their minds and have pulled out of the original agreement, though their legal obligation was to restore the jetty to its original status.</P>
    <P>In 1982 the cost of that operation was estimated for me at between £30 million and £35 million but I suppose today's price lines up with that.  At that stage we were enjoying a reserve of one million barrels of oil as part of our strategic oil reserves.  That is why we must consider all the factors involved.  First, we are to <Col N="1363" /> receive $44 million but I see no mention here of the cost to the State of replacing the one million barrels of oil.  The terminal is to be handed over to the Irish National Petroleum Corporation.  The Minister tells us that the only effect on our strategic oil reserves will be a drop in the form of 1.5 day's national storage.  Is that based on the new part of the strategic oil reserves which was represented by 160,000 barrels as a result of the original agreement or does it represent the replacement of one million barrels?  One way or the other, there will be a huge cost to someone in the State.</P>
    <P>There is no indication that any oil company supplying the Irish market will be asked to take up the additional burden of keeping our national oil reserve up to the strategic level as we are obliged to do, not only for our own reasons, but in compliance with EC regulations.  From where will it be replaced?  Who will replace it?  How much will it cost?  That is another element of this deal.  If we have to purchase one million barrels of oil today it will cost a minimum of $25 or $26 a barrel, that is $25 million or $26 million.  If we take that amount from the cash flow of $44 million, the deal does not look half as attractive.  When we deduct the cost of maintaining those strategic oil reserves, the cash flow dwindles even lower.  Is the deal as good as it is being presented here today?</P>
    <P>The most important aspect of this matter is that it is a bad blow for the Bantry area, the Cork region, for national confidence as far as international investors are concerned and, probably most important, it is a bad blow to the future expectations of our off shore oil explorations.  Taking the last agreement in good faith, I would have thought that a strategic link-in to the expectation of finding oil off our shores, having it refined at Whitegate and stored in Bantry Bay&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Deputy Skelly said another multinational is pulling out.  I am not here to run the multinationals out of this country, although he may be.  We will need multinational investment for a long time to come.  I would like to think we are at the stage of development where <Col N="1366" /> we could do everything ourselves, but we are not.  The multinationals are involved in off shore exploration and I would have thought this was part of a national strategy, coming together with Whitegate on the one hand, and Whiddy oil terminal on the other with, hopefully, successful oil exploration off our shores to get the greatest benefit for our people.  I cannot see what changed in the world outside when Gulf entered into an agreement to rebuild this terminal.  They know, and everybody has known for a number of years that oil prices would be soft for a number of years to come.  Those people do not make investment decisions on the basis of two or three years ahead.  At that stage they obviously saw great potential off our shores and decided to rebuild this terminal and make good use of it.</P>
      <P>I do not accept part of the Minister's statement that there have been dramatic changes because it was known at that time that we would not be taking huge oil tankers into Whiddy.  The basis of the planning for which they had applied was for the small tankers and a buoy system which, as I already said, is a cheap way of doing it, and that basis still remains as valid today as it was then.  What we will be doing is taking in oil from off shore Ireland, hopefully in the future, refining it at Whiddy, storing, transferring and trans-shipping it.</P>
      <P>No matter what anybody says, the natural assets of Bantry Bay will not be easily found anywhere else in Europe and for small tanker trans-shipment it is ideally placed to service the north European market.  We all hear about the expectancy of Europe to be as self-sufficient from an energy point of view as they can, and if we successfully brought oil ashore we could establish our own markets in north Europe and trans-ship it in small tankers from the Whiddy oil terminal. Nothing in that scenario has changed since this agreement was signed originally.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What is the reason for this?  I do not know because it has not been made clear in the Minister's statement.  All I can say is that this is either a vote of no confidence in our oil industry or else 12 months ago <Col N="1367" /> we were conned into an agreement which was brought forward for a specific reason &mdash; to get compensation in the High Court in London and subsequently to use it for a different purpose.</P>
    <P>I have already dealt with the $44 million.  I admit it is a welcome boost to any Government but what will the outgoing be nationally?  As I said, we will lose 150 jobs, 100 permanent jobs; we will lose our strategic £1 million and the renegotiated level of 160,000 barrels.  We have not been told in this statement from where the strategic reserve will be replaced at what cost to the State the INPC or whoever will store it for us, or if other oil companies in the market place are going to take on an additional burden. One way or another we must preserve our strategic reserve.  There are no free lunches.  Somebody has to pay, and this has not been made clear so far.  In the light of those remarks I am saying that this $44 million may be attractive at the outset, but it will become less attractive as we make subtractions.  I am not in a position to do all the subtractions but I have outlined what I believe are the obvious ones and there may be more hidden subtractions that I do not know about.</P>
    <P>Chevron will be permitted to remove the remaining crude from the terminal. Who will replace this and at what cost? In his statement the Minister said that over recent months Gulf had been looking beyond the rebuilding of the jetty and the future prospect for the terminal.  I dealt with that adequately but I cannot see that any changes have taken place since they decided they were going to rebuild it.  The Minister also said that the future utilisation of the terminal is as clear now as it was originally &mdash; I have also dealt with that statement.  He said the bleak outlook for the use of the terminal is not a vote of confidence in what we expect to do with the oil off our shores.</P>
    <P>The Minister said he could have dug in.  I was not a part of the negotiations and I have to take what the Minister <Col N="1368" /> says on trust, that he got the best deal available.  I have already referred to my doubts.  What do INPC intend to do with it?  Apparently they are going in as caretakers. What will happen the existing jobs at Bantry?  Will the people be paid off by Gulf?  Will anybody be employed by INPC or will they just become a national monument?  What are the Government proposals?  Will the Government go abroad to recruit the people who were interested in 1982, the people in the North African oil companies, and the private interests in Saudi Arabia who were interested in taking portion of it for strategic storage for the North European area.</P>
    <P>There is nothing in the statement to show that the Government know where they are going.  I wonder now fast this was thrown at them.  However, we will have to use a different occasion in this House to try to extract the information which I must get before I can say conclusively that this is a good deal.  I cannot say that it is a good deal for the reasons outlined.  I do not want to be seen as obstructing any development, but it is sad that the development which the people in the Bantry area looked for will not take place.  It is unfortunate that people who thought they could earn their living there have been dealt a body blow today.</P>
    <P>For whatever reasons the multinational companies have decided that Ireland is not for them for future oil exploration or for exploration of our oil potential, for some time to come.  When all the factors are taken into consideration, they have bought their way out rather cheaply.  It is easy to say that, not having made the deal.  However, there is no doubt that they have specific legal obligations under the original foreshore lease to restore it to its former status and they were getting away with restoring it to part of its status.  The legal obligations were quantified for me in 1982 at about $35 million.  When I see the other factors that I have to take from that $44 million, I can only conclude that at the end of the day we are not getting a lot out of it and it is a bad blow to the hopes of Cork, Bantry and the national oil scene.</P>

      <P>I am not happy with the statement made by the Minister, and nobody could be happy with it.  Last December we welcomed the Minister's statement in regard to the agreement that was made but pointed out that it was only a memorandum of understanding which could probably be changed by Chevron. The Minister has put a very nice gloss on what has occurred, but it is fairly obvious that, once Chevron changed their minds and offered $44 million, the Minister and the Government jumped at the chance of the money and accepted the pay-off.  The Minister's statement does not indicate that the Government went deeply into this.  They certainly have not explained their thinking about what has occured in the House.</P>
      <P>As Deputy Reynolds said, Chevron have changed their minds, but why? What occurred in the past 12 or six months to make them change their minds?  Surely when agreeing to build the jetty, Chevron must have looked beyond the rebuilding of the jetty to the future prospects for the terminal before offering to put up $60 million.  It was not that they put up $60 million to build the jetty and then started to look at future prospects for the terminal.  They are not that stupid. The Minister has now accepted Chevron's assessment of the prospects for future utilisation of the terminal as being well founded, but the Minister does not explain how he has come to that conclusion.</P>
      <P>What new decisions have been made in regard to the Irish market by the multinationals? It is nonsense for Deputy Skelly to say that the multinationals are pulling out.  They run the oil business and control it more than they ever did.  All they are doing is refusing to pay in anything while they are continuing to take out profits.  For a start they are saving at least $16 million on this deal.  While they are making big money they will not pull out, but they have stopped putting anything into the economy.  What decisions have been made in regard to the Irish market?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Has the discovery of so-called now commercial quantities of oil off the Irish <Col N="1370" /> coast anything to do with this deal?  Has it been based on any decisions as to what would occur if commercial quantities of oil were discovered in the Celtic Sea? Have Chevron and Gulf made a decision that such a discovery would be brought ashore not in Ireland but in Milford Haven and elsewhere?  Is that one of the considerations as to why they now see no further use for Bantry and for the jetty? Have they decided to save themselves $16 million by offering this Government who are hard up for cash, $44 million now?  The offer of cash now rather than cash or jobs later has been very much emphasised by the Minister.</P>
    <P>The Government jumped at this hastily and neither the people in Cork nor Bantry are happy with it.  No matter what gloss the Minister puts on it, $60 million would have gone into the Bantry area in the provision of jobs and into consumer spending in that area.  What will happen to the $44 million?  It will go into the big open pit of debt.  The Minister says he will look at the situation to see the alternatives, and we all know what that means.  In terms of jobs and in terms of an asset for the State and in terms of our oil storage capacity, our strategic needs, our future prospects of oil being discovered a few miles off Bantry, nothing has been taken into consideration by the Government in this deal which seems to be just a simple cash deal, as Deputy Reynolds said.</P>
    <P>Any reasonable examination of this deal will show that our future interests are not really taken into consideration. It is all right to say that the current conditions on international markets are accepted as impacting very adversely on the outlook for future commercial use of the terminal in an international trading mould, but that is accepting that there will not be changes and that there are not oil prospects in the Irish market and that the current state of the market will not change over the next five or ten years. There is a very volatile situation in the international oil market and it could change in the next two years.  These are not sufficient reasons.  The Minister has not given sufficient evidence that the <Col N="1371" /> Government have given thought to this. We must accept that they have jumped for the cash and that it is a very bad day for the Cork area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am deeply shocked at the news which has been conveyed to the House about Chevron deciding not to go ahead with their project in Bantry Bay. As a Deputy who lives close to Bantry I know only too well the vacuum that will leave in the area.  This announcement has confirmed the fears which I expressed at an area roads meeting of Cork County Council in Glengarriff last Friday week when I made a plea to the bodies concerned who had appealed against the decision of Cork County Council, to withdraw their appeal from An Bord Pleanála in the interests of faith and goodwill, to let proper dialogue ensue between all parties concerned and not to inhibit in any way this valuable industry that we are looking forward to.</P>
      <P>It is amazing to think that a few years ago an oil refinery project which was on the cards for that area was bedevilled with objections that played the issue out for two and a half years before it was decided finally, and the world scene had changed so much by that time that the project was abandoned.  I am sorry that we are seeing a repetition of that now in view of the fact that Cork County Council as a planning authority had imposed the most stringent conditions on the planning permission that was issued to Chevron about four months ago.  All the conditions were incorporated in the findings of the Costello Tribunal and I am sorry that the assurance given by that reputable body were not adhered to or taken up by the people concerned who object to that very valuable industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I realise that every citizen has a right to <Col N="1372" /> object to and appeal against any planning decision.  This is a democratic right laid down in the Planning Acts and it gives the opportunity to every person in this country &mdash; he need not be a national &mdash; to object to any development which he sees fit to object to.  I am not placing all the blame on the section who objected to this development.  I know only too well how unscrupulous multinational oil companies can be.  We have seen in this instance that Gulf Oil came in and established the storage depot on Whiddy Island and for years enjoyed the facility of the finest bay in the world&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I think Chevron would have gone ahead if they had got the green light when the permission was given by the council. However, I was speaking to a member of the company about three weeks ago and he expressed grave fears and doubts as to the future development of the project. Taking all the opposition to it into consideration, if the objections were dealt with even by An Bord Pleanála, who had agreed to hold an oral hearing on 21 January, and they gave the green light to Chevron on that occasion, the objectors still had the right to appeal that decision to the High Court, and years could pass before a decision would be given.  Every Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism must face this in his capacity in that Ministry.</P>
      <P>It is sad for the country, and particularly for south-west Cork, that this industry is not going ahead.  The Exchequer would gain to the tune of £40 million according to the agreement&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A proper refinery must be built there in the near future.  We need action, not false promises.  As a result of the decision of Chevron the Government should give special attention to the Bantry Bay area. Serious consideration should be given to establishing a free port there.  We are entitled to such treatment as a result of the serious setback we received today. We will not stand idly by like Opposition Deputies did when in Government.  We must continue the fight to ensure that industries are placed in Bantry.  I will be vehement in my approach to Ministers in future in seeking special treatment for that underdeveloped area.</P>

      <P>It is important that fish processing industries are established on the west, eastern and south-eastern coasts.  We should utilise our natural resources to the fullest.  It is amazing to think that the herrings in brine imported from Holland are caught in Bantry Bay or Kenmare Bay.  We must explore the possibility of establishing fish processing plants adjacent to our fishing ports.  We must foster and develop such activity.  There will not be rapid growth in industrialisation here unless we harness our natural resources and ensure that they are utilised to the fullest extent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the matter of mariculture and fishing, we could and should take a lesson from our northern neighbours in Iceland <Col N="1377" /> and the Faroes.  These people depend completely on their fishing which they have made a very lucrative industry.  We are only skimming the surface here as far as the development of our fisheries and mariculture is concerned.  I hope that there will be an emphasis in future on industrial development along our western seaboard.</P>
    <P>Another area that could be developed is our mineral wealth.  At the turn of the century there was a very important mining industry in existence here.  There were copper mines dotted all along the south-west coast and the western coastline which gave very valuable employment. Was a proper evaluation ever made of our mineral resources since the foundation of this State?</P>

      <P>The previous speaker moved from complete satisfaction to utter frustration, like a pendulum, many times.  I would refer to one point he made about party favouritism where the IDA are concerned.  In my experience as a public representative, I have never met party favouritism there.  Many an accusation I made against the IDA as regards favouritism within regions, but not party favouritism.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that there was no point in making excuses about excessive energy prices, declining markets and competition from low wage-cost countries. That statement is simplistic from an energy point of view.  The high cost of energy has left us, in many phases of our industrial development, at a severe disadvantage.  The Minister said also that the development of our telecommunications services continues at full pace. That sounds very hollow to people who have not yet got an automatic telephone service.  I have met industrialists almost daily who have great complaints in this regard.  In the Border town of Clones there are a few very extensive industries, one whose product is completely export-orientated, and it is a very valuable industry, with fairly high technology.  The greatest problems that beset these people concern the telephone service.</P>

While we must admit that a great deal of money is being spent on our national primary and secondary routes which are fairly heavily funded from the EC, to industrialise the area, as the previous speaker advocated, more money will have to be provided, not alone for these routes but for the county roads and main roads.  Further the Minister talked about creating and maintaining the maximum number of jobs, maximising value added in industry and maintaining the wealth created for further employment.  While good strides have been made in value-added industry, much more could be done.  There are many areas which need to be closely examined.  Some years ago a survey was done for the eighties, but we are not meeting the targets.  In my area a number of entrepreneurs have made some very successful ventures into value added, as have the co-ops, but there must be greater urgency.  The Minister mentioned the necessity to promote the rapid development of our natural resource-based industry.  It is regrettable that our forests are not used to the best advantage. Almost all our tanneries have been closed and hides are sent elsewhere for processing.</P>
    <P>In my area there is a problem of imports of concrete products from across the Border.  While we are in favour of free trade and integration, the serious disadvantages of the manufacturers in my area must be emphasised.  Within the EC there should not be such serious inequities. Grogan Associates published a report in September 1985 on the import of concrete and quarry products from Northern Ireland.  In the five counties along the Border, 35 per cent of stone, gravel and sand is imported, while 31 per cent of concrete blocks and ready mix concrete is also imported.  In one year 35,000 tonnes of precast concrete were imported.  We are asking the Department to consider giving assistance to our local industries on a similar basis to the assistance being given across the Border.</P>
    <P>The problems which beset our industries <Col N="1381" /> must be recognised.  Twenty per cent of the market for paving slabs, coping, cattle slabs, floor units, flags, kerbs, bollards, drinking troughs and lintels is being filled by imports.  Between 9,000 and 11,000 tonnes of concrete piping is being imported per year which represents 10 per cent of the total market requirement. People north of the Border have a great advantage in that their electricity prices are 25-40 per cent lower than ours. Cement prices are also lower.  The declared value of concrete blocks imported in 1984 was £760,000, representing 96,000 tonnes.  Imports of tarmacadam for the first five months of 1985 amounted to 13,000 tonnes.  The market for roof tiles is filled by imports to the extent of 90 per cent.</P>
    <P>It is time to consider the question of unfair competition.  Our industries in these counties cannot continue to operate at such a disadvantage.  Concrete product manufacturing plants and batching plants are now being set up across the Border in the same way as petrol pumps were set up some years ago, specifically to cater for cross-Border trade.  The manufacture of concrete products in areas just south of the Border will come to an end.  It is estimated that 400 or 500 jobs have already been lost.  The people in the North have been grant-aided over the past four years to the tune of £76 million, but there has been no grant-aid here.  In the North they have capital grants of up to 30 per cent on new buildings, machinery and equipment.</P>
    <P>The Minister must consider this question very carefully.  We are denying our own people the opportunity to operate successfully in business.  They spent a lot of money setting up a structure to cater for a market but, through no fault of their own, they have become completely uncompetitive because they are not getting the incentives which are being given north of the Border.  If such incentives were paid, the outlay would be more than recouped by the additional jobs created.</P>
    <P>The Minister mentioned our natural resources.  If we are serious in our approach to industry we will have to consider all our natural resources including <Col N="1382" /> turbary, afforestation and quarries. There is no point in trying to attract foreign industrialists while we leave our resources untapped.  The Minister mentioned the national linkage programme as being one of the most important incentives to job creation.  I agree that it is very important and I pay tribute to CTT, IIRS and other bodies who are doing so much for the development of the economy.</P>
    <P>Previous speakers mentioned the timber industry.  The forest product of the area I represent is exported and then imported as pallets, fencing posts, fencing, box timber, etc.  A report on the timber industry indicated the potential for development and the types of industry which should be set up.  It is time the IDA looked at the ordinary things like fencing posts and pallets rather than the high technology aspect of the timber industry. There is a massive market for these ordinary products.  In my constituency there is only one timber plant which has the necessary debarking equipment.  The IDA should look at the possibility of grant-aiding this industry as many people have asked me if there is any hope of obtaining forest timber to make pallets for fencing so that they could go into business even in a small way.  At present such timber is drawn from long distances from their area.</P>
    <P>I mentioned tanneries earlier and it is incredible that the IDA and the Department have not conducted an in-depth examination in this regard.  In October I asked the Taoiseach a question about the percentage of bovine hides exported unprocessed in 1983 and the tonnage and value of leather imported.  The reply was that total slaughterings of farm animals in 1983 was estimated at 1,260,000. Exports of unprocessed bovine hides in 1983 amounted to 29,652 tonnes and the number of hides was in the region of 1,096,000 or 87 per cent of estimated slaughterings.  In October 1983 I tabled a question regarding the steps which the Minister was taking to have all bovine hides processed in this country.  The reply was that competitiveness in the market place for leather was the critical determining factor of the extent to which <Col N="1383" /> native bovine animal hides could be processed here on a commercially viable basis.</P>
    <P>However, if other countries can process this on a commercially viable basis we should be able to do the same as we have the product.  In 1973, when I was elected to the Dáil, they were fighting tooth and nail in my constituency to retain a tannery in Ballybay.  We sought assistance at that time from the Government to no avail.  The tannery closed, the second in the county to do so, at a time when there was a meat plant in the county which had a very high slaughtering capacity.  They were exporting all their hides which entitled them to an export subsidy.  The Minister talked about development resources, job creation and employment potential but that tannery was allowed to close and there is no sign of any attempt to revive it.</P>
    <P>At present there is competition from across the Border by the Northern Ireland Industrial Development Board although they were always behind the IDA as far as the development of industry is concerned.  A factory in Clones moved over the Border with nearly all their workers because they were offered very attractive incentives.  Reading the NESC report the thinking seems to be that the designated status areas could be substantially changed.  I agree with some of the recommendations contained in the report but there is cause for concern in many areas.  I am afraid that areas which had been getting higher grant aid could lose their high designation status, particularly in the Border area.</P>
    <P>Another statistic in the report shows the problems in relation to creating jobs. It relates to the development of agriculture and I notice that in my own area employment in agriculture has dropped from 44.7 to 22.8.  Despite all the efforts that have been made by way of agricultural grants, development and so on, we cannot retain agricultural workers on the land and that is why we will have to make a greater effort in the agriculture based industries.</P>
    <P>I mentioned afforestation earlier in <Col N="1384" /> relation to small industries.  A few weeks ago I was in a builder's providers and there was a large shed there containing chipboard of various grades but I noticed that none was produced in this country. I asked a question in the Dáil regarding the tonnage and value of chipboard imported in 1984 and the tonnage and value of chipboard manufactured in this country during the same period.  The Taoiseach replied that the information available from external trade statistics related to reconstituted wood and that there was a statement attached.  He also said that information on the manufacture of that commodity was not available for reasons of confidentiality.  He went on to state that the quantity of reconstituted wood in metric tonnes made from wood wool, wood flour, wood shavings, saw dust or other wood waste amounted to 67,771 to the value of £16,745.  It made me wonder why we do not do more in this regard, especially when we realise that other countries are exporting this product in bale form to this country.</P>
    <P>After discussions with people in my constituency I tabled questions regarding fire clay bricks.  Seemingly, there are large deposits in various areas of that clay which could be used for the manufacture of bricks, fire clay and ceramics but no effort is being made to produce it.  There is even a problem in finding out information about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>Every possible effort is made to ensure that officers appointed to missions abroad are equipped with the necessary <Col N="1385" /> skills and information to enable them to assist in promoting Irish goods and services. My Department attach the highest importance to this aspect of their work. I am satisfied that our missions are providing a valuable practical service in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister not agree that more could be done in that area?  The day of social graces and social functions for diplomats should take second place to industrial promotion work in many of the embassies where we have already one-stop shops.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy uses somewhat provocative language in his question. The days of social airs and graces are well gone so far as the Irish diplomatic service are concerned.  One of their prime functions is the selling of goods and the promotion of Irish trade.  Of course, there are other agencies who have that responsibility: in this connection I refer to Córas Tráchtála and others.  Where they are established in the country the role of the embassy becomes secondary, but where there is no CTT presence the first obligation of the embassy is to explore possibilities to create markets or expand them for Irish goods and services. They do that effectively in many areas of the world but it is not practical in some areas.</P>
      <P>For instance, the embassy in America is situated in Washington but that is not the prime area for selling our goods and services.  However, CTT are in other American cities.  Obviously more could be done if I had more resources available to me.  If the Deputy would vote for more taxes to allow me to have those resources, I should be very glad to open embassies and missions throughout the world to sell more goods.  In an open economy such as ours, the surest way to eliminate unemployment is to sell our goods.  I should be very glad to have the support of the House in opening new embassies and giving an unqualified mandate to the officers manning the embassies to sell our goods and services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy that there is huge potential for exports to developing countries in the Third World. Again, we come back to the matter of resources.  It might mean shutting embassies in other parts of the world and transferring personnel.  For instance, we do not have a resident ambassador in the area between Washington and Buenos Aires, a vast stretch of territory that offers enormous potential for exports.  It is a question of stretching the cloth as far as possible.  South-east Asia is another area of great wealth and with great potential for our exports and for the sale of Irish services.  We have limited representation there, even though we have resident ambassadors in parts of south-east Asia. I wish we were more strongly represented on the ground there.  In the meantime, we are doing the best we can.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government have made representations to the British authorities on behalf of individual prisoners requesting transfers, when it was judged that there were convincing reasons justifying such requests.</P>
      <P>The British Government have indicated their willingness in principle to consider particular requests for which there are compelling humanitarian reasons and have agreed to transfers in certain cases.  I am conscious of the hardship experienced by the families of some of these prisoners and I will continue to take up cases which seem to me to have merit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not sure what the Deputy means in the second half of his supplementary question.  In the ten-year period since 1975 four prisoners were sent back to Northern Ireland and in the past week one prisoner, Shane O'Doherty, was sent back.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister accept that is a reasonable response over a ten-year period and that it shows goodwill on the part of the British authorities? Will the Minister not accept that British soldiers convicted of offences in Northern <Col N="1388" /> Ireland are returned to prisons in Britain and does he not think there should be a reciprocal arrangement?  I ask him to make a case for all Irish prisoners who wish to come back to prisons in Northern Ireland.  He stated in his reply that he was aware of the cost and inconvenience to relatives.  I put it to him that Irish relatives have to travel at great inconvenience and expense and they may not gain admission to the prisons.  I had that experience this summer when I almost did not gain admission to Brixton prison. If the Anglo-Irish agreement is to work, both countries must consider this aspect on humanitarian grounds.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I accept what the Deputy has said, that this must be considered on humanitarian grounds.  While I have sympathy for him in that he nearly missed his visit to Brixton prison, I have far more sympathy for the mothers, brothers and sisters who go to England to see a relative and find when they arrive that he has been transferred to another prison.  I am told there are good security reasons for doing this and for not informing relatives before they leave Ireland that the prisoners have been moved.  I do not think the comparison made by the Deputy between British soldiers being transferred back to England and the people who are convicted in England is a valid comparison in every case.  In some instances there are genuine humanitarian reasons why prisoners who are convicted of crime in Britain should be returned to Northern Ireland.  Where I am satisfied there are genuine humanitarian reasons I will follow the matter up, as I have done in a number of cases.  Of course, I wish I had more success.</P>

Where it would have relevance is in respect of the return of Irish prisoners to this jurisdiction. We have not signed the convention. The Government are considering it. There are practical considerations involved here.

In addition to individual applications the Government have admitted groups of refugees such as those from Hungary in 1956, Chile in 1974 and Vietnam in 1979-81.

In the normal course of events my Department receive Amnesty International's views on human rights issues including those in Sri Lanka.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 19 together.  The Government welcome the outcome of the Geneva Summit between President Reagan and Secretary Gorbachev which we regard as a starting point for a more consistent and predictable super-power relationship.</P>
      <P>It has been our consistent belief that a process or realistic dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union is an essential prerequisite for more secure and stable international relations.  Therefore, we attach particular importance to the agreement at Geneva on the Establishment of a framework for the US-Soviet dialogue by means of further summit meetings planned for 1986 and 1987, as well as by regular meetings of Foreign Ministers and by other high level contacts.</P>
      <P>While we recognise the serious differences which persist between the two countries, we hope that the fresh start heralded by the Summit will have a positive impact on the overall climate of East-West relations.  We hope, too, that it will provide the necessary impetus to progress both in the bilateral negotiations on nuclear and space weapons at Geneva, and in the multilateral negotiations taking place in other arms control and disarmament fora.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are pleased that the two leaders have agreed to accelerate the peace of the negotiations at the Geneva talks and that they have endorsed the principle of reductions of 50 per cent in their strategic nuclear forces as well as the idea of an interim agreement on their medium range nuclear forces.  We also note with satisfaction their declared intention to <Col N="1393" /> work with other interested countries to enhance the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to strengthen the nuclear non-proliferation regime, as well as their commitment to advance the work at the Stockholm Conference on Confidence &mdash; and Security-building Measures and Disarmament in Europe and to accelerate efforts to conclude a convention to ban chemical weapons.</P>
    <P>We have noted the generally positive assessment of the Summit given by representatives of both Governments who have briefed us at official level on the discussions.  It is our hope that the meeting will lead to concrete progress, not only in the field of arms control and disarmament but also in all aspects of the relationship between the two countries and in the broader East-West dialogue, notably in the framework of the CSCE.</P>
    <P>As regards Ireland's role and contribution in the general area of nuclear disarmament, the Deputy will be aware that successive Irish Governments have voiced their deep concern at the dangers inherent in the continued growth in armaments, both nuclear and conventional. We see reliance on nuclear weapons as a poor foundation for the maintenance of international peace and security.  Within the United Nations framework we consistently pursue, to the extent possible, practical and realistic measures to halt the nuclear arms race.  To this end we endeavour, together with other likeminded countries, to influence the nuclear weapons States to work towards arms control and reductions with a view to the achievement of complete and general disarmament.</P>
    <P>Central to the Government's activity in the field of nuclear disarmament has been the promotion of the goals set out in the Non-Proliferation Treaty, namely to halt the nuclear arms race and to prevent the wider dissemination of nuclear weapons capability.  In this respect the recently concluded Third Review Conference of the parties to the NPT has been a particular focus on the Government's efforts.</P>
    <P>I addressed the opening session of this conference, which adopted a consensus <Col N="1394" /> final document to which the Irish delegation made a substantial contribution. In my address to the conference I proposed the introduction of a moratorium or freeze on nuclear testing by all the nuclear weapons States as a basis for, and as a concomitant to, negotiations on the conclusion of a comprehensive test ban treaty.  The Government attach considerable importance to a CTBT which is the one disarmament measure singled out in the NPT.  In our view, conclusion of such a treaty would make the further technical development of nuclear weapons more difficult and thus tend to reduce the emphasis on nuclear arms in international security.  Moreover, it would prevent the emergence of new nuclear weapons States.  At the conference Ireland also tabled an appeal on behalf of the non-nuclear weapons States to the nuclear weapons States parties to commence negotiations leading to the conclusion of a CTBT.  The Irish delegation at the United Nations General Assembly continue to pursue these goals.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Geneva Summit took place only a couple of weeks ago so there would be no progress in the meantime beyond what was achieved up to then.  On the prospect of a reduction in nuclear arms as a result of the Geneva Summit, all I can say is that the two Leaders have met.  The briefing we received from the Ambassador here on <Col N="1395" /> behalf of the Soviet Union and from the US Under-Secretary of State who came to Ireland to brief us on behalf of the American Government, is that both Leaders are hopeful that the Summit will lead to some reduction in nuclear arms. Obviously, the fact that both men met and talked was an advance on what had been the case for some years up to then when they were not meeting or talking. The fact also that at the end of the meeting they both acknowledged that there were serious difficulties but that both expressed a determination to continue, both at foreign affairs level and at Government level, those meetings in 1986 and 1987 is an indication at least of their goodwill and, I believe, of their determination to bring about the reduction so much desired not only by the Deputy and I but by everyone else in the world in order to remove the threat of the appalling holocaust that hangs over all our heads as a result of the relationship between the two super-powers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I have set out the views of the Government on the question of a <Col N="1399" /> unilateral ban on trade with South Africa on a number of occasions most recently when replying to a question on 5 November last.</P>
      <P>The view of the Government is that, for pressure on South Africa to be effective, broad international agreement is required on measures such as the strength ening of the existing arms import embargo, the introduction of an oil embargo and a ban on new investment in South Africa and the Government will continue to seek international agreement on the adoption of such measures.</P>
      <P>The question of derogation from the terms of either the EC Treaty or the GATT has not arisen.  The Government's aim is to bring maximum pressure to bear on the South African Government to abandon their policy of apartheid and institute a dialogue with representatives of the black community.  I wish to assure the Deputy that policy towards South Africa is kept constantly under review with this aim in mind.  Whatever appropriate measures are required in pursuit of this policy, as determined by the Government, will be taken.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>The reason this question is on today's Order paper is that in his reply of 5 November the Minister indicated that a unilateral boycott of South African goods could be in contravention of the GATT and EC Treaties, and in a further answer of 27 November he indicated the articles involved.  Would he say whether they have sought, or intend to seek, or have even considered seeking, derogation from the articles of the treaties referred to in view of the fact that the South African régime are still exporting goods to Ireland, that the apartheid régime is clearly repugnant to the majority in this country and that there would be widespread support for a unilateral boycott of goods?</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is under a slight misapprehension.  We do not intend to seek derogation from our EC or GATT obligations.  Ariticle 36 of the EC Treaty allows us to ban the <Col N="1400" /> importation of certain goods for reasons of public morality, public security or health of animal, plant and human health.  It cannot be done for political or trade reasons.  There is a subparagraph in Article 36 which says it cannot be done for protectionist reasons.  Even if we could introduce measures to ban South African goods, it would be ineffective while there is free movement of goods throughout the Community.  What we want is Community action or worldwide action if this is to be truly effective, and that is what we should be aiming at.  We should consistently seek to strengthen the measures which have been taken on a worldwide and on a Community basis and, if I may say so, we have been modestly successful in doing that in the EC in the past few months.</P>

      <P>I have no wish to deny the Minister's efforts in this area but, in view of the widespread effect which the action taken by 11 young people in Dublin had in raising the consciousness of apartheid in Ireland and abroad, similar unilateral action taken by the Irish Government could have the effect of galvanising international support in the same direction.  While every effort should be made to have agreed moves in this area, where this is failing, unilateral action is called for.</P>

I am sure every Deputy will join me in condemning that régime and we will seek to alleviate the suffering of the majority in the most practical way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The first ever ministerial meeting on economic matters between Ministers from the European Community and Ministers from ASEAN, Association of South-East Asian Nations, countries, with the participation of Portugal and Spain, took place in Bangkok, Thailand, on 17-18 October 1985.  Ireland was represented at this meeting by my colleague, Deputy J. O'Keeffe, Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.  The Bangkok meeting originated from a decision taken at a meeting of European Community and ASEAN Foreign Ministers held in Dublin on 15-16 November 1984.  The informal Bangkok meeting was designed to provide an opportunty to take stock of co-operation between the two regions on the completion of the first five years of EC-ASEAN Co-operation Agreement and to consider how relations between them could be broadened and further strengthened.  The EC-ASEAN Co-operation Agreement, which was signed at Kuala Lumpur on 7 March 1980, provides for co-operation in the fields of trade, economic co-operation and development co-operation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In Bangkok the Ministers held extensive discussions on economic relations between the two regions.  They noted that trade between them had developed and diversified considerably since the agreement came into effect and that development aid provided by the European Community had also increased.  However, they also noted that, although the EC is an important economic partner, its share of ASEAN markets and of foreign investment in the region is not increasing as fast as that of other major <Col N="1402" /> industrialised countries.  It was, therefore, agreed that a major effort would be made to strengthen the European presence in the ASEAN region throughout a comprehensive and concerted approach. As part of this process, they decided to set up a high level working party to examine investment conditions in the two regions, and to study ways and means of facilitating European investment in the ASEAN region, especially by small and medium-sized enterprises.</P>
    <P>They also decided to expand co-operation between the two regions in a number of areas.  These include provision by the European Community of training facilities in the fields of aviation, business management and executive training, and public administration; co-operation in scientific and technological research; energy co-operation; and tourism co-operation. The Community will also organise a series of trade fairs and seminars in ASEAN capitals in 1987 and 1988.</P>
    <P>As far as Irish exports are concerned, Córas Tráchtála intend to take advantage of the major effort planned to strengthen the European presence in the ASEAN region by organising at least two trade missions to the area during 1986.  The ASEAN region has been designated by CTT as an area of special interest.  CTT sponsored two trade missions there in 1985, one for merchandise, expected to yield £13 million in business, and a second for services.  In 1984, Irish exports to the ASEAN region were valued at £48.5 million, an increase of 8 per cent on the 1983 level of £45 million, while imports were worth £93 million, a 32 per cent increase on the 1983 level of £70 million. The increase in imports was mainly accounted for by a sharp increase in imports from Singapore.  The planned extension of EC-ASEAN co-operation into the fields of training and human resources development and tourism will also present opportunities for Irish State-sponsored bodies, such as Aer Lingus, Aer Rianta, the Institute of Public Administration and Bord Fáilte and for bodies providing training in business <Col N="1403" /> management to increase their involvement in the ASEAN region.</P>

      <P>As the Deputies probably know, there is a Bill before the Houses of Congress in the US about immigration.  Like virtually all Bills which have been promoted there in the last number of years it contains a clause about amnesty.  The chance of this becoming law is slim.  Many other Bills which came before Congress, either at the stage in the House of Representatives or the Senate, did not pass into law.  Without being categoric about it the assumption is that this will not become law, but it does contain a provision about amnesty.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very conscious of the points being made by the Deputy. Neither I nor anybody else knows how many Irish people are in that situation. The Deputies should understand that one cannot regularise a situation for Irish immigrants only.  As far as the US authorities are concerned they would have to consider all nationalities.  Even if the top figure suggested for Irish immigrants is correct other countries nearer the United States could give figures ten, 20 or even 100 times as large.  The US must behave in an even-handed fashion to all immigrants, so there would be an enormous amount of regularisation for all nationalities. That might be difficult.  I am not sure what can be done if this Bill fails.  Some of the immigrants have been there for many years and some have been more recent.  I would not attempt to tell the American administration what they should do but I hope the administration rather than a private member of either of the Houses will bring in a Bill which will find cross-party support.  It is not a matter for a legislator of this country but I hope that is what will happen in the relatively near future.</P>

      <P>The European Commission was given a brief by the European Council in Milan last June to examine the proposal contained in the report of the <i>ad hoc</i> Committee on a People's Europe that a Euro-Lottery be established which would finance projects in the fields of culture.  The Commission's report is still awaited and, until it is available, it would not be appropriate for me to make any statement on the matter.</P>

      <P>It is extremely unlikely. The report was only received early this week.  The Commission were asked to study it and come up with proposals, perhaps for the next Summit meeting.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The code of conduct to which the Deputy refers was drawn up in 1977 for the subsidiaries of companies of the Ten operating in South Africa, with the object of improving the conditions of black workers employed by such companies. I am aware that in the past there have been variations in national treatment of the information obtained from firms reporting under the code.  This has not of course affected the analyses of the operations of the code of conduct which have been conducted on a number of occasions since 1977.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am pleased to be able to tell the Deputy that an improved and strengthened version of the code was approved by Foreign Ministers of the Twelve at their meeting on 19 November 1985.  In addition to provisions relating to improving the living standards and fringe benefits of workers covered by the new code, a section of the code is devoted to <Col N="1408" /> the procedures to be followed in reporting under its provisions.  In future the national and joint reports will be public.</P>
    <P>I am arranging for copies of the revised code to be placed in the Oireachtas library.  Ireland has no companies reporting under the code.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the suspension by the Nicaraguan Government on 15 October last of a wide range of civil liberties, including those listed by the Deputy.  As I indicated in the House on 5 November, this action on the part of the Nicaraguan Government, the circumstances leading to it, and the continuing crisis in Central America are matters of serious concern to the Government.</P>
      <P>It is the Government's view that the complex problems of the Central American region including Nicaragua can only be resolved by a political agreement emanating from the region itself and without outside interference.  In the words of the political joint communique agreed by the Foreign Ministers of the Ten, plus Spain and Portugal, and their Central American and Contadora counterparts at the conclusion of their Conference in Luxembourg on 12 November:</P>
      <P>a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Central America (will) have to be based in particular on respect for national sovereignty and independence, territorial integrity and non-intervention in the internal affairs of other States and non-recourse to intimidation or force. </P>

      <P>Would the Minister agree that the unfortunate derogations which the Nicaraguan Government had to introduce derived directly from the fact that they are fighting a battle to survive against attacks from the Contras who are armed and financed directly by the US Government? Will he undertake to make direct representations to the US Government to cease aiding the Contras in this way and so ensure that normal life can return to Nicaragua and the Nicaraguan people and that the democratic Government there are enabled to survive?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I and my Government, like other Governments of the 12 Community countries, are deeply concerned about all events in Central America which interfere with the normal democratic process in those countries and which may have the effect of preventing, for various reasons, the solution to the problems of the various countries, separately and jointly and preventing the people in that region from living without interference a peaceful and normal life.  We deplore all of those strongly.  As regards making direct representations to any one of the countries involved in the region whether they have come in from outside or are there already, as I have said on a number of occasions, I believe that the strongest <Col N="1411" /> voice Ireland has to influence events there is its voice in the EC.  That is the best way we can exercise our influence there.  The initiation by the EC, the Central American countries and the Contadora group last year of a joint conference in Costa Rica at which I presided and the continuation of that process in Luxembourg last month are a very valuable contribution to bringing peace and some stability to the region.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs the Government's <Col N="1412" /> response to the recent European Commission Green Paper on the Common Agricultural Policy and whether he has had any discussions on it to date at Foreign Minister level.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission's Green Paper <i>Perspectives for the Common Agricultural Policy</i> published last July is a discussion document which sets the framework for a Communitywide dialogue on the future of the CAP. Consultations have been taking place since its publication at Community level and at national level here in Ireland with interested parties.  General discussions on the Green Paper have taken place in the Council of Ministers for Agriculture and are to continue later this month.  Foreign Ministers have not discussed the matter.</P>
      <P>No overall definitive Commission proposals arising from the document have emerged as yet.  This country's response will be formulated when substantive proposals are presented and having regard to the views of all the Irish interests concerned.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>I said in my reply that this is a discussion document.  If implemented as written down it would certainly not augur well for growth in Irish agriculture in the future.  That does not mean that the proposals emanating from this Green Paper, if it is accepted, will have the same effect on Irish agriculture. The Government are very much aware of that position and we are watching closely to see that that does not happen.  Having said that, let me say that we should also recognise that the original purpose of the CAP has been well achieved or over-achieved.  The original purpose of the CAP was to ensure that Europe did not import food and was self-sufficient in food, but now we are producing large surpluses which are extremely difficult and costly to dispose of.  We <Col N="1413" /> should be realistic and recognise that some adjustment of the CAP is essential in the future.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PrionsiasDeRossa" hpid="Proinsias De Rossa Proinsias De Rossa">
      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not what the Irish farmers think the CAP is for. They do not think it is just to prevent food from being imported into the EC.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>There are different views on that, but the CAP has been of enormous benefit to this country in helping agriculture to divest itself of its dependence on virtually one market in the past.  We must look to diversify within the CAP in agriculture in Ireland into other products and get added value here also.  We would be very foolish if we thought the future for Irish agriculture was going to be precisely the same as the past ten years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister should be aware that I am appalled at the answer he has given.  Anybody involved in agriculture would surely recognise that any dismantling of the CAP as it is now will be a very serious concern&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, any changing of it, and it must be improved.  The Minister must be aware that Irish agriculture has a great deal of potential for development and, if it is not allowed to develop, our agricultural industry and our economy generally will be affected seriously.  Is the Minister aware that another Commission study group are at work, as reported on the radio this morning, and are likely to recommend an end to beef intervention? I want the Minister now to say whether he agrees that this would be totally disastrous for cattle production in Ireland. The whole attitude of the Commission is negative and, unless we are in there fighting positively, we as a nation will lose out very heavily on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>As regards the first part of the Deputy's question, yes, I agree <Col N="1414" /> with the thrust of his argument.  For that precise reason we argued for an achieved successfully under the super-levy proposals of 18 months ago that Ireland should be allowed to develop its dairy industry.  While other countries in the EC were asked to cut back we were allowed to increase for precisely the reason Deputy Collins has mentioned.  I know nothing about the report on the radio this morning, but I have heard about it.  If it is as blunt as the Deputy says about bringing an end to taking beef into intervention, that will be damaging for Irish agricultural interests.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Having regard to what the Minister said I want him to understand and accept that there is great concern amongst the Community generally at the acceptance of the limit on milk production brought about by the super-levy. It is nothing to be proud of and we cannot be pleased with it because milk production has been stopped at a level far below our potential and many people involved in the dairying industry are affected seriously by this and are in great difficulty.  Will the Minister agree with me that Ireland's interests are largely ignored in strategic Commission proposals in agriculture, and does this not reflect a very poor lobbying job by the Minister and his colleagues in Brussels that they seem unable to get proposals, even proposals for discussion, that will take account adequately of our vital national interests?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not true.  Quite the reverse is true.  The production of dairy produce has been stopped in the Community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>That does not apply to Ireland which is the only country in the Community which was allowed to increase its level of production under the 1983 agreement on the super-levy.  No matter what political football may be made out of this, I do not believe that the Irish farmer is under any illusion <Col N="1415" /> about the difficulties facing him in the future.  They are not under any illusions about the extremely competent negotiations pursued by the Government over the super-levy and the good results achieved. It is clear, if one discussed the matter with farmers or any organisations over the last two years, that they all recognise that a good job was done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that two years after the super-levy was imposed on us milk production here has been stopped at a level far below the potential of our dairy industry and that that represents a far more severe blow to our dairy industry than the stop imposed by the milk levy on our partners in Europe?  We must have regard for the fact that their production limit is at its maximum, they could not go much higher, but we are stopped about half way.  If the Minister regards this as a good deal achieved by his colleagues in Government for the Irish dairy industry he is not in touch with reality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It was precisely because it was recognised that the Irish dairy industry had not developed to its full potential that we were allowed to increase when other countries were stopped.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCollins" hpid="Mr. G. Collins Mr. G. Collins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>We were only allowed a pittance.  If we were allowed to develop to our maximum potential in line with other member states who had a head start on us that would be a concession we could all be proud of, but we cannot accept as fair or just the super-levy limits imposed on us and accepted for the last two years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>They are precisely the arguments that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Agriculture, and I were making at the time of the super-levy debate two years ago.  They were listened to and accepted and hence we were allowed to increase our production in the last two years when other countries were cut back.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Collins</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether he believes the British Government in their operation of the Sellafield plant are in breach of their international obligations, both in respect of pollution of the seas, and in respect of accountancy for nuclear materials to ensure no diversion to military purposes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>On the question of discharges into the sea from the Sellafield plant, I have no reason to believe that the United Kingdom is not carrying out its obligations under the relevant international agreement which is the Paris Convention of 1974 on the Prevention of Pollution from Land-Based Sources. There has been no suggestion to the contrary made by the Commission of this convention, which comprises the contracting States, that the UK is not in compliance with its obligations under the Convention.  In addition, I understand that the British Government have recently given details to the Commission of planned measures to reduce further discharges from the Sellafield plant.</P>
      <P>In regard to the second part of the Deputy's question, the United Kingdom is, of course, a nuclear weapon State and Sellafield is a mixed facility which reprocesses nuclear material for both civil and military purposes.  The UK has, however, voluntarily concluded safeguard agreements with both EURATOM and the International Atomic Energy Agency covering civil nuclear materials processed at Sellafield.  Neither of these bodies has detected any anomaly at Sellafield which would indicate the diversion of the safeguarded nuclear material from civil to military purposes.</P>

      <P>I presume the Deputy is asking me if I accept that emissions from Sellafield are at an acceptable level and, of course, my answer to that is &ldquo;no&rdquo;. Ireland's position on the question of discharges of radioactive waste into the marine environment is that such discharges should be reduced as quickly as possible to a level as low as is reasonably achievable &mdash; the so-called ALARA principle enunciated by the International Commission for Radiological Protection &mdash; and that they should be discontinued as soon as possible by using the best technology available.  This has been made clear in international fora and has also been conveyed to the UK authorities on a number of occasions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs if in view of the worldwide revulsion at recent tragic events in South Africa, he is doing everything possible to assist in bringing apartheid to an end and in establishing the need to bring about reforms designed to fulfil the legitimate aspirations of the black population.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1419" />
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the view of the Government that only the complete abolition of the apartheid system in all its manifestations can lead to the establishment of a democratic, multi-racial society in South Africa.  Reform of the system is not sufficient.</P>
      <P>The policy of the Government is to do all within their power to bring about the abolition of the apartheid system by peaceful means.  Ireland has maintained a consistent policy of opposition to the apartheid policies of the South African Government.  This opposition has been voiced internationally, at the United Nations and within the European Community. Irish policy is expressed, <i>inter alia</i>, in our refusal to have diplomatic relations with South Africa, our refusal to assist or encourage trade with South Africa, our refusal to permit semi-State bodies to maintain offices in South Africa and our policy of actively discouraging sporting contacts.  Ireland also provides aid to the victims of apartheid both on a bilateral basis and through the United Nations.  Government policy towards South Africa is kept under constant review with the aim of putting pressure on the Government of South Africa to abandon the policy of apartheid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are working to achieve the peaceful ending of the system of apartheid in a number of ways.  Internationally we regularly and thoroughly condemn apartheid in international fora such as the UN.  Together with our partners in the European Community, we have sought also to press South Africa to change its policies.  Thus, at a meeting on 22 July the Ten Foreign Ministers called on the South African Government to take the following preliminary steps towards the abolition of apartheid and the opening of meaningful dialogue with representatives of the black community: the immediate and unconditional release of Mr. Nelson Mandela; and end to detention without trial; an end to the practice of forced removals; and the repeal of discriminatory and offensive legislation such as the pass laws and the group areas act.  These, together with the ending of the current state of emergency, <Col N="1420" /> remain in the view of Ireland and her colleagues in Europe the first minimum steps which the South African Government should take.  On 10 September, Foreign Ministers agreed on a series of both positive and restrictive measures to increase pressure on South Africa.</P>
    <P>I am confident that, through our actions nationally and in international fora, Ireland is doing everything possible to assist in bringing about a peaceful end to the system of apartheid.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Mr. P. Barry Mr. P. Barry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Barry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy would need to specify the measures I said would be counterproductive.  The only one I said would be counterproductive would be the imposition of a visa regime here against South African nationals.  If we imposed a visa requirement for South African people coming to Ireland then, obviously, the South African Government would reciprocate.  It must be remembered that we have a very big aid programme in Lesotho and the development of that aid programme depends on constant traffic of Irish people through South African airports to Lesotho.  If we imposed a visa restriction on South Africans coming to this country, people like those referred to just now by Deputy De Rossa wishing to go to South Africa could not go without a visa and it would be an easy matter to refuse the granting of such a visa.  Some people were refused entry at the gates of the country during the summer.  Anybody who wants to <Col N="1421" /> observe the regime in South Africa is free at present to go without a visa, but I believe that would not be so if we were to impose visa restrictions on this side.</P>

    <Title>International Development Association (Amendment) Bill, 1985: Second and Subsequent Stages.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of the Bill is to authorise a voluntary contribution of £8,330,000 by the Irish Government to the Seventh Replenishment of the resources of the International Development Association; and to authorise a voluntary contribution of £1,500,000 to the Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa which will be administered by the International Development Association.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The International Development Association &mdash; or IDA for short &mdash; is one of three international financial organisations in the World Bank Group.  The other two are the World Bank itself and the International Finance Corporation. All three organisations are concerned with providing finance in developing countries for projects that promote economic development.  The World Bank itself lends to a wide range of developing <Col N="1443" /> countries on more or less commercial terms.  The International Finance Corporation invests in or lends to private organisations, mainly in the more advanced developing countries.  By contrast, the IDA provide highly concessionary assistance and concentrates this assistance on the poorest developing countries only.</P>
    <P>The association was founded in 1960. Membership is open to all members of the World Bank and 134 of them have joined to date.  The association is run in close co-ordination with the bank and shares the same headquarters and management with it.  The President of the bank, Mr. Tom Clausen, is also the President of the association and they also share the same executive board and board of governors.</P>
    <P>Some 90 per cent of IDA's lending goes to countries with a <i>per capita</i> income of US$400 or less.  The association's lending terms reflect the extreme difficulties that the poorest countries face in meeting any loan obligations.  The terms provide interest-free loans for 50 years, with capital repayments starting after ten years.</P>
    <P>The bulk of the projects financed are in the agricultural and rural development sectors and are aimed at directly improving the lot of the poorest groups in the populations of the countries involved. Most of the other lending is for infrastructural and industrial projects.  The projects financed by the association must be financially and economically viable and must meet the same standards as those required by the World Bank itself.  Thus while the terms of the loans themselves are &ldquo;soft&rdquo;, the criteria for assessing the projects being funded by the loans are strictly commercial.</P>
    <P>The association commits over £3 billion, that is, over £2.5 billion, annually in loans at present.  Its resources are obtained in a number of ways.  The principal way is by periodic replenishments provided mainly by the richer member countries, also known as Part I members. A small number of its other members, Part II members, also participate in the <Col N="1444" /> replenishments.  The funds are provided by the donors on a grant basis and consequently are non-repayable.  Total financial resources in June 1985 comprised, in round figures, initial subscriptions amounting to $1 billion, transfers from the World Bank of $2 billion and replenishments of $30 billion.</P>
    <P>Ireland joined the association of its foundation in 1960, and subscribed $3 million to the initial capital.  We did not contribute to the first or second of the three-yearly replenishments of resouces, but we agreed in 1971 to make a contribution of $4 million to the third replenishment, even though Ireland was still a Part II member at that time.  When Ireland became a Part I member in 1973, it was accepted that this would involve a continuing commitment to contribute towards IDA financing.  Since then Ireland contributed £3.1 million to the fourth replenishment, £5.8 million to the fifth replenishment and £6.2 million to the sixth replenishment.  In addition, Ireland made a special one-year contribution of over £2.07 million to the association in 1983.</P>
    <P>Negotiations on the current replenishment, which is the seventh, began at the end of 1982 and concluded towards the middle of last year.  The negotiations agreed on an overall amount of $9 billion for the replenishment.  This represents a decrease of 25 per cent in US dollar terms over the amount of £12 billion negotiated for the sixth replenishment.  The agreement on $9 billion was dictated by the principle of preserving equitable burden sharing between donors and by the refusal of the United States of America to go beyond a 25 per cent share in a $9 billion replenishment.  The United States maintained its stance in spite of pressure from other donors to support a replenishment of $12 billion, the level which all other donors considered to be the minimum necessary to provide the association with adequate funding.</P>
    <P>The greater part of the funds will be provided by Part I countries.  The basic principle adopted in the allocation of contributions among these countries was that each would maintain in this replenishment <Col N="1445" /> the same share as it had taken in the sixth replenishment.  The allocations have been made on the understanding that commitments to them are not final until approval, where necessary, has been obtained from the legislature of each country.</P>
    <P>As was the case for previous replenishments, donor countries have the right initally to substitute non-negotiable, non-interest bearing demand notes for cash payments.  The notes, denominated in the member's currency, are to be deposited over three years.  Actual cash payments under the replenishment will arise over the years 1985 to 1995.  The precise rate at which the funds are called upon will depend on the progress made in implementing the projects financed by the replenishment.</P>
    <P>As a Part I member of the Association, Ireland is, as I have said earlier, expected to contribute to the periodic replenishments. In accordance with the sharing arrangements agreed in the negotiations, the Government have indicated that, subject to legislative approval, they are prepared to contribute £8,330,000.</P>
    <P>Following the disappointing level of the seventh replenishment, efforts were made to raise supplementary resources. Negotiations were initiated with the group of countries which contribute to IDA and agreement was reached on the establishment of a special facility for Sub-Saharan Africa.  Most donor countries are pledged to participate, though one notable exception is the United States. The facility is designed to provide fast disbursing funds to finance structural adjustment and sectoral policy reforms in low-income African countries which are committed to undertake stabilisation and adjustment programmes which can be satisfactorily monitored.  Under the terms of the facility, IDA will be entrusted with the administration of over $1 billion to be lent on the same highly concessionary terms that apply to the normal IDA assistance.</P>
    <P>The Government have indicated that, subject to legislative approval, they are prepared to contribute £1.5 million to the <Col N="1446" /> facility.  The level of contribution corresponds approximately to the share we assume in replenishments of the association itself.  Cash payments on foot of our contribution will be spread over a period of about four years, starting this year.</P>
    <P>Ireland has traditionally been a strong supporter of IDA.  Its aim of assisting the poorest of the developing countries makes it an especially worthy form of development assistance.  This group of countries is particularly hard hit by the world recession.  Both IDA and the special facility aim at helping to remedy the ultimate causes of famine and in doing so, will complement the more immediate famine relief work of other agencies.</P>
    <P>Attention is already being focused on the next replenishment of IDA.  At a meeting of donor countries held during the recent World Bank-IMF Annual Meetings in Seoul, it was agreed that negotiations for the eighth replenishment should start in January next, with the aim of concluding them by September 1986. Ireland will be seeking to ensure that these negotiations result in an adequate level of resources being made available to IDA.</P>
    <P>The payments both to the seventh replenishment and to the special facility will count as part of our national Official Development Assistance programme. They are in line with the Government's commitment to develop that programme. The present Bill is required to authorise the contributions.  Ireland's membership of the association is covered by the International Development Association Act, 1960.  As in the case of previous replenishments, the legislative provision to authorise our contribution to the seventh replenishment takes the form of an amendment to that Act.  The Bill makes separate provision for our contributions to the special facility.</P>
    <P>I recommend the Bill for the approval of the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>We fully support the Bill introduced by the Minister in so far as it relates to our discharging our obligations to the developing countries through the IDA.  Having said that, I <Col N="1447" /> have to stress that we are very unhappy and dissatisfied with the nature and extent of the replenishment, its inadequacy and the attitude of the wealthy developed world to the developing nations.</P>
      <P>As the Minister has pointed out, the seventh replenishment is in nominal terms 25 per cent less than the replenishment which I, as Minister for Finance, proposed to the House in 1980 as part of the contribution of $12 billion.  Five years later, having witnessed the most horrific scenes of human suffering and tragedy which have given us a sense of both guilt and obligation, we are proposing a replenishment of 25 per cent less in money terms &mdash; in real terms perhaps as much as 50 per cent less &mdash; to the International Development Association.</P>
      <P>I do not think any parliament, particularly the Parliament of this nation, could allow the occasion to pass without expressing not only criticism but shame at the fact that the wealthy nations respond in such a niggardly way to the needs of the developing countries in what was meant to be a new international economic order of balance and justice. While there may be total unanimity as to the way the Government of the day are discharging the role and obligation of the Irish people, I hope there will be equal unanimity in expressing absolute rejection of the attitudes reflected in many other countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The United States, which is by any standard the wealthiest country in the world, has to a very considerable extent been a barrier against an adequate replenishment in line with the sixth replenishment in 1980.  I do not recall the terms in which I introduced the Bill in 1980 nor the reaction of the House, but I would be surprised if I as Minister or those who addressed the House on the issue would have suggested that we regarded the replenishment as being adequate to meet the needs of 1980.  We are now being asked by the allegedly concerned wealthy nations to accept that a contribution which is 25 per cent less today than it was five years ago in nominal terms &mdash; and probably nearer to 50 per <Col N="1448" /> cent less in real terms &mdash; is in any way a discharge of international obligations in developing countries.</P>
    <P>Having singled out the wealthiest country &mdash; the United States &mdash; I should also make the point that, while we can make those criticisms in respect of democratic countries involved in this programme, it is equally important that we should also point out the scandal of the totalitarian states of eastern Europe, expecially the Soviet Union, who made no contribution whatever to this programme. When we talk about the attitude of the major powers to needy and developing countries let it be noted that the countries who claim to represent the underprivileged and the rights of all on an equal basis make no contribution to the everyday needs of international development of the starving nations.  We cannot have peace and justice as long as we remain silent in the face of such a scandal.  We hear of liberation movements throughout the world and of support for countries which are sometimes presented to us as being in the neutral, non-aligned groups, countries such as Cuba who are very close to the Soviet Union in their attitude to world affairs.  People may say that supporting liberation movements is done in the cause of justice, but we find that the very countries which present themselves as champions of the poor and oppressed in Latin America, Africa or anywhere else are only interested in upsetting the established order &mdash; perhaps sometimes for a good reason &mdash; and have no real commitment to developing the potential of poorer countries to supply their everyday needs in food, clothing, education and health.  Scandalous though the attitude of the democratic countries may be, it is only a pale reflection of the scandal of the other countries of the totalitarian states who represent themselves as being concerned for justice and peace.</P>
    <P>The Minister made some points which should be borne in mind.  He said:</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1449" /> The projects financed by the association must be financially and economically viable and must meet the same standards as those required by the World Bank itself.  Thus while the terms of the loans themselves are &ldquo;soft&rdquo;, the criteria for assessing the projects being funded by the loans are strictly commercial.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated the soft terms of the loan in the interest free provision over a period of 50 years.  The terms of the loan are undoubtedly soft, but the commercial criteria applied to the projects to be helped in the loan are the same as those which would be applied to any projects in regard to normal economic developments in any of the member states.  The Minister advisedly used the term &ldquo;strictly commercial&rdquo; because it accurately reflects the conditions, the strictly commercial criteria, attached to the projects.</P>
    <P>Allowing that the terms of the loan are exceedingly soft, nonetheless we are still making unreasonable judgments of the conditions which exist in these countries for projects of this nature.  Let us take the commercial criteria to be applied in foreign development programmes in a country with which I am familiar, Lesotho, or Tanzania or others for whom we have special bilateral aid programmes. You can start a programme for farm improvement in these countries and then you become aware of the hazards of nature and the problems of soil.  There is ravaging erosion of a kind which we could not imagine.  Some Members, including Deputy Owen, who recently visited Lesotho will have seen for themselves the problems of soil erosion, which can sweep away the work of ten years.  Other programmes can be washed away in the course of two years.  Yet we still apply the same strictly commercial criteria to the projects to which we have given soft loans.  This seems to be done on the basis that they are poor countries with fewer resources and greater infrastructural problems than richer nations and that is why we give them the concession of terms on the interest repayable.  However, it is not just a question of lack of money: it <Col N="1450" /> concerns education, the demography of the country, soil structure and climate. In the face of these realities which have been brought dramatically to our attention in the last year or two, especially in Ethiopia, can we really justify applying strictly commercial criteria to the projects, even allowing for the very real concessionary interest terms from the World Bank?</P>
    <P>We all suffered from the dramatic changes in the world economic order since the mid-seventies, particularly as a consequence of the oil crisis of 1974-75 and later in 1979-80.  We saw the effect this had on the cost of energy, which was a major problem, and we still live with its effects even in a Part I donor country, which Ireland has been for over ten years. We have seen the effect on our interest payments as a result of the increased value of the dollar and the cost of our energy.  It had a dramatic effect on every aspect of the economy, including our borrowing and our balance of payments and that was translated in a real way into problems for every citizen.</P>
    <P>However, the problems we experienced as a consequence of that dramatic shift in the world order pale in comparison with the effect on the economy of developing countries.  They were particularly dependent on imported energy to an extent greater than any of us.  While we may have an 85 per cent dependency rate on imported energy, their rate is well over 95 per cent and they were the victims of that dramatic shift to a very great degree.  They were the victims of the increase in the value of the dollar and the appreciation of strong currencies such as the yen, the Deutsche Mark and other currencies and they still are the victims. In addition, many of the countries concerned had to cope with some horrific natural disasters.</P>
    <P>Yet, we do not take account of that when we consider matters such as the International Development Association replenishment.  We still apply strictly commercial criteria.  Can those poor countries genuinely be expected to meet such criteria when we know in our own case that sometimes it proves difficult or <Col N="1451" /> impossible to meet them?  I must make it clear that I am not making any criticism of our own Government: I am talking about the International Development Association.  Having regard to our own difficulties in meeting strictly commercial criteria, can we support the notion that poor countries should be bound to adhere to them?</P>
    <P>There are 800 million people in dire poverty and many people here have made considerable efforts to highlight this fact. It is appropriate now to acknowledge the magnificent response to the Live Aid programme promoted by Bob Geldof.  At a time when we seem to point out many of the bad things happening at home, it is gratifying to note what was done by this young man who might have appeared to many of us to be involved only in the world of entertainment.  He stimulated people's consciences and his achievement and that of many young people can scarcely be measured.  It is proper that we should acknowledge with pride what he did and the response of many of our young people.  It showed that the people of Ireland still adhere to traditional values.</P>
    <P>What has been the response of the world to this dire poverty that exists?  The response in this instance is an annual replenishment figure of $2.5 billion annually committed by way of loans.  That is what the developed world is committing. Let us consider what the developed world is spending on armaments, particularly the wealthy nations.  One of them has been reluctant to make its appropriate contribution to the seventh replenishment and the other, the Soviet Union, makes no contribution.  How does that $2.5 billion compare with the $660 billion per annum spent on armaments by the wealthiest nations?  We see distressful scenes of poverty and starvation on television and they hurt and make us feel guilty but then those pictures fade from the screen.  I know that many people, particularly in Ireland, spend a considerable amount of their time reminding us of what is happening in those poor countries and long may they continue to do so.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1452" /> The total annual income of the poorest countries in the world is roughly £2 billion.  Yet, the wealthy nations, including some of our partners in the EC, spend much more on armaments to maintain contracts in their armaments programmes and employment in their armaments industry than they do in helping to alleviate some of the problems of the poor countries.</P>
    <P>I accept that there are bilateral aid programmes in existence.  I was pleased to be the second Irish Minister to negotiate the Lomé Convention and I am more pleased that a third Irish Minister has been involved in this work.  Many of the bilateral programmes of the wealthy countries have strings attached to them. A former President of the United States, Jimmy Carter, appeared to have a new awareness of the obligations of his wealthy country as regards human rights, aid programmes and so on.  However, the attitude of the current President of the United States has been, &ldquo;We had better get it right.  From now on we help our friends&rdquo;.  There was the change in the criteria laid down as though the starving millions, many of them suffering under military dictatorships or in inadequate democracies, had any choice as to who are the friends of the United States. Those rich countries spend $660 billion per annum on armaments while making a contribution of $2.5 billion to replenish this fund.  If we put that against the total annual income of $2.5 billion it makes the whole thing shameful.</P>
    <P>We want to help those people to help themselves.  It has been said that if you give a man a fish you will feed him for one day, but if you teach that person how to fish and provide him with the equipment he will be able to feed himself. The first duty of all of us in the family of nations is to equip those people, to train them to help themselves so that in the dim distant future the need will not be there.  But what is the reality?</P>
    <P>There are 870 million illiterate adults in those countries.  What are we doing to help them out of their illiteracy?  We talk in cliches of the need to promote industrial and economic training for them.  We <Col N="1453" /> hear about Japan and their third level graduates.  Is it not time that the family of developed nations should realise there is no help for those people, no means by which they can be rescued from their poverty while 870 million of them are illiterate.  What scope have they for being trained, equipped, educated to contribute to their wellbeing and that of their families and countries?  Let us talk about the younger generation.  More than 130 million of the young people in those countries are without even primary education, basic fundamental training.  Are we not sowing the seeds of further problems in the future?  Do we expect them to continue to live in the total poverty and depression from which generations before them suffered?  When will we acknowledge that our response is shamefully and scandalously inadequate?</P>
    <P>We seem to be satisfied to talk about a balanced world order while we should be talking about our inability even to recognise these problems, without thinking of solving them?  The figures I have given are well documented and the International Commission on Justice can confirm them.</P>
    <P>In those countries there are 42 million people who are blind or almost blind because of climate or prevailing wind or inherited chronic diseases.  What are we doing about that?  If they are blind and illiterate, how can they possibly begin to provide for themselves or ensure that they will not always be seen as the poor with their begging bowls.</P>
    <P>We cannot even make a contribution to the development of justice in our own country.  If we in the developed world are constantly talking, whether among the heads of Government in the EC or at summit meetings between, for example, Australia, Canada, the US and Japan, trying to cope with the problems we have, talking about how we will readjust by new instruments of technology to the problems that are our own making, it is about the price of us.  While we in the developed world are talking about consumer capacity and the hope for expansion in our economies, the problems of <Col N="1454" /> the others are very remote.  The real object of the economically developed world should be to promote the welfare and the consumer capacity of those poor people.  It is only when we help them that they can begin to help themselves to get out of the problems we are always reacting to, continuing economic recession. Let us look at what we take for granted as the most basic necessity, water, and think that two billion people in the world have not access to fresh pure water.  Can we not see that we are not helping them to solve their problems?</P>
    <P>One could give figures to underline the enormity of the problems and the total inadequacy of the global response.  It has been brought to my attention that 12 million babies in those countries die before they reach 12 months of age.  We are so used to watching our own problems that we do not realise that to a starving mother a baby is still special.  We still have to see that that is part of the problems in Africa and the South American sub-continent.</P>
    <P>We have statistics about death, blindness, lack of education, lack of infrastructure, but we still talk of economic commercial criteria in the applications of this fund.  I will return to comparisons and maybe some of them will underline dramatically the scandals I have been talking about.  For instance, if we contributed the expenditure for four days on armaments we could more than provide for the food needs of the developing countries for a year.  That is the scale of military expenditure in the developed world.  If we contributed even a half day's military expenditure we could end the most chronic problem in the developing countries, malaria.  The cost of one modern military tank, built to destroy, would provide 1,000 classrooms to accommodate 30,000 children; and the cost of one jet aircraft would provide 40 major pharmacies for health care.</P>
    <P>We can look at figures relating to the developed countries we are associated with in the EC, the Council of Europe and other bodies to see what we are allowing to happen.  Should we not <Col N="1455" /> scream shame on every occasion possible? There may be others who will ask who these Irish think they are, what kind of hypocrites they are, pretending they can be the conscience of the world.  Perhaps even to make the type of case I am making is to suggest that we have a virtue that other people do not have.  I am not suggesting that for a moment but, for as long as we do not condemn this scandal constantly, we too, are to blame.</P>
    <P>On the matter of the amount of money being spent in the interest of third world countries, we find that the most scandalous aspect is that spending on armaments in what is categorised as the Third World is now $80 billion, or more than double the figure of ten years ago.  Some of this spending has been focused in countries that have been in conflict with their neighbours or which have been engaged in regional conflicts such as Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and India but, despite that, we are now witnessing the extension to the developing countries of the same scandalous trends that have been a characteristic of the developed world for some time, that is, the trend of expenditure being diverted to armaments instead of to real human needs.</P>
    <P>Is it any surprise then that, for instance, there are military dictatorships in 50 to 55 third world countries, military dictatorships that are propped up and supported by one side or the other? Countries such as the United States might say they would not become involved to the same extent in the Sub-Saharan replenishment programme because they do not like the character of the dictatorship in Ethiopia or someone else may not like the character of the military regime in Nigeria.  So much of what is being applied by way of programmed co-operation from the developed to the developing countries is being applied to prop up the most repressive dictatorships ever, even in terms of the developing countries. That is another scandal about which the democratic world must be ashamed.</P>
    <P>I might mention in passing that it is time the classifications were changed. Much has happened since we emerged as <Col N="1456" /> a Part I member in 1973, a change that we welcomed in the House at the time. Much has changed in such countries as Iran and Iraq too, and also in Saudi Arabia since then but, by and large, they are still categorised as part of the developing world though I expect that the terms of the IDA replenishment will not be extended to them in the same terms as it will be applied elsewhere.  It is time we considered the inclusion of many of these countries and in this context I might include also such countries as Singapore, Malaysia, the Philippines and so on who have made great progress in recent years.  It is time for reclassification so far as these countries are concerned and to recognise that, even within these countries, there would be such regional conflicts as the conflict that has been in progress between Iran and Iraq for the past five years.</P>
    <P>Does anyone really believe that that conflict could continue at such an horrendous rate, with almost one million casualties in that five year span, without the support and intervention of outside powers?  Are we not ashamed that, even within the EC, there are countries who are supporting one side or the other in these conflicts by way of armaments contracts with Iran or Iraq and which at the same time are in political co-operation. If we are to have any view by way of political co-operation I suggest to the Minister for Foreign Affairs that we should draw attention to the scandal whereby at the table at which he sits there will be Ministers whose Governments are supporting different sides and providing arms to the different sides in the Iran-Iraq conflict.  What kind of response is that from the developed world to those who are suffering?  What kind of contribution is it to a better climate for peace and justice?</P>
    <P>In October we began international peace year and peace, by definition, involves justice, but on the evidence available to us there are no signs of justice and no prospect of peace.  We scarcely deserve such prospects.  I can only express the hope that the response of the Irish people will continue as it has been continuing <Col N="1457" /> in recent times in particular.  We might as well acknowledge that even our own ODA is not anywhere near the level of the commitment we intended originally. I do not wish to be seen to be in any way partisan in saying that.  I appreciate the problems of a Minister for Finance in difficult times.</P>
    <P>I am not criticising our level of ODA but this is one area in which I would wish for a consensus and a bipartisan approach in the House so that no Opposition spokesman would criticise the Minister for Finance of the day for providing, for instance, an extra £20 million on his current spending because of a commitment to our bilateral ODA programme in terms of percentage of GNP and that, conversely, no Government would consider themselves limited or constrained in their efforts to meet that commitment. What we do will not change the world but at least it will mean that whenever we speak we can speak not only with conviction but with the proof that at least our actions are as loud as our words.</P>
    <P>My final point is that if one once engages in the business of armaments contracts it becomes a very easy road to travel in terms of the development of that industry, a road on which one will find lots of customers, poor customers in the countries we are talking of who will buy the equipment from the armaments industry.</P>
    <P>I wish to suggest, as forcibly as possible, that our independence and our neutrality are important, not only from the point of view of our inherited position but more in terms of our role, present and future, in the matters of justice and peace throughout the world.  Peace and justice were fought dearly for here.  We must never allow ourselves to be compromised other than by way of decision of the sovereign Government and Parliament in events that might or might not emerge at a later time in world conflict but which hopefully will never emerge.  In particular we should ensure that we avoid embarking in any way on armaments contracts and procurements.  Once we get into investment in arms for export, we will find it a rather attractive outlet in terms <Col N="1458" /> of opportunities and potential, and to our cost, we will find that we too have contributed to the scandal I have been trying to underline this afternoon.</P>
    <P>I support what the Minister and the Government propose to do in terms of our contribution to this fund, and I support the miserably inadequate response of the developed world having regard to our totally inconsistent behaviour in every other area to which I have referred.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome this Bill.  Like Deputy O'Kennedy I want to express my deep disappointment that the seventh replenishment to the International Development Association is only £9 billion, £3 billion dollars less than the sixth replenishment.  I particularly welcome Deputy O'Kennedy's remarks and the tone of those remarks because if and when &mdash; I say that knowing it might not happen for some time &mdash; there is a change of Government and his party come back into office, I know he will fulfil that commitment by ensuring that our progression towards the .7 per cent of GNP, which is the United Nations target, will continue and will be achieved as quickly as possible.</P>
      <P>Sadly this Bill does not give rise to a great deal of interest either in the media or in this House but it has given rise to more interest than would have been the case four or five years ago.  In 1981 a joint committee was set up and I chaired that committee.  It is important to note that that committee are willing to educate themselves in areas of development.  I am here as the voice of that committee which recently published their second annual report.  We have endorsed the desire to reach the .7 per cent of GNP target, which this country has not yet reached. The committee also welcomed the fact that until 1987 there will be steady growth and, when we are returned to office in 1987, I trust we will continue that growth, but if the Government change, the Government of which Deputy O'Kennedy will be a member, will also continue that growth.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The last time we discussed this subject was in 1983 when this House was asked <Col N="1459" /> to approve a special contribution of £2.07 million, a contribution made necessary because of defaulting by the United States on the sixth replenishment.  This House readily agreed to that contribution and many other countries' representatives of IDA also agreed to a similar contribution.  The reason for that extra contribution caused me great sadness. The fact that half way through an agreement the United States were willing to default on the amount they were willing to give, should have been the writing on the wall for people to see that they would probably baulk at increasing their share when the seventh replenishment took place.  As a result, the seventh replenishment is 25 per cent down on the previous one.</P>
    <P>It would be interesting to look at the situation faced by members of the IDA when they sat down to consider and review the seventh replenishment.  They had the task of considering whether the association had met the needs of IDA recipients and whether economic conditions had changed in any way.  I cannot imagine a worse agenda being put before a group than that agenda and yet, at the end of the day, they had to come out with something which was far less than was needed.  There is not the slightest doubt that the majority of the recipient countries of IDA loans continue to suffer from weak economic growth they have deteriorating external positions, many of them with no foreign currency and very slow faultering development.</P>
    <P>The IDA were set up in 1960, 25 years ago, and loans had a 50 year repayment period.  It is a matter of regret that IDA have not been abolished.  One would have hoped that, after 25 years of a commitment of this sort from the developed world, the lot of the developing countries would have improved and the IDA could have been abolished.  We all know that did not happen and, if anything, the existence of IDA is more necessary now than it was in 1960.  It is an indictment of the developed world that that is the position. It is an indictment also that, despite the millions of pounds that have been put <Col N="1460" /> into developing countries, many of them have gone backwards instead of improving. It is an indictment on all of us that we have not been able to find out why the existence of the IDA is still so essential. Deputy O'Kennedy touched on one reason for this.  He said that even many developing countries spent a great deal of their limited resources on armaments. We need to look again at the whole concept of new world economic order.</P>
    <P>I commend IDA for the flexibility they use in assessing whether a country is eligible for a loan.  If the criteria were too inflexible it could be said that a loan would only be granted on the basis of <i>per capita</i> income.  In some countries the <i>per capita</i> income is very unbalanced.  A country could have a high <i>per capita</i> income but many millions of their citizens could be living in dire poverty and in conditions of gross under-development. I welcome the fact that IDA have continued to be so flexible in determining which countries can benefit.</P>
    <P>I particularly welcome the extra facility we are approving in this legislation for the £1.5 million we are giving and the $1 billion approved for the Sub-Saharan African region.  In this House last night the United Nations Special Envoy for Africa addressed members of the committee which I chair and Members of both Houses came to listen.  He said that because of the tremendous input internationally between 17 December 1984 and now, the 20 countries in Africa severely affected by drought and famine had been reduced to seven.  He stressed that this was a tremendous achievement brought about because of the awakening conscience of the developed world.  If that can be done because we saw the disastrous and heart rendering pictures on television, I hope and pray the same commitment will continue in the developed world so that that will not be a nine days wonder and we will have played our part in reducing the number of countries which have been so severely hit by drought and famine.</P>
    <P>Mr. Diallo, the UN envoy, clarified for us last night that despite the fact that it has rained in Africa the problems are not <Col N="1461" /> over.  Money and all forms of facilities are still required.  There is a need for doctors, nurses, teachers and agronomists. I hope that this special facility of $1.1 billion will very quickly be mobilised so that the African leaders can proceed quickly with infrastructural development. The African leaders met recently and agreed to come together again in five years, having implemented a programme of action in their own countries.  There must not be a recurrence in 1989 or in 1991 of the events we have seen during the past year in Africa.  Of course Africa will always be subject to drought in certain areas and there will be a certain amount of famine but as long term development takes place the effects of famine will be reduced.  We have only to look at our own country to see the truth of this. If we had a potato shortage now there would not be the mass starvation and death which we had in the 1840s.  We should learn from that.</P>
    <P>The facility which we are approving today should be made available as quickly as possible.  I trust that the Minister will ensure that our allotment to that facility will go as quickly as possible.</P>

      <P>I thank Deputy O'Kennedy for his support for the Bill and also Deputy Owen, the chairperson of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Co-operation with Developing Countries, for the support which she and the committee have been giving to the work we are doing in this area.  I share with both Deputies the disappointment they have clearly expressed at the size of this replenishment.  It was for many of the reasons which have been developed by these Deputies and as a result of the perception of the problems to which they have referred that all the donor countries in IDA took the view &mdash; and persisted in it &mdash; that a replinishment of $12 billion was the minimum required to meet the task we want IDA to carry out.  I stress that this was considered the minimum amount required.  Had we any confidence that a larger figure could have been provided, we would have supported any number of arguments to obtain it.  We <Col N="1462" /> share with the other donor countries disappointment at the level of this replenishment.</P>
      <P>One point made by Deputy O'Kennedy will disturb the tranquility and non-contentious nature of this debate.  He criticised the application of commercial criteria to IDA loans and asked how we could justify the application of these criteria. It would be criminal to do anything else.  The essential requirement is that the funds loaned through IDA or through any other agency should be used for productive purposes.  If they are not used for such purposes then we are not giving the money in the right way.  If we do not apply the test that there has to be a return for expenditure on a project, then we are letting down people whom we want to assist.  I was amazed to hear Deputy O'Kennedy expressing reservations about the application of such criteria.  We want those people to get bigger returns from the projects assisted.  I was doubly amazed to hear him make that point after his recent solid performance during the debate on the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Public Expenditure on Capital Projects here.  I urge him to think again and apply the same logic that he was defending in relation to a review of our own capital expenditure.  The need in developing countries for projects that will give a return is overriding and it would be criminal to act in any way other than to take account of that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy specifically mentioned two other points, one of which related to education.  The IDA operation recognises the importance of educational projects in these countries and in 1985 about 13.5 per cent of IDA loans were in the educational area.  Neither Iran nor Iraq would be eligible for IDA aid <Col N="1463" /> because they have gone past the threshold level at which they would qualify.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy's other point about reassessing the categories is already taken care of because there is a graduation process through the various stages of eligibility.  Countries bring themselves through it.  Some of the Caribbean countries have graduated out of one class but not yet into another, a problem I hope will be shortly resolved.</P>
    <P>I thank Deputy O'Kennedy and Deputy Owen for their support.  I hope they will continue to support future measures of this kind.</P>

      <P>It emerged recently that the taxpayer's husband is in receipt of a social welfare invalidity pension, which is chargeable to tax.  This pension is paid gross and it is standard practice in such cases to collect the tax attributable to it by restricting the aggregate tax free allowances under PAYE which in this case are set against the wife's employment earnings.  As the amount of the invalidity pension exceeds the total allowances due there is no balance available for use against the taxpayers employment income.  The appropriate amended certificate was issued to her on 29 October 1985.  This certificate was issued on a non-cumulative (week-one) basis to avoid collection in one sum of the underpayment which would have arisen since 6 April last.</P>

    <P> 1.  In the absence of a standard health services price index, the percentage changes in the allocations have been expressed in real terms by using the increase in the annual average consumer price index between 1982 and 1985. (The annual average for 1985 is estimated).</P>
    <P>2.  The percentages are based on provisional final allocations for 1985.</P>
    <P>3.  The difference in percentage changes as between health boards can be explained by a variety of factors including</P>
    <P>&mdash;differences in pay-non-pay relationships;</P>
    <P>&mdash;differences in numbers eligible for cash allowances;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the relative extent to which health boards avail themselves of facilities in extern voluntary hospitals etc. (the percentages quoted in the table are derived from the allocations for direct expenditure (including provision for the expenditure of the General Medical Services (Payments) (Board);</P>
    <P>&mdash;extra funds provided to cover extra revenue expenditure involved in bringing new units of accommodation into operation. </P>
    <P>4.  The allocations to health boards (from which the percentages quoted in the table are derived) are expressed in net terms taking account of income accuring to the boards such as patient receipts etc.  Such income increases from year to year and, when taken into account, improves progressively the spending levels of the boards. </P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance or unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that an applicant is available for work and to fulfil this condition a person must be capable of, available for and genuinely seeking work. In general pursuance of full time education normally involves a degree of commitment from the person concerned which would not be consistent with availability for work.  Each individual application is determined, however, on its own particular merits.

He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at the appropriate maximum rate of £32.75 weekly, with effect from 2 September 1985, and he was paid in respect of a current week on 27 November 1985.</P>
      <P>When the amount of supplementary welfare allowance paid to him, pending a decision on his claim, has been ascertained, arrears of unemployment assistance, less the amount of supplementary welfare allowance, will be paid to him. Further weekly payments at £32.75 will continue to be made as they become due.</P>

He is, accordingly, entitled to unemployment assistance at £13.15 weekly from 16 January 1985, being the appropriate rate in his case of £29.95 less means of £16.80, increased to £14.95 from 3 July 1985, being the appropriate rate of £31.75, less means of £16.80.
