      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann approves the terms of the Third ACP-EEC Convention, signed on 8th December 1984, together with the related internal agreement on the measures and procedures for implementation of the Convention and the internal agreement on the financing and administration of <Col N="2408" /> Community aid, signed on 19th February 1985, copies of which have been laid before the Dáil. </P>
    <P>I am pleased to bring before the Dáil this motion concerning the Third Lomé Convention.  I think it is fair to say that one of the most significant achievements of the recent Irish Presidency was the successful conclusion of the negotiations for the present Convention after more than a year of long and at times arduous negotiations.</P>
    <P>The Lomé Convention is probably the best known instrument of the Community's development policy and it is certainly the most important.  It grew out of the two original Yaounde Conventions signed in the 1960's between the original six member states of the Community and a number of their former colonies, for the most part in French speaking West Africa.  Following the accession of the United Kingdom to the Community, negotiations began on a broader, more ambitious association agreement. Twenty independent Commonwealth countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific participated in these negotiations. The first ACP-EEC Convention was signed in Lomé, the capital of Togo, on 28 February 1975.  At the time, the Convention was hailed as the most extensive co-operation agreement in the history of North-South relations.  In contrast to the previous Conventions of Yaounde, the Lomé Convention, as it quickly became known, granted free nonreciprocal access to the Community market for almost all ACP products.  In addition, it made available considerable financial and technical assistance for a wide range of ACP projects, primarily in the agricultural and industrial sector. However, the most significant innovation of the Convention lay unquestionably in the field of commodities with the introduction of a system to guarantee compensation for losses in commodity export earnings of ACP countries.  The scheme, known as Stabex, covered a range of basic agricultural commodities and was designed to alleviate the worst effect of fluctuations of prices on the world market <Col N="2409" /> or to offset the effect of natural disasters on commodity production.</P>
    <P>By 1979, when it was time to renegotiate a successor to the first Lomé Convention, the Community's attitude was undoubtedly coloured by the fact that there had been a steady deterioration in the international economic situation which had affected the economic performance of most industrialised countries, including the member states of the Community.  On the ACP side, there was disappointment that the Convention had not proved to be the panacea for their development problems that they had hoped.  Nevertheless, there was a general recognition on both sides that the Lomé framework should be retained, as should the principal instruments of ACP-EEC co-operation.  The second Lomé Convention which was signed on 31 October 1979 was, therefore, more than a mere consolidation of Lomé I.  One of its new features was the setting up of a system, known as Sysmin, to help ACP countries, whose economies were heavily dependent on the export of minerals to the Community, and which had not, generally speaking, benefited significantly from the provision of Stabex.  The Community also agreed to increase the resources available under the Convention in real terms to shift more resources into the agricultural chapter of the Convention.</P>
    <P>The negotiations for the Third Lomé Convention began in October 1983 and were concluded over one year later after six ministerial negotiating conferences. At the outset it was clear that the fundamental lines of the previous Convention should be confirmed and agreement was quickly reached on a number of broad objectives.  Having defined the general objectives, the next task of the negotiators was to work out, in the body of the Convention, areas of joint action, and to emphasise those sectors of co-operation which should be given priority.</P>
    <P>One such sector is agricultural development and in particular, food security and food self-sufficiency.  I know the concern of this House about the situation in many parts of Africa where famine is at <Col N="2410" /> present widespread and I am sure Deputies will welcome the importance which the new Convention gives to tackling the long-term food requirements of Africa. In my address on the occasion of the signing of the Third Lomé Convention, I said that the most immediate problem in Africa was that of hunger.  The first priority must, therefore, be action to enable Africa to feed her people.  In addition to providing as much short-term relief as we can, we must look towards the future and tackle the problems in a more comprehensive and integrated way than in the past.  We have made it clear in the Convention that it is our aim to develop food strategies, with the full co-operation of ACP Governments, so that imported food will gradually be replaced by local, national production.  This will demand much closer co-ordination between the Community and the countries concerned to work out and implement an agricultural policy best suited to the needs of each country.  In general, emphasis will be on small farming, the training and development of small farmers, better distribution of agricultural products within the country concerned or on a regional basis, and better storage of products.</P>
    <P>Many developing countries will, nevertheless, not be able to feed their populations by their own efforts.  In these situations, the Community will continue to provide aid programmes which operate outside the scope of the Convention.  The ACP countries have, for some time, been asking for access to the Community's food surpluses on favourable terms and I am pleased to note that the Community has in the new Convention adopted a more flexible attitude.  Under Article 34, there will now be the possibility of longer term advance fixing of refunds on the export of those agricultural products available to the Community.  Specific agreements may be made with the ACP countries who request them in the context of their overall food security requirements.</P>
    <P>Agriculture in general, and the production of food in particular, is constantly under threat in many parts of Africa from <Col N="2411" /> drought and desertification.  For the first time the Lomé Convention is making resources available to tackle these and other environmental problems.  During the negotiations there was a recognition by both sides that the physical, economic and political existence of certain ACP states is threatened by endemic drought and growing desertification which will nullify all efforts at development, and in particular the achievement of the priority objective of self-sufficiency and food security.  Inventories will therefore be made of the water tables in the most badly affected areas.  Other measures will aim at controlling and preventing bush fires and general deforestation.  Improved training and technical assistance is envisaged and this should bring about better management of forests and create a greater awareness of the dangers of soil erosion and deforestation among local populations.</P>
    <P>One of the major problems in Africa is the dependence on wood as a fuel.  It is hoped that measures contained in the Convention which encourage the development of new and renewable sources of energy such as biomass, wind and solar energy, will greatly reduce this dependence. I would like to mention, incidentally, that this is an area in which we are active under our own bilateral aid programme notably through peat development in Burundi and experimentation with papyrus reeds as a source of fuel in Rwanda.  It is a pleasure for me to be able to note, and pay tribute to, the technical expertise which Bord na Móna are contributing to these projects.</P>
    <P>While agriculture and the drive for food self-sufficiency are of paramount importance, industry, too has a role to play in the development of ACP countries and the creation of an adequate standard of living for their people.  The emphasis in the new convention will be on restoring existing industries to a sound footing rather than embarking on new large scale projects.  Handicrafts and small and medium sized industries will be encouraged, particularly in rural areas. The Centre for the Development of <Col N="2412" /> Industry will continue its task of bringing together European and ACP entrepreneurs with a view to setting up joint ventures in ACP States.  In addition, a new approach to private investment should help to foster a climate of greater investment confidence in the ACP, thus speeding up the process of industrialisation.</P>
    <P>Trade is a key part of the convention and I am pleased to report that all the concessions of the previous two conventions have been retained and strengthened. We have not been able to advance as far as the ACP would have liked but nevertheless I am satisfied that the provisions of the convention should enable many ACP countries, including some of the poorest among them, to gain freer access to the markets of the Community. There will be a new emphasis on the development of trade and services and the importance of tourism in the economies of ACP States is given special recognition.  The rights and obligations under Lome II as regards bananas, beef and veal, rice and rum have all been maintained and improved upon where possible.</P>
    <P>The Stabex provisions have been strengthened under the new convention. In particular, three new products have been made eligible for Stabex transfers and the thresholds triggering the transfer have been lowered.  Stricter administrative rules and improved monitoring of whether the use made of the funds conforms to the objectives of the system have been introduced.  In addition clear rules have been agreed for reducing transfers where funds prove insufficient to cover all legitimate claims during a given year.</P>
    <P>The aims, scope and management procedures of Sysmin have been set out in greater detail in the text of the Convention. While the system's prime objective to help restore the viability of the mining industry in the ACP countries concerned remains unchanged, it has now been agreed that should this aim prove unattainable, the system may give backing to diversification measures.</P>
    <P>Another innovation which is of some importance is the inclusion for the first <Col N="2413" /> time in such a Convention of a chapter on social and cultural co-operation.  Support will be given to the ACP States' policies and measures in order to enhance their human resources, increase their own creative capacities and promote their individual cultural identities.  More specifically, criteria have been laid down to ensure that the cultural social dimension is taken fully into account at an early stage in the design of projects and programmes. A joint declaration of ACP migrant workers and ACP students in the Community was also agreed.  It states that the member states and ACP states will continue to ensure that, through the legal or administrative measures adopted by them, the foreign nationals within their territory are not subjected to discrimination on the basis of racial, religious, cultural or social differences.</P>
    <P>In the objectives of the Convention we have agreed to put man at the centre of our action, to respect his right to life and to ensure that he is the beneficiary of the development process.  For the first time, the contracting parties' faith in fundamental human rights and respect for human dignity is enshrined in the text of the Convention.  In an attached joint declaration both sides also proclaim their determination to fight effectively for the eradication of apartheid.  I believe that by writing into the text of the Convention references to human rights, human dignity and apartheid, we have added a new dimension to ACP-EC co-operation which could lead to a greater mutual understanding between our peoples and thereby begin to eliminate intolerance and prejudice.</P>
    <P>I come to the chapter of the Convention which deals with financial and technical co-operation.  This chapter proved to be one of the most contentious in the negotiations, principally on account of the long debate which took place over the notion of &ldquo;policy dialogue&rdquo;.  This concept was defined, in the Community's view, as a way of implementing ACP-EC co-operation. Its aim was to make this co-operation as effective as possible by bringing Community aid more into line with economic and social reality in ACP countries <Col N="2414" /> and by achieving better co-ordination between the policies laid down and implemented by these countries and the contribution of the various Community aid instruments.</P>
    <P>To begin with, the ACP countries were somewhat suspicious of the idea which they saw as an attack on their sovereignty and an attempt by the Community to interfere in the establishment of their policies.  It was only after long and detailed explanation by the Community that the ACP countries were prepared to accept that there should be a more concerted form of co-ordination between donors and recipient countries by means of thoroughgoing exchanges of views. The Community made it clear that it had no intention of questioning or challenging the recipient countries' choice of development strategy; its objective was to make its aid more effective by identifying not only projects and programmes which could benefit from the Community's financial support but also whole sectors of the recipient countries' economies.  I believe that this new approach will lead to a more efficient use of resources while ensuring that the real development needs of the ACP countries are addressed.</P>
    <P>The chapter on financial and technical co-operation is, of course, an important one for the ACP countries but it also provides an opportunity for European firms to sell their goods and services to the ACP States through the projects and programmes financed from the European Development Fund, EDF.  A little over 2 per cent of the contracts won by European firms under the fifth EDF were awarded to Ireland.  Our percentage contribution to the EDF is 6 per cent.  The four largest member states between them won 86 per cent of all EDF business. It is recognised that the small member states, and particularly those with no history of commercial involvement in the ACP States, are at an inherent disadvantage. This disadvantage was acknowledged in the arrangements which were made for allocating technical assistance contracts by giving a guaranteed quota to the small member states.  Ireland's quota <Col N="2415" /> of 2 per cent helped a number of Irish firms to get valuable experience of overseas consultancy in providing technical assistance to ACP countries and it is now clear that they are capable of competing for and winning contracts in open competition.</P>
    <P>In 1983, when the quota system was changed, Ireland succeeded in obtaining a minimum quota of 2 per cent with effectively no upper limit for the percentage of contracts which Irish firms could win.  In fact, the latest figures show that 3.48 per cent of technical assistance contracts are now being awarded to Ireland. For works and supplies contracts the picture is unfortunately not so good.  However, one must be realistic and accept that Irish firms face considerable difficulties in winning large works and supplies contracts in ACP countries.  The ACP countries constitute a highly competitive market where the major international firms, with many years experience and well established connections in the recipient countries, are at a clear advantage. Increasingly, the small and medium sized contracts, which would be within the capability of Irish contractors, are being won by local ACP firms.  From a developmental point of view this is, of course, highly desirable even if this may not seem the case to the Irish firms involved.</P>
    <P>Our record in supplying the materials required in EDF projects, that is, supply contracts, is reasonably good, at least by comparison with the other smaller EC countries.  We have to date sold over £6 million or almost 4 per cent of supplies under the fifth EDF.  However, our sales are made up almost exclusively of fertiliser and we appear to have had little success in supplying other products.  I might add that very few Irish firms even tender for this business.  Both my own Department and agencies such as Córas Tráchtála, the Confederation of Irish Industry and the Construction Industry Federation are very anxious to see more Irish firms involved in overseas work under Lomé III.  Every possible assistance is, <Col N="2416" /> and will continue to be, given to firms both in getting information about projects and in lobbying ACP Governments when this is considered appropriate.</P>
    <P>The most difficult area of the negotiations both within the Community and with the ACP was the question of the volume of financial resources to be made available under the convention.  Internal Community co-ordination on the size of the sixth European Development Fund was complicated by the need to reach agreement on the contribution keys of each member state.  When eventually a figure of 7,000 million ECU, approximately £5,040 million, was put to the ACP countries, it was rejected by them on the grounds that it did not constitute, and I quote &ldquo;an adequate financial contribution for the Lomé III Convention&rdquo;.  In the end, the Community was able to increase its offer to 7,500 million ECU by including an estimated contribution from Spain and Portugal and by a remarkable political gesture from Italy which agreed to contribute an additional 150 million ECU, approximately IR£108 million, over and above its normal contribution.</P>
    <P>The details of Community assistance to the ACP states under the new Convention are as follows.  The overall amount available to the ACP countries will be 8,500 million ECUs, approximately IR£6,120 million.  This represents a 54 per cent increase on the corresponding Lomé II figure and so maintains in real terms the value of the resources to be made available.  At a time when other international aid programmes are being cut back and even the bilateral programmes of the member states are showing retrenchment, I am satisfied that this figure is not ungenerous and shows our continuing commitment to the development of the ACP countries.</P>
    <P>The total amount is divided into 7,400 million ECU &mdash; approximately IR£5,328 million &mdash; which goes into the sixth European Development Fund and 1,000 million ECU &mdash; approximately IR£792 million &mdash; which will be loaned from the own resources of the European Investment Bank.  Outside the convention, provision <Col N="2417" /> is also being made within the sixth EDF for financial assistance to the overseas countries and territories in the sum of 100 million ECU &mdash; approximately IR£72 million &mdash; while 20 million ECU &mdash; approximately IR£14 million &mdash; will be provided by the EIB.</P>
    <P>Ireland's contribution to the new EDF will total approximately 41.3 million ECU &mdash; approximately IR£30 million &mdash; or 0.55 per cent of the overall amount.  It is expected that the moneys of the sixth EDF will be disbursed over a period of eight to ten years.</P>
    <P>The Lomé Convention is not able to provide solutions to all the problems confronting the ACP countries but it does make a considerable contribution towards solving some of them.  It remains a unique example of north-south co-operation of which Europe can be proud and in which Ireland can play a role disproportionate to our size and influence.  We participate fully in the decision-making programmes alongside the larger member states and, through the various specialised committees which assist the Commission in the management of the aid, we can make an important contribution to the design and approval of projects and programmes.</P>
    <P>The participation of Irish firms in Community funded projects has brought Irish expertise and skills to parts of the world with which we have had very little contact. The new convention sets new and important objectives for ACP-EEC co-operation and provides new challenges for those involved in their implementation. I therefore recommend that this House approve the terms of the third ACP-EEC Convention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Minister for giving us such a detailed review of the elements contained in the Third Lomé Convention.  I should also like to extend my congratulations to the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs on his contribution in bringing about the third in a row for Ireland.  I do not intend to make any great boast of this, but it is significant that this is the third time the negotiations for the <Col N="2418" /> Lomé Convention were concluded under an Irish Presidency.  I had the experience of concluding the negotiations for the Second Lomé Convention in 1979 and the current Taoiseach had the same experience in 1974.  We can feel a little tinge of satisfaction if not pride about that.  I extend to both Ministers in the House my congratulations on achieving the culmination of the Lomé Convention during the Irish Presidency.</P>
      <P>It is not a coincidence that Ireland should nearly always emerge as the EC country during whose presidency the Lomé Convention is signed.  This convention derives from the long association between the former colonies and their former imperial masters.  This association was particularly enshrined in the Yaounde Convention before the original Lomé Convention was launched.  Let us not overlook some of the realities in interpreting, analysing and, hopefully, redirecting the purpose and instruments of the Lomé Convention.  The ACP-EEC countries still feel, understandably so, that this convention is a very limited means, as they see it, of recompensing them for the manner in which over the years they were exploited.  Let there be no doubt about that in our minds.  If we do not take the view that they see this as an instrument of retribution and justice, we are mistaken.</P>
      <P>On the night before the Second Lomé Convention was to be signed I was in Lomé.  I was awakened at 3 o'clock in the morning by a message saying that the Ministers of the ACP countries wanted to see me.  At that hour of the morning it was conveyed to me that the convention would not be signed the following day unless there was a change in the preamble. The change required was that they insisted that the preamble should include a paragraph saying that the Second Lomé Convention was seen as an instrument of retribution for the exploitation, as they said deliberately, of the developing countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I pointed out to them that we knew a little about colonial exploitation in Ireland. We knew 700 years more of it than they did.  I said that if they wanted a <Col N="2419" /> paragraph in the premable, as the Irish Foreign Minister I would claim a chapter. That gave them an awareness that they were not the only people who had been exploited.  That incident demonstrates that Ireland is in a unique position because our experience is akin to the ACP countries' experience, not the same but akin.  As a country formerly exploited and dominated by one of the major imperial powers we can understand why the ACP countries are now even economically at a disadvantage, apart from the physical disabilities they may have and the geographical problems they have, because they have been exploited over the years.</P>
    <P>Let it not be said that the Lomé Convention is a very generous instrument on the part of the EC countries, that it was a unilateral decision of the EC countries to help, boost and be kind to the ACP countries, because it is not.  It is a significant attempt to recompense them for the disabilities which have accrued over the years and to restore a balance in terms of markets &mdash; I note some things which are not included in this convention and they were not in the previous ones either &mdash; in terms of money supply and the economic world order which pose a more critical problem for the developing countries than they do for us.  If we measure the impact of the transfer, about 60 countries must be involved in the ACP side.  Perhaps it is more now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is growing each year, obviously.  We are talking about the transfer of approximately £6,120 million over a five year period.  That is roughly £1,000 million per annum.  Let us put it in perspective.  The best perspective we can get on it is this: that our total budget in any one year is nine times the amount that will be provided under this convention to 66 countries.  It is important that we see the measure of this.  I do not want to dismiss it but neither do I want it presented as a major contribution from EC countries.  That is the first point.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister has, very fairly, given us <Col N="2420" /> details of the total amounts involved.  If one compares the amount of money transfers now with those negotiated under the first Lomé Convention &mdash; and the Minister makes the point that it maintains the level of assistance negotiated under the second Lomé Convention &mdash; as the person who negotiated the second Lomé Convention let me acknowledge this much: that while we did claim that Lomé II maintained the level of money in real terms of Lomé I, that did not take account of the impact of debt payments, interest payments and other matters that had accrued since Lomé I.  The blunt fact of the matter is that if one uses an inflation index &mdash; ours not theirs &mdash; one could say &ldquo;Yes, Lomé II kept pace with Lomé I in terms of real values and increased inflation&rdquo; and one could say the same now.  But the reality is that to get the real measure of the value of what is being contributed under any of the conventions &mdash; and we are now dealing with Lome III &mdash; one would have to take into account what will be the net gain accruing to them at the end of it. Having regard to the crushing burden of debt payments on developing countries, of interest payments &mdash; and God knows we know something about them here now &mdash; because they are, by definition, debtors to almost every international institution and developed country, then one will see that we have not kept pace with the contribution since Lomé I.  If one isolates the payments alone the answer is: &ldquo;Yes, we have, just about.&rdquo;  As the Minister said, in that sense it is not ungenerous, but perhaps there is a case for being a little more than not ungenerous; there is a case for making a major impact.  If we isolate the payments alone probably we could argue that we have kept pace.  But if one takes account of all the other events I have mentioned than it is clear that we have not.</P>
    <P>I want to draw a conclusion from that. Anybody looking at the state of western economies in recent times, in particular of the EC, could come to one conclusion only: that the European Community has, in a sense, turned in on itself.  The role of Europe in the future world economic <Col N="2421" /> order will be a limited one.  Europe is concentrating on budgets.  There was an example recently when we put a ceiling on a budget for agriculture over the next five years.  We are putting a ceiling on this and that.  We are not looking at all at the role and potential there for Europe, not merely within itself, but in terms of international trade.</P>
    <P>For instance, do we not realise that one of the problems that Europe has faced is that we are not getting the cheap raw material we used to get from many of these developing countries?  I am talking now in the period just before the EEC was launched and immediately thereafter when European industries were able to draw on cheap raw material from the primary producers in these countries, European multi-nationals particularly. Indeed not just Europeans but any of them could avail of cheap labour.  We built up western economies on the basis of raw material imports and cheap labour imports from what are now the ACP countries.  Let us recognise that as a reality of the world economic order as it was.  Now we have reached the point at which that cannot last.  Some of them, notably what are now termed the ASEAN countries, of Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the Philippines; I forget the fifth&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously they are growing.  A few years back, even in 1977-78, when I occupied the seat now occupied by the Minister present, they were in the category of least developed countries. Now they have lifted their economic development to the point that they are competitors of ours.  God knows we know that well enough here in the area of textiles. The fact of the matter is that for a long time imports from those countries into EC countries formed the base for our industry, for re-processing and whatever else.  Now they have seen the opportunity themselves for attracting the multi-nationals by their raw material availability and more importantly, by cheap <Col N="2422" /> labour, as they have claimed to date anyway.  The result is that most of the major multi-nationals now invest in these ASEAN countries particularly.</P>
      <P>We have already seen a change in the world economic order.  That is only an example of that change, though I would feel that fairly soon we shall see a major change in that when the cheap labour rates that have attracted people to these countries will not be quite as cheap as they have been to date.  Then there will be a greater balance in labour costs when people will not work for what are unduly deflated labour wages in those countries. That is a development we would all welcome, that there would be no exploitation of the labour market, which, in turn, can mean that one gets lower prices for products produced in those markets.</P>
      <P>I am still talking in general terms of the economic order.  Anyone who looks at Europe over the last five or ten years in particular &mdash; and I have had an opportunity of looking at it from the inside and outside &mdash; could not come to a conclusion that Europe really saw a dynamic role for itself, not just within Europe but in terms of a new and just world economic order.  I should make it clear that nothing I say is meant in any way as a criticism of the role of either Ministers present in the House or of Irish officials in this area. When the Minister mentions a very generous adjustment from Italy, a remarkable political gesture in that they agreed to contribute an extra £108 million above their normal contribution, I acknowledge that to be a remarkable political gesture. But one begins to wonder why.  What was happening that the whole operation hinged on an extra £108 million?  Why should the whole Lomé Convention hinge on whether there would be from Europe the amassed wealth of all of these nations of Europe who would put up an extra £108 million?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to say to our Italian friends &mdash; and I have had some associations with them over the years, though not on this particular issue &mdash;<i>grazie mille</i> because they have some awareness of their role and have close associations with many of the north African countries in particular <Col N="2423" /> with very little colonial domination.  Is it not a measure of how limited is the attitude of member states of the EC, particularly the major, powerful ones, that there was a risk that the Lomé Convention would not be concluded?  I suppose there was hardly a risk of its breaking down altogether but a risk that it would not be concluded when it was were it not for the fact that the Italian Government came up with £108 million commitment.  The major increase was from £5,040 million to £6,120 million overall and that says all that has to be said about the attitude of the European Community at present.</P>
    <P>In its attitude to the Convention and the amounts involved, the Community is giving no central leadership, direction or purpose either within its own bounds or in its relationships with other countries. The Community has been diverted into concentration on budget contributions which small men have caused by yielding to dominant demanding countries, particularly Britain, and they have not been strong enough to say that that is not the kind of Europe they want.  There was great hope when the European Community was launched for a balanced and parallel development in terms of elimination of regional balances and externally between the European Community and its partners.  The Lomé countries must always be seen as partners.  Instead of seeing that parallel and consistent thread based on opportunity, justice, togetherness and potential we are seeing quite the opposite.  Anyone who writes the history of Europe in the late seventies or early eighties will not note anything of great consequence.</P>
    <P>Many new areas have developed: technical assistance, marketing co-operation, financial and technical co-operation, social and cultural co-operation and trade.  However, an historian will see that nothing really big emerged in Europe in the seventies and eighties.  When the history of this era is written they will say that the first Convention achieved a lot but, after that, these Conventions did not make a major, dynamic contribution to world justice or economic order.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2424" /> Let me give some examples of what is missing from this Convention.  The reality for most of these countries is that their debt service repayments are a crushing burden around almost all their necks. The Convention does not address itself to that problem.  Within the last five years, that has become a major problem for these countries.  That was also the case in 1979 but not to the same extent as at present.  This is not a criticism of my colleagues in the House, far from it, but those within the institutions of the Community either at Commission level or Council Secretariat level should have addressed this problem.  Look at our own constraints and translate them into the position of the African countries.  We know the constraints which our foreign debt imposed on our economic development. We have all read about interest charges, in what currency we should borrow and so on.  That is only a slight reflection of the problems facing the developing countries because they borrow more heavily and perhaps cannot always place their borrowings at the most appropriate time.  We can make our choice in that regard although I contend that sometimes we make the wrong choices.  However, I will not go into that matter.  Those countries have no choice and have to take what they get on the available terms.  The Convention should have launched into that area and tried to get either through the EMS system, which unfortunately has not developed, or through arrangements with world banks &mdash; and I know they already play a role &mdash; some indemnity against appreciation of their foreign debt which has become a major problem.</P>
    <P>I want to stress the value of marketing. The Minister said:</P>
    <P>Trade is a key part of the Convention and I am pleased to report that all the concessions of the previous two Conventions have been retained and strengthened.  We have not been able to advance as far as the ACP would have liked... </P>
    <P>One could read for that that we have not been able to advance as far as the ACP <Col N="2425" /> and the Irish Presidency would have liked because, if my experience is anything to go by, we were generally well in advance of most of our partners in that area.  The Minister went on to say:</P>
    <P>...nevertheless, I am satisfied that the provisions of the Convention should enable many ACP countries, including some of the poorest among them, to gain freer access to the markets of the community. </P>
    <P>It is clear that the second major disability which these countries suffer in terms of building their own economies &mdash; and we all want to promote self-sufficiency &mdash; is trade imbalance and marketing disabilities of one form or another.  They do not have access to markets and there are all kinds of hidden barriers which exist even within GATT.  There are all kinds of customs regulations which militate against trade but, above, all, they lack marketing expertise, marketing analysis and marketing capacity to exploit markets to their advantage.  You must be familiar with markets and supply them on the basis of that familiarity.  Some countries are slightly better established than others &mdash; Nigeria is one &mdash; but, generally speaking, their marketing effort is so weak as to be ineffective. They have not got a marketing strategy in terms of developing or producing products. They have not got a research and development capacity.  Why should the Western world do all the research and development and pass on the information to them?  They will never be independent or self-sufficient.  They will never really be capable of exploiting and developing their own potential until such time as they have what we have.  Their research and development capacity does not feature in the Convention except to a small degree. Neither does marketing feature in the Convention nor does the other matter I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>To that extent I find the Convention a great deal less than adequate or inspiring. The Stabex provisions are being strengthened but those provisions have been in existence since Lomé I which the Taoiseach negotiated.  The Sysmin provisions <Col N="2426" /> have been in existence since Lomé II in which I was involved in terms of the minerals area.  It is significant that there is an extension on the existing Convention in relation to agriculture in terms of drought and desertification and re-afforestation programmes but that is about the major extension in this Convention.</P>
    <P>The major deep-seated problems that give rise to all of this are not being tackled. That is unfortunate.  We have all been shocked to see the pictures from Ethiopia, in particular, of the starving peoples.  Those of our own voluntary workers who are more familiar with these countries than we are have said that supplying food is no answer, that self-sufficiency must be brought about as a first priority.  The Minister can say rightly that to this extent the Convention is aiming in the right direction in trying to create food security and self-sufficiency but the Convention is not trying to create a new order in which markets can be opened up for these countries and particularly in which our surplus capacity can be used effectively to underpin their development.  It is extraordinary that only this week this introspective Europe, a Europe which is losing direction and inspiration and which is unworthy of the founders whose names we invoke &mdash; Schumann, Spaak and so on, whose names we are hardly worthy to mention &mdash; is putting a saving on agricultural spending for the next five years without even beginning to realise that we should begin to produce for the needs of the developing countries and to redirect the nature of our production, whether in high protein foods or otherwise, that we should start a research and development process to investigate how our meat surplus could be transferred to products that would be suitable for those peoples and make a major determined effort to ascertain how the scandal of surpluses could be used effectively by way of new technological research to produce foods that are suitable for the starving peoples of Africa.  In that way we would be demonstrating that Europe is ready not merely to co-operate but to be a part of the real world.  The attitude in Europe is <Col N="2427" /> that, &ldquo;Mrs. Thatcher's approach to our budget is that X percentage be devoted to agriculture and if that means that we must produce an X percentage from somewhere else, we must cut back on agriculture.&rdquo;  The budget ceiling has been set as the only issue in European development and this will impinge on the Lomé Convention, too.</P>
    <P>If we begin in terms of new techniques for the development of agriculture in areas where there is a surplus, is it not extraordinary that in a world in which there is such a shortage of food, we in the breadbasket of the world are cutting back on food production?  That is a scandal, not to mention its impact on our own country.  Surely it is not beyond the wit or the commitment of the European countries to produce food of a kind that would meet the needs of the developing countries.  In addition, as the Minister has indicated, there is the most important aspect of helping them to attain self-sufficiency in the production of their food but they are a long way from that.  The cycles of drought and of soil erosion which are an endemic part of the African condition particularly are such that a major long term commitment in science and technology will be required to bring about a change in soil and climatic conditions affecting agriculture.</P>
    <P>That is not to say that we must not make the effort but in the meantime we must supply what those people need.  Is there any guarantee that we will not again witness the scandals that have aroused us in terms of Ethiopia particularly?  Let us not fool ourselves that the problem relates only to Ethiopia.  Eritrea has been mentioned but that brings in another problem.  There are similar problems in Tanzania, in Zambia, in Lesotho and in the Sudan from time to time, sometimes for six to 12 months before we hear of them.</P>
    <P>We react only when such tragic events as the famine in Ethiopia are brought to our attention.  But we must do much more than react.  There is a historic obligation on us in Europe &mdash; I include Ireland though we had no part in colonial <Col N="2428" /> exploitation &mdash; to protect these people against the ravages of famine.  A great opportunity has been missed, not just in the Convention, but in terms of European policy, to opt for an enhanced food production programme in Europe as distinct from limiting the amount of food production.  Both at the Council and in the Commission I have witnessed the European preoccupation with the budget.  This preoccupation which the British in particular have introduced into Europe has turned Europe inwards in a way that is damaging the whole role and purpose of the Community and also our relationship with these other countries. It is time we moved away from that. Otherwise, the history of this decade as it relates to Europe will not be one to be proud of and I will not take any pride in having been involved in some way.</P>
    <P>When we talk about the ACP countries, there is a factor we should recognise apart from the economic disabilities and disadvantages.  It is easier for the Ten to reach a consensus than it is for the 66. Within that number there are African, Caribbean and Pacific nations at various stages of development and with different preoccupations and priorities.  Some want better scope for mineral development, some want better markets for agricultural products and some want to get direct money transfers to develop tourism.  For all these countries to come together and find a common purpose on which to reach agreement with the Ten is a major achievement in itself.  I recall when we negotiated these conventions that the then President of the ACP had a much more difficult job than I had.  Bri St. John of Barbados had to deal with 60 countries while I had to deal with nine or ten. We should recognise the problems these countries have in reaching a consensus. They arise because of differences in culture, history and the economic priorities of the various countries.</P>
    <P>With regard to social and cultural co-operation, I note there is now a new statement of principle in the Convention. It states that the member states and ACP States will continue to ensure that <Col N="2429" /> through the legal or administrative measures adopted by them the foreign nationals within their territory will not be subjected to discrimination on the basis of racial, religious, cultural or social differences. We can say and mean that the EC countries will not subject foreign nationals in our territory to discrimination on the basis of racial, religious, cultural or social differences but we must recognise it is happening all the time. However, the chances of discriminating against the educated white man in the ACP countries are so minimal as not to require inclusion in the Convention.  He is an essential agent there in whatever development programmes are being carried out.</P>
    <P>The reality of discrimination exists in the school and housing programmes and in employment in those countries.  I do not oppose the inclusion of such a statement of intent but if it is to become a reality we have a long way to go.  It is not always a matter for government: it is a matter of the attitude of people.  I do not think we will begin to reach the end of that road until we cater in these countries for the basic priority, namely, education as we do in our own country.  That is the guarantee for them, as it is for us and for Japan.  In that country 45 per cent of those going into first time employment have third level education.  It is not quite as high as that in Switzerland but it is close to it.  When we turn to the other end of the scale, we must ask how many people in employment have any education.</P>
    <P>We will never get rid of discrimination by statements of principle until there is equal opportunity for all.  We will not even get rid of discrimination in this city until there are equal educational opportunities for the children from the inner city and for the children from Foxrock. We can complain about urban vandalism but we will never get to the root of the problem, even in our own small community, unless we provide equal educational opportunities at every level.  This matter of education was being discussed when I was involved with the last Convention but I do not know what has happened in <Col N="2430" /> the meantime.  Educational programmes as they relate to modern technological developments are vital.  It is not enough to say that we will work with those countries through our consultants, although there is something in that for us and I understand that approach.  We have consultancy projects in Tanzania, Zambia, Sudan, Somalia and elsewhere.  If we are serious about a new economic world order &mdash; and Lomé is meant to be an instrument in that direction &mdash; we will have to concentrate on education, particularly in this era of technology.  If we do not, no matter how much we transfer, we will not even keep pace with where we were, much less move forward.  The matter needs to be considered in the context of the ACP-EC relationship.  Apart from the justice of the case, it is the only way one can guarantee against discrimination.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Ministers opposite will share my view that one could have nothing but admiration for the intellectual capacity of some of the Ministers of the ACP countries.  They put many of us in the EC to shame in terms of their philosophy and capacity.  On the other hand, in some cases we were not negotiating on equal terms because some Ministers were ill-equipped to negotiate on any basis with anyone because of their lack of educational opportunity.  Only by concentrating on developing their resources and potential can we have an era where there will be no discrimination but where there will be equal opportunity.</P>
    <P>We get the ritual commitment in relation to apartheid and injustice and I hope it means something real in our case.  I have seen too many cases where we said one thing in the EC and did something else.  If the member states who pledge themselves to fight against the injustice of apartheid really mean what they say they could do it effectively.  However, they are still supplying markets there to a considerable extent and they are drawing on the uranium of South Africa to a considerable extent.  There is a mutual inter-dependence between the economic structure in many member states of the EC and the current South African régime <Col N="2431" /> and we would be foolish to ignore it.  Our record may not be so great, but in terms of supporting the motion against apartheid in sport, we paid a bigger price for being as good as our word.  We would not allow our semi-State bodies to sponsor world cup golf in Kerry in 1978 when I was Minister.  This was a big loss to us, and to Kerry, because we would have had the world golf stars here with international television coverage.  We did what we said we would do and paid the price in terms of tourism loss and so on. Many of our partners in the EC say one thing but do something else.</P>
    <P>In the course of discussions on political co-operation in particular, we should remind our EC colleagues that statements of principle are one thing but actions are what we are really interested in.  Britain, the Federal Republic of Germany and France tell us they will co-operate with the ACP countries in trying to get rid of apartheid, but what they actually do and what they put in print are very different.  We do not have to apologise for reminding them of that.  If people make a statement of principle they should act on it and if they do not intend acting on it, let them be honest enough not to make such statements which do not mean much.</P>
    <P>I welcome the concentration on agricultural capacity of the ACP states to deal with such problems as afforestation, erosion and so on.  This is a major step forward.  I commend the actions taken through our own programme in this connection over a number of years.  In our bilateral co-operation programme, we concentrated on personnel development and tried to transfer knowledge and technology to the countries with whom we co-operate.  I insist on using the word &ldquo;co-operate&rdquo; because it is a two-way process. I am thinking particularly of Tanzania, Lesotho, the Sudan and Zambia. It is vitally important that that kind of approach be extended on a much broader base to co-operation between the EC and the ACP countries.  We will never help them to combat the problems which are <Col N="2432" /> endemic to Africa unless we transfer skills and technology to them.</P>
    <P>When I was in Africa I saw examples of money which had been transferred. For instance, projects which had been undertaken five years before we arrived in Lesotho, on which millions of pounds had been spent, had all gone for nothing because the people did not have the knowledge and capacity to maintain the programmes.  If this knowledge and expertise is not made available to the people the benefits of the project are of very limited duration.  For that reason, I commend the kind of developments we have been promoting for some time.  I am thinking particularly of actions in countries like Burundi.  I was Minister when that programme was launched but other Deputies were Ministers when other programmes were launched.  None of us claims credit here but there was one theme through all our programmes which I am sure still remains.  Our priority was to help the people to develop their own special resources.  Hence the concentration on peat development in Burundi or the Basatho ponies in Lesotho.  The Minister should commend, on the broader range of activities in EC/ACP co-operation, that kind of focus we concentrated on in our bilateral programme, not a transfer of money or even food but, much more important, a transfer of knowledge, skill and technology.  This is a guarantee of a much better understanding and more mature relationship. between the donor countries and the donee countries.</P>
    <P>Ireland has a special obligation which we face up to, but this is only a reflection of the attitude of our people because their contributions to voluntary agencies are running ahead of official contributions.  I am not saying this as a political criticism of the Government, because this has always been the case.  This is proof that our people are encouraging Governments to develop official programmes to aid these countries.  We should do everything in our power to maintain our commitment to the ODA targets.  We should not juggle with words. We should do what we say.  We can use <Col N="2433" /> any words we like to interpret our commitments so that it will appear that we are living up to them, but the reality is that we are not measuring up to the targets set by the UN in the development decade to which we were committed.</P>
    <P>Our record is a good one but I would like to make a suggestion.  I am glad it is recorded that we are getting some level of contributions from consultancies and contracts under EDF.  I remember negotiating this with Claude Cheysson and saying it was time we were allowed in on this area.  I remember asking why only the French and Belgians got the consultancy contracts under Lomé.  The 2 per cent commitment was made by way of a gentleman's agreement.  It is important that we exploit the opportunities that exist under the consultancy contracts, because we are way behind having regard to the natural advantages which the French and the British have had over the years.  This must be one priority.  We cannot just rely on placing the blame on others that we are not getting our share of contracts.  Having reviewed our relationship with the development countries I consider that there is real scope for having a centre for development studies, for bilateral co-operation, for technology, for research and market development.  I am thinking of something that has not been attempted elsewhere, where we would have for instance, in Shannon which has a natural advantage, a new centre for studies, consultancies, research and so on.</P>
    <P>
      <i>Notice taken that 20 Members were not present; House counted and 20 Members being present;</i>
    </P>
    <P>Ireland has a major traditional role in terms of our relations with developing countries.  As we look at the obligation of the European Community to develop an new era of understanding and co-operation with the African countries we must be conscious of our role.  Ireland has experienced deprivation due to colonial domination.  We have experienced a lack of opportunity and a lack of economic development.  Now that we have come to <Col N="2434" /> a new era of confidence the only hope for justice in the world is if we encourage through educational programmes, through research and technology, the same capacity and confidence in the developing countries.  I support what the Minister has presented to the House.</P>
    <P>While I am on my feet talking about co-operation with the countries of the world I will say that it is a happy coincidence and privilege that we are addressing this topic when the delegation from the US Congress are here to promote closer co-operation with the old sod of Ireland with which they have a particular association.  It is appropriate for me to say, as the Chair is bound by silence, that we have presiding over our affairs here today a Tipperary man who was born in New York.  It is a matter of great pride to us to have our US associates with us this morning.  I know that we are working for the same aims not in a sense of selfish promotion but in the knowledge that unless we create conditions for justice throughout the world we will not even have the conditions for peace in our country. It is a happy coincidence that this delegation are with us as we address the major problems of the developing countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific nations in the context of the Lomé Convention.  I welcome the delegation on this festive occasion coming up to Saint Patrick's Day and I hope that it will be a further encouragement to the Minister to realise that while we are a small country we have great and powerful friends who will work with us not just in our interests but in the interests of achieving a new balanced economic order in the world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Owen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome our distinguished guests.  Some, if not all of them are politicians and I would hate to tell them what they have done to my nerves by arriving just as I am about to make my contribution.  I was already feeling somewhat inhibited because sitting in the Chamber were the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and an ex-foreign Minister all of whom had intimately negotiated the signing of the Lomé II and Lomé III <Col N="2435" /> Conventions.  I welcome our guests and hope that they will find this discussion of interest.</P>
      <P>I am happy that we are about to ratify the Lome III Convention.  There is no doubt when one looks back at the papers issued and the comments made when the discussions started in late 1983 to prepare the Lomé III Convention that there were many pessimists who worried that there would not be a Lomé III, because there did not appear to be a chance of reaching agreement not only between the 65 ACP countries but between the ten European countries.  It is a happy day that the optimists have now seen their optimism come to reality.  What most optimists hoped for was that at least the Lomé II convention would be consolidated and if possible the amount of money available increased. We have heard today that not only have the terms of Lomé II been consolidated but there has been a real increase in the amount of money made available.  Lest Deputy O'Kennedy leave the House I will address one or two points he raised.</P>
      <P>The burden of debt with which the ACP countries have to contend is a grievous drawback and the most serious element of their problems.  While saying that this should have been dealt with in the Lomé Convention, I contend that the whole essence and spirit of this document is to get the countries to a state of development in which they would no longer have to depend on loans or grants, although many of these loans are of the soft loan variety, with very preferential repayments detailed in them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that Deputy O'Kennedy was suggesting, but perhaps he was, that the 7,400 million ECUs which have been written into this Lomé Convention should all go to wipe out the debts of all these countries.  That is just unrealistic. One would still have all the basic underdevelopment in these countries to contend with.  It is obvious that self-sufficiency and self-dependence will arise only by a concerted long term, phased programme of development.  Deputy O'Kennedy's suggestion may sound a <Col N="2436" /> simple way of getting rid of the problem, but it is unrealistic.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke about creating more food mountains.  The problem at the moment is that we have not managed to find a way to move the food mountains we have, and which are suitable for feeding the starving people of Africa.  We find ourselves continually tied up in red tape. Producing more food is not the answer. We should try to use up what food is there.  That is what we should be working towards now, before any more mountains or lakes come into existence.</P>
    <P>The Deputy also spoke about the lack of any chapter on marketing.  This is an extraordinarily complicated document, but there is a chapter which deals very intricately with the development of trade and services &mdash; Chapter 6.  Certainly, there is a spirit in the Convention that ACP countries should be given every possible co-operation and assistance in developing their markets and in educating themselves as to how to participate in these markets.  The spirit and content may be there, but it is another matter to make it work properly.  I am afraid that history shows that it has not worked all that well.</P>
    <P>It was significant that in December 1984, when Lomé III was signed, there was far more interest or awareness of the fact that such a thing as a Lomé convention existed.  Many would have been hard pressed when the last convention was being signed to say where Togo or Lomé were.  With the help of television and the media in general, the public are being educated in the need for a wider outlook on the world and a moving away from the insular attitude that tended to prevail, both here in Ireland and in Europe as a whole.  It was significant that the Convention was signed in December when we here were being appalled at the pictures arriving via our television screens from Ethiopia and other sub-Saharan countries.</P>
    <P>There has rightly been a great deal of criticism of the EC developed countries, the United States included.  Perhaps this was because of the lack of and the tardiness of response and the unfortunate fire <Col N="2437" /> brigade type of response which we make generally when we see horrific pictures. The developed countries failed to move in and to negotiate in time to prevent the catastrophies which unfortunately occurred.  We are only human, we cannot change the climates of these countries. The thrust of programmes must be towards accepting the parameters within which these countries have to live and in trying to work within them, leading to long term development.</P>
    <P>Despite all this criticism, one must acknowledge the tremendous initiative of this Lomé III Convention, that it has been signed and has been a success.  This signature was in doubt at the beginning. Lomé I and II have been consolidated in Lomé III.  I cannot look into the future to see if there will be a Lomé IV or if some other form of co-operation will be worked out.  One must give an amount of praise to the initiative of Lomé.</P>
    <P>I intended at the outset to pay tribute to our Ministers who were involved in the negotiations leading up to the signing of the Convention.  Our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Barry, signed the Convention and, as Deputy O'Kennedy has said, this is the third convention which has been signed during an Irish Presidency.</P>
    <P>We also need to pay tribute to the back-up team, our officers who have participated in these discussions.  For depth of technicality, complication and complexity it would be hard to beat this document of the Lomé negotiations.  Those who did most of the work probably were the backroom boys and girls, who deserve a word of congratulations.  This includes our officials both at home and in Brussels. I should like that put on the record.</P>
    <P>Much has been and will continue to be said about the more negative aspects of the history of Lomé and the present Lomé convention.  Most glaring on the negative side is the fact that in many countries the development progress has been slow and faltering, in some almost non-existent and some countries have gone backwards.  Despite the billions of dollars, pounds and ECUs made available, there are countries which are worse <Col N="2438" /> off today than they were eight years ago, but perhaps not as long as 30 years ago when the EC was founded.</P>
    <P>True, in the negotiations leading up to Lomé III, the ACP countries sought a much greater financial commitment from the EC countries, something in excess of 4 billion ECUs over what eventually was agreed upon.  True, in the area of policy dialogue there were long and arduous debates and discussions and what came out was a slightly different concept from what the EC countries had in mind.  True, even within the EC countries there were differences, particularly in the area of trading.</P>
    <P>Recently, I was asked to chair a debate run by Concern, in a series being conducted all over the country in second level schools.  I was very pleased and, quite frankly, surprised at the depth of knowledge that these 15 and 16 year olds had of the importance of the trading area with regard to development, aid and so forth.  I had to tell these young people that when I was 15 years old, I would not have known the first thing about that subject.  Firstly, there was very little literature to consult and, secondly, it was not a discussion subject at school.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the scenario for the Lomé III negotiations was one where many countries were turning in on themselves because of the recession.  They were trying to consolidate what they had within their own boundaries and not to look outside.  Their tendency was to consider their growing problems of unemployment, loss of jobs and so forth.  That is the danger of negotiating a Convention like this in recession &mdash; people will look inwards rather than outwards.  Therefore there are millions of people who are unable to work their vast natural resources and consequently there are millions suffering from starvation.  It is a paradox that has not been solved.  No country participating in the Lomé Convention has yet reached the status of a newly industrialised country.  It had been hoped that as countries came in at the bottom of the scale other countries at the top would be looking for industrial status and, in turn, <Col N="2439" /> would be able to help the less fortunate countries.</P>
    <P>It would be unrealistic to think that the 65 ACP countries and the ten EC countries could sit down together and find a peaceful solution acceptable to all. Even the ten European countries cannot agree among themselves.  It would be wrong to expect that such meetings and conventions would be all peace.  The 65 ACP countries, though joined together, are not homogeneous.  They have different political structures, different population structures and different climates. We can see from the negotiations how difficult it is to reach agreement. This must be accepted as the reason why negotiations were long and difficult.  The homogeneity of all the countries is separating even the 65.  Twenty of the 31 developing countries are in Africa and all the indications are that all the emphasis must be on Africa.  The indicators show that in those countries incomes are down, health facilities are down, the amount of food available is down and that is why I should like to see the setting up of this new fund which will make available to the ACP countries 8,500 million ECUs. This should help to get at the structural problems in African countries more quickly.  It will help to bring together all the technological possibilities necessary to improve those countries.</P>
    <P>It would be wrong to blame the Lomé Convention for the position in Africa still.  There has been a general deterioration in world economies and there has been fragility in the whole of Africa which for years was composed of colonial societies and the conditions were not there for the Africans to build up stronger economies.  There has been increased cost of energy and higher population growths in those countries and of course the convention cannot dictate family planning among their populations.  What is necessary now is to draw up structures so that the terms of the convention can be implemented.</P>
    <P>Though this convention generally is one of the consequences of Lomé II there is a deeper accent on autonomy.  There is <Col N="2440" /> more selectivity and more provision for sectoral development.  This is a welcome development of the Lomé Convention, and the EC and ACP countries should be able to sit down and set their programme, having given a more realistic appraisal to the necessities.  This should lead to the using up of the money to better purposes.</P>
    <P>There is no doubt that the drawdown of moneys by some of those countries under Lomé II has been disappointing. Though Kenya drew down 60 per cent of the moneys available, in Zambia they do not have the infrastructure to make use of the moneys available and there is a drawdown of only approximately 20 per cent.  That money is still there in the central exchequer but efforts must be made to help those countries to make better use of the financial terms available. We must have the thematic activity which will provide a wider balance.  Whereas we cannot control climates in all countries, we can get co-operation between the ACP and the EC to implement policies that by themselves will aid the drought stricken.  A desert does not stop when it reaches a border.  It continues on and it is here that regional policies are very important so that the work will not stop in one country, because, of course, the desert runs merrily along into the others. Here the regional aspect must be guarded carefully.</P>
    <P>I welcome the increased openings that will be made available for private investment. The Lomé Convention on its own is not the panacea, the final answer, leading to sustainable development in these countries.  There will have to be a great deal of co-operation among a number of agencies, including private investment. Included is an extra chapter relating to the expansion of the fishing and shipping sectors.  The Minister has highlighted another modification in the convention, the social and cultural co-operation and also the human rights area, which embraces the increased awareness and recognition in this convention of the role of women in development.  As a woman involved in this area I welcome that because perhaps it is not sufficiently <Col N="2441" /> taken into account.  If one looks at the pictures that we see here and examines the projects that go on in the Third World one realises that many of those countries are not only worked by but are having a major effect on women and children, and this convention emphasises that.  For the record I quote Article 123:</P>
    <P> 1.  Co-operation shall support the ACP States' efforts aimed at enhancing the work of women, improving their living conditions, expanding their role and promoting their status in the production and development process.</P>
    <P>2.  Particular attention shall be given to access by women to all aspects of training, to more advanced technology, to credit and to co-operative organizations, and to appropriate technology aimed at alleviating the arduous nature of their tasks.  </P>
    <P>We do not have to be told here in this House of the arduous nature of those tasks where women must walk 20 miles to get a bucket of water.  I welcome the extra chapter in the convention this year acknowledging the role of women and recognising it in the definition of the cultural and social considerations.  Many of the countries have adopted projects that were developmental in nature and may well have developed things like water sources and material resources, but on the other hand these were leading to a deterioration of their social and cultural structures.  This detrimental element in development must be watched very carefully. Developed countries going into a developing country sometimes can be very insensitive to the social structures that exist there.  They do not recognise that people do things differently in other parts of the world from the way we do them here.  They rush in like a bull going into a china shop, insisting that the way we do it is always right.  That is a shortsighted, tunnelled approach.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the opening address of the Togolese President at the commencement of the celebrations for the signing of this convention.  He <Col N="2442" /> reminded the participating countries that they were making a solemn undertaking to go beyond a simple calculation of the self-interest of our states to see man as capable of progress and out-doing his own efforts in a new world which he has made a better place by finally understanding the meaning of solidarity.  He was highlighting the fact that the motive behind which countries participate in a convention such as the Lomé must be of the highest order and not of self-interest.</P>
    <P>Because of the recession belt tightening in the EC, a number of the ACP countries have not seen the significant improvements that one would have hoped for.  Analyses of such situation reveal two inherent dangers.  The first is that we would all jump up and say that we must do more, that we must pour more money in, that we must over-sensationalise the whole problem.  In other words, we must assuage our consciences and assure ourselves that we are doing the best we can.  I submit that, if that was what had happened, then not only would we have been standing still; we would have been going backwards as far as development is concerned.  The very spirit of the Lomé Conventions I, II and now III is one of self-dependence, self-reliance, self-sufficiency; and going in that frame of mind in order to assuage the conscience of the developed world is of necessity damaging to that spirit.  The other danger that existed when the negotiators were sitting down, and still exists now that they are implementing the recommendations of the convention, is in the whole area of the policy dialogue. This gives rise to a great deal of discussion. There is the danger of chasing in and doing the cosmetic project.  Equally there is the danger of saying that it has not worked as it was set up for the last eight years and now the donor countries will have a far greater say, will wield the big stick and say what is best for the developing countries.  It is a return to a kind of paternalistic attitude.</P>
    <P>Neither of these attitudes prevailed in this convention, I am happy to say.  However, in the area of policy dialogue as it emerged eventually &mdash; it was called the <Col N="2443" /> programming process, which does not go quite as far as the policy dialogue that the EC countries would want &mdash; whether we and the ACP countries like it or not, it has, as everything nowadays has, an element of conditionality attached.  If I want to borrow £100 from a bank the bank manager will look for some form of collateral.  If I want to use credit to buy something in a shop they will look for some form of collateral.  It is unrealistic to expect that these vast resources of money are being made available to the Third World and ACP countries without them recognising that they have responsibility to make the best use of it.  Of course, the EC countries have an obligation and responsibility to their taxpayers who are paying all this money to answer the questions and ensure, and assure, that the money is being spent effectively and wisely.</P>
    <P>The greatest damage can be done to the whole process of development and development education by the pictures and television coverage of something like the very lavish and extraordinary celebrations that a country such as Ethiopia had when millions of their people are dying of starvation, or, further back, the obscene and lavish coronation of Emperor Bokassa, of The Central African Republic, in the late seventies, a Napoleonic affair, when the people were dying around him and millions of pounds, dollars and ECUs were being poured into the African continent.  Something like that can, understandably, turn off the people of developed countries whose taxes are being used to go towards the development of those countries.  The ACP countries must understand that there is no such thing as a free lunch.  If we are to make the best use of this money some conditions must attach to it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the fact that a programming process exists whereby the ACP and EC countries can get together and work out what is best for them.  What we and the other EC countries must do is ensure that this Lomé Convention is more successful than Lomé II.  In this regard I welcome the extra conditions in the terms of the <Col N="2444" /> financing of this convention where there is a shift towards an assessment of the broad objectives.  The Commission and the European Investment Bank will be obliged to make a report which will include an assessment of the impact of EC aid on the economic and social development of the ACP countries.  They must also inform the Council of Ministers of the results of their evaluation of the projects and how they live up to the developmental objectives laid down in the convention.  This element of answerability and continual assessment is vital so that we will not find at the end of four or five years there are blatant gaps in the success of the Lomé III Convention.</P>
    <P>In 1989 if there is a Lomé IV we will have passed the end of 30 years of ACP-EC co-operation.  I should like to think that history will record that some good has come out of it.  As far as the financial commitment is concerned one has only to look at the increase from 1957 when the six EC countries entered into a convention. The amount of money available then was 581 million ECUs.  In 1984 that increased to 7,400 million ECUs.  We must ensure that not only is the financial commitment there but that it has some effect.  Unfortunately massive transfers of money do not equal development.  It is not the amount of money that counts but what is done with it.</P>
    <P>We are a small country geographically and economically but we have made many gains by participating in this and other international agencies.  On my way to a meeting the other evening I heard a replay of John F. Kennedy's address to this House in 1963.  It is still true today that nations which are far bigger than ours have not played the same kind of role that we have, despite our size.  We have a role to play which is disproportionate to our size.  The experience and value of our co-operation with 65 ACP countries is enormous to us.  We should be aware of that and learn from it.</P>
    <P>There appears to be a consensus among the negotiators and international observers that real progress was made although perhaps not as great as the ACP countries had hoped for.  There were shortcomings <Col N="2445" /> and some expectations may not have been met, but as in any other area of endeavour the convention will be measured less on the quantity, books, papers and hours of negotiation and more on the effectiveness and quality of what is done.</P>
    <P>I welcome the ratification of the convention. As chairperson of the Oireachtas Committee on Overseas Development I am glad to have had an opportunity to speak on development because it is a subject that does not get a great deal of airing in this House.  This convention gave me an opportunity to say a few words on it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe) Jim O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. J. O'Keeffe)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the House for the compliments which were paid to my colleague, Deputy Barry, and to me in connection with the negotiation of Lomé III.  On behalf of the development co-operation division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, I express my appreciation of the compliments which were passed in relation to their work. Nobody knows better than I the outstanding work they have done not only in relation to Lomé but in relation to the entire development co-operation programme.</P>
      <P>It might be no harm to mention that in 1985, when our development co-operation will involve funding of approximately £38 million, the total number involved in the division including diplomatic, administrative and clerical staff totals not more than 28 people.  Having made that opening remark I must express my disappointment.  I appreciate the contributions made to the debate but I was disappointed at the relatively small number of contributors.  I should have liked to have seen a broader debate with a greater number of speakers.  It is important that we get more legislators involved in discussing the issues raised by Lomé and other development issues.  I hope we may succeed in attracting a greater number of speakers when we next have a debate in this area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When one looks at the Lomé agreement what is important is not to overstate its importance in resolving the problems of developing countries while at the same <Col N="2446" /> time recognising many of its unique merits.  Looking at the latter half of that equation first, there is a danger of measuring the merits of Lomé purely in terms of its funding which has now been increased to over £6,000 million.  It is probably easier to compare the figures one had in the earlier conventions and try to assess the merits of Lomé III on that basis.  That would be a mistake. What are important are the other provisions dealing with trade, tourism, fishing, transport, energy and other areas which are of far greater benefit to developing countries than the amount of aid funding.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned the introduction of Stabex and Sysmin and the other instruments of the convention. These were unique and innovative in their time.  The Community can claim credit for establishing unique instruments of co-operation which, hopefully, will be reflected in agreements made between the developed world with the developing world.</P>
    <P>What we have here is a unique convention, Lomé I, which was signed when the Taoiseach was Minister for Foreign Affairs.  As Deputy O'Kennedy mentioned, we have a unique treble with Deputy O'Kennedy in the chair of the Council of Ministers in Europe for Lomé II and the Presidency back with us again for Lomé III.  It is fair to say that in our approach to Lomé III the national position was as liberal and as progressive as possible.  From the point of view of funding, my approach was that we would make our contribution to the fund as large as possible, and that was recognised by our partners in the European Community and the members of the ACP.  We were also trying to secure terms of the convention which would be as helpful and as liberal as possible.</P>
    <P>In the past some criticism was expressed in relation to our approach to access of beef to the Community.  That criticism was based largely on a misunderstanding. There was a provision for admitting 30,000 tonnes of beef under Lomé II. There was some discussion on whether that figure should be increased.  When we examined the records over the past <Col N="2447" /> number of years, we discovered that the existing quota had never been filled.  I think the maximum amount ever supplied in any one year under that provision was 18,000 tonnes.  Really we were talking about an illusory problem.  That was the only area where we had to reinvestigate the facts and present the position as it was.  I do not think there can be any criticism even in that area when the quota has not been filled.  The quota will be continued.  Because of animal health problems in Zimbabwe and elsewhere it is unlikely to be filled for quite a long time.</P>
    <P>During the latter half of 1984 we were not just presenting a national viewpoint. Holding the Presidency of the Community we had to ensure that an agreement was completed.  Deputy O'Kennedy will recollect the hours of tedious negiotiations involved in getting an agreement between the Ten first and then with the ACP.  Our approach was that it was well worthwhile making every effort possible to ensure that an agreement was reached. We had to take into account when we assessed the national input to the funding aspect of the agreement, that Ireland's contribution is .6 per cent.  Let us not overstate the relevance of the national position in regard to the funding.  We had a viewpoint nationally and we made it clear that we were prepared to join in any figure on which we could reach agreement with our partners.  I would have liked to have seen a higher funding figure. The real effort at the end was to get agreement among all the member states to a figure which would be acceptable to the ACP.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister at liberty to indicate &mdash; and if he is not I will understand &mdash; why the Italians were selected to pay an extra contribution over and above any other member state?  Did they volunteer?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There were a number of aspects in the Italian situation.  My recollection is that under Lomé II, the Italians had undercontributed, as it were, <Col N="2448" /> in relation to what would be their normal EC key.  That slack was taken up by the Dutch.  Over the past five years the Italians in national terms have been very progressive in the development of their aid programme, as was shown in Geneva last Monday.  They were taking up a bit of slack in their own contribution and, in addition, giving a lead.  I should like to compliment them in every way on the lead they gave at the end of the negotiations and in Geneva last Monday.</P>

    <Speaker pid="NoraOwen" hpid="Mrs. Owen Mrs. Owen">

      <P>If Deputy Owen is referring to the announcement by the Italians in Geneva, the full effects of the announcement have not yet been teased out.  I can only say that, on face value, the announcement would appear to represent a very substantial increase in their support.  Further details will no doubt come to hand in due course.  I am quite prepared to take them at face value.  They provided the extra funding at the final stage of the negotiations on Lomé and made their announcement in Geneva in relation to famine in Africa.  My reaction is: more power to them.  I hope it will encourage others to follow in a similar vein.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I mentioned that, while we should recognise the unique advantages of Lomé, we must not overstate its importance. The enormity of the problem of the developing world is such that an effort such as Lomé will not make anything other than a minor contribution towards <Col N="2449" /> the resolution of those problems.  Coupled with those problems of underdevelopment we have the horrific consequences of drought and famine.  I sometimes wonder whether there is a full understanding in the developed world of the differences between the countries in Africa and elsewhere and in Europe and the Western world generally.</P>
    <P>We see figures which compare <i>per capita</i> income in different countries.  In Ethiopia the <i>per capita</i> income is £140 per annum and the comparative figure in Ireland is £5,000 per annum and in the US it is £10,000 per annum.  We do not think we are too badly off compared with the US.  We have half their <i>per capita</i> income and we have not got all the luxuries they have.  We are not doing too badly. We are the 25th richest country in the world.  We tend to forget that.</P>
    <P>If we take a country like Ethiopia where their <i>per capita</i> income is less than 1/25th of what we have, if we are good at figures we can decide what that means in living terms.  Perhaps one can paint a better picture if one looks at the situation on the ground there.  Many people have not been as privileged as I have been &mdash; and as I know Deputy O'Kennedy has been &mdash; to see the situation on the ground in these countries, the lack of roads, water supply, sewerage systems, infrastructure generally.  Normally we travelled on a dirt track, if they were lucky enough to have a dirt track.</P>
    <P>Perhaps a better picture might be drawn by illustrating the situation in agriculture. I was in Tanzania and Sudan over the last eight or nine days.  I might illustrate the situation by telling of a request made to me by one of the Tanzanian Ministers for help in the upgrading of their agriculture, an area which figures much in our development programmes. He wanted to know if we would get involved in assisting the development of the oxen plough in a particular part of his country.  What we might tend to forget is that the type of agriculture there he wants upgraded was done with a hoe, the same procedure and implement we had in the last century.  The next stage &mdash; which <Col N="2450" /> would effect a vast improvement if it can be implemented &mdash; is the introduction of the ox and plough.  One might then say: why not skip that intermediate technology and go to the tractor?  At first glance that might appear to be the obvious solution. But it must be remembered that one is talking of a place where there are very few tractors, even if there are no spare parts for them and, even if one had all of that, there is no fuel to run them and, if one had that, there are still no people with the expertise to drive and use them for proper cultivation.  Then one gets a full appreciation of the situation obtaining there.</P>
    <P>Probably that is a more illustrative picture of their problems.  Ireland in the last century was probably comparable to some of the situations we find in developing countries, particularly in Africa, where I have seen these problems myself. When we talk about Ireland in the last century we are reminded of another aspect, something that is so ingrained in us we shall never forget it, that was the Famine.  Even among our younger generation, when one refers to black'47, there is a continuing recollection in our culture and tradition of what happened because of the problems then obtaining of underdevelopment, coupled with a disaster that affected all agricultural production.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It was market domination that was the main cause of the Famine, not just the potato blight, but domination of the market by the British at that time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. J. O'Keeffe Mr. J. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the same parallel could be drawn today.  The point I am making is that, there we were, a subject people, with our agriculture in an underdeveloped state.  Because of a special circumstance, the blight on our staple diet, the potato crop, we suffered a famine of horrendous proportions at a time when we had a population of 8 million people and lost 1 million.  That was in the 1840s, coupled with the huge number of others who left our shores. People in whose background there is a famine of that dimension can perhaps <Col N="2451" /> more readily relate to similar situations in Africa, in Ethiopia, the Sudan and the other countries affected.  These countries, where hunger stalks the land, must raise questions in our minds as to why in the latter part of the twentieth century this situation should result in deaths of a proportion similar to that which occurred here.  What is the cause?  They have the problem of underdevelopment and now they have a huge drought which has affected their countries so seriously.  We must ask: why should drought result in so many deaths?  We had drought in Europe, in Ireland, last summer.  There were some complaints about water supplies not being as plentiful as normal but we did not have any hunger.  I might relate the type of underdevelopment, plus the blight we had on our potato crop in the last century, to the position now obtaining in these countries &mdash; underdevelopment plus drought, with a comparable result, hunger, famine and death.</P>
      <P>We must raise questions as to what has been the response of the western world to these situations.  One thing that was very clear to me when I visited Ethiopia on behalf of the European Community last November was that the response, both within the country and from the international community, was too late.  It was interesting to note the comparison with Kenya where there was a similar food deficit to that in Ethiopia.  Because of a variety of factors, including the fact that Kenya was somewhat better off than Ethiopia, but principally because the aid and support came in at an early stage, the extent of the devastation resulting from food shortage was quite minimal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having returned from the Sudan last week I want to give an early warning of the situation developing there.  Sudan is one of our four protegé countries in Africa.  They have opened their borders to refugees from a number of countries, including of late Ethiopia, so much so that they have over 1 million refugees in the country at present, rising daily.  They have shown, in international terms, a warm hearted generosity in opening their borders to people from surrounding <Col N="2452" /> countries.  In what appears to be a developing crisis there they should expect a similar warm hearted response from the international community.  Having opened their borders to refugees from other countries they find themselves now with a huge number of their nationals affected by hunger.  Present estimates of that number are put at over four million people many of whom left their own areas in the Sudan, have travelled to other areas they feel are more fertile or closer to towns and cities in an effort to find food.</P>
    <P>In national terms, again the Sudanese, because of a very generous tradition of theirs, have attempted to cope with that problem, that of &ldquo;own displaced persons,&rdquo; by supplying food and other requirements from their reserves.  On the evidence available to me last week it was clear that on their own they will be unable to cope with this problem.  Apart from the support given the Sudan for the refugees pouring into their country there is need for a major international effort to prevent, among their own people, the kind of catastrophe we witnessed in Ethiopia over the past six months.</P>
    <P>We must respond ourselves.  I have had discussions with some of our voluntary organisations.  I would hope that the public support for the efforts of those voluntary organisations, so evident during the Ethiopian appeals, will become evident again in relation to the efforts of the Sudanese, and indeed any other of the African famine countries in which they might work.  At official level we have arranged for the supply of 3,500 tonnes of wheat flour which we hope will be on its way to Port Sudan shortly.  We will be urging the international community, in particular the EC, to respond effectively and early to what appears to be a developing catastrophe there.</P>
    <P>The situation in the Community from the point of view of famine is that at the European Council in December the Taoiseach was able to get agreement between the Heads of State and Governments for a figure of 1.2 million tonnes for Africa.  At the same time, he wrote to the Heads of State in other <Col N="2453" /> countries of the developed world asking for matching contributions.  It is clear from the response of the US and other countries that there has been a response to that appeal.  I am not saying that the response from the US was solely because of the Taoiseach's intervention but it helped.  Having made that commitment at the end of 1984, there is a need for an even greater response from the Community and we will be working at EC level, not just for the implementation of the figure agreed at the Dublin Summit but to ensure, if possible, that that figure is increased.</P>
    <P>I must also refer to the difference between development and relief and the public support which is needed for both. The response of the Irish public to the appeal for Ethiopia was absolutely enormous and recognised now as being, <i>per capita,</i> the highest in the world.  However, the response we get from the public for relief should also be available for development because, essentially, relief is a firebrigade operation but development leads towards self-sufficiency which is so necessary to ensure that relief operations will not have to be continued in <i>saecula saeculorum.</i>  One of the major objectives of the Lomé Convention is the promotion of a more self-reliant and self-sustained development of the ACP states.  I wish there was a greater understanding and acceptance of the need for such development and support for it.  It is easy to relate to the harrowing pictures on television of people in the last stages of distress but it is not as easy to grasp the importance of helping those people to improve their agricultural industry, trade and all the other things which will enable them to become self-reliant.</P>
    <P>Mention has been made of the reasons why we should be involved in this activity. The basic reason for helping is humanitarian. At the same time, we are trying to encourage better political stability and, as has been mentioned by other speakers, there is an economic return because of our involvement in helping developing countries.  I am a firm believer in the concept of inter-dependence and we should not be involved in giving funds <Col N="2454" /> for what we can get out of it.  One Deputy referred to exploiting the situation and, of course, we should not exploit anyone. At the same time, we should bear in mind that there are possible returns to the economy because of our involvement in development activities and, while ensuring that aid is provision on purely developmental grounds, we should not be unaware of the possibilities of securing a return from contracts and so on.  There is a return in trade and if we look at the figures between this country and the ACP states, the balance of trade is in our favour.  There is a return in employment and, apart from people involved directly in development, here and abroad there are well over 1,000 whose employment is directly related to projects and programmes in the developing world.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is only a small reflection of the overwhelming favourable balance of trade between EC countries and developing countries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the exact balance of trade figures but I believe they justify the Deputy's contention. There have been improvements in recent years in which we can take pride but, like our reaction to the Lomé Convention, we cannot sit back and pat ourselves on the back.  Further improvements are necessary.  When I took over responsibility for development in 1981, the official figure was £18 million and this year it will be £38 million.  These figures show a substantial increase but we must continue to ensure that the level of increase is continued and, if possible, improved.</P>
      <P>It is very important to ensure that there is all party agreement for our efforts in the Third World.  I should like to encourage an all party commitment and support for development activities.  I have particular expectations of the work of the all party committee in that area in ensuring a united approach to the continuation and expansion of our development programme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The ACP countries have been asking <Col N="2455" /> for access to the Community's food surpluses on favourable terms for quite some time.  The position has improved to a certain extent and I hope it will be more than a nominal improvement.  Under Article 34, there will now be the possibility of longer term advance fixing of refunds on the export of those agricultural products available in the Community. Specific agreements may be made with the ACP countries who request them in the context of their overall food security requirements.  That is an advance and, in the years ahead, further advances will be necessary.</P>
    <P>When we look at our food surpluses we must do so in the context of the needs of developing countries.  We must also look at the wealth of the Community in the context of the hunger and deprivation in the Third World.  We must maintain pressure at all times to ensure that there will be greater support for the relief of hunger and suffering.  ACP countries are anxious to purchase some of our surpluses but cannot do so now because normally their requests are to purchase on the basis of payment in their own currencies which would not have a great marketability within the Community.  We must also attempt to find a system which will enable us to respond to a greater degree to their request to be allowed to purchase on favourable terms.  When they are willing to purchase, though only in their local currencies, we must be able to devise some system that will go as far as possible in meeting that request.  Lomé III represents an improvement and in the years ahead we must be seen to be making efforts to enable even further improvements to be made.</P>
    <P>I thank those who contributed to the debate and I trust that during the year there will be opportunities for more wide ranging discussions on the question of development generally.  I appreciate the support of the House for the motion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move: &ldquo;That the Bill be now read a Second Time.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Government have undertaken a major programme for reform in local government.  This Bill is the first in a series which will be introduced to give effect to these reforms.  It may be helpful to the House if, before dealing in more detail with the provisions of this Bill, I give some account of the overall programme of which it is part.</P>
      <P>The need for modernising and improving the local government system has been widely recognised for many years by various Governments.  A White Paper on the subject was published 13 years ago. There have been several statements and commitments since then.  Very little has however come of these approaches and the system continues to work on with various deficiencies diagonsed &mdash; deficiencies in organisation, in functions, in procedures and in financing.  The stage has now been reached where any further delay in tackling the whole question of local government reform would be indefensible.</P>
      <P>The whole situation has been reviewed and fresh consultations have been held with representative local government bodies.  In the light of these steps the Government have prepared their reform programme and intend to press ahead with it vigorously.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The local government system is there to serve the needs of society.  It is remarkable that there has been no major organisational change in the system in this century despite the fundamental changes in society itself and in the way in which society lives, thinks and works.  Yet these social changes have deep implications for the workings of the local government system and its relationship to the public it serves.  Major changes have resulted from the developmental process, including urbanisation and, notably, the massive expansion of the capital city into the surrounding countryside.  Within cities and major areas there are important issues of <Col N="2457" /> planning, renewal and development in which the local authorities have a major and a critical part to play; indeed they are shaping, for better or for worse, the urban environment of the future.  The growth of traffic, of recreation and of tourism, are other major areas of change making demands on the local government system.</P>
    <P>The functions of the system have been extended in various ways to meet some of these needs.  This applies particularly to planning, housing, roads and environmental control but organisational change has not kept pace.</P>
    <P>In the large urban complexes, and in Dublin in particular, there is a special need for the co-ordination of planning and development, and for co-operation in providing services.  In many places town populations have outgrown their boundaries to a serious extent.  Despite the changes that have taken place in local authority functions, there is the feeling that local Government is somehow removed from the real needs and current preoccupations of the people who elect local councils.  This can be seen as part of the reason for the system not commanding the position it should command as part of the democratic system of government. The growth of voluntary associations throughout the country with a variety of objectives is in itself to be welcomed.  But the fact that these groups are found to be so widely necessary and that they exist in most cases without links with the local government system and, indeed, in many cases are in some antipathy with that system, is a signal which we must take account of.  It indicates the need to make local government more relevant and more accessible to people, and more responsive to their needs.  This calls for changes of organisation, of functions and of attitudes.</P>
    <P>Another major aim must be to make local government as efficient as possible. There are very practical reasons for this in that local authorities between capital and current spending are now responsible for some £1,400 million of expenditure each year.  This is a significant element in the total public financing requirement.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2458" /> Local authorities are also among the principal agencies providing employment throughout the country &mdash; often in areas where little other employment may be available.  These factors &mdash; the level of spending and of employment &mdash; taken with the key importance of local authority infrastructure mean that the system is playing a major role in the economy of the country.  The system must be seen to be operating efficiently and providing a good return in terms of value for money. The Government are intent on making any change which may be necessary to achieve this aim.</P>
    <P>A programme of reform has been developed which will be implemented in stages and which is intended to revitalise the local government system, to attune it to the needs of today so that we have a system capable of meeting the challenges, difficulties and opportunities of the late 20th century.</P>
    <P>Briefly the reform programme will cover the following:</P>
    <P>First: The initial phase of fundamental reorganisation of local government in Dublin plus electoral reform throughout the country.  These and certain other matters are covered in the Bill now before the House.</P>
    <P>Secondly: The completion of the reorganisation in Dublin, including the transfer of functions to new councils and the setting up of a metropolitan council as a co-ordinating body, will be the subject of a further Bill.</P>
    <P>Thirdly: Additional legislation is in preparation to effect reforms and improvements in the organisation and procedures of local authorities.  This will cover such matters as the adjustment of urban boundaries, the setting up of new town councils, extended functions for local authorities in certain social and economic spheres, improved co-ordination and agency arrangements between authorities, a better provision for local authority recognition and support of certain local bodies and a variety of adjustments in relation to procedures, by-law making and so on.</P>
    <P>Fourthly: An examination is being conducted urgently of a means of effecting a <Col N="2459" /> substantive devolution of functions from the centre to the local authorities so that any necessary statutory provisions may be included in the legislative programme I have outlined.  Changes in this area will have to be effected soon so as to avoid duplication or confusion of roles.  Where complete devolution is not feasible, agency arrangements between central bodies and local authorities may be possible.</P>
    <P>Certain important functions of my own Department are being included in this review, but the Government are looking at a wide range of public services in search of devolution possibilities.</P>
    <P>People should be able to look to their local authorities more than at present for information, advice and assistance in areas of economic and social interest.  In many cases these are areas in which local authorities have little or no say at the moment.  Also, local authorities should have the right of making their voices heard when decisions affecting their areas are being made by various bodies at national and regional level and with this in mind the Government are intent on developing a more complete system of local self-government.</P>
    <P>Fifthly: No amount of change in organisation or functions will bear fruit unless there is an adequate finance system. There are two points to be made about this.  The Government have recognised the need for change following the removal of domestic rates and the collapse of the agricultural valuation system and have made provision for a land tax from which the proceeds will accrue to local authorities.  Other approaches to see how local revenues might be supplemented and how local authorities might be made more financially self-sufficient are under examination.  Studies in this area have been undertaken by the National Economic and Social Council and by the Commission on Taxation and I am hopeful that we will get useful advice and suggestions from these sources.</P>
    <P>The other point is that local authorities cannot expect to escape the severe financial constraints which apply in the public <Col N="2460" /> sector generally at present.  This means that there are severe limits to the additional resources that can be made available to local authorities in the short term. This harsh reality of the moment does not remove the need to search for a better financing system on the lines I have described.  It would, of course, be the aim that there should be a suitable financial adjustment in respect of any new functions that might be developed on local authorities in consequence of the initiatives to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>Finally the reform programme will include an examination of the regional level of Government, including the role of the regional development organisations, and the relationship between the various bodies existing at this intermediate level outside the representative system.  In the meantime the regional development organisation will continue to serve local authorities and other interests as they are doing at present.</P>
    <P>The Bill then is not, and could not be, a comprehensive measure covering all aspects of local government reform.  It is a first stage.  It deals essentially with matters which are necessary or desirable to have in place before the local elections in June.  The other changes to which I have referred will be the subject of an ongoing programme of local government reform and in due course the necessary legislation to give effect to various aspects of this programme will come before this House.</P>
    <P>The matters covered by the present Bill are: the adjustment of Dublin city boundary involving some areas being added to the city and some to the county; the setting up, for electoral purposes, of three new counties covering the territory of the existing Dublin County Council and of Dún Laoghaire Corporation, and to which elections will be held in June; and powers designed to enable effect to be given to the recommendations of the two electoral commissions recently published.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes provision also for the extension of the Galway City boundary and for upgrading of that city to the status of county borough.  The Bill includes <Col N="2461" /> some other particular provisions which I will come to.  Much of the volume of the Bill is taken up with the definition in legal terminology of the new boundaries in Dublin and with matters consequential on the adjustment of the Dublin city and county boundaries.</P>
    <P>In deciding on the reorganisation of local government in Dublin, the Government had a number of different options to consider and evaluate in the light of the work which has been going on in this matter intermittently for some years. One of the options would involve the replacement of the existing three councils - the city council, the county council and the Dún Laoghaire Borough Council &mdash;by one overall council, a sort of greater Dublin council.  This overall council would have responsibility for services over the whole of the metropolitan area and might have committees at local level. The option has certain attractions in that it would facilitate co-ordination in planning and development and in the provision of services.  It would also command resources on a scale which would favour adequate expertise being provided and economies of scale being achieved.  In the Government's view, however, a single council with responsibility for the whole of the Dublin area would be too large and unwieldy a body and too far removed from the people it served.  Neither would it be well suited to the evolution of the system along the lines I outlined earlier &mdash; namely, towards being more closely responsive to the needs of the people who are represented by it.  An overall council on the scale implied could also create imbalance in relation to local government units in urban and rural areas elsewhere.</P>
    <P>Another option would involve the setting up of a number of borough councils covering the whole of the city and county, each with responsibility for the normal local government functions in an area of some 100,000 people or so.  This was not favoured because of the fragmentation which would be involved and the additional problems of co-ordination which would arise.  It would also be a more expensive system.  There would be need also to provide under this option for a <Col N="2462" /> directly elected metropolitan council, with its own expensive administration with powers overlapping those of the mainline authorities.</P>
    <P>Another possibility examined was that the city area might be reduced so as to correspond more closely to the concept of an inner city authority, with a number of county or borough councils covering the rest of the metropolitan area.  Again, there would have been serious problems of demarcation and co-ordination.  Hundreds of thousands of people who associate themselves closely with the city would have found themselves excluded from that area and attached to new units of local government in the county.  The Government decided against this option as well.</P>
    <P>The Government decision, as announced, is that there should be four mainline local authorities in Dublin comprising the existing Dublin Corporation, subject to boundary adjustments, and three new county councils covering the rest of the metropolitan area and replacing, after a transitional phase, the existing Dublin County Council and the existing Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  Provision will also be made for a metropolitan council to be nominated by the four mainline authorities to consider matters of overall interest and to act as a co-ordinating influence in relation to services and programmes that will require to be approached on a metropolitan basis.</P>
    <P>The Bill sets out the changes proposed in the city county boundary and the boundaries for the new county areas.  The changes proposed in the boundary between Dublin city and county will be made definitively under powers proposed in the Bill before the local elections are held.  This means that by then the corporation will be responsible for the areas being taken into the city, and the county council for the areas being excluded.  The three new county areas, on the other hand, are being established at this juncture for electoral purposes only.  The replacement of Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council by three new county councils is a fundamental change involving complex matters to <Col N="2463" /> be settled in regard to transfer of functions, property, resources, staff and so on.  All of these will take time to work out &mdash; consultations with the local authorities have already begun &mdash; and will require further legislation to bring into effect.  In the meantime, the three new county councils will be elected in June. There will be no direct elections then to the existing Dublin County Council or to Dún Laoghaire Corporation and those bodies will carry on with the members elected for the three councils serving on them until the transfer to the three new county councils is effected.  These members will then assume operational responsibilities in the three new counties and the existing county council and borough corporation will be phased out.</P>
    <P>The changes in the city-county boundary will mean, between the gains and the losses, a net addition of some 18,000 in the city population.  The changes, however, are not designed to increase or diminish the city but to rationalise the existing boundaries and to iron out some inconsistencies that have developed since the last boundary change took place in 1953.  I will consider these changes in more detail later.</P>
    <P>The boundaries for the three new county areas have been fixed by reference to major geographical features, namely the Liffey and the watershed which divides South Dublin naturally into east and west sectors.  The Dublin North County will be known as Dublin-Fingal and will comprise the territory north of the adjusted boundary and of the River Liffey, except for the small part of Lucan which lies north of the river and which will be included with the rest of that centre for administrative purposes.</P>
    <P>The two counties south of the adjusted city boundary and of the line of the Liffey will be divided by a line which will proceed from the Dodder, and the city boundary, at Woodside Drive, by the boundaries of the Castle Golf Club and of Marley Park, to Rockbrook and then by the Pine Forest Road to Glendoo Mountain and the junction with the <Col N="2464" /> Wicklow county boundary.  This line follows townland boundaries or other natural or physical features which facilitate the north/south direction of the division.  The county to the east of this line will be known as Dún Laoghaire/Rathdown and to the west Dublin-Belgard.  Dublin-Fingal will have 24 members: Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will have 28 and Dublin-Belgard will have 26.  This gives a total of 78 members in place of the combined membership of 51 at present in Dublin County Council and in Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  This increase, I might mention, is fully justified by reference to the level of representation available in other counties.</P>
    <P>The Bill also enables effect to be given to the recommendations of the Dublin Electoral Area Boundaries Commission in the city area and in the new county areas, subject to two minor adjustments in the proposed city boundary at the Santry by-pass extension and at Cherry Orchard.  These adjustments are designed to provide a more logical line of division between city and county at these points and do not materially affect the recommendations of the commission in regard to electoral area divisions.</P>
    <P>In accordance with their terms of reference, the commission have also made recommendations on this division of Dublin city into six districts and of each of the new county areas into two districts. These units are envisaged as a basis for future devolution and/or local representation within the reorganised system. This role of the new districts will be taken up in the further legislation which I have already referred to.</P>
    <P>The Government have also decided, as announced, to implement the recommendations of the County and County Borough Electoral Area Boundaries Commission in regard to changes in electoral areas in counties and in county boroughs outside Dublin.  A number of the provisions in the Bill are designed to enable this to be done.  The commission were asked to recommend changes which would bring about a more consistent relationship between population and membership within the various areas.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2465" /> There will be an overall increase of 13 in the membership of seven county councils.</P>
    <P>The Government have decided that Galway should be made a county borough, equal in status to Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford.  This is in recognition of the distinctive history of the city, as celebrated in the quincentennial year. The decision is also justified by the size of the city and by its major importance as a social and economic centre in the west of the country.  This means that Galway city will become a separate administrative county.  Again, there are considerable complexities as regards the future relationship between the city and the county and it will take some future time to sort out these matters.  In the meantime the way will be prepared in that the city population will vote as a separate entity in the June elections without linkage with Galway County Council membership.</P>
    <P>The way will be further prepared for the enhancement of the status of Galway by giving effect to the recommendation of the commission that the city boundary should be extended to take in a number of surrounding townlands.  The membership of the Galway Borough Council will be increased from 12 to 15.  I would like to avail of this opportunity to commend both Galway Borough Council and Galway County Council on reaching agreement about the adjustment in the city boundary and, in particular, the very positive approach of the latter body. There was no corresponding agreement in regard to the adjustment of the boundaries of Cork city or of Limerick city and accordingly the commission were not in a position to recommend adjustments in those cases.  I will be bringing in an amendment on Committee Stage to delete the reference to Cork and Limerick from section 19.  The question of those adjustments will now fall to be taken up as part of the general review of urban boundaries, which I have already referred to, and for which a boundary commission will be set up at a later stage.</P>
    <P>While speaking of the commissions, I would like to avail of this opportunity to <Col N="2466" /> thank both bodies &mdash; the chairmen, Judge Murphy and Judge Carroll, the members and the staff concerned &mdash; all of whom I know worked hard to complete the assignments in the short time allowed. Inevitably in assignments of this kind the recommendations will not find universal approval on all points.  However, the commissions have met their assignments effectively and impartially and within the time allowed, and I am glad to acknowledge this and to record my appreciation.</P>
    <P>I will now outline in more detail the specific provisions included in the Bill. Part I of the Bill contains standard provisions relating to title, definitions and orders.</P>
    <P>Part II relates to the upgrading of Galway to county borough status.  Section 5 provides that on a day to be appointed by the Minister the borough of Galway will cease to be part of the county and will become an administrative county of itself called the County Borough of Galway.  As I mentioned earlier some time will be required to allow for the necessary arrangements to be made between city and county to ensure a smooth transition, without disruption of services.  Consultations between my Department and both authorities are under way.</P>
    <P>Section 5 (4) provides that the borough electorate will not be entitled to vote at the June elections to Galway County Council.  This is because Galway Borough is to become a county borough.  Section 6 provides for an increase of three to 15 in the membership of the borough council and that number will be elected at the June elections.  When the borough becomes a county borough the title of the council will change to the city council.</P>
    <P>The effect of section 7 is to apply the management system to the county borough. By virtue of subsection (5) there will be a single manager for city and county.  This arrangement may however be terminated by agreement of the councils of both city and county; it may not however be terminated while the present manager continues to hold office.  It is important that joint management should apply for the initial stages to ensure that <Col N="2467" /> the separation of city and county is dealt with in a co-ordinated manner and that any practical difficulties arising can be readily sorted out.</P>
    <P>Section 8 enables any further necessary provisions to give effect to the establishment of the county borough to be made by order.  By virtue of section 3 such an order would require the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I would next like to refer again to the report of the County and County Borough Electroal Area Boundaries Commission in relation to Galway.  The commission have recommended that the boundary of the borough should be extended and the proposed extension has been agreed by both the borough council and the county council; an additional 5,000 persons will be added to the borough.</P>
    <P>Sections 19 and 20 in Part IV deal with boundary alterations and provide a legislative basis to implement the commission's recommendations in regard to Galway.  As soon as possible after the enactment of this Bill, I would propose to make an order under section 19 extending the boundary of the borough so that the boundary alteration will have effect for the purpose of the June elections.  The commission also recommended that adequate provision should be made for the payment of compensation to the county council in respect of the boundary alteration.  Section 19 enables provision to be made for the payment of compensation and the order to be made under that section will include appropriate arrangements in this regard.</P>
    <P>The next Part of the Bill &mdash; Part III &mdash; provides for changes in the Dublin area. As I have already stated, these changes represent a first step and further legislation will be required.  It will simplify matters if I deal first with the city.</P>
    <P>The purpose of section 10 is to effect the alteration of the boundary between Dublin city and county for all purposes. Detailed descriptions of the altered areas are set out in the First Schedule to the Bill.  A map showing these areas has been prepared and a copy has been placed in <Col N="2468" /> the Oireachtas Library.  The major areas being transferred from the county to the city are the areas which constitute the northern environs of the city, including Donaghmede, Darndale, Coolock, Santry and Ballymun, the Ashtown area and an area between Clondalkin Industrial Estate and Cherry Orchard Park. The other areas are an area adjacent to Cappagh Avenue and the Northway Estate and parts of Crumlin/ Walkinstown and the Beech Hill area north of Belfield.  The major areas being transferred from the city to the county are the areas comprising Baldoyle, Bayside, Sutton, Howth and an area at Rathfarnham.  Also to be included in the county are parts of Kimmage, Templeogue, Belfield and a small area south of Elm Park Golf Course.  The Second Schedule to the Bill contains consequential provisions which will apply as a result of the alteration of the boundary between Dublin city and county.  They generally follow the lines of similar provisions made in the past in relation to boundary alterations and include, in particular, provision for the phasing-in over a five-year period, of the liability of ratepayers in the areas excluded from the city.</P>
    <P>Section 11 provides for an increase of seven to 52 in the membership of Dublin City Council.  These members will be elected for the altered city area and on the basis of the electoral areas recommended for the city by the Dublin Electoral Area Boundaries Commission.</P>
    <P>I turn next to the provisions relating to County Dublin.  As I mentioned previously, the Government have decided that County Dublin, including the area comprised in the Borough of Dún Laoghaire, should be divided into three counties with a county council for each of the three areas.  However, it would not be possible to have three new county councils fully operative immediately following the June elections.  This would necessitate the abolition of the existing county council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Corporation; their replacement by the three new county councils; various <Col N="2469" /> complex property and financial adjustments; staff transfers; revised arrangements for the operation of various services and other arrangements to deal with the many other matters arising. Clearly it would be impossible for this comprehensive programme of activity to be completed before June.</P>
    <P>However, rather than defer reorganisation in the Dublin area, the Government decided to press ahead and establish the new county areas of Dublin-Fingal, Dublin-Belgard and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown for the purposes of the June elections.  For these purposes they will be known as electoral counties.  It is important that the public should begin to identify with these counties and for that reason elections are being held in June to councils for each of the electoral counties. Section 12 provides for the establishment of the three electoral counties and the Third Schedule details the boundaries of the counties.  Section 13 provides for the establishment and election of a council for each of the electoral counties and specifies the membership.  The alternative to this approach would have been to hold elections to the existing county council and Dún Laoghaire Borough Council and then abolish them and hold further elections to the new authorities when definitive legislation dealing with all aspects of local government reorganisation in the Dublin area has been prepared. This would yet again long finger the need for change and could, indeed, result in no change at the end of the day.</P>
    <P>As I have said, section 13 provides that councils will be elected for each of the electoral counties.  Section 16 provides that all of the elected members &mdash; 78 in total &mdash; for the three electoral counties will serve on and act as the existing Dublin County Council.  While this may be somewhat unusual, the alternative was, as I have said, to defer reorganisation again.  Also the arrangement will facilitate an orderly transition from the existing to the new bodies.</P>
    <P>In regard to Dún Laoghaire, section 16 provides for similar arrangements to apply.  In this case I will make an order specifying those electoral areas which <Col N="2470" /> correspond as nearly as possible to the existing borough and the persons elected for those areas will, in addition to serving on the county council, also serve on and act as the borough council pending its replacement.</P>
    <P>I will be introducing further legislation to invest the three councils elected in June with all the powers of county councils and to provide for the transfer of assets, liabilities, staff, and so on from the existing authorities to the three new county councils.  For the interim period, Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation will continue in being and will continue to perform their existing functions.  Section 29 provides for the continuation of the county council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.</P>
    <P>I apologise to Deputies, incidentally, for the fact that on page 5 of the Explanatory Memorandum section 28 should read section 29 and section 29 should read section 28.</P>
    <P>I would like to stress that the June elections to the councils for the three electoral counties will be on the basis of the electoral areas recommended by the Dublin Electoral Area Boundaries Commission. Section 14 provides the necessary statutory power to divide the electoral counties into county electoral areas.  Section 15 contains provisions relating to the register of electors, returning officer and costs of the elections to the three councils.</P>
    <P>Section 17 is a standard provision providing for the preparation of official maps of the electoral counties.  The boundaries of the electoral counties are described in the Third Schedule.</P>
    <P>Section 18 contains supplemental provisions in regard to the alteration of the city/county boundary effected by section 10 and would enable the Minister by regulations to continue in force in those areas any enactments, regulations, rules, bylaws and other instruments which had effect in those areas prior to the alteration of the boundaries.  The section would provide a convenient means of continuing, on a temporary or longterm basis, the application of statutory requirements in the areas affected by the boundary <Col N="2471" /> alteration where this is considered necessary &mdash; for example, regulations under the Road Traffic Acts in relation to speed limits.</P>
    <P>In dealing with Part II of the Bill, which relates to Galway, I have already referred to section 19 which will enable the boundary of the borough to be extended prior to the June elections.  Section 19 is a consequential provision which requires the Minister, prior to the elections, to make any consequential adjustments to electoral areas arising from the boundary extension.  These will be made on the basis of the recommendations of the County and County Borough Electoral Area Boundaries Commission.</P>
    <P>Section 21 enables the Minister to alter on a once-off basis, prior to the June elections, the number of members of a county council, of a county borough other than Dublin and of Galway Borough Council.  This was to enable any recommendations of the commission in regard to membership to be implemented.  In the event the commission have recommended alterations in the number of members in the case of eight county councils and this section will enable these recommendations to be implemented.</P>
    <P>Sections 22 and 23 are provisions which will enable any necessary adjustments to be made to the register of electors and to polling districts arising from the revision of electoral areas recommended by the commission.</P>
    <P>Section 24 will enable the Minister to make by order, which by virtue of section 3 must be approved by both Houses, any further provisions necessary to enable this Act to have full effect.</P>
    <P>Section 25 enables the Minister to alter the quorum of a local authority to take account of any alteration in the number of members of the authority.  Section 26 is a technical provision designed to ensure that the number of members of the Dublin Committee of Agriculture will remain as it is at the moment: 32 members. By law the number of members of a committee is four times the number of county electoral areas.</P>
    <P>Most Deputies will be aware of the <Col N="2472" /> procedures which currently apply to the appointments by local authorities to health boards.  The effect of section 27 and the Fourth Schedule is to apply these procedures to appointments by local authorities to the bodies mentioned in that section.</P>
    <P>Section 28 will extend the boundary of County Cork to include the Whiddy Island oil terminal, as recommended by the Costelloe tribunal of inquiry.  It will also enable the Minister to alter the maritime boundaries of any county or county borough.  I have already dealt with section 29 in the context of the changes affecting County Dublin.  Deputies will appreciate that many of the provisions of the Bill are of a complex nature and they can be gone into more fully on Committee Stage.  I look forward therefore to the debate on this Bill and to hearing the views in relation to the provisions of the Bill of the many Members of this House who have served as members of local authorities.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that the central provisions of the Bill relate to measures which will need to be in place for the local elections, notably the adjustment of the Dublin and Galway boundaries, the setting up of three new counties in Dublin, and changes in electoral areas and in council membership elsewhere. These changes will have to be incorporated in the 1985 registers of electors and in polling schemes under powers being provided in the Bill.  Reasonable time must be allowed for the necessary adjustments to be made at local level if the arrangements for the local elections are to proceed smoothly.  To fit in with this time-scale it will be necessary that the Bill be enacted before Easter.  I now announce for the information of the House that the local elections will take place on Thursday, 20 June 1985.</P>
    <P>This is an important Bill and I have no wish to inhibit discussion, but I think it necessary to mention that there is this time factor to be kept in mind.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has taken until the last line of the Minister's speech to finally extract the date of the local elections.  It <Col N="2473" /> has been very unfair to the Government and the whole system of local democracy to have dallied so long in making this important decision.  With less than three months to June, the Government have shown themselves very indecisive in this matter.  It was time for them to dispel the continued doubts as to whether they were considering a further postponement.  One can only come to the conclusion that they were entertaining such thoughts when they decided to leave the fixing of the date of the local elections to such a late stage.</P>
      <P>We welcome the announcement and are anxious that everything possible be done to facilitate the holding of these elections.  We recognise that the matters contained in this Bill will, of necessity, have had to be passed into law by the Houses of the Oireachtas well in advance of the date now announced, in order to enable these elections to take place.  It is very remiss of the Minister and his Government to have delayed so long in this matter.  Many of the orders to be made under this Bill cannot come into force until the Bill is passed, with seven weeks' sitting of the Dáil before the election date arrives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill before the House cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered as implementing major reforms of the local government system.  It deals solely with electoral matters and makes no reference to the functions carried out by local authorities or the method of financing them in the future and omits reference to the need for restructuring the operation of second tier local government, which contradicts the claims that this Bill has something to do with making the system more responsive to the needs of local communities.  It is hard to believe that this Bill contains the results of the Government studies of the local government system over a period of two years. Speech after speech from successive Coalition Ministers of the Environment promised us major reforms in the system, aimed at strengthening and expanding the role of local government.  The Minister for Energy when Minister for the <Col N="2474" /> Environment, the then Minister of State, Deputy Quinn, and the present Minister, Deputy Kavanagh and his Minister of State, Deputy F. O'Brien all laid great emphasis on the extensive reviews being undertaken in the Department, which would result in legislation being enacted to establish the radically reformed system in time for elections to be held under the new system.  Even the 1984 elections were postponed to enable this wonderfully reformed system to brought in before the elections in June 1985.  Those people genuinely interested in seeing the system radically overhauled are bitterly disappointed with this Bill.  It contains none of the promised reforms in functions and financing and ignores the needs of all urban dwellers outside the county borough areas of Dublin and Galway.</P>
    <P>It now transpires that the Government ignored the areas really in need of reform and concentrated their energies on seeing how best they could adjust the local government system to their own advantage. The much vaunted proposals for reform turn out to be a cynical exercise in electoral area alterations to suit Fine Gael and Labour candidates.  In all the submissions which have been made, all the seminars which have been held and articles which have been written about how our local government system should be reformed to make it more meaningful, more responsive to local needs, few, if any, suggestions were made about the need to alter electoral boundaries.  Yet this is what is happening.  This is what we are being offered as worth while reform. About the only good thing that can be said about the Bill is that at least it is a start and I suppose we should be glad of that from a legislatively lazy Government.</P>
    <P>It is clear that the only purposes of the Bill are to give legislative effect to the new boundaries decided on by the Government for the four new county authorities in Dublin and to determine the number of members to be elected to these authorities and all the other county councils and county boroughs.  The Bill gives the Minister the power to make orders changing the boundaries of local <Col N="2475" /> authorities and electoral areas and to decide the number of members to be elected in each of the local authorities.</P>
    <P>This Bill is principally an enabling one and does not propose the alterations in electoral areas recommended by the boundary commissions.  Local government reform, we maintain, requires fundamental changes in the present role of local authorities and requires far-reaching proposals in regard to the functions which they perform, in the method of financing to give them financial independence and security and also a need for reform of the structures in a two tier system.</P>
    <P>I am referring to the need for adequate second tier structures to be provided for all the towns which have been developing over the past 30 years.  No reference whatsoever was made to the reforming of structures in that area.  The Government have dealt with this whole question of local government reform in a very cavalier fashion.  The system of local government has been suffering at the hands of this Coalition Government for the past two and a half years.  They have seriously undermined the financing of local authorities and have left them in a position where they are struggling under serious handicap to try to maintain the level of services which they were able to provide so readily a few short years ago.  Many of them have had to undergo massive redundancies of their permanent staff and their level of services has suffered very severely.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>In justifying my claim that the Government have been dealing with the local government system in a very cavalier fashion, I must also point to the postponement of the local elections last year.  Now it seems that they were postponed for no good reason.  Up to this time the Government have continued to withhold information about whether a further postponement was intended. Now they propose changing all the electoral areas just three months before the <Col N="2476" /> election date, without consultation and without time for proper representations to have been made, studied and considered.</P>
      <P>Despite the boundary commissions' work, we will still end up with inequality of representation throughout the country, with boundary extensions still being required for Cork and Limerick and Galway County Council and borough council still in the dark on how compensation is going to be paid.  We will end up with Gaeltacht areas being denied any special recognition in our local government system and remaining divided by electoral area boundaries.  We will remain with a situation in which councillors who have given loyal service to their communities over the years will find themselves cut off electorally from those communities with only a few weeks left before election date.  That is the greatest disservice that the Minister, and the Government, have done to local democracy and to councillors who have given voluntarily of their time, energy, knowledge and experience over the years working with their local communities and helping to make local government effective and efficient under terrible constraints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of those councillors, because of the dilatoriness of the Minister, now find that their entire electoral area is to be changed with only a few weeks left to election date.  That is a disgrace.  It was a dreadful way for the Minister to treat those councillors.  In December 1983 the Minister postponed the local elections with a promise to reform.  I put it to the Minister that it would have been just as easy for him in January 1984 to have published the terms of reference and appoint the boundary commissions as it was to do so in January 1985.  I suggest that there was no good reason why the Minister wasted one year.  There was no reason why he should deny councillors the opportunity to take into consideration the changes to be made one year ahead of the change.  Some councillors have discovered that the changes being made will affect them in a dramatic way <Col N="2477" /> and they have but a few weeks to consider what action they should take.</P>
    <P>I am aware that some councillors have found that 90 per cent of their electoral area has been taken away from them, based on the areas where they live.  One cannot deny that results of that type will come out of any electoral boundary area revisions but it was unfair to have left it so late and not to give any opportunity to the councillors so affected to acquaint themselves with the needs and problems of the new areas where they will be asking a different community to support them.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy suggesting that 90 per cent has been taken away? Only 10 per cent has been taken away at most.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall give the Minister an example.  The town of Oughterard was in the electoral area of Galway.  That town which has a big population and some of the rural areas that surround it which have a low population have been changed to another electoral area.  When one looks at the new electoral area one finds that one must travel almost 20 miles before one comes up against any heavily populated area.  There is nothing but bog, lakes and mountains for a distance of 15 or 20 miles from Oughterard back towards the coast where the community live.  A councillor living in Oughterard who had worked from there through the Galway electoral area now finds that because of the switch he has to turn his face to where he had his back to try to work up support in four or five weeks. That is only one instance of how areas have been changed.  I am sure the Minister has been made aware by Members of the effect of some of the changes.  Some of the changes were ridiculous.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am not saying that there would not have been anomalies for some individuals because it would not have been possible or right to design electoral areas to suit individuals.  The only complaint I have is that by delaying so long the Minister has acted very unfairly to some councillors and has shown very little respect for the <Col N="2478" /> work they are doing.  The Minister has very little interest in them and has dealt with them in a cavalier fashion.</P>
    <P>If there was any real concern for local democracy or a true appreciation of the role local governments should play in developing the country, community leaders would be loud in condemning the Government for their delay in introducing reforms.  The Government have got every encouragement from this side of the House to get on with this work. Our co-operation is assured in the whole area of local government reform.  We will not delay the passage of the Bill but we are urging the Minister to come forward with proposals for real reform.  The Minister is aware that we have published our thoughts on this matter.  We have shown that we are prepared to follow the path of radical change and reform in the local democratic system.  There is no political reason for the Minister to hesitate in stepping out into that area.  We have shown the way forward by publishing our proposals.  We have stated that it is our intention to make major reforms when we return to office and we have indicated the direction that reform should go. There is no excuse for the Government being dilatory in proceeding with this work.  I have assured the Minister before that any proposals would get a ready response from us and I repeat that assurance.</P>
    <P>We have a full commitment to developing the local government system and we will co-operate with the Minister, if he requires our co-operation, in helping to bring forward reforms.  However, our pleas and urgings have fallen on deaf ears so far.  What we have seen is a pathetic attempt, an excuse, to show that a step has been taken along the road.  A lot of time has been wasted and that indicates a lack of interest on the part of the Government in this area.</P>
    <P>The whole bone of contention in support of our argument that the Minister has been dilatory is easily confirmed when one looks at the date the electoral area boundary commissions were <Col N="2479" /> to make their report.  Their work, therefore, was of necessity very rushed and did not allow for adequate consultation with local auathorities about the most suitable changes.  Consequently, many of the agreed submissions made by local authorities have been ignored.  In most cases no consultation took place with local authorities.  If the Minister doubts that I shall for the sake of the record, outline what the commission stated.  For instance, in the case of Limerick the commission complained that they were unable to recommend a specific boundary change as the time available to them was too short.  Under the heading, City Boundaries, <i>Limerick</i>, the County and County Borough Electoral Area Boundaries Commission Report states:</P>
    <P>Because of the clear disagreement between Limerick County Council and Limerick Corporation the commission was unable in the time available to recommend a specific boundary change but recommends that a thorough-going review of all options for the area be put in hands as early as possible to provide the necessary basis for a decision. </P>
    <P>The commission recognised that there is a need for boundary changes in regard to Limerick city but complain that they were given inadequate machinery with which to carry out their task of making recommendations in that area because of the time factors imposed on them by the Government.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy should read that again and he will then see the reasons for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>The strange thing about the lack of time is that one of the members of the commission was a civil servant in the Minister's Department.  In effect, he was complaining about his Minister and the work done in his Department, that they had not advanced their work earlier and made greater progress.  That is an indication of shoddy work and a lack <Col N="2480" /> of commitment.  Lack of commitment clearly emerges from the whole thing.  However, we will continue to crack the whip over the Minister and urge him to get on with the job of reform.  We will continue to criticise the Minister until we can see positive proposals coming forward for the Bill.</P>
      <P>Changing and fiddling around with electoral areas is too closely associated with possible electoral advantage to one side or the other and by any stretch of the imagination it cannot be deemed to be a contribution of any kind to major necessary reforms.  The commission reported that they could not receive oral submissions in regard to electoral areas changes due to the time constraint.  At page eight they state:</P>
      <P>The Commission received and considered a total of 97 written submissions, the majority of them relating to the review of electoral areas.  Because of the time constraint, the Commission was unable to receive oral submissions on this aspect of its work. </P>
      <P>At page nine they complain:</P>
      <P>Because of the short period of time allowed to the Commission by its terms of reference to complete its work, it concluded that sufficient time would not be available to receive oral submissions except from the local authorities concerned in relation to the extension of city boundaries. </P>
      <P>At page 11 they state their regret once more about the time constraint.</P>
      <P>The commission have had to claim that they could not fulfil the tasks given to them because they were not appointed on time or given sufficient time in which to carry out the work.  Therefore, we have a rushed report which ignores many of the areas urgently in need of change. They had to come forward with these recommendations without the advantage of consultations with the people who were making submissions, such as interested citizens.  It seems an extraordinary situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In bringing forward a report of this kind the commission showed evidence <Col N="2481" /> appointed, mid-January, and that they were only given until the end of February that the esteemed personages who comprised the commission, headed by a judge, had not time adequately to consider fully all of the matters put before them.  Because the commission did not have time, they must have been to some extent influenced by the information put before them by the officials of the Department who have as their political head the Labour Minister for the Environment.  We are entitled to come to the conclusion that the work contained in this document is more a reflection of the thoughts of the political head, and the civil servants responding to them, rather than the thoughts of people who should have assisted the commission.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Mr. Kavanagh Mr. Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kavanagh</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is entirely wrong to assume that.  It is an unfair assumption.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have experience of revision of electoral areas and the information required and I am satisfied that many of the thoughts we read in this report are similar to those prepared by the Civil Service before the commission ever began their work.</P>
      <P>The commission felt inhibited by their terms of reference.  Many local authorities made agreed submissions but these submissions were ignored.  For instance, the local authorities in Dublin had a submission which would have been agreed by the various political parties participating in the council meetings.  That would have been very valuable because the submissions would have been agreed across the board, and it is not often one would get that in matters as sensitive as this where electoral reputations and careers might be at stake.  Any such agreements should have been accepted and should have formed a major part of the recommendations to the Minister.</P>
      <P>Again, at page 11, the commission refer to a submission sent in by County Wexford.  I will read it:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In submissions relating to County <Col N="2482" /> Wexford, the Commission was urged to recommend an increase in the total membership of the county council.  It was indicated that the county, with a population of 99,081, has a council membership of 21, which is among the lowest in the country, and an average of 4,718 persons per councillor, one of the highest in the country.  It was suggested that the Commission should recommend an additional councillor for each of the four electoral areas in the county without any alteration in boundaries.  The Commission noted that the councillor-population ratio in each of the electoral areas in the county is already within satisfactory limits. Within its terms of reference, the Commission could recommend boundary changes and/or propose an increase in membership only for the purpose of bringing about equality of representation within a local authority.  It considered that, as equality of representation already existed in the case of Wexford, it was precluded from recommending an increase in membership for that county. </P>
    <P>A real need was identified, there was an across the political divide response, a submission was made but it was ignored. Due to the lack of time, it was not possible for the commission to enter into discussions with Wexford County Council. Anyway, because of the way the terms of reference were drawn up they were inhibited from responding to that request.  Again there is evidence that the terms of reference were not adequate. Wexford loses because of it.  This is an indication that there can be lack of equality of representation throughout the county.</P>
    <P>Later, on page 11, the following reference to County Clare appears:</P>
    <P>As indicated, the terms of reference did not permit the transfer of a seat from one electoral area to another. Had this been permissible, the disproportion in certain cases could have been remedied without alteration of boundary or an increase in the number of members.  For example, the imbalance <Col N="2483" /> in County Clare could have been made good by transferring one member each from Ennistymon, Kilrush and Milltownmalbay to the Ennis electoral area, which would then be sub-divided.  As it is, the Commission's recommendations involve increasing the membership by one and splitting the existing Ennis electoral area five ways.  Similarly, the imbalance in Limerick County Borough could have been made good by transferring a member from the No. 4 electoral area to the No. 1 electoral area, rendering boundary changes (including a transfer across the Shannon) unnecessary. </P>
    <P>In other words, the established Ennis electoral area has been decimated because the terms of reference were drawn up in a way that did not allow the commission to respond and to take into account established communities and the traditional electoral areas.  The commission appreciate that what they are proposing is an electoral monstrosity without a logical basis and without electoral efficiency. However, the commission had to make the best they could of it because of the imperfect terms of reference.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of great regret that the Government should have given the job to two commissions, ask them to make recommendations but at the same time the Government did not make any reference to the existence of Gaeltacht areas. That is a very serious omission and must be an indication of the Government's thinking in regard to the Irish language and to areas in which the majority of the people speak the language daily.  This shows a complete disinterest in the preservation of those Gaeltacht communities. That is a great tragedy.  The commission again said they were constrained by the terms of reference.  They were unable to respond to genuine cases by many organisations, from some local authorities and individuals to overcome the electoral division of Gaeltacht areas. I quote from page 9 of the <i>County and County Borough Electoral Area Boundaries <Col N="2484" /> Commission Report</i> dated 28 February 1985:</P>
    <P>The Commission received a group of submissions relating to the Gaeltacht areas.  Among the suggestions made was that, within the counties concerned, the Gaeltacht should form one or more than one electoral area separate from English speaking districts. The Commission considered that implementation of this suggestion would involve major changes in the counties concerned which would be outside the scope of its terms of reference. </P>
    <P>I have never known a Government commission to make so many complaints about how inhibited they were in doing the job they saw needed to be done and could not do because of the very restricted terms of reference.  It is a sad reflection on the Government that it never occurred to them or to their Minister for the Gaeltacht, who has special responsibilities in this area and who sat at the Cabinet table where these terms or reference were finalised or to any member around the table, that they should have sought to correct the divisions of the Gaeltachtaí as evidenced by the existing electoral areas.  That was not new.  A great deal of work was done on this and the result of that work is available to the Minister in his Department.  The work of Comhairle na Gaeilge on the recommendations which they made is to be highly commended.  Those recommendations are in file in the Minister's Department and his officials are well acquainted with them, as I know from my experience. However, it was a lost opportunity and the Gaeltacht areas will suffer because the opportunity has not been availed of and must wait until some other day.  A sad aspect of that was that one of the local authorities made a strong submission recommending that their Gaeltacht areas should be all contained in one electoral area.  That submission was turned down by the Government.</P>

      <P>Amendment of the Voluntary Health Insurance legislation for the purpose referred to by the Deputy would introduce a fundamental departure from the existing role of the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Advocates of this development appear to consider that this would facilitate the control of hospital expenditure.  It is arguable as to whether this might not be more effectively accomplished on a much wider scale by including appropriate deterrents to excessive hospitalisation and excessive hospital costs in the Voluntary Health Insurance Board's insurance arrangements.  Furthermore, it would be undesirable to allow a situation to develop which could be construed as facilitating the creation of a two-tier health service.</P>
      <P>In the circumstances I am not satisfied that it would be desirable in the overall interests of the health services to provide for the statutory powers for the Voluntary Health Insurance Board which would enable them to depart from their traditional functions in the manner referred to.  Discussions on this and other issues have taken place with the Voluntary Health Insurance Board.  Further discussions are likely to take place in a couple of months.</P>

In the event of private investment or external investment in a particular private hospital in the Dublin area, that investment would not be at the cost of the Irish Exchequer or of Department of Health funds.  That is the important criterion.  The VHI would not be locked into effectively amortising the capital costs of a hospital over a very short period.  This is equally an important consideration.  Finally, there is a need for legislation to ensure that where foreign companies such as the BUPA company in the UK invest in the Republic of Ireland and become involved in hospital development their insurance arrangements should be on a community rating so that they do not discriminate against or place the VHI in a less advantageous position <i>Vis-á-vis</i> their operations in the Republic.  On balance, as one who normally favours investment by State bodies in development, I am not yet convinced that there is merit in the proposal put forward by some on behalf of the VHI.</P>

      <P>Let me make a point.  This is where I consider we are going wrong at Question Time.  We are all set to debate the rights and wrongs, merits and demerits of allowing the VHI to invest in hospitals.  As the Chair sees it, that is not what Question Time is all about.</P>

      <P>I will stay within the terms of the question.  Does the Minister not consider that it would be more desirable that the VHI themselves would be partners in a hospital rather than be paying moneys to a foreign company who are in competition with them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The VHI are a contractor on behalf of their subscribers. Where they provide services in respect of a particular hospital there is nothing to inhibit the VHI from introducing a scheme in relation to a particular hospital which has high specialities and expensive technology and saying that for that hospital this is what they are prepared to pay. To draw an analogy, American insurance companies equally demand of contractors X service for X premium paid and do not get themselves locked into the running of a hospital.  Finally, I make the point that for a country of three and a half million people we have 19,200 beds in existence and in addition 1,500 private beds.  If we are to have more investment in more hospital infrastructure the public hospitals of the health boards and the voluntary hospitals about which many Deputies are concerned will find themselves with occupancies of 60 per cent and 65 per cent, and their viability and cost will be called into serious question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>We have health board hospitals, public voluntary hospitals and private hospitals.  These three types of hospitals provide approximately 21,000 beds.  It would be undesirable to add a VHI owned tier on top of that. That is the basic argument which we must consider.  We have enough beds and hospitals.  There are 21,000 beds for 3,500,000 people.  Deputies must rid themselves of their obsession with building more hospitals with more beds.  The real issue is to rationalise them and have consultants on a specialist basis in hospitals.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I have received a rationalisation plan for hospital services from the Midland Health Board and given my approval in principle to it.  In particular I have approved the establishment of a regional orthopaedic unit in Tullamore, the concentration of maternity services for Laois-Offaly in Portlaoise, the establishment of an associated paediatric unit in Portlaoise, and the provision of a new geriatric unit in Edenderry.</P>
      <P>I am satisfied that the plan proposed by the Midland Health Board provides the best solution from both the medical and organisational points of view for the provision of hospital services in this area and discussions are taking place between officers of my Department and officials from the board on the measures which have to be taken to implement the plan.</P>
      <P>I have been concerned for some time at the lack of paediatric and orthopaedic services in this area and my previous statement on the appointment of a paediatrician to Tullamore was designed to remedy the situation in relation to paediatrics. However, since that time considerable efforts have been made to find a viable solution to the broader issues and these have resulted in the preparation of the plan which I have now approved and which means that in-patient paediatric services for the area are now to be provided in Portlaoise with associated outpatient clinics in Tullamore.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The immediate issue <Col N="2495" /> was the concern of the health board to get the paediatric service under way and approval from Comhairle na nOspidéal for the appointment of the paediatric consultants.  I gave that approval as a first step.  I am extremely anxious that it should be dealt with as a matter of urgency.  The development of the orthopaedic unit in Tullamore is under discussion currently between the Department and the health board.  I have not got sufficient information on that.  I will write to the Deputy.  There is no question of any delay.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>With all due respect to the Minister, there seems to be a difference of opinion on this proposal because the Minister for Defence, Deputy Cooney, gave an undertaking to the people of Longford-Westmeath that the orthopaedic unit would be in Athlone.

The Royal Victoria Eye and Ear Hospital have agreed to participate in the programme and have indicated that no additional revenue implications will be involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme will be undertaken on an investigative and research basis initially, on a trial basis, and the team carrying out the procedures will form part of a group of teams throughout Europe involved in this area.  I am prepared to make available to the hospital some capital <Col N="2497" /> moneys to purchase four devices required to carry out the implant operations.  I think it will benefit a small number of post-lingually profound deaf adult patients by putting them in touch with environmental sounds.</P>

      <P>One of the measures I introduced in relation to those who do not pay their health contributions was that they would be charged an admission charge for inpatient hospital services, be they farmers or self-employed persons whose health contributions are outstanding. In that regard I brought in the regulations on 1 June 1984 and they were immediately liable for an admission charge of £100.  Up to the end of January 1985, 65 persons had paid the £100 charge; but in the period 1 June 1984 to 30 September 1984 a total of 363 demands for the £100 had been issued in relation to the charge.  Health boards, for a variety of reasons &mdash; largely because they did not see themselves as having any role in this area from 1971 when they were first established &mdash; up to 1984 did not collect arrears.  Indeed, there was not much pressure on them by a number of Ministers of Finance to do so.  From April 1984 the Minister for Finance has been responsible for the collection of health contributions from all self-employed persons, including farmers.  I have been bringing great pressure to bear on the health boards to collect these arrears of contributions.  They stretch over 13 years and total some £32 million.  I do not have an average due.  I am pursuing them and I have not written off any of the arrears. I have insisted that the full enforcement procedures be brought into play in respect of these arrears of contributions which, after all, are paid by PAYE workers on a straight 1 per cent deducted from their wages each week.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the use of these estimates gives rise to much concern among other sectors of the community and to much unnecessary unease because of the magnitude of the estimated figures?  Would he tell the House if the actual figures are likely to represent a much smaller percentage of the estimate?  For example, are they likely to be in the region of 10 per cent or 50 per cent of the estimate, or what figure do his Department feel is actually due out of these estimated figures he has given the House today?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy knows, a flat rate health contribution scheme was introduced from 1 October 1971.  That was replaced by a pay-related scheme with effect from 6 April 1979. Talking somewhat offhand at this stage, I would imagine that, on appeal, we probably would have not more than £12 million to £15 million outstanding of the £32 million, but that is a substantial sum of money.  Every year I have included several millions in my estimates on the basis of the money being remitted to the Exchequer.  It all goes straight to the Exchequer.  It is not within the reach of the health boards who do not regard themselves as having an incentive to collect the arrears.  I would think that approximately £8 million to £9 million are outstanding and I am quite determined to get that money.</P>

      <P>Did the estimated amount owing which the Minister gave the House refer specifically to health contributions, as was asked in the question, or did it include the special levy and the youth employment levy?  Who is responsible for collecting this levy &mdash; formerly it was the health boards?  I understand the Revenue Commissioners collected it last year; but, in view of the fact that there is to be a land tax, will it still be the Revenue Commissioners, or who will collect it?  My third question is this. Would the Minister accept that there is chaos, particularly among farmers, in that they received demands on an estimated income &mdash; they do not know on what it was based &mdash; and that some of them have actually paid the special levy for which they were not liable as their total income amounted to less than £5,000?</P>

      <P>All of the data I have given refers to health contributions only, not to the levies, because the health contributions are reflected in the agreed Estimates between my Department and the Department of Finance.  There is no reason in the wide world that farmers or self employed persons should be unduly perturbed about it.  All they have to do is to pay.  But the propensity of Irish people not to pay for anything if they can get away with it is enormous.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister may have misunderstood me.  It is my understanding that they are not objecting to paying. They are concerned that they are being presented with a demand based on an estimated income which bears no relationship to their real incomes.  Many of these people are smallholders who would not have an accountant or who would not have to prepare accounts.  Is the Minister aware of that, and that, some of them have paid the special levy even though they were not liable because their incomes were less than £5,000 per annum?  Would the Minister now say who is responsible for collecting it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>All any person who receives an assessment on that basis has to do is pay on account.  I have no doubt, if somebody wants to pay on account what they consider themselves to be liable for, that the health boards would be anxious to resolve the balance by agreement or formal appeal.  Unfortunately, it is not germane to farmers or to the self-employed as the system does not capture the money at source and the tragedy is that people just do not want to pay and will not pay unless they are compelled to do so.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to answer that question but I will write to <Col N="2501" /> the Deputy about the matter.  Quite a number of farmers who are liable have paid for some years but still owe for others.  Therefore, I could not give a precise figure, but a considerable number of farmers have appealed amounts due which were based on the health boards' determination of their incomes.</P>

      <P>The control and regulation will be contained very emphatically in the Children Bill to be published next month and supervision and control will be substantial and definite within the <Col N="2502" /> framework of the Bill.  At present in the health board areas there are 250 centres compared with 175 in 1982, a figure of 87 in 1980 and 30 in 1974.  There has been considerable growth in this area and my concern is to provide more centres for disadvantaged groups, namely, mothers who are chronically ill, children from homes where parents must go out to work and are unable to make arrangements for the care of their children and in cases where parents are unable to cope.</P>

The number of requests from the Eastern Health Board has been surprisingly low although health boards spend about £1 million per year for 6,000 children in the 230 day care centres.  That was the figure for 1983 and I am sure it grew substantially in 1984.  I am quite willing to listen to the health boards, especially as far as disadvantaged areas are concerned, and that is where the money should be spent.</P>

      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 8 together.</P>
      <P>As indicated in the national plan, <i>Building on Reality,</i> the Government intend to bring forward a series of complementary Bills which will update and extend our child care legislation.</P>
      <P>The scheme of the first of these Bills has recently been approved by the Government.  It is now with the Parliamentary Draftsman and I expect the Bill to be published before the end of next month.  The Bill, which will deal with the care and protection of children, will provide for the following:</P>
      <P> (1) New system for the supervision and registration of day care services for children &mdash; for example, nurseries, creches.</P>
      <P>(2) Updating of the law in relation to foster care to promote greater use of this form of care for children who need to be looked after apart from their family;</P>
      <P>(3) A reorganised system of residential care with the emphasis on small family-type units.</P>
      <P>(4) Strengthening of the powers of health boards to intervene in cases of child abuse and neglect.</P>
      <P>(5) Increased penalties for offences against children and provision for new offences &mdash; for example, restrictions on the sale of solvents to children.</P>
      <P>(6) New powers for health boards to provide child care and family support services.  </P>
      <P>A second Bill will amend the Adoption Acts in the light of the recent report and recommendations of the Review Committee on Adoption Services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Government are also committed to bringing forward revised measures in relation to young offenders and this will be the subject of a third Bill.  The question of raising the age of criminal responsibility and of strengthening the law with regard to parental responsibility for damages caused by children who have not <Col N="2504" /> reached the age of criminal responsibility will fall to be considered in this context.</P>
    <P>It might be noted that under existing legislation &mdash; section 99 of the Children Act, 1908 &mdash; a court may order a parent to pay a fine, damage or costs in respect of an offence committed by his child unless the court is satisfied that the parent did not conduce to the commission of the offence by neglecting to exercise due care of the child.  A child for this purpose means a person who has attained the age of criminal responsibility, which is seven years at present.</P>

      <P>The general issue of adoption, and particularly the question surrounding the adoption of legitimate children, so called, is a major issue which has required considerable Government time.  That can be said, too, of the system of juvenile justice that is being incorporated in the Bill.  Because those are two major issues it was considered that a single Bill would have to contain from 300 to 400 sections.  The one we are talking of comprises 98 sections already.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health, in view of the fact that it would appear that Ireland is one of the few countries in which birth certificates <Col N="2507" /> are not issued for stillborn children and given the effect that this has on parents many of whom are rightly concerned since their children are baptised, if he will agree to change the regulation to ensure that birth certificates can issue for babies who are stillborn if the parents so request.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Health the number of babies who are stillborn or suffer neo-natal death; and if he will introduce registration of such cases both in the interest of medical research and so that the family would have some formal record.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.</P>
      <P>The most recent figures relating to the number of babies who are stillborn refer to 1981 when there were 600 such cases. The figures for neo-natal deaths are for 1983 when there were 389 cases.</P>
      <P>In the case of neo-natal deaths, that is deaths of liveborn infants aged under 4 weeks, both the birth and the death of the infant are registered and birth certificates or death certificates can be obtained as required.</P>
      <P>In the case of babies who are stillborn, the present legislation provides for their notification to the public health authorities and the records are available for medical research.  There is no legal provision for the issue of birth certificates for such children.  There has not in the past been any obvious need or demand for such provision.</P>
      <P>A comprehensive review of registration procedures has recently commenced and the question of whether arrangements should be made which would enable birth certificates to be issued for stillborn children will be considered as part of this review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister tell us when that review will take place and if he will be prepared to include the matter of stillborn children in the review? Would he agree that Ireland is one of the few countries in which birth certificates <Col N="2508" /> are not issued in respect of stillborn children? These babies are baptised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal factor to date in the case of the stillbirths appears to be the requirement to ensure the availability of accurate statistical information.  For that reason the main responsibility within the existing system for the notification of stillbirths was not vested in the relatives as is the case in respect of live births.  Instead, the notification of stillbirths rests with the professional staff involved in the delivery of the babies.  This system works quite well.  If stillbirths were to be registered there might be involved a change in the prime responsibility for notifying those events from the professional staff to the parents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GayMitchell" hpid="Mr. G. Mitchell Mr. G. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that Ireland is one of the few countries in which birth certificates are not issued in respect of babies that are stillborn?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have the information regarding the practice in other countries.  In 1981 there were 600 stillbirths notified here.  That represented a considerable decrease from the 1971 figure of 880.  I would make the point that while it might be important to some parents to establish a permanent record of a stillbirth, there might not be sufficient cause for parents of stillborn children in general to ensure their taking the necessary steps to effect registration. That would create the risk of a possible disimprovement in the availability of public information that is required.  That possibility must be guarded against.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister says that the transfer of registration in this case to families might involve the risk of less accurate medical records but would he not agree that the family should at least have the option of registering a stillborn child?  Surely that would not interfere with the quality of the statistical record provided by the hospitals.</P>

      <P>I take the point made by the Deputy.  It is a sensitive point.  In some cases parents of stillborn children may wish to have tangible evidence in the form of a certificate that a baby was born to them.  I have no objection to that but the dual system would be necessary to ensure that the information is collected and collated properly.  However, I am prepared to review the position.  I might add that the legislation has not been reviewed for many decades.</P>

Is é sin muna bhfuil an tAire agus an Rialtas sásta athsmaoineamh a dhéanamh ar na moltaí atá glactha acu cheana féin ón choimisiún.</P>
    <P>The principal proposals contained in the Bill refer to the Dublin area.  On this side of the House we have recognised for a long time that there was need to restructure the local government system in the Dublin area to take account of the huge housing development and the establishment of entire new communities and large townships within the Dublin area that were not catered for in the structures that were established many years ago before these developments took place.  The existing regime in Dublin was Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Urban District Council and the Balbriggan Town Commissioners.  The Government decided to establish a new corporation area and three new county councils to replace the four authorities I have mentioned.</P>
    <P>In the new local authority areas there is large divergence in the ratio of population to elected member and I wish to draw the attention of the House to that fact.  Part of the Government's brief was that there would be equalisation of representation between the different areas in each county, but there is a rather large deviation in Dublin.  In the new proposed corporation area there will be one member per population of 10,485, in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown new county council there will be one member per population of 6,630; in the Tallaght-Clondalkin county council area there will be one member per population of 6,374; and in the the Blanchardstown-Fingal area there will be a member per 4,754.  There is certainly no attempt here at equalisation of representation within the county of Dublin.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to note the divergence across the country.  In Leitrim a councillor is elected per population of 1,255, in Longford a councillor per 1,483 and in Carlow a representative is elected per <Col N="2528" /> population of 1,896.  These are the lower figures but, on the other hand, in the south Cork area there will be a councillor per population of 6,808.  We still continue to have a major divergence between the ratio of population to membership of local authorities.</P>
    <P>The main proposals of the Bill are designed to facilitate the establishment of the new authorities in Dublin.  To be quite honest, anyone reading them will have to admit that the proposals for Dublin are very confusing.  I am sure we are witnessing something unprecedented in local government history.  I doubt if any Government in any part of the world have ever set about changing the structures of the authorities in the primary centre of population in the way we are proposing.</P>
    <P>Let me give some indication of the sequence of events proposed by the legislation. Under the Bill new boundaries are being established for four new local authorities in Dublin.  However, elections will not be held in respect of Dublin Corporation, Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire Urban District Council and the Balbriggan Town Commissioners but elections will be held within the boundaries of the proposed new Dublin authorities.  However, councillors successful in these elections will not serve the new authorities but will be assigned after the election to serve in three of the four previous authorities.  Some of the newly elected councillors for the new Rathdown council area will serve on the old Dublin County Council and the old Dún Laoghaire Urban District Council even though they have been elected as councillors to the newly proposed county council.  I do not think one could get anything more confusing than that.  In addition, further legislation will have to be enacted after the elections to establish the proposed four new Dublin authorities. However, this legislation cannot be introduced until all the consequential arrangements have been worked out, dividing Dublin County Council, Dublin Corporation and Dún Laoghaire Urban District Council into four new areas, and <Col N="2529" /> until all the staff and management separation agreements are finalised.</P>
    <P>It is fair to ask the question: what happens if agreement is not reached on the division of property and of staff and management functions between the new local authorities?  What happens if the unions do not co-operate?  What happens if a major strike is called?  Dare I pose the question, what happens if a general election is called in the interregnum after people have been elected to a council which does not exist and who are being asked to serve on a council which was been abolished?  It is possible that the councils to which they have supposedly been elected may never come into existence. This is the most confusing legislation any Government ever attempted to put through the House.  I doubt whether many people understand the complexity and stupidity of this Bill.  People are asking why the Government are going about this in such a ham-fisted way, and why they have selected such a tortuous route to achieve such a simple change. The only answer to these questions is that up to now the Government have failed to get on with the job and to do the groundwork which would have enabled them to have all this work done before next June.  Maybe they harboured hopes of being able to postpone the election again.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>Having wasted a year we now have a situation in which the Government had to scramble something together quickly but the unscrambling of this will cause a lot of headaches and confusion and will not contribute to a smooth transition to the new structures for a reformed local government system <Col N="2530" /> in the Dublin area.  In fact it will lead to utter chaos and confusion.  I hope it will not result in disillusion or that it will not be a disincentive to people coming forward to participate in local democracy. People should seek to give service to their follow members in the community through these local authorities, but they will only do that if they see that participation is meaningful and that by playing their part they can be effective. Unless the functions are expanded and defined, and unless the financing is changed, I can see a lot of people in Dublin scratching their heads in 12 months time and asking how they ever agreed to this.</P>
      <P>Like all rushed legislation, this is bad legislation.  Nothing should be rushed in the sense of bringing forward proposals for legislative change.  Over the years I have heard those with long experience continually pass that advice to the younger Members.  This Bill was rushed to my house by a civil servant last Saturday so that I as Opposition spokesman would have an opportunity of seeing it before the Dáil sat on Tuesday.  This Bill was circulated to the other Members last Tuesday and taken today, Thursday.  This means that very few Members had an opportunity to study it.  That is a fact which cannot be denied.  I cannot recall many other legislative proposals which were brought in at the last minute and given such little time for consideration.  I sound the warning bell that what we are doing now could lead to a lot of difficulty for the Dublin region in about 12 months time unless this is sorted out.</P>
      <P>Unless the unions and the staff in the different authorities are very generous in reaching a settlement with the management and the Department, the Minister is heading for trouble in trying to divide these responsibilities.  More will be heard of this.  This is not the right way to do this.  All these proposals could have been announced this time last year and that would have given the Minister, the management and staffs the last 12 months to discuss the new arrangements.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Up to the date this commission were established in mid-January and given their terms of reference, no discussions <Col N="2531" /> as regards changes in staff arrangements, management structures and the authority boundary areas in Dublin had taken place.  That is extraordinary considering that we had had a postponement a year earlier to allow those discussions to take place, the proposals to be published and time to consider representations on these matters.  Like so many other things, this will be rushed through and will be seen to be wrong and slipshod, and unless the staffs agree to be very amenable, there could be trouble.</P>
    <P>The other main area being changed outside Dublin is the Galway area.  This Bill is dealing with the new structures for Dublin and the changes proposed for Galway.  The extraordinary thing about Galway is that the commission were asked to consider whether a boundary extension should be recommended for Galway city.  When the commission wrote to the two local authorities informing them of this and asking for their views, the corporation and the county council sought information as to what exactly was involved and, if there was agreement, if compensation would be payable.  It transpired at the fairly early stage that the Government were not able to answer questions.  There was no procedure whereby Galway County Council could be compensated for any territory they ceded to Galway Corporation and discussions broke down at an early stage.</P>
    <P>As there were only three weeks for the discussions to take place, things were rushed and it was only at the last minute that some councillors from both authorities got together and made an agreed submission.  This was no thanks to the Minister or his Government, to the terms of reference of the commission or the arrangements the Minister gave to the commission, or the commission itself because they were powerless.  They would not have made any recommendation for an extension of the Galway city boundary were it not for the fact that there was agreement locally.  If there had been any dissention locally, the commission made it clear that they could not make a submission and they would not. <Col N="2532" /> That is what happened in Limerick.  In that case they could not make a submission because there was disagreement and the commission did not have sufficient time to consider the matter.  We see a lot of difficulty being created for local authorities because of the Government's dilatory approach to this area.</P>
    <P>I am interested in the section dealing with Galway, particularly where mention is made of the continuation of the management structures.  At present there is a joint manager for the city and the county, but under the proposal to eventually make Galway city a county borough, this Bill provides that that management arrangement will continue.  I want to protest against that.  That is not satisfactory and it will not be well received in Galway. It was felt that the expansion of the city boundary was long overdue.  The opportunity offered by this Bill was availed of, no thanks to the commission but due to the hard work done by local officials. There does not seem to be much point in establishing Galway city as a county borough and telling us it has equal status to Galway County Council if it is to continue under the same management as the county.  The city will now operate independently and, financially and in every other way, administer all the services which will become its responsibility and should be under the management of a county manager who should not have to share his duties and responsibilities with any other area.</P>
    <P>The growth and development of Galway has been hindered by the present management structure where the county manager delegates to an assistant manager and where the daily operation is controlled by a town clerk who is the person most in touch with the problems and services administered, and who is also the person immediately consulted for decisions.  The town clerk cannot make decisions, he must refer them to the assistant manager; and if it is a big decision the assistant manager must refer it to the county manager.  We have a very cumbersome inefficient structure which is hindering development.  It does not <Col N="2533" /> encourage initiative and it does not stimulate dynamism within the local structure. I urge the Minister to change that section where he guarantees the existing manager that so long as he holds the office of Galway County Manager he will continue also as manager of the new county borough of Galway.  That is most unsatisfactory and unreasonable and something we urge the Minister to change.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not mention in his speech, nor in the Bill, the role of the town clerk after the establishment of the new county borough.  There does not seem to be any provision for a town clerk in a county borough structure.</P>
    <P>In relation to Dublin, when the four local authorities were being replaced by four new authorities and when newly elected councils were to act on behalf of three of the old ones, the Balbriggan Town Commissioners disappeared off the scene.  There is no reference in the speech or in the Bill to what has happened to the Balbriggan Town Commissioners in this most confusing arrangement which the Minister has thought up to introduce radical reform in the Dublin area.  Will the Minister tell us what will happen to the Balbriggan Town Commissioners?</P>
    <P>The Gaeltacht areas come in under the Galway recommendations.  Due to the time constraints and the difficulty of reaching agreement because of lack of compensation arrangements and lack of an assurance in regard to the procedures to be adopted in deciding compensation, the agreed submission from the two local authorities in Galway was effectively a last minute thing.  In fact an exception was made to allow acceptance of their submission at a date later than the appointed time.  The Galway County Council recommended that Connemara would be one electoral area.  Is there a possibility that that recommendation could be revived and accepted or is it the position that the Minister will refuse to accept any changes in the recommendations made by either of the two commissions in regard to the new electoral boundary delineations.  If the Minister is totally against any changes I would like him to say so because in a number of <Col N="2534" /> areas groups are coming together to pressurise for certain changes to eliminate local anomalies that have arisen.  If there is local agreement in relation to getting a change there is no reason the Minister should hold out, so I would like him to give some indication to the House that he will accept agreed recommended changes when he makes an order.</P>
    <P>This Bill does not do a lot but it gives the Minister a lot of power.  Section after section of the Bill contains the words &ldquo;the Minister may by order&rdquo;.  The Minister is receiving vast powers to make orders which will have far-reaching effects on electoral areas.  We will not see these proposals here at the moment because most of them will be made by order and after a period of 21 sitting days of the Dáil they will come into force unless they are annulled.  They are not now before the House so there is an opportunity for local groups who are agreed on changes to approach the Minister before he makes an order.  A mistaken impression may have been given that, because the commissions made their reports and the Bill has been introduced here, no changes can be made. This Bill and the commissions' reports will have no effect on the electoral areas.  This is reserved for the Minister.  The Minister can accept or reject suggestions, but if there is agreement for a change in any area the Minister should have an open mind and consider and accept sensible proposals when they come forward.</P>
    <P>There is an urgent need for reconsideration of what the Minister has done in the Connemara area, particularly in relation to the division of the Fíor Gaeltacht of Connemara, which we had hoped would some day be bound together in one electoral area.  On the question of the future of the Gaeltachtaí, they will have to have a stronger place in the local government system.  The intention in establishing Údarás na Gaeltachta was that eventually additional powers could be ceded to that authority; but because of controversies that have raged &mdash; for political reasons &mdash; there seems to be little likelihood that the Minister will cede <Col N="2535" /> additional powers to that authority.  The Government since they were elected set out to destroy the credibility of Údarás na Gaeltachta and have done great damage to the whole concept of a local authority for the Gaeltacht areas.  If the Government are not prepared to strengthen the Údarás by giving them greater powers in relation to functions dealing with roads, housing and other local services, I suggest that there is a need to provide some co-ordination between the various Gaeltacht areas.</P>
    <P>I recommend the suggestion of Comhairle na Gaeilge that there should be a Comhairle na Ceanntaire Gaeilge, that there should be some sort of a national committee which could act as the voice for all the Gaeltacht areas in representations to local councils and to the Department of the Gaeltacht and other Government Departments about matters affecting Gaeltacht areas.  The Gaeltachtaí have two difficulties with which to contend.  They are located in remote areas &mdash; and I suppose that is why the language survived there, because the oppressor did not exert his influence in those areas &mdash; and they have great economic difficulties, great social problems and a huge lack of services and opportunity. There is need for some special medium of representation for them to have a voice which will be heard.  I do not know if this Government are in any way sympathetic to the language or the Gaeltacht.  Very little of what they have done would convince us that there was any sympathy at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that I understand what is proposed with regard to Galway and Dublin. In Galway the existing borough council will remain, up to the date of the election and after it but the borough <Col N="2536" /> council area is being extended and at some date in the future the extended borough council will be made a county borough.  Therefore the people in the city are not being allowed to participate in the county council elections because at some date in the future they will be made a county borough.  On the date of the county council election they will still be only a borough council and under the existing legislation entitled to vote in the county council elections, but when this Bill passes that right will have been taken from them.</P>
    <P>The whole question of the effect on commercial ratepayers in the areas which are being transferred from one local authority area to another is of very great importance.  This deserves much more comment than the brief reference by the Minister in his introductory remarks.  In the case of Galway the corporation rate last year was £23.77p and the county council rate was £19.64p.  Therefore, if a commercial property has a high valuation and there are many such in the area which is being added to the city from the county, with one factory employing well over 1,000 people, a property there with £100 valuation would be paying £2,300 in the corporation area and only £1,900 if it had remained in the county council area.  Immediately, there will be an increased financial burden of £400 per £100 valuation on properties which are being transferred.  There is an arrangement whereby that increase will be phased in over a period of five years.  It seems that the phasing in is based on the valuation and not on the amount of rates to be paid.  Why is that so?  Surely it would be more appropriate to base it on the actual rate to be paid.</P>
    <P>Secondly, from the reference in the Bill to standard valuations, am I interpreting it correctly that if I live in the part of Galway County Council which is being transferred into the city and undertook an extension to my factory, shop or commercial property last year and am on the list for a revision of valuation, if my £100 valuation goes up to £150 &mdash; in other words, if there is an increase of £50 in my valuation &mdash; will the remission or phasing <Col N="2537" /> in over the five years apply to the increased valuation?  As I read this Bill, it will not.  Those who through no fault of their own, through a decision of this House, are being transferred from one rating authority into another, because they are progressive and recently undertook developments, are going to be doubly penalised.  Not alone will they face the high rate in the future but they are going to face it now on the part of their property which has been recently valued because of an improvement and the enlargement of their valuation.  If that is so I ask the Minister to think twice about it and apply the phasing in over the five years also to any additional valuations arising from improvements.</P>
    <P>I cannot let this debate go without asking the Minister to tell the House the history behind the strange anomaly that in County Cavan a district electoral division existed all on its own inside another electoral area.  The district electoral division of Tullyvin West, with a population of 263, although geographically within the Bailieboro county electoral area, had heretofore been included in the Cavan county electoral area.  There must be an interesting history behind that.  The House should know what happened in the past and the Minister should say how that strange situation came about.  It is correct that the matter should be regularised.</P>
    <P>Some other matters in this Bill include voting procedures in appointing persons to various committees.  This has not received any publicity, but it will bring about a fairly extensive change in the method of appointing council members and representatives of the council to various committees of the council.  This has always been a bone of contention at council meetings.  Some local authorities in the past have been accused of taking all the positions on committees because there happened to be a majority.  Our thanks are due to the late President, Erskine Childers, who when Minister for Health when he was establishing the health boards laid down new procedures for representation of county councils on the health boards, whereby each group <Col N="2538" /> of seven on the council would be entitled to representation.  That group could be formed by any seven members.  This gave an opportunity to the smaller parties and Independents to group together to ensure that representation was proportionate in relation to the various political groupings on the council.  No one group, because it might have been a majority of even one, could proceed to take all the seats on these committees.  I am pleased that change is being introduced.  Despite what some may say or think privately, there will be a general agreement that that is a good proposal.  It is said that it will apply to every committee of the council and it is hoped it will eliminate much contentious discussion and vote taking at council meetings in the future.</P>
    <P>Another interesting provision in the Bill is the power to extend the maritime boundaries of an authority.  In this case the Bill proposes the extension of the boundary of the county of Cork to include Whiddy Island.  It seems that Justice Costello made reference to this in his report on the tragedy there.  I hope that other local authorities will have a look around at some of the offshore islands and locations adjacent to their coastline and consider if it would be worth their while bringing them within the county boundaries if such anomalies exist.</P>
    <P>The Minister should explain to the House what he means by a reference to compulsory adjustment.  As I said earlier, one of the difficulties confronting the local authorities in Galway &mdash; and the county council in particular because they are the ones who will suffer &mdash; was the lack of provision for making compensatory payments, or procedures or machinery for assessing the amount of compensation to be paid in the event of land and property being transferred from one authority into another.  In this Bill the Minister said that the local authority should seek to reach agreement in questions of financial adjustments arising out of the ceding of an area from one local authority to another.  Where local authorities are unable to reach agreement, it is suggested that the Minister would have the power and in the Bill he calls that <Col N="2539" /> compulsory adjustment.  Previously, as I understood it, when a boundary commission made a recommendation that part of one area should transfer to another area, if there was no agreement locally as to what the compensation would be I understood that an independent arbitrator was appointed.  I doubt if the Minister or his staff of civil servants might have the expertise to make a fair and accurate assessment of the amount of compensation to be paid.</P>
    <P>I wonder why the Minister is taking this power on to himself in this section. Am I reading it wrongly?  Is it the case that the Minister in having the power to make the decision will appoint the arbitrator, because the word &ldquo;arbitrator&rdquo; is not mentioned in section 4?  Is that a new provision? If the Minister is to be the person to make the decision how will he exercise that function?  Section 2(4) of the Second Schedule states:</P>
    <P>the Minister shall, upon the request of either the Corporation or the County Council make an adjustment (hereafter in this Schedule referred to as a &ldquo;compulsory adjustment&rdquo;) of such matter or thing and may by such adjustment make any provision in relation to such matter or thing which could under this Article have been provided for by an agreed adjustment. </P>
    <P>That whole area of compensation could become very crucial in any boundary extension in the future.  It has already raised itself as a major obstacle in Galway and the agreement reached was conditional on satisfactory compensation arrangements being made.  I hope that that condition will be fulfilled.  An explanation is needed there.</P>
    <P>Those living in Baldoyle, Sutton and that general area of Dublin for some strange reason find themselves becoming part of the new Dublin County Council. As I understand it, Howth and that general area has been part of Dublin Corporation for the past 20 years, a period that has seen the greatest urban development experienced in the country.  The area mentioned has participated in that <Col N="2540" /> growth and there have been huge housing developments in the whole region.  The people there consider themselves very much a part of Dublin City.  They identify with the city and with Dublin Corporation. They have never considered themselves to be out in the country.  Any fairminded person looking at the map of Dublin as drawn up by the Government, not the commission, must question why this area has been put in with the county. It involves leaving a very narrow neck connecting Howth and Baldoyle to the county.  There is an extraordinarily narrow band connecting one to the other and that highlights that the decision made was for a reason other than keeping natural communities together.  If Howth was naturally a community to any part of Dublin it was more part of the city community than of the county community. Connecting in the way shown on the map is very strange.</P>
    <P>There are some people who would be so bold as to suggest that this was done by the Government purely for electoral advantage.  That is a terrible thought.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertMolloy" hpid="Mr. Molloy Mr. Molloy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molloy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am concerned about the matter.  These matters must be highlighted. I do not think anybody has read the Bill.  I am probably the only Member, apart from the Minister, who has read the Bill from A to Z.  I do not know if the Deputy who will follow me has studied every line of it as I did but if he did he did not have anything else to do for the last two days because I had to burn the midnight oil to do so.  I got a head start in that I was given a copy of it a day or two earlier then anybody else.</P>
      <P>According to section 3 all orders made under the Bill must be laid before the Dáil for 21 sitting days except those made under section 5, 7 (7), 8 or 24.  At first reading it appears that orders made under the latter sections are exempt.  However, I shall quote section 3:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>3.&mdash;(1) Every order or regulation made by the Minister under this Act, other than under section 5, 7 (7), 8 or <Col N="2543" /> 24, shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made, and if either such House shall, within the next twenty-one days on which that House has sat after such order is laid before it, pass a resolution annulling such order or regulation, such order or regulation shall be annulled accordingly but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done thereunder. </P>
    <P>Subsection (2) states that when it is proposed to make an order under section 8 or 24 of the Act a draft thereof shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.</P>
    <P>There seems to be a contradiction between the two because one says that if an order is made under section 8 it does not have to be brought before the Oireachtas or wait for 21 sitting days before it comes into force, whereas subsection (2) states that it has to be brought before the Houses and must await the period of 21 sitting days.  Orders that have to be brought before the House which have to wait the passing of 21 sitting days are very important in relation to this Bill because of the time scale.  Today, late in his speech the Minister emphasised this point.  He implied that if this Bill is not allowed to go through before Easter the whole game is up because it would be very difficult to get orders through.  This again shows the slipshod way in which the Government have gone about this Bill.  He said that it will be necessary to have the Bill enacted before Easter.  It will be essential, because if the Bill is not law before Easter the whole game will collapse because of the orders and the time scale necessary.  I hope the Minister will clarify the apparent contradiction.</P>
    <P>I will refer briefly to the offshore islands and ask the Minister whether he has received representations from Comhdháil na nOileán for separate representations on county councils for people residing on those islands.  I have <Col N="2544" /> heard that some members of the Minister's party have attended comhdháil meetings and have given assurances on behalf of the Taoiseach that the Government will make special provision for those communities.  So far, we have not seen any proposals which would fulfil the commitments made, particularly by Deputy O'Donnell when he spoke, as he said, representing the Taoiseach.  The secretary of the comhdháil made representations on behalf of the islanders but so far I understand they have been rejected.  I have here a letter from the Department of the Environment which is as follows:</P>
    <P>18 Nollaig, 1984.</P>
    <P>Feargal Mac Amhlaoimh,</P>
    <P>Comhdháil na nOileán,</P>
    <P>Comharchumann Chléire Teo,</P>
    <P>Cléire,</P>
    <P>An Sciobairín,</P>
    <P>Co. Chorcaí.</P>
    <P>A Chara,</P>
    <P>Mr. Liam Kavanagh, T.D., Minister for the Environment, has asked me to refer to your letter of 27 Samhain, 1984 suggesting that separate representation on the county councils of Cork, Donegal, Galway and Mayo should be provided for the off-shore islands.  The Minister has asked me to explain that the combined island population in each case falls well short of the number of persons normally represented by a single county councillor in the counties concerned.  This is so even when account is taken of those islands which are connected to the mainland by bridge or causeway, for example, Achill in County Mayo, Gorumna, Lettermore and Lettermullan in County Galway and Inchadoney and Reengarogy in County Cork and of the islands of Haulbowline and Spike in Cork harbour.</P>
    <P>As you know the election of county councillors is on the system of proportional representation by means of the single transferable vote, a system which envisages electoral areas returning at least 3 members each. </P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2545" /> In this connection there is a procedure in the Local Government Acts, whereby a local body set up to further the general social and economic interests of the people of an area may be given recognition, and aided by the county council as an approved local council.  The people of the islands may wish to consider whether to establish such bodies and apply to the appropriate county council for recognition of them.  A copy of the relevant extract from the Local Government Acts is attached (section 72/75 of the Local Government Act, 1941 as amended by section 54 of the Local Government Act, 1955). </P>
    <P>I hope the Minister will make some reference to the position of the islanders. He must appreciate that there is great frustration among those communities, particularly about lack of facilities and the neglect of some of the islands in regard to the provision of essential services and the construction and maintenance of roads.</P>
    <P>Particularly in my constituency, in order to bring foodstuffs and domestic materials for homes and farms ashore, the goods have to be transferred from freight vessels to currachs and rowed on to beaches on which waves are crashing, putting the lives of the people at risk. The property is very often damaged from being soaked in salt water.  Of course, there is a high incidence of arthritis on these islands because of the constant wetting which the men have to endure to get their goods ashore.  That happens every week on Inisheer and Inishmaan.  Young men become old very quickly, crippled with arthritis because of those very primitive methods.  They still have to use old methods to bring animals out to be transferred to freight vessels.  This should not be allowed to continue in 1985.  Vessels are incapable of coming in to the shore because proper landing facilities have not been provided.  I hope this and other Ministers would give recognition to the difficulties those communities are experiencing.  We have a duty to provide those communities at least with means of <Col N="2546" /> transporting their goods and families to and from the mainland.</P>
    <P>There are many other instances which I could refer to.  The living conditions are still as primitive as they were 50 years ago.  Communities should be sustained on those islands but we need to bring their standard of living up to that available generally.</P>
    <P>When the Government announced changes for Dublin they spoke about a Dublin Metropolitan Council but there is no reference to it in the Bill or in the explanatory memorandum.  It is like much of the reforms we have been requesting from the Minister &mdash; they have been left to lá eile.  It is not satisfactory that so much time has been allowed to elapse without work to reform the whole area of local government.  It is strange that if the promised DMC are to have some important part to play in the new Dublin local authority system, there is not a reference to it here.  The Minister spoke about a three tier system, the top one of the DMC which would not have any statutory powers, the county councils which would be the main local authorities, and there would be a third tier below that.  There is no reference to the third tier in this Bill, as I have highlighted, and it is one of the major omissions.  Were there any attempt to provide for some tier of the local government system for the large urban areas which have been built up over the past 20, 30 and 40 years we would give a much greater welcome to this Bill.  The only welcome we can give is to say that it is a small, shaky start down a road which we have been encouraging the Government to travel for a long time and which we hope they will not stop going down the minute these elections are over.  I am convinced that the only reason this has been brought forward is that the election date is coming up and the Government must show some cause for delaying it last year.  All they are doing is changing the electoral areas. They have not yet made provision for the new structures in Dublin.</P>
    <P>A very unusual situation will obtain after these elections.  I have warned about the difficulties that we could run into <Col N="2547" /> there.  The Tallaghts, the Clondalkins and the other growth areas or townships that have been built up around Dublin are all neglected.  This Bill has no place for them.  There is not a word about a structure for them in this Bill and they are being ignored.  We know the extent of the problems in those areas, and these new county councils will not provide the solution to the difficulties that the people in Tallaght and the other growth areas in Dublin are experiencing.  It will not provide them with the forum to bring forward many local problems which are bearing down on them on a day to day, week to week basis.  Very big frustrations are building up in those areas, and the proper way to accommodate the needs of those communities is to provide a second tier of a local government system there.</P>
    <P>The Minister seemed confused when he started to talk about a three tier system.  You cannot call Dublin Metropolitan Council, who have no statutory function, a tier in the local government system.  They are just some kind of advisory committee and should not be referred to as part of a three tier system.  The Minister should stay with a two tier system, continue with the county council as the main line local authority and below that in the urban areas where large groups of people are living together he should provide a second tier, be that a district council or whatever name you want to give it.  I would prefer some name like Tallaght Town District Council which would link it to the county council to be established in that area and where the division of roles and functions would be clear, one would not overlap the other and responsibilities would be clearly defined.  In that area there is great need for solid work and reform.  The Minister will find this side of the House very co-operative in supporting him in any change of that nature, and we urge him to get on with the real reform.  We will facilitate the passing of this Bill before Easter so that he will not run himself into trouble with the orders which he has to make which might go by default if we were to <Col N="2548" /> debate Committee and other Stages of this Bill fully.  If that was to carry on after the Easter recess he would not be able to hold the local elections or he could hold them only if he were to bring in a guillotine motion or if the Fianna Fáil Party in Dáil Éireann co-operated in letting the Bill pass in time for those orders to be made and to come into operation.  We are prepared to co-operate fully with him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>It is heart-warming to hear the Opposition spokesman facilitating the passage of this legislation before Easter.  One could be cynical and say that because the Government are in mid-term, because of the obvious advantage they have and also because the Opposition really cannot complain about gerrymander despite the attempt to do so, they are rubbing their hands with glee and trying to get into this election because the boundaries are more than fair to them. As between political parties these boundaries are, if anything, less than fair to this side of the House and give no advantage to this side.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Local Government (Reorganisation) Bill should have two elements.  First it should introduce an element of government at local level which is not there at the moment because of the total lack of powers on the part of members of local authorities.  Second, it should introduce a local element into the exercising of that authority.  Progress has been made but, particularly in the Dublin city context, <Col N="2549" /> we do not go far enough.  I do not intend to take a party line on this issue.  Important matters need to be raised which I would like to raise here today.  I am surprised that the major Opposition party have no proposals of their own to put forward.  They have no suggestions to replace suggestions which are being put. They have nothing to say in a planned way about what they would like to see. The Opposition have a duty to oppose and they are doing so, but they also have the responsibility as a party offering themselves as the alternative Government to propose, and they have made no proposals whatsoever.  That is a pity because if they had done so we could compare them with the Government's proposals and see how well each set of proposals would stand up.</P>

      <P>There are great improvements in the Dublin County Council area.  The existing arrangement of an authority in Dún Laoghaire with a county council encircling Dublin city and Dublin City Council in the middle cannot be allowed to continue.  The change in the county introducing three new authorities will improve the situation there.  The ratio of representation in the county is coming nearer to the national average and that also is a good thing.  However, the situation in Dublin city has not changed or, in so far as it has changed, it has changed for the worse.  The mix of population is not good.  We have transferred out of what might be called settled working class and middle class areas and have brought problem areas into a city which already has more than its fill of problem areas, particularly in the inner city.  Putting all of those areas into one local authority is not a good idea.  On a breakdown the <Col N="2550" /> population in Dublin city is approximately 325,000 on the north side and only 220,000 on the south side.  We have an enormously disproportionate representation on the north side of the city which will return 31 councillors as against 21 councillors for the south side.  That disproportionate representation will create problems.  The representation within the city of approximately 10,500 per councillor does not allow for the local representation we have been speaking of.  It is only marginally better than the representation we had heretofore.  I do not have the exact figures but the new population at approximately 546,000 will be about 20,000 greater than the existing population in Dublin Corporation. There will be seven additional members but that does not give any significant decrease between Dublin city councillors and councillors elsewhere.  That is a matter for concern.  The reality is that a Dublin electoral area to the new Dublin City Council will be about the same size as a three-seat Dáil constituency whereas Leitrim, which does not even make up half a Dáil constituency, will return 22 members.  This will encourage people to use the Dublin City Council as a way of getting into the Dáil.  Many of us making our careers in politics started at that level but it would not encourage people to become involved in city politics for its own sake.  The level of representation is too high and given the small turn-out at local elections, minorities will have a platform and will use it as a springboard into this House.  All parties have used this system through the years but what we should be going after is local effort in reorganising local government, particularly in the Dublin area.</P>
      <P>In County Leitrim the representation will be approximately 1,255 head of population per member whereas in Dublin it will be approximately 10,500.  It is a ratio of 9 : 1.  We are not making Dublin city politics any more local than they have ever been.  I regret that because it would be in the interests of the public if we did so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the commission's terms of reference was that the commission should <Col N="2551" /> recommend the division of each of the districts into two electoral areas of not more than five seats taking due account in such divisions of the affinity of different parts of these districts with each other and of the population of these areas as recorded in 1981.  The Drimnagh-Crumlin-Walkinstown area will be the second biggest electoral area in the country.  In terms of tolerance it will be way above the representation of other electoral areas in the city and that does not meet with the term of reference which was given to the commission.  Part of Crumlin was taken out of the electoral area and part of Walkinstown was broken off from another part of Walkinstown and added into that electoral area.  The areas of Crumlin, Kimmage and Drimnagh, which have a natural affinity, make up four quotas. How anyone could take out part of Crumlin and put in parts of Walkinstown and still meet that term of reference is beyond me.  Either it is not in keeping with the term of reference or those on the commission do not know Dublin very well.</P>
    <P>There is an area of Crumlin, part of the lower Crumlin development council's area, which is being cut out and put in with Harolds Cross, Terenure, Rathmines and another part of Terenure with which it has no affinity.  They are poles apart.  They are not even in the same parish.  I do not see how that can be done while, at the same time at the other end of the electoral area, Walkinstown, which was Terenure I, was transferred into that part of the city and Walkinstown, which is called Ballyfermot H, is being transferred to another electoral area.</P>
    <P>How can all that be justified given that term of reference?  The commission have made a serious mistake in putting in five-seat electoral areas in south inner city and north inner city Dublin.  Perhaps the members of the commission thought in good faith that because there were specific and particularly difficult problems in inner city Dublin the best thing to do would be to give them ten seats so that they would have a good representation. That would be a very good idea if <Col N="2552" /> it could be done by putting more representatives into smaller areas but in order to get sufficient representatives they had to make very large areas.  What did they do?  They made very large troublesome areas.  One inner city constituency on the south side of Dublin, where the largest proportion of problems relating to the city arise, has been lumped into one five-seat local election constituency. The same has been done on the north side of the city.  That is not a good idea.  The Minister and his officials can titter away but they have made a very serious mistake.</P>

      <P>It is not in the interests of the people to put problem areas like Fatima Mansions, Dolphin House, St. Teresa's Gardens, Bishop Street flats and Oliver Bond House together and lump them in with other blocks of flats such as Iveagh Buildings and other densely crowded high rise buildings. Other solutions were available, for example, the Kilmainham end of that could have been put into a different electoral area as could the South Dock area.  This would have left a smaller, more manageable area in the inner city which could be represented more effectively.  A serious mistake was made by the commission and before it is too late I suggest that the House, by agreement, should re-consider that.</P>
      <P>In relation to the powers of the new council and councillors, particularly <i>vis-á-vis</i> the manager, many of these councillors will be elected to authorities which will not exist.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the initial period they will have to opt for one authority or another.  We are to have a second Bill which I hope will come sooner rather than later.  There should be a significant transfer of power back from city managers and county managers to councillors who should have the power to decide on local issues locally. <Col N="2553" /> That is the second element of local government reform.  The first is to get the structure on a local basis where people are talking about local issues.  Local government should be given to the elected representatives of the people.  To do that we have to amend the Act dealing with the managers.</P>
    <P>Many councillors are given a bad time by many of our over-paid TV stars like Gay Byrne and others but they would be quite capable of dealing with serious problems which affect many parts of this city which are nearer to ground level than Howth Head.  We should give councillors the power to decide on matters which are affecting the people instead of just giving consent.  The only power they have is to introduce a section 4 motion which is always controversial.  How can we expect people to have respect for councillors if we do not respect them ourselves and in the national parliament devolve powers on them to enable them to deal with local issues?</P>
    <P>It is very important that the Bill, which is complementary to this Bill, should be brought before the House this year.  I do not know whether it would be possible to do that before the local government elections.  Presumably it would not.  We have to be very serious and very definite about devolving powers to local authorities and about transferring power from central government to councillors and from managers to councillors so that councillors who are elected by the people will have the authority local people want them to have and can exercise their responsibilities.  I hope when we think in terms of that reform the whole question of local government financing will be considered seriously.</P>
    <P>The Government are at an advanced stage in considering a national lottery. As chairman of the Dublin City Council Finance Committee for five of the past six years, I am aware that our committee undertook to study the possibility of having a lottery in the Dublin area.  I raised that matter in this House.  Initially I came up against much derisory comment from people who did not think it was a very good idea.  Having pursued <Col N="2554" /> the matter through the city council and with various Government Ministers we find that the Government think a lottery is a good idea, have grabbed the idea for themselves and intend to hold a national lottery.  That is fine, but I would urge that the local authorities should be given a share in the lottery.  If local authorities have to organise the sale of a certain number of tickets in order to get a percentage, fair enough.  There are many natural outlets within Dublin city in the different offices.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. G. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>They could be used very easily as outlets for the sale of tickets for such a lottery.  This Bill implements the commission's report, part of whose terms of reference was to propose boundaries with a maximum of five-seat constituencies. A number of three seat constituencies were proposed but no one-seat constituencies.  The restriction of a population of 75,000 to 110,000 meant that there would have to be some five-seat constituencies.  The multi-seat constituencies at local and national levels take from the effectiveness of parliament and local councils.  Some system will have to be found which will give a single-seat constituency based on PR.  This can be done.</P>
      <P>If we were to introduce one-seat constituencies it is likely that Fine Gael would do well in Dublin and Fianna Fáil would do well west of the Shannon.  It is possible to devise a one-seat constituency arrangement at national and local levels which would discount the regional imbalance and allow for the abolition of multi-seat constituencies.  Multi-seat constituencies are a load of nonsense.  They are outmoded and cause problems for Deputies and councillors who have to spend much of their time watching what other representatives are doing instead of getting on with the job.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sorry that in this Bill we have not attempted, even on a temporary basis or on a trial basis, to introduce one-seat local government constituencies even in <Col N="2555" /> one county council area or one borough council area to see how effective they would be.  We have to think in terms of one seat local government constituencies and one seat Dáil constituencies if Deputies and councillors are to be effective in representing the people who elect them and if they are to be allowed to spend time outside their constituencies getting involved in local government and looking after people effectively, efficiently and scientifically.  That is worth looking at.</P>
    <P>In Dublin city because of the size of the local government areas and because of their importance in terms of political advantage and involvement it simply is not possible for most Deputies to surrender their interest in their city council or local government seats.  Given the multi-seat constituency arrangement and the fact that some of the electoral areas in Dublin city are the same size as a three-seater constituency it would be political suicide for some Deputies to surrender their seats on local authorities.  There are many TDs who probably would be very happy to do so.  In my view, in local government reform we should not just encourage Deputies not to have to stand for election to local government but rather arrange our affairs in such a way that we can also encourage those who are elected to local government not to want to seek election to the national Parliament.  There are many people who are specifically interested in local government affairs.</P>

      <P>Deputy David Molony has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the case of Brendan Flynn, an Irish national at present in a Spanish prison on hunger strike.  The Deputy has 20 minutes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>I am particularly grateful to you, Sir, for the opportunity to raise the case of Brendan Flynn here this afternoon. <Col N="2556" /> I want to thank the Minister of State for making himself available for this question.</P>
      <P>I do not suppose any person can be in as lonely a position as to be in some sort of trouble in a foreign country, to be in prison, away from one's family, from people one knows and trusts and finding oneself in a state of complete and utter uncertainty, and the only thing that is certain is the possibility that one might be detained for up to four years in prison before either being released or having one's case tried.</P>
      <P>I became interested in this matter in the past few days because I heard a journalist being interviewed about it on radio. When I looked into it I was surprised to see that the matter had been highlighted in different respects over the past several months.  I have to say that I think Brendan Flynn is fortunate in that he has at least one friend of a very genuine nature in this country, that is journalist Sam Smith, who has pursued the case relentlessly and who has been largely responsible for all the publicity this case has generated here particularly recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Brendan Flynn is an Irish national, in his forties, from Dublin.  On his own admission I understand he is a former member of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I gather that he was involved in property dealing in Dublin.  In 1981 he became interested in investing in a time-sharing apartment complex in Lanzarote in Spain and invested a substantial amount of money in it.  Having established this complex he had the difficulty of managing and looking after it.  But he met with one, Yves Dorval, who was a property consultant or manager in Lanzarote.  For his own bad luck Flynn got involved with this man.  Over a period of time they interacted as partners together in this business.  It became apparent after some time that Mr. Dorval was pocketing more than his share of the profits of the business. In March 1984, when the situation had become intolerable, Brendan Flynn confronted the problem, met with Dorval, but failed to solve the problem. He then instituted civil legal proceedings <Col N="2557" /> in Spain.  Some time later he returned home and was in Dublin on 2 July 1984 when Mr. Dorval's body was found and it was evident that he had been strangled.</P>
    <P>I do not want to get involved in the minutiae of the evidence that is there or not there about how this man was killed. I just want to put on the record of the House that the evidence there is extremely doubtful in many respects. Theories have been built on very insubstantial investigations.  There are two police forces in Spain.  I can only say, to my astonishment, that among themselves they differ very substantially as to what happened or how this man could have been killed and indeed as to who killed him.  But which or whether, when Brendan Flynn was in Dublin and heard about the death of his former business partner he flew out to Spain on, I think, 18 August 1984.  He went to Lanzarote and on 20 August 1984 he was arrested there by one of the police forces, the Policia Nacional. They brought him back to Plaza del Ingles and interviewed him.  I understand they gave him an opportunity to answer some questions that related to the murder of Mr. Dorval, that the answers he gave them were not regarded as satisfactory and, as a result of this, he was brutally treated.</P>
    <P>I understand he has given particular details of the way he was treated to the Minister for Foreign Affairs by way of letter that was somehow transmitted.  I am not going to go into the details of the way in which he was treated.  It is there on record, it has been published in magazines and in papers and I understand the information is available to the Minister. I would urge anybody interested in the case to take a look at his description of how he was ill-treated by the police.  The fact that he was ill-treated can be substantiated by independent evidence.  The police force who found Dorval's body, the Guardia Civil &mdash; because they found the body &mdash; should have had responsibility for conducting the investigation into the case.  When Flynn was arrested by the other police force in Spain, in the ordinary course, he should have been handed over to the Guardia Civil but that <Col N="2558" /> did not happen.  When the Guardia Civil did seek to get Flynn back into their custody the first police force made a curious application to court to ensure that they would be allowed continue their investigation into the case.  Apparently their application was refused and the Guardia Civil were astonished, when they eventually got custody of Flynn, because of his condition.  It was evident that he had been badly beaten.  I might say that I understand he is still suffering from severe physical injuries as a result of the treatment and, no doubt, considerable mental anguish from the treatment he received.  But the second police force were so concerned at his condition that, before they would take any responsibility for him, they had him examined by a medical doctor who apparently certified to the Guardia Civil's satisfaction that they were not in any way responsible and that he was in that condition when he was given into their hands.</P>
    <P>I say that because the House will be well aware that in this country allegations can be made from time to time that people are mistreated or brutally treated at the hands of the Garda, police force or whatever.  In this case I would suggest to the Minister of State present that there is independent evidence that establishes beyond question that, at someone's hands, while in the custody of the Spanish authorities, Flynn was mistreated.  However, he is not now in the custody of the police.  He is in the custody of the prison authorities in Spain and he has been there since August last.</P>
    <P>The question of evidence against him presents somewhat of a problem because there is not a great deal of it.  Unquestionably Flynn had motive &mdash; there is no doubt in the world about that.  He is not charged with actually committing the murder.  He could not be charged with that because he was in Dublin when the murder occurred but he is charged with financing and arranging it &mdash; I should imagine a pretty difficult thing to prove under any code of law.  There is no evidence because under the Spanish system &mdash; I have the benefit of seeing this and of speaking to Flynn's lawyer in Spain &mdash; the <Col N="2559" /> court must receive from the prosecution a statement outlining the evidence they have.  This document is full of suggestions as to the motive Flynn might have had. Obviously, given the history of the case, there are loads of reasons to show that Flynn had motive but there is no solid evidence to associate Flynn in any way with the murder of Dorval.</P>
    <P>One magazine published in Ireland today lists 16 Irish people who, between them, were ripped off to the tune of £750,000 by the deceased Mr. Dorval, any or all of whom had the same motive, namely, that this man Dorval fiddled money from them.  Other than that motive, there is simply no evidence available. Flynn made a statement to the Spanish authorities under duress, having gone through the appalling treatment that he evidently went through.  In that statement he did not in any sense admit guilt.  While under the greatest pressure imaginable, he maintained his innocence and, to this day, stoutly maintains his innocence.  I cannot say if he is guilty but from the documents I have seen &mdash; and I have seen as much as can be seen &mdash; and from the evidence available &mdash; there is no evidence which could possibly convict him and this is why he has gone on hunger strike.  He has been on hunger strike now for 15 days, has lost an awful lot of weight and is suffering mentally and physically from the conditions in which he finds himself.</P>
    <P>Flynn's biggest problem is that under Spanish law he can be held without trial for up to four years.  It is extraordinary that any country could have such a law.  I made inquiries to see if any other country had such laws and I cannot trace any. The continental system differs from ours &mdash; we had a lot of discussion on this during the Criminal Justice Bill &mdash; and they can hold people for a lot longer than we do, but four years is stunning.  This is not a throwback to a law of decades ago; it was introduced a few years ago.  At that time the limitation was two and a half years but I understand it was increased to four years because of the problems the Spanish authorities had with the Basque <Col N="2560" /> Separatists and this was a way of controlling terrorism.</P>
    <P>There is no evidence of any worth or value against Flynn and that situation has not changed since 20 August last when he was arrested.  He is faced with the bleak prospect of remaining in the hands of the Spanish authorities in prison for up to four years.  If an Irish national is mistreated by the authorities of any country, it is incumbent on the Government to make the strongest representations and objections.  I am sure that the Minister for Foreign Affairs has already made representations in this regard, but when someone is held indefinitely without evidence or a trial it calls for something outstanding in terms of effort.  Thousands of Irish people travel to Spain every year on holidays and they should know how they could be treated if they were arrested.</P>
    <P>I am not convinced that Brendan Flynn is guilty but, even if he is, it is completely intolerable that an Irish national should be treated in this way.  Under our system if a person was held for that length of time without evidence, the case would be thrown out.  When the Garda cannot produce a book of evidence after a few months &mdash; it obviously varies from case to case &mdash; the person to whom the case relates will be released.  If he is not, there is an application for <i>habeas corpus</i> to the High Court and undoubtedly that court would release him.  This man cannot do anything about his position and the only certainty he has is that he might have to remain there for four years from the time of his arrest before his case is dealt with. Irish people going to Spain should be aware of the facts in this regard because anyone could be arrested for an offence. Mr. Flynn has been very badly treated by the Spanish authorities and we should acquaint holidaymakers going to Spain of that fact.</P>
    <P>If the Spanish authorities will not take seriously the representations made by the Irish Government and will not respond quickly, we should convince Irish people that they should not go to Spain.  The Spanish know the value of foreign tourists and should treat them properly.  Mr. <Col N="2561" /> Flynn was certainly guilty of keeping bad company &mdash; I am not referring to his former association with Fianna Fáil &mdash; but to the fact that he was obviously associating with Dorval who was, to say the least, an unsavoury character.  By any standards, however, his human rights are being disregarded and that must stop.</P>
    <P>I will be following up this case in an other respect, even if Mr. Flynn is released tomorrow.  I do not believe that Spain's accession to the European Community should go through until their laws are changed.  I accept they are a democracy now, but it is not so long since they were a dictatorship.  Perhaps at times we pay lip service to human rights, but we must ensure that laws like that are excised from the statute book of Spain before they are admitted to the Community.</P>
    <P>I am sure that the Minister of State made representations about this case but something more must be done to show our complete dissatisfaction at the way in which Brendan Flynn was treated.  If the Spanish authorities do not react, we should bring this matter further.  They should try Flynn or release him.</P>

      <P>I fully appreciate the concern expressed by Deputy Molony, which is shared by the Government.

I assure Deputy Molony and the House that everything possible is being done by the Government in regard to Mr. Flynn's situation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Irish Consul visited Mr. Flynn shortly after his arrest and numerous times since.  An official of the Irish Embassy in Madrid also visited him, as late as last week.  The embassy have been in regular contact with Mr. Flynn's lawyers in Spain.  In principle, this is a matter for the courts in Spain in which it is not possible to intervene.  We cannot interfere with judicial proceedings in another country.  Nevertheless, the embassy in Madrid made representations to the Spanish Foreign Ministry and has spoken to the police and the judicial authorities <Col N="2562" /> concerned.  We obtained a certificate of good conduct from the Garda in relation to Mr. Flynn which we passed on to the Spanish authorities.</P>
    <P>It would not be helpful to Mr. Flynn to divulge the nature of the concern or the manner in which we expressed it but I assure the House that we are doing everything possible to speed up the reasolution of this case.  We are concerned about the possibility of certain prejudicial information which may have been given to the Spanish police about Mr. Flynn. Deputy Molony made certain references to maltreatment of Mr. Flynn.  As I mentioned, our officials in Spain have been in close contact with Mr. Flynn's lawyers. In the light of our discussions with them. I am concerned that anything we say in regard to such allegations might be prejudicial to Mr. Flynn.  I say that while giving due weight to the concern very properly expressed by Deputy Molony and bearing in mind that our main preoccupation at present is to ensure a swift and speedy resolution of the case on the basis, we hope, of Mr. Flynn's protestation of total innocence.  We are very concerned with the possibility that Mr. Flynn could be detained indefinitely.  Following a visit from one of our officials from the embassy to the Canary Islands last week, further representations have been made by our embassy in Madrid.  Our latest information is that Mr. Flynn's case will receive priority treatment and that we may expect it to be referred to the High Court next month.  I hesitate to say anything further at this stage because of a genuine concern that anything I might say could be prejudicial to Mr. Flynn in his present situation.  But I wish to assure the House that from the very beginning, from the moment the matter was brought to our attention, we gave the case full attention, both by way of a visit from our consul and of visits by officials from our embassy in Madrid and these visits were followed by the continuing representations I have outlined.  I hope that as a result of the action that has been taken there will be a resolution of the problem in the near future and that this will lead to Mr. Flynn's early release.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2563" /> I should clarify the reference to the possible prejudicial effect on Mr. Flynn of statements made by me in this House. I would refer to discussions my officials have had with Mr. Flynn's lawyer.  Our view is that we must take considerable note of the advice of the lawyer as to the tactics and strategy he intends adopting in the conduct of the case.  On that basis, I do not wish to say anything that would interfere in any way with the strategy of Mr. Flynn's lawyer.</P>

In that situation I must take into account very seriously the views expressed by the lawyers.  I could not do anything worse than to say something that would prejudice Mr. Flynn and his lawyers in their presentation of the case.</P>
      <P>The situation then is that keeping in touch with Mr. Flynn and his lawyers and having made the strongest possible representations to the authorities in Spain, we are hopeful of an early resolution of this case followed by the early release of Mr. Flynn on the basis of his protestation of innocence being upheld by the Spanish judicial authorities.</P>

Ireland will also mark the day by informing the UN Secretary General of our voluntary contributions for 1985 to four UN funds to aid the victims of apartheid: UN Trust Fund for South Africa, £25,000; UN Educational and Training Programme for Southern Africa, £25,000; UN Fund for Namibia, £21,000; UN Trust Fund for Publicity against Apartheid, £1,000.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. J. Bruton)</NameTxt>
      <P>The reduction in VAT rates applied to a wide variety of products and services including newspapers, electrical and other household goods and hotel charges.  The full reductions due in the cover prices of newspapers were not passed on to the consumer as the newspaper publishers and distributors implemented price <Col N="2512" /> increases from 1 March 1985 which offset in some cases the full VAT reduction. While I expressed to the Irish publishers my disappointment at the timing of these increases, I had, in deciding not to apply my powers under the Prices Acts, to take into account the financial position of the industry which has for some time past been exempted from detailed price control.</P>
      <P>In regard to hotel and other tourism related charges I am advised that the relevant sectors of the tourism industry have agreed to reduce their prices by 6.8 per cent which is the equivalent of the appropriate VAT reduction applied.  In so far as the many other products are concerned the indications are that traders have generally passed on the VAT reductions. As the Deputy may appreciate, however, there is a wide variety of items involved here, with many brands and models sold in many thousands of distribution outlets.  Because of the highly competitive nature of the market most of the items concerned have not been subject to detailed price control.  Few complaints about failures to pass on the VAT reductions have been received and, with the notable exception of newspaper cover prices, very few of these were, on investigation, found to be substantiated. In some cases it was found that the reductions due had in fact been implemented prior to 1 March.  The National Prices Commission will continue to monitor the situation and have, through surveys undertaken some time prior to 1 March 1985, established generally prevailing prices for a range of these products against which current prices following the VAT reductions can be compared.  The Priceline offices will continue to investigate any complaints received.</P>

      <P>Galway County Council have completed stage 1 of the mid-Galway regional water supply scheme. This is a public scheme involving the development of a stream at Danganbeg Wood and the provision of headworks at a cost of approximately £1.5 million, of which £0.5 million has been recouped from the EC under the FEOGA western package.  The design capacity of the headworks is 950,000 gallons, per day.  While information on all the areas and houses capable of being served by the headworks is not readily available to my Department, it is estimated that stage 1 of the scheme will ultimately benefit some 2,000 houses and associated farms throughout the mid-Galway region including those in the proposed mid-Galway group scheme area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The mid-Galway group have sought approval to grants and a special contribution in respect of the first phase of their proposed group scheme development which will bring water supplies to 450 houses and associated farms in an area between Abbeyknockmoy and Monivea, running towards Coolarne and the Abbey-Ryehill.  The provision of the <Col N="2514" /> group scheme will enable water to be supplied to approximately 850 other houses and associated farms in the vicinity and designs were received recently from the group for a second phase of the group scheme to serve 60 houses and 140 farms.  The group propose as part of the first phase to lay the large distribution mains which are necessary to provide water supplies to other areas at a later date.  Galway County Council, however, have revived their earlier proposal to lay these distribution mains as stage 2 of the regional scheme.  This proposal is under examination in my Department and I hope to make a decision on the matter in the near future.</P>

      <P>It is not possible at this stage to provide an estimate of foreign interest payments by the Government and by semi-State bodies in 1985.  This will depend, in part, on the level of foreign borrowing during 1985.  The increase in the value of the US dollar against the Irish pound between 31 December 1984 and 12 March 1985 is estimated to have added approximately £22 million to the cost of interest payments in 1985 on the Government foreign debt outstanding at 31 December 1984 and approximately £4 million to the cost of interest payments by semi-State companies in 1985 on their foreign debt outstanding at 31 December 1984.  Extra costs or savings during the remainder of the year will depend on exchange rates at the times when interest payments are due.</P>

      <P>Following a routine review of the old age pension entitlements of the person concerned, it was found that there had been an increase in her means since <Col N="2519" /> the date of the last assessment. Accordingly, it was decided that she is entitled to an old age pension at the weekly rate of £23.30 from 16 November 1984.  This is the rate to which she is entitled having regard to the assessment of her means, consisting of the weekly value of rent from a public house, intestacy interest in a holding and capital. The appropriate pension book payable from 22 February 1985 issued on 25 February 1985 and a payable order covering arrears of pension due from 16 November 1984 to 21 February 1985 issued on 4 March 1985.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare the reason a person (details supplied) in County Wexford was refused unemployment benefit; the reason the data submitted on her behalf to prove that she was available for work was not acceptable to his Department; and the reason the standard six weeks penalty of non-payment of benefit was not applied in her case as she is receiving no unemployment benefit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Entitlement to unemployment benefit is subject to the condition that a claimant must be fully available for work and must be genuinely seeking work.  Where a claim for unemployment benefit is disallowed on the grounds that the applicant is not available for work the disallowance stands for as long as she remains unavailable for work.  There is accordingly no standard six weeks penalty in such cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The unemployment benefit claim of the person concerned was disallowed by a deciding officer on the grounds that she was not fully available for work.  She appealed against the disallowance and attended an oral hearing of her case on 22 February 1985.  The appeals officer also decided that she was not available for employment.  She continued to sign the unemployment register and her entitlement to unemployment benefit is at present being reviewed in the light of her availability for full time employment and <Col N="2520" /> what efforts she is making to get employment from 23 February 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The qualifying age for retirement pension was fixed at 65 when the scheme was introduced in 1970 as that age had become the norm for retirement from most employments.  The qualifying age for old age pensions remained at 70 years until 1973 and was progressively reduced to its present level of 66 years over the period to 1977.  A retirement age of 65 years is still standard in many occupational pension schemes.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The issue of retirement age, including <Col N="2523" /> its reduction or the introduction of flexibility, will be dealt with in the framework for a national pension plan which the Government intends to publish later this year.  The Commission on Social Welfare may also make some recommendations in this area.</P>
    <P>While it is difficult to estimate the additional take-up, particularly in the light of the current practice in occupational pension schemes, an extra 17,000 people might claim a retirement pension from the Department of Social Welfare if the qualifying age was reduced from 65 to 60 years.  Taking account of the effects on tax and PRSI income as well as the direct expenditure effects, the net additional cost is estimated at about £59 million in a full year.  Unless part of that cost were met by an increase in the PRSI rate the entire cost would fall on the Exchequer.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The free electricity allowance, free telephone rental allowance and free television licence schemes apply to persons aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare pension, a British or Northern Ireland retirement pension or an ordinary Garda widow's pension.  Persons under 66 years of age, who are in receipt of blind or invalidity pensions or disabled person's maintenance allowance may also qualify.  The schemes do not apply to British or Northern Ireland invalidity pensioners of whom, it is estimated, 3,300 are resident in this country.  There are practical difficulties in relation to the extension of these schemes to include this category because of the difference between the Irish and British invalidity pension schemes.  Any such extension would, in any event, have significant cost implications and there are no proposals at this time to extend the schemes in this way.</P>
