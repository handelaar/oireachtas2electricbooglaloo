    <Speaker pid="GarrettFitzgerald" hpid="The Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to speak briefly at the outset of this discussion in order to reject unequivocally allegations that this Government seek, have any intention of, or would tolerate, a politicisation of RTE.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On this subject I have a very strong view, which I have held since the establishment of RTE as our national broadcasting service.  I believe that it is of vital importance that RTE be free from political control, influence or bias &mdash; that it be <Col N="1804" /> as independent as we can make it.  It is not, and should never be, an arm of Government policy.  On this point I found myself at the time and remain in disagreement with the statement by the former Taoiseach, Mr. Seán Lemass, that RTE should be an &ldquo;instrument of public policy&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>No Government of which I am leader will take any step that will weaken the independence of RTE.  That means that any members that we will appoint to the Authority in replacement of existing members will be, and be seen to be, independent.  It means also that we shall expect that Authority &mdash; and I here and now make this clear &mdash; to approach the appointment of the next Director-General in the manner best calculated to ensure that the person appointed is the best qualified for the job, as that job emerges from the major consultancy study that we are initiating.  In this connection I want to express the hope that the procedures that the new authority will adopt for the selection of the new Director-General will, as I understand was the case on occasions previous to this, include in the actual selection process itself an element independent of the members of the Authority.</P>
    <P>The House and the general public should not, and I believe will not, underestimate the importance of the review of RTE now about to be undertaken by consultants on behalf of the Government. The role of RTE in the years ahead will necessarily be very different from what it has been in the past.  We are moving into a situation in which there may be satellite broadcasting, direct and/or by cable, into and possibly out of this State, as well as new local and community radio, on a whole range of new wavelengths being allocated to us over the next five years and a new longwave RTE radio service reaching to and perhaps beyond Britain.</P>
    <P>It is vital that our national broadcasting service should be prepared for this new situation which may well involve a measure of re-orientation so that some of its <Col N="1805" /> services may reach beyond the confines of the State.  RTE have provided a very fine service during the past quarter of a century, given the small size and resources of our community.  Many criticisms of them take little or no account of the contrast between the resources available to them and those available to the broadcasting services in neighbouring Britain &mdash; one of the best endowed such services in the world.  At the same time there is concern about aspects of their efficiency and productivity.  It is right that these issues should be examined impartially, so that we be assured that, within the resources available, they are attaining standards of service and of productivity matching those of other comparable broadcasting systems.</P>
    <P>The chairman of the Authority was notified by the Minister at the beginning of February that the Minister would be making an important statement on broadcasting within a matter of weeks and was requested at that early stage not to nominate a new Director-General, a request which was repeated when the Minister told the chairman of his proposed statement last week and of his intention to engage consultants.  The Minister indicated on both occasions that he would discuss the implications of the statement he would be making with the Authority.  I regret that, despite the early intimation by the Minister, the Authority nevertheless decided to proceed in this matter before the discussion had taken place.</P>
    <P>The validity of the position of the Government in this matter will be clear when the new Authority are appointed, and when the consultant's report becomes available, providing a basis upon which the new Authority can make a considered decision on the type of person required to head this organisation in the testing years to come.  I am content to let the Government's actions stand the test of public opinion as this situation unfolds.  But I wished to make unambiguously clear to this House today where the Government stand, and where I stand <Col N="1806" /> personally, in the matter of the independence of RTE from political influence over their operations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach's statement is sheer hypocrisy.  He has already appointed one of the most prominent handlers of Fine Gael as a member of the existing RTE Authority and I challenge him to refute that.  The Taoiseach has also stated that all the new members of the Authority will have no political involvement. Why then has he already appointed Mr. Frank Flannery, a leading Fine Gael handler, as a member of the RTE Authority?  This action has already undermined the Taoiseach's statement in the House today and will be seen as a sham.</P>
      <P>The Taoiseach stated in Sligo last Sunday that he supported the intervention of the Minister for Communications into the legitimate appointment of a Director-General of RTE and he made that statement before he knew the name which was presented to the Authority last Monday.  A man had already been legitimately selected to fill the position of Director-General of RTE in accordance with the 1960 Act and the Taoiseach has undermined the authority and integrity of RTE by declaring his support for the Minister.</P>
      <P>The critical issue at stake here today is the appointment of a Director-General of RTE and the future of public service broadcasting.  I wish to state clearly that Minister Mitchell has breached the terms and spirit of the Broadcasting Authority Act, 1960, and has interfered in a blatant political way to frustrate the legitimate appointment of a Director-General to RTE.  Under section 11 of the 1960 Act the duly appointed Authority shall</P>
      <P>...from time to time appoint a person to be the Chief Executive Officer of the Authority and such person shall be known, and is in this Act referred to, as the Director General. </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1807" /> The important word is &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  The Minister released a letter of 1 March 1985 addressed to Mr. Fred O'Donovan, chairman of the RTE Authority which stated:</P>
    <P>I confirm that no further action regarding the selection of any name for the post of Director General should be taken by the Authority. </P>
    <P>This is blatant involvement in the affairs of RTE and undermines their honesty and integrity.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister released a letter of 1 March 1985 addressed to Mr. Fred O'Donovan, chairman of the RTE Authority which stated:</P>
      <P>I confirm that no further action regarding the selection of any name for the post of Director General should be taken by the Authority. </P>
      <P>This is blatant involvement in the affairs of RTE and undermines their honesty and integrity.  The Minister's intervention came as a bombshell to the Authority at their meeting in Cork on Friday last, 1 March.  This interference was blatant, political and illegal.  If this Authority had complied with the Minister's directive they would have undermined the impartiality and integrity of the Authority.  The Authority, at their meeting on Monday, 4 March rejected the Minister's intervention and have recommended a name for the post of Director-General in accordance with section 11 of the 1960 Act.  It is the solemn duty of the Minister for Communications to give the necessary consent to this appointment in accordance with section 13 of the Act.  In a statement in <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> of 4 November 1984 it was, in the course of an interview stated:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Jim Mitchell insists it would be absolutely wrong to interfere with the <Col N="1808" /> Authority's right to make the appointment, maybe this will show that there is no political involvement in who gets the job. </P>
    <P>I call on the Minister today to honour this comment.</P>
    <P>The reasons for the Minister's decision to direct the Authority do not stand up to scrutiny.  For over two and a quarter years he has not brought forward a White Paper or legislation for satellite broadcasting or for independent local radio. The Government document <i>Building on Reality 1985-1987</i> makes no reference whatsoever to proposed developments in RTE in relation to staff or financial targets.</P>
    <P>RTE have reduced staff from 2,367 in 1980 to 2,246 in 1983 and overall turnover of RTE is now £62 million compared to £33 million in 1979.  The Comptroller and Auditor General examined and approved all accounts, as required under the 1960 Act.</P>
    <P>Over the years RTE have been subjected to more reports and investigations than any other semi-State company, including the Broadcasting Review Group and the 1981 Scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Commercial and semi-State Bodies, and the recent appointment of consultants to examine RTE.</P>
    <P>To leave RTE without a Director-General until the Minister appoints his own national handlers Authority in six months' time is placing the future of RTE in jeopardy. It will be a ship without a captain and will seriously undermine the integrity and impartiality of RTE for the future.</P>
    <P>I believe that the background to this interference by the Minister goes back to 1983 when the Taoiseach appointed a Minister of State at his own Department, Deputy Ted Nealon, as Minister of State at the Department of Posts and Telegraphs with responsibility for, as the Taoiseach said on 22 February 1983 in Dáil Éireann, RTE and broadcasting generally.  Is this special responsibility the undermining of the integrity of the Authority?</P>
    <P>Fianna Fáil placed a motion on current affairs broadcasting before this House on <Col N="1809" /> 1 March 1983, two years to the day, when the Minister illegally intervened in RTE. At that time I expressed grave concern regarding the appointment of Deputy Ted Nealon to this sensitive position with responsibility for broadcasting and RTE.</P>
    <P>You may recall, a Cheann Comhairle, that my remarks in relation to particular national handlers were regarded as unparliamentary, but what I said then is now coming to pass.  There are propagandists in the Government and, as far as they are concerned, the name of the game is propaganda at all costs.  The Minister of State, Deputy Nealon, is in the right place to interfere with the running of RTE and we now see the fruits of his appointment.</P>
    <P>In Volume 340, column 1424 of the Official Report of 1 March 1983, the Minister for Communications stated:</P>
    <P>It is vitally important that politicians, of whatever party, should not interfere with RTE in the discharge of their duty. </P>
    <P>In column 1431 of the same volume he stated:</P>
    <P>A freedom which subjects RTE's detailed actions to daily questioning by the Minister cannot be a real freedom, or be conducive to the aim of the Act to create a public service broadcasting organisation independent of detailed controls.  The Authority are, after all, a group of respected individuals appointed by the Government to represent the public trust. </P>
    <P>The Minister went on to say it was vital that RTE, in the discharge of their duties, be removed completely from political interference or pressure and that it was very important that Government be particularly sensitive to the need not to interfere with or unduly pressure RTE.  How do the Minister's statements ring in 1985?</P>
    <P>At column 1440, the Minister said:</P>
    <P>I took a note of something Deputy Leyden said.  This is an interpretation of what he said: that my own party would not tolerate any interference.  I <Col N="1810" /> applaud and fully subscribe to those statements. </P>
    <P>I call on the Minister now to honour those solemn commitments given in Dáil Éireann and to approve the appointment of a new Director-General of RTE.  In accordance with section 11 of the 1960 Act, a name has been forwarded by the Authority to the Minister in this regard. It is your duty and your responsibility to duly authorise the appointment.  Your failure to do so would be seen for all time as the undermining of the honesty, integrity and impartiality of RTE.</P>
    <P>We are talking about a very important organisation who were set up by the Oireachtas to discharge their duties in a most impartial, non-partisan and political manner.  If you reject the name put forward by the independent RTE Authority, the new Authority&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Leyden</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;appointed by the Government will be seen as a total political organisation who will appoint a totally political person so as to ensure that the Government will have an easy time from the national broadcasting organisation. At all times we will oppose any such interference with broadcasting.  We will stand by the principles that we have honoured down through the years.  Fianna Fáil have never yet rejected a name put forward by the Authority.  Successive Fianna Fáil Ministers have always appointed the person whose name was put forward by the Authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the light of the requests that have been made to the Minister from this side of the House, and I presume also by some fair-minded Members on the Government side, I appeal to the Minister to comply with the Act and to appoint the person whose name has been forwarded to him by RTE.  Surely the Labour Party must be asking if what the Government are doing is in the interest of justice and fair play.  Is it reasonable that the most experienced personnel in RTE should be put in the situation of seeking a position <Col N="1811" /> which does not exist?  For the next six months RTE will be without leadership and that leaves them in a dangerous situation.</P>

      <P>The series of statements made to the House this morning will enable us to reduce some of the hysteria that has been generated by the Fianna Fáil in the past few days. One can only speculate as to the real motivation for that hysteria.  It is regrettable that the Leader of the Opposition who was so vociferous in orchestrating the hysteria is not here now.  His comments should have been interesting.</P>
      <P>This Government, of which Labour is a partner, have a very good record in relation to RTE unlike the party for which Deputy Leyden is spokesman on these matters.  We did not seek at any time during our terms in office to sack the Authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Unlike Fianna Fáil, we did not sack the Authority for political reasons even if what was done by Fianna Fáil was in accordance with the Act. Because at that time the Act was deemed to be deficient in respect of the independence of the Authority, a Labour Minister in the 1973-77 Coalition Government introduced amending legislation to ensure that the political interference that had been engaged in by Fianna Fáil would not be repeated.</P>

      <P>As has been endorsed by the Taoiseach's comments, the winners in this debate will be the Irish people. The reason they must win and must be seen to win is that the Fourth Estate is an integral part of any mature democracy. Because of the kind of technological developments to which the Taoiseach referred and of which Deputy Leyden is very much aware, broadcasting is in a period of transformation, a transformation of unique dimensions.  Therefore, it is only right and proper for the Government to appoint consultants to review the implications of all this so as to ensure that whoever emerges as director-general of RTE, as a consequence of a proper process of selection, will be the one suited best, not for the job as it was but for the job as it will be in the light of these changes.  It is clear that something has gone desperately wrong on the Fianna Fáil side because otherwise there would be no excuse for the hysterical response we have had from them in the past few days.</P>
      <P>We have taken the right course of action in relation to considering the way in which broadcasting is likely to develop and in the matter of ensuring that the Fourth Estate which is so critical to the operation and maintenance of democracy is maintained.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1813" /> Down through the years there has been in this House a tradition of which Deputy Leyden must be aware but which, in common with other members of the Opposition, he chooses to ignore in this instance, that is, the tradition of not attacking people who are not in a position to defend themselves.  We here enjoy certain privileges in terms of law.  We all put ourselves before the electorate.  Sometimes we fail, sometimes we succeed, but we are willing candidates.  However, there are many others in society who give their services in a wide range of voluntary and public service organisations and who do so for little or no reward but frequently at considerable cost to themselves in terms of personal time, time away from their families or their businesses.  This democracy could not function if it were not for the collective contribution of such people.  It has been the tradition always that politicians were responsible for any organisation who were accountable to the Oireachtas rather than citizens who happen to be members of organisations, boards or authorities.  The selective attack by Fianna Fáil on one member of the RTE authority within the hysterical framework to which I have referred is not only in breach of that tradition but is grossly unfair to the individual involved because of his inability to counter the charges.  He possesses neither the platform nor the immunity that Deputy Leyden possesses in this House by virtue of the democratic system.</P>

      <P>I think my memory of the Official Report will bear out my assertion. We have made a statement already about the importance of broadcasting. We have already speculated as to why the hysteria generated by Fianna Fáil on this matter has been so intense.  We have already talked about the changes that took place at another time when a previous Fianna Fáil Government decided that they would unilaterally sack the entire Authority.  I suppose in those days it was acting under the dictum enunciated by one of the founding members of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Seán Lemass&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The attack on a particular individual in the way it was launched and the manner in which it has been pursued this morning is contrary to the interests of our society and is grossly unfair to the individual involved.  I presume that in Fianna Fáil there are elements of decency and even though they may currently be regarded as unbecoming to the conduct of that party, I hope those members will come forward and disclaim and disown the kind of virulent attack that has been launched on one member of that Authority when the Authority are collectively responsible for their decisions.  It is clear that a raw nerve somewhere has been touched to great effect and the protestations of Fianna Fáil do not match their actions when they were in Government.</P>

      <P>I am glad we have had an opportunity of saying a few words on this very important matter, on this famous confluence of events, the meeting of the waters, cumar na dtrí n-uisce, which suddenly appears when the RTE Authority are about to appoint a Director-General.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We know that the intervention of the Minister is due to one thing, that the Authority by right of the obligation laid on them by section 11 of the 1960 Act <Col N="1817" /> were about to appoint a Director-General. There was much fluttering in the dovecotes and the decision was to stop it on the pretext of having consultants brought in.  It is as plain as the sun in the sky that what the Taoiseach said is wrong, that he did not want to politicise RTE. Politicisation is really the name of the game.  We are in an Orwellian situation where when you go to politicise you announce to the public you are depoliticising. This is what the Taoiseach has done.  Nobody in this House, by tradition or by conviction, has more of a belief in the power of the media and particularly of television than the Taoiseach.  This is so to the extent that it took him from his fireside on a famous occasion to run down to Donnybrook to participate in a programme in order to advertise himself. His father who did this State some service, and I do not want to speak critically about him, was put in charge of propaganda at the time of the Civil War and the unfortunate state prevailing in the country then.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I deny categorically the contention of the Minister which was repeated here by the Taoiseach almost in identical words that the purpose is not to politicise: in fact, the words are so identical they make us suspicious of their origin.  We are told that the purpose is to diminish political interference.  It is the direct opposite.  It is turning the facts on their head and this House should know that.  That is a particular <i>modus operandi</i> now employed by people who know how to impact on the media.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Factors such as the frequency spectrum expansion, proposals for the Irish satellite network and the report of the cable <Col N="1818" /> systems committee are the burden of the case made by the Minister and the Taoiseach for the setting up of this consultancy committee for RTE.  I ask the House to note that all these three factors are in the area of technology and it is important that we should dwell on that because the person who has been named by the Authority as the future Director-General is coming precisely from that area.  There is a total lack of logic to say that the appointment of a Director-General must be held up because three technological areas are involved and need further discussion and consideration. That brings up the whole idea of the engineer and the technologist not being a suitable type of person for this kind of job.  I thought that C.P. Snow in his famous The Two Cultures lecture and the controversy that followed it had settled that long ago.  The fact that a man has engineering or technological qualifications does not exclude his competence in the area of programming, which seems to be the basis of a lot of the controversy, internally at least, in RTE, and has been for some time.  I ask the Members of the House who want to refresh their memories, to read the Snow lecture and the controversy about it.</P>
    <P>We appointed Dr. Todd Andrews as Chairman of the RTE Authority and he had something very interesting to say about that sphere in his autobiography. He is the man we appointed and, I am glad to say, who resisted interference from a Fianna Fáil Minister when the occasion demanded.  He gives a very good account of the competence of engineers in the administration and in those particular fields in the autobiography.  I think that is well worth reading in this context too.  It is unfortunate that this man who, when he could be a member of a political party, was a member of the Labour Party, should be brought into this controversy and politicised in this way.  When I listened to the mealymouthed windbaggery from the Minister for Labour, nobody could characterise it as anything else because he had no speech; he was inviting interruptions and he had nothing <Col N="1819" /> substantial to say &mdash; I realised why a man like this is being vilified.</P>
    <P>In today's paper there is a substantial article on the controversy by Mr. Eoghan Harris of RTE.  Mr. Harris is a highly intelligent and articulate man, a supporter of The Workers' Party as far as I know, but the substance of his article is that this action by the Minister is political and nothing but political and the motivation behind it is political.  He says RTE is a political animal with everyone pushing his or her political philosophy.  He is telling us the view that is accepted by at least some people within RTE.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>The paper is what they used to say was the Bantry pig jobbers paper, now owned by Dr. Tony O'Reilly, the <i>Irish Independent</i>, Thursday, 7 March 1985.  In this article Mr. Harris said:</P>
      <P>The Director General of RTE is editor in chief of the most powerful political tool devised by man for reporting and forming political ideas. It's no job for somebody who thinks life is about boatsailing, and then starts screaming for the Dún Laoghaire lifeboat when the seas get rough. </P>
      <P>That is his opinion.  I think that he, like many people in the media, may exaggerate the influence and importance of it.  I personally think newspapers make more of an impact.  If one knows a person's political bias, say, Olivia O'Leary and her bias towards Fine Gael&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>I will refrain from doing that.  What I am saying is that if you know a person's political bias you discount it and I do not think the influence of television is as great as Mr. Harris claims in his article.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When this party were in Government the Minister, Deputy Faulkner, received from the Authority, appointed by a <Col N="1820" /> Coalition Government, a name for Director General.  Without hesitation, without doubt or scruple, he appointed the person whose name was handed to him by the Authority on the basis that irrespective of who appointed the Authority, they were a competent and careful Authority. They recommended a certain person to the Government and that nomination was then accepted by a Fianna Fáil Government.  I suggest that this Minister do the same now.  He should not come here insulting our intelligence with this clap-trap about cable systems, satellite systems, a broader frequency spectrum and so on because nobody believes him. Nobody in his own party, nobody in Government and nobody in the media believes it.  I am instancing what this man says from the heart of the scene that is, that he regards this as a political act, purely a political act, and that is how it will be seen and how it will go down in history.</P>
    <P>In this article he shows his bias towards one man.  By training I would be on the side of the programmer rather than the engineer but my thoughts have been modified considerably in this House in that regard because a person could be a very good programmer but a very poor Director-General.  I want to quote from this article which indicates that the engineer and the technologist versus the programmer is at the basis of this in many minds.</P>
    <P>And most of us in RTE think that after 25 years of broadcasting we are entitled to see how a programmer and not an engineer would function in that job.  In 25 years we have grown our own talent.  These men and women who make editorial decisions have learned human and communication skills that can't be learned from conduit and cable. </P>
    <P>I do not accept the logic of that in the end because the man who is dealing with conduit or cable is not necessarily excluded from a knowledge of human nature.  In fact, it is pushing a very narrow <Col N="1821" /> range on the person who takes one discipline rather than another.  This is at the basis of this dispute.</P>
    <P>One of the most dangerous suggestions that comes out of this is the idea that there should be some kind of élite group &mdash; and may the good God save us from the élitists &mdash; put in charge of RTE.  The Director-General must live in some kind of vaccuum unaffected by anything.  He should live in an ivory tower or take on some kind of demi-god existence.  What we are saying is that there is a lawfully constituted Authority with an obligation as laid down in law, in which this House played its constitutional part in putting it on the Statute Book, and that that Authority are doing something.  I believe the Minister is more open minded about this than are the Taoiseach and some members of the Government.  It is not a correct way to govern the country &mdash; to allow one group in Government to introduce one bit of legislation and then tell them to go away, that the next bit is for the other group.  The contraceptive Bill was Labour legislation and RTE is Fine Gael legislation and they will push their own man regardless of the Labour Party and as far as the RTE Authority are concerned they are not to be involved.  If we cannot stop that sort of thing it is up to us to highlight it and to indicate that in following other Ministers who accepted nominations of a political hue different from theirs, there is a good precedent to follow, and I appeal to the Minister to follow it.</P>

      <P>A whole variety of new developments are emerging in RTE.  One is the very important satellite television, the other is local radio.

      <P>The Government position is straightforward and very public.  They have decided, in the public interest, that the time is right to examine all structures involved in broadcasting with an eye to orderly development in the future.  For the reasons stated it is felt that the appointment of a Director-General should await the process instituted by the Government and this will allow the <Col N="1824" /> consultants to decide on the future structures appropriate to RTE.  The Minister has taken a very wise decision on which he has elaborated in his statement in reply to a Private Notice Question in this House.</P>
      <P>A new era is coming about and it will have an enormous impact on RTE.  They will on the one hand face a much more competitive situation to the extent that they will be in competition with local or community radio and of course additional services of cable television and satellite broadcasting services.  As far as frontiers are concerned in television broadcasting, the national frontiers have disappeared. We will have no control over what is coming in here, nor would we seek such control.  We also have the possibility for the first time of going abroad through our satellite television to other countries. These are the kinds of challenges facing RTE and this is why the decision taken by the Minister to institute an investigation, to appoint consultants is a very wise decision which will lead to better broadcasting and a more efficient and better organised RTE structure.</P>

      <P>RTE if they are to have any real function, if they are to produce a vibrant public broadcasting system must be a highly politically charged institution.  I refer to politics in its general sense, not party politics but political debate and political tension.  This is an important point.  The other point is that any decision made by a Minister, by definition, is political.  What the Minister must avoid is making decisions which are or are seen to be party political in the interest of one party.  On the face of it it seems that the Minister has erred in this regard.  No one will deny that there is a <Col N="1825" /> problem in RTE.  The staff in RTE have been concerned for a considerable time with the direction in which RTE have been going.  The present Chairman of the Authority, Mr. Fred O'Donovan, has interfered in the sphere of programme making to an unprecedented extent&mdash;&mdash;</P>

A further point in relation to this consultancy group is that we now appear to have three groups of consultants dealing with RTE.

We are rapidly reaching a point at which there will be more consultants running around RTE than programmers.</P>

      <P>Some rationalisation of this situation must be brought about.  The context of the decision by the Minister is totally wrong.  It would have <Col N="1826" /> been far better if the Minister had made his decision to review RTE in the context of a review of the whole area of public broadcasting.  The terms of reference given to the group established by the Minister, under the chairmanship of Dr. Ó hEocha, are broad enough in order to do that.</P>
      <P>There is a serious need for a debate on public broadcasting.  Public broadcasting could be a very useful and important element in creating a more tolerant society on this island, just as the newspapers could be part of that development.  If there is over-emphasis on commercialism in RTE, if there is a shift away from the idea of public broadcasting to the idea of commercial broadcasting, then the possibility of our broadcasting system being of benefit to the people on this island is seriously limited.  I should like to suggest a way that may reduce the heat in the debate on this.  Will the Minister not announce the people he proposes to appoint to the new Authority now and show that the people he proposes to appoint are completely non-politically partisan?  That suggestion is worth considering and I ask the Minister to do so right away.</P>

      <P>It is regrettable for the sake of RTE that this debate has to take place because it will do a lot of damage to that organisation which is the bulwark of democracy in the area of public broadcasting. It is the balancing factor between the printed news media, which is in the hands of the private commercial sector.  It is important that the public get a balanced and impartial view of news.  Unfortunately, the Government, and the Minister, sought to interfere in this at a late stage.  It was not hysteria generated by Fianna Fáil that brought this public debate about but the actions of the Minister were in complete and utter disregard for the independence of the RTE Authority as enshrined in the Broadcasting Act, 1960.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I will not attempt to reply to what Minister Quinn said because he did not say very much.  However, there are some interesting and dangerous comments in <Col N="1827" /> the Taoiseach's speech.  I should like to deal with them briefly.  Unfortunately, the debate is not long enough because the issues involved are serious and important.  It is no wonder that the general public look on with serious concern because of the actions of the Government. I have some sympathy with the Minister.  We are all aware of his views on independent broadcasting &mdash; they were outlined by Deputy Leyden this morning &mdash; over many years.  I have sympathy with him in finding himself in a position that was not of his own choosing.  He was pushed into it by others.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach said:</P>
    <P>No Government of which I am leader will take any step that will weaken the independence of RTE. </P>
    <P>The very steps the Government are taking at the last minute by issuing an instruction to the RTE Authority not to proceed with the appointment of a Director-General is a direct intrusion on the independence of RTE as enshrined in the 1960 Act.  Does the Taoiseach understand what the Act means?  The approach by the Taoiseach and the Minister displays a degree of arrogance that, if taken to its logical conclusion, can be dangerous for the independence of public broadcasting here in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer to a number of other interesting items the Taoiseach spoke about.  He said:</P>
    <P>It means also that we shall expect that Authority &mdash; and I here and now make this clear &mdash; to approach the appointment of the next Director General in the manner best calculated to ensure that the person appointed is the best qualified for the job. </P>
    <P>I fully subscribe to the view that the best qualified person should always get the job, but that does not mean that he cannot vote for the political party he wishes to vote for.  If he is the best, he should get the job.</P>
    <P>What is interesting in this case is that the Taoiseach in his speech is casting a reflection on the person nominated by the Authority to get the job, that he is <Col N="1828" /> not the best qualified for the job.  I should like to ask the Government on what value judgment they made their decision and on what value judgment does the Taoiseach's statement follow?  Has the Taoiseach outlined his own judgment, or is it the judgment of outsiders?  Is it, as Deputy Wilson said, the judgment of an elite group?  Is it the judgment of the national handlers?  We want to know how the Taoiseach makes out that the best man was not the man nominated by the Authority?</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach went on to say:</P>
    <P>In this connection I want to express the hope that the procedures that the new Authority will adopt for the selection of the new Director-General will, as I understand was the case on occasions previous to this. </P>
    <P>What is different about the method of selection by the Authority?  As I understand from the chairman of the Authority last night on television, he had discussions with the Minister about the post becoming vacant at the end of March. Everybody knew about the vacancy.  The Minister told the chairman that there would be no interference from him and the job was advertised nationally and internationally.  The Authority nominated the interview board, as is their right, although the Taoiseach does not seem to accept that those procedures are correct.  The procedures are enshrined in legislation.  The interview board proceeded with interviews and called in independent outside management consultants to assist them.  At the end of the day they nominated a person.  What was wrong with those procedures?  The Taoiseach and the Minister must tell us what was wrong with them and tell us his statutory basis for saying anything different.</P>
    <P>I shall now deal with the intervention. The Minister went on record very often to say that he would not interfere, that the appointment would take its course and that he would follow the examples of his predecessors.  In the last 25 years of RTE no Minister of any Government <Col N="1829" /> ever turned down the nominee of the Authority.  The most recent parallel was the name produced by a Coalition-appointed Authority in 1978 to a Fianna Fáil Government.  That name was accepted by the Minister of the day, Deputy Faulkner, without question and that is the way it should continue to be. Why are the smokescreens and red herrings being put forward for changing the system at this stage?  Last December, January or February there was not any talk about the new developments in RTE.  We have known about them for years.  RTE have known about them and have been preparing for them.  Are the Taoiseach and the Minister saying that they do not know what the developments are and are not in a position to take advantage of them?  I ask the Minister to note that the frequencies on satellites were approved as far back as 1977 at the Geneva Convention. The Taoiseach and the Minister have a duty to tell the House if the Authority did not follow impeccably the selection process for a candidate as Director-General.</P>
    <P>The Minister may state that he is going to rely on section 13 to withhold his consent, but I suggest that he think long and hard about the legal implications of that. There is a lot of case law on it.  That section is subservient to the earlier section. If an unsuitable person is appointed the Government have every right to act, but the onus is on the Minister to show in what way the Authority did not act properly and impeccably and in what way they did not carry out their legal responsibilities.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach and the Minister are trying to get us all to believe that the first intervention by the Minister, contrary to what he said to the chairman and in public, was when he sent them a letter asking them to hold back for three or four weeks.  That letter was sent on 1 February.  In the course of the letter he pointed out that an important statement would be issued and he asked the Authoity to suspend all action in the filling of the post in the meantime.  The Authority complied with his views and yet in the <Col N="1830" /> intervening three or four weeks the Authority were subjected to villification in the media about their dilly-dallying and indecision in not appointing a new Director-General, about not bringing that matter forward.  The Authority acted impeccably. At any stage they could have said that they were not responsible, that the Minister was.  They did not do that because they are a responsible Authority and I would not expect anything less from them.  They took the stick on the chin. However, on 1 March the truth became known and now the public really know what happened, that the Minister, on 1 March when the final selection was made of a nominee, sent the letter which Deputy Leyden has already read into the record.  It stated as follows:</P>
    <P>I confirm that no further action regarding the selection of any name for the post of Director-General should be taken by the Authority. </P>
    <P>That is not advice.  That is not a request.  That is a direct instruction, direction or any other word one would like to put on it.  It is in complete contravention of section 11 of the Broadcasting Act.  The Taoiseach said that he would never take action to interfere with the independence of the RTE Authority. What is really at stake is the propriety of the actions of the members of that Authority, the manner in which thety have approached their task and carried out their legal responsibilities.  They have done so impeccably.  It is regrettable that the Taoiseach and the Minister should try to cast any reflection on the way they have done so.</P>
    <P>It is also very regrettable that the reputation of each member of that Authority should be drawn into open debate here.  Those are people chosen to do a job for a very minimal fee, entrusted with ensuring the independence of RTE in the way they carry out their duties.  It is totally regrettable for anybody to try to impute blame to them.  They have stood back and taken criticisms when, if they had been as politically motivated as some have tried to imply here, they would have <Col N="1831" /> attacked the Minister long ago.  The independence of public broadcasting is on the line here, undoubtedly.</P>
    <P>With regard to the appointment of a new Authority, the Taoiseach is telling RTE that the procedures will have to change.  I ask the Minister to confirm in this House if he is going to change the legal responsibility which he has placed on this Authority or any future Authority under the 1960 Broadcasting Act.  If he is not, there is no way that he can change the procedures under statute.  The future selection will be the same as it has always been in the past, as laid down by statute. If the Minister is talking about independent assessors, independent assessors were employed in this case.  He has admitted this in the House.  The Authority's nominating interview board and the independent assessors both came to the same conclusion, yet the Taoiseach says that procedure was not correct.  He should tell us where it was not correct.</P>
    <P>There are many other things I should like to say.  There is no way in which the stance of the Minister and the Government in this matter is credible.  There is not a school-child of six years of age who would believe their case.  Everybody knows that for a long time we have been facing into satellite television.  The Minister talks about cable television, but I gave out licences for this as far back as 1980. He then talks about the need to bring in consultants.  Already the semi-State bodies have consultants appointed who have been given two pages of terms of reference, employed at the taxpayer's expense.  Is the Minister saying that they are not capable of doing the job?</P>
    <P>I call on the Minister to forget about bringing in the red herring or putting up the smokescreen that this intervention is absolutely necessary.  If he and the Taoiseach want to show bona fides for their case, they should extend the term of this Authority for one year.  By your actions shall you be judged.  If this study is so vital and so necessary &mdash; which nobody believes or accepts except themselves &mdash; the terms should be extended for one <Col N="1832" /> year, so that the country will be able to judge.</P>
    <P>The Government took this action only at the last minute.  They did not take it before any move was made to appoint a Director-General.  It can only be concluded that the action was politically motivated to get a person in there who would be subservient to the political views of certain sections of the Minister's party.  The Minister was not responsible. He did his job honourably until he was pressurised by others.  If he wants us to believe in him, he should extend the terms of the Authority.  By what has happened up to now, nobody can believe that it was anything but political motivation and blatant political intervention which has caused the problem which is damaging our national broadcasting service, the independence of which is vital to the maintenance of our democracy.  The public, naturally, are very worried and concerned about the Government's action and intervention.</P>

      <P>I shall start by thanking Deputies for their contributions.  I fully understand and appreciate the great interest and concern shown by all sides of the House in the affairs of RTE.  It is quite right that that should be so.  Some of the Deputies opposite have been kind enough to suggest that my actions and personal credentials have been honourable. They imply that it is the Government that have not been honourable.  I am grateful for the personal accolade, but the action of the Government in this matter is extremely correct and proper.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I feel very deeply that there should be no political interference whatever with RTE.  Deputy Leyden quoted from the Official Report of 1 March 1983.  He gave a number of quotations but I want to repeat one, from column 1424;  <Col N="1833" /> It is vitally important that politicians of whatever party should not interfere with RTE in the discharge of their duties. </P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>On behalf of this side of this House, I say that there has never been political interference and there will be no political interference with RTE.  In all the appointments which I have made, not only in my position as Minister for Communications, but previously as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, Minister for Transport and Minister for Justice, I have been totally politically impartial. When I became Minister for Justice I inherited, for instance, visiting committees for all prisons in this State, almost all of which were comprised of members of one political party.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TerryLeyden" hpid="Mr. Leyden Mr. Leyden">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JimMitchell" hpid="Mr. J. Mitchell Mr. J. Mitchell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>When those visiting committees came to be appointed they were reappointed impartially.  I did not sack all the Fianna Fáil members of the committee.  I retained half the Fianna Fáil membership and appointed other worthy people.  I tried to choose people who were non-political.  Similarly, in all my appointments in my present Department, I have appointed people of all political parties and none.  The only criteria were that the people be worthy and that the appointments be made on merit and merit alone.  I regret very much that in the course of this debate individuals have been named.  I do not intend to indulge in that.  Deputies opposite will know that on many of the boards there are even prominent members of their party appointed by me on merit.  I make that point to illustrate my approach at all times to these appointments.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One of the main reasons for the difficulty into which many semi-State bodies have got is that Ministers come under pressure to appoint people as a reward for their services to the party alone.  The people concerned are very worthy people, but are not always particularly <Col N="1834" /> suited to the job.  In many State companies under my aegis the quality of the board, and the suitability of the board's members, have not been as good as they should have been.  This has had a detrimental effect on many of our State companies. That will not be the case and has not been the case in my Department since I took office.  That is the approach which I will adopt to the appointment of an RTE Authority and to consenting to the appointment of a Director-General.  I hope that, given the generosity of the Opposition in accepting the consistency of my honourable intentions in this regard, they will accept in due course, when the Authority are appointed and when I consent to the appointment of a Director-General, that it will be seen in the light of my record and seen to be totally without regard to politics.</P>

      <P>Even if the end of the term of a Director-General was not due, a consultancy look into RTE was overdue and was being considered in the Department because of the major developments in broadcasting.  In the heat of this debate that point has been dismissed too readily by the Opposition.  We are at a major turning point in broadcasting affairs.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Mitchell</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Leyden made the point that there was no White Paper on satellite broadcasting.  Deputy Wilson, who was my predecessor as Minister for Posts and Telegraph, made a very wise timely move in November 1982 by setting up a high level committee on satellite broadcasting.  He deserves great credit for that, and I said that before in this House.  That committee reported to me within a year in a very elaborate report.  It was not expedient to publish that report because of confidentiality, because the national interest was involved and because it would not be wise to let other countries which are also vitally interested in this area know exactly what <Col N="1835" /> our line of thinking was and the options available to us as we saw them.</P>
      <P>On the basis of that report I made certain proposals to the Government within three months of the completion of the report.  The Government made certain decisions to invite proposals. Those proposals were received by the end of July of last year.  The consideration of those proposals is now coming to a conclusion.  The potential of this development is major for broadcasting.  Of course there is still some doubt how direct satellite broadcasting will go.  There is also the question how other possible satellite broadcasting may go, not only here but also in other countries.</P>
      <P>There is no doubt that we are entering into a new era in television which RTE when they were set up 25 years ago could not have anticipated.  The framework then designed could never have anticipated the developments which are now taking place.  For that reason alone, it is extremely timely that we have a review of the organisation of RTE.  This review does not imply any criticism of RTE.  There are many critics of RTE and I am not saying none of the criticism is unjustified.  That would be wrong.  Over all in my view RTE, within their present framework and given their present financial resources, do a very good job by any international comparison.  Not everybody will agree with me, but I think they do.</P>
      <P>The main purpose of this review is to gear RTE so that they can exploit the new era of broadcasting which is dawning, to gear them for growth and for the world of satellite television and the world of very extended radio broadcasting.</P>

      <P>I hope to deal with some of the points Deputies made but, before I depart from the consultancy, I want to say that there was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i> by Howard Kinlay on Tuesday of this week in which it was said that the draft terms of reference which were communicated to the Authority had <Col N="1836" /> changed by the time I made my statement. I want to make it absolutely clear that the terms of reference as suggested are precisely the same as what was communicated to the Authority in writing.</P>
      <P>In my letter I included a copy of the draft terms of reference which are as follows.  These are draft terms of reference which I propose to discuss with the Authority tomorrow: Having regard to the current functions of RTE and possible changes in those functions, and bearing in mind that the broadcasting services must be at least self-financing, to examine and report on (1) the suitability of the existing organisation of RTE; (2) the efficiency and effectiveness with which the organisation carry out their current functions as reflected in particular in the costs and output of the different functions; (3) costs and staffing levels having regard <i>inter alia</i> to recently concluded productivity agreements; and (4) any measures necessary to enable RTE to meet approved financial targets on a continuing basis including the scope for generating advertising and other revenue and the arrangements for the collection of TV licences and to make recommendations in regard to whatever changes and improvements are regarded as desirable or necessary.</P>
      <P>They are the draft terms of reference which were communicated to the Authority in writing last week.  <i>The Irish Times</i> report quoting some source to the contrary was inaccurate and wrong.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dowling</NameTxt>
      <P>On Thursday last I dealt with two important aspects of the budget, the continuous need for improving our national finances and the progress this Government have made in that direction. I am glad that the provisions of this budget continue to make that a priority. I dealt also with the unemployment situation and the measures taken in the budget to somewhat lessen the trauma of long term unemployment, with specific measures being provided for the creation <Col N="1839" /> of jobs for young people. I want now to deal with the third and most important aspect, that of taxation, to which this budget has addressed itself to some extent.  The budget was regarded as imaginative as far as taxation was concerned.  In some quarters it was suggested that it marked the end of a long period of rising taxation.  It would appear to be adhering rigidly to the national plan and the commitment therein in relation to taxation.  We have a very excessive taxation system which has stifled economic development.  Perhaps it constitutes one of the causes for our remaining in recession for so long.  It is not something that has developed over a short period but rather something which has been aggravated over a long period by successive Governments.  It will not be easy to undo much of that damage.</P>
      <P>Some people might contend that the simplification of the tax system in this budget was somewhat radical.  Perhaps it was not sufficiently radical; perhaps there were not sufficient reductions in the higher bands of taxation.  However, it constitutes a beginning.  In line with the difficulties we all know exist, the demand on the level of current expenditure &mdash; which cannot easily be met &mdash; means there must be a level of taxation consistent with the types of services the State must provide.  Nonetheless, for the first time, the Government have recognised there is a need radically to reform the whole taxation system.  I hope this constitutes a meagre beginning in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The income tax changes would appear to reduce the taxpayer's bill to some extent.  Certainly it will reduce the marginal rate of tax for quite a large number of taxpayers.  It will bring one-sixth of those in the higher tax bands down to the 35 per cent rate and abolishes the penal 65 per cent tax band, reducing that to 60 per cent.  Therefore there is some sign of hope for the hard pressed taxpayer as a result of these budgetary provisions.  This is a demonstration that something worth while can be done in that respect.  Therefore the simplification of the tax bands <Col N="1840" /> and the reduction in indirect taxation constitute the most significant improvement in that area.</P>
    <P>Lip service has been given to the reduction of VAT over many years but it has taken courage to do what has been done in this budget though the Minister is not sure at present that it will yield the amount of revenue he would like.  Of course he is hopeful that it will.  It may not yield revenue directly but it will stimulate economic development in other areas. I am certain that the job situation will improve as a direct result.</P>
    <P>Perhaps the tourist industry has received the greatest benefits as far as VAT reductions are concerned.  Hopefully that industry will respond in such a way as to provide additional jobs and revenue to the economy in the years ahead, particularly in the current and ensuing years.</P>
    <P>One of the most contentious areas is that of farming taxation on which I should like to dwell briefly.  The Minister has said that he will introduce a Bill to provide for a different form of taxation on agricultural land, based on adjustable acreage in a1986, which would appear to be meeting much opposition from the farming organisations. I agree with the principle of that form of taxation as it applies to a productive sector such as agriculture.  For some time I have perceived that if one over-taxes a productive sector one tends to reduce productivity.  In this respect it will be seen that the farmers will not invest because nobody wants to pay marginal taxation on additional investment or effort at 60p or 65p in the £ as obtained before the implementation of this budget.  Therefore the budgetary provisions entail a simplification of the system of taxation of farmers which I should have hoped would have met with the acceptance of the farming organisations. However, I can appreciate their difficulties having analysed that system.  While the details of the Bill to provide for the collection of this tax are not yet known I should hope that there will be provision to take account of some of the objections to that form of taxation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1841" /> It has been clearly established that taxation of any enterprise or profit, farming or otherwise, should be based on ability to pay.  That is recognised as being fair. Under the system now proposed the ability to pay principle is subservient to the objective of securing an overall revenue target.  There will be a doubling of taxation of the farming sector arising therefrom. Farmers may still pay the same amount in taxation but it will simplify the system for them because, as we are aware at present, 50 per cent of the total payout of farmers goes to the accountancy sector.  Therefore this constituted an attempt at simplification of the system and, at the same time, to direct the level of revenue generated from farming profits into the central Exchequer so that those moneys could be utilised among local communities, perhaps through the relevant local authorities, allowing them an additional level of expenditure.</P>
    <P>What concerns me is that a taxation proposal without ability to pay, or without consideration of ability to pay, creates an undesirable precedent in any productive sector.  On that basis I would suggest that the Minister for Finance would provide in the proposed Bill some mechanism for the lodgment of an appeal where hardship is created on a farm, where there may be sickness or where a considerable level of borrowing over the last five or ten years has reduced profitability or eliminated it altogether.  In those types of cases any income derived from farming goes to lending institutions.</P>
    <P>With regard to the increased revenue to be derived from farming taxation one must ask: Will that go towards financing local authorities?  If that were the case there might be greater acceptance of that form of taxation.  Of course some farmers view the operation of this system, particularly farmers in excess of the 80 adjustable acres, as another form of resource tax.  In a sense, I suppose it will have that type of impact.  I should love to see a form of taxation introduced which would eliminate any upper limit and which would include the whole farming <Col N="1842" /> sector, taking into account certain suggestions which I made.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation suggested that it would take about 15 years to develop a sufficiently detailed survey to enable land to be taxed on an adjustable acreage basis.  There will be many problems associated with this because already in County Waterford there has been such a survey and its findings have not been acceptable to farmers who examined it. On the basis of that survey almost all County Waterford appears to be highly inflated regarding adjustable acreage.  If that is the case I do not think that this system of taxation will ever get off the ground, which is a pity as there is great merit in it.</P>
    <P>The health charges, income and youth employment levies must be dealt with under the adjustable acreage scheme and I should like to know how that will be achieved.  How will the child benefit scheme operate?  However, in regard to taxation the Government have made a meagre start and I hope that in the years ahead a much greater impact will be made in relation to all areas of taxation, particularly the PAYE sector.  Of course it is extremely difficult to do anything quickly in this area.  It would be easier if we were starting from base level to implement the various proposals set out in the report of the Commission on Taxation, but we have inherited a regressive taxation system which will have to be tackled.</P>
    <P>Opposition Members have been very quick to say that there is nothing in the budget for farming, our most important industry.  I do not agree.  This budget in an indirect way has improved the potential for farming profits.  In 1984 farm incomes improved, and it was the best year for farming since the middle seventies. The prosperity which resulted from our entry to the EC diminished considerably in the late seventies, but 1984 gave a ray of hope and perhaps will give rise to increased investment in farming.  The main reason for this is that inflation has been lowered by the policies of the Government.  In 1980-81 inflation was running at 18 per cent and the rate is now <Col N="1843" /> at 6 per cent, which is a great help to the farming sector.</P>
    <P>Stock relief has been retained, and that also is very welcome.  There is now an incentive for people to lease land as the first £2,000 will not be considered for tax purposes.  The exemption for another year from stamp duty for young farmers under 35 is also very welcome.  The Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance should consider extending the rescue package for at least another year or two.  The biggest subvention in the budget is for disease eradication and in the current year almost £32 million is provided for this purpose.  Unfortunately, the scheme appears to be running into difficulties with the Veterinary Union and the Department of Agriculture. I hope that the problems can be resolved because we cannot afford to tinker with such an important industry. So much money has been spent over the last few years in this area that it would be a shame if we did not continue our efforts in this regard.  The farming organisations are most anxious to co-operate with the Minister and the Department and I ask the Veterinary Union to resolve the difficulties and to get the scheme off the ground.</P>
    <P>Taxation levels will continue to be very high over the next couple of years although attempts are being made to reduce them.  The overall borrowing level in terms of GNP is too high and, although the budget deficit is moving in the right direction, it is still too high.  When the Government came to office in 1982 Exchequer finances were in serious disarray, which damaged confidence in our economy.  The process of getting order back into those finances led to tax and PRSI increases.  Even with the relief given in this year's budget, personal taxation is still too high and is a disincentive to work.</P>
    <P>I congratulate the Government on their efforts to provide an economic plan. <i>Building on Reality</i> is a modest attempt to indicate our growth levels and how our economy will develop over the next three years.  It is a realistic approach and I am <Col N="1844" /> confident that its aims can be achieved. The budget is in line with the expectations of a large number of people.  Perhaps it does not live up to the expectations of the Opposition because in Private Members' motions in 1984 they advocated spending something in the order of £800 million.  I do not know how they purpose to finance that expenditure and perhaps they will enlighten us.  It is easy to spend money but it is hard to convince the public that finances must come from levels of taxation. I wish the Minister for Finance success in his endevavours to put the economy back on the road to prosperity and to create an environment which will provide jobs at all levels, especially for young people.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>Our greatest national problem today is finding occupation for all our people within our community.  I regret that the budget has done little to ease the anxiety or frustration of young people in this regard.  The budget and the Government policy document <i>Building on Reality</i> projects little or no increase in employment over the next few years. This is a clear sign, especially to young people, that they should emigrate.  More and more people are being let go from employment and we have now reached the record figure of 234,000 people out of work.</P>
      <P>Our income tax system remains basically unchanged and the PAYE worker is being asked to pay more tax in 1985 as a result of the budget.  Social Welfare increases of 6 per cent and 6½ per cent may balance off the rise in inflation but they will not recoup people for all the day to day increases in prices which will rise as a result of the budget.  There is no acknowledgement of the contributions made to the economy by business people, employers, farmers and workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is difficult to know what present Labour Party policy is.  Their members voted here for the budget but say outside that it is not really their budget.  It is obvious that Labour have abandoned the working person and the person on social welfare.  I am sure that if they were to <Col N="1845" /> conduct a poll among their supporters the result would be in the from of a certain and unequivocal message.</P>
    <P>Before the November 1982 general election Fine Gael told the people they were the only party who could solve our economic problems.  When the Coalition were returned to office after that election the national debt amounted to £12 billion but it is estimated that by the end of this year the corresponding figure will be £18 billion, an increase of 50 per cent in three years.  At that time in 1982 also Fine Gael promised that in office they would phase out budget deficiting by 1987.  Instead, the 1985 budget deficit is also a record at £1.234 billion.  That is another example of a broken promise.  Fine Gael misled the people.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil left office in 1972 the economy was in fairly good shape. We did not have the bad habit of borrowing abroad to finance current expenditure. At that time the foreign debt was £126 million while the current budget deficit was £5 million or a negligible 0.3 per cent of GNP.  But when the Coalition left office in 1977 our foreign debt had increased to 825 per cent or £1,040 million. That increase was due mainly to the foreign borrowing that had been engaged in for the purpose of funding current expenditure.  Therefore, the current budget deficit increased some 0.3 per cent of GNP in 1972 to 6.9 per cent of GNP in 1975.  It was during the time of the Coalition Government, too, that people were conditioned into accepting the idea of borrowing to finance current spending. The present Taoiseach was then the economic think-tank of Fine Gael.  We must not forget that.</P>
    <P>A Coalition Government were returned to office again in 1981 and with the exception of the period from February to November 1982 have been in office since.  The average current budget deficit in that time has been at annual rates of 7.6 per cent, 8.2 per cent and 7.5 per cent in terms of GNP.  The policy in this country for the past 12 years or more has been one of increasing budget deficiting and the Coalition parties must accept a <Col N="1846" /> very large proportion of the blame in this regard.</P>
    <P>In 1983 interest repayments on our national debt amounted to £1.33 billion. In 1984 the figure in this respect was £1.57 billion while the estimated figure for 1985 is £1.84 billion.  To put the matter in different terms, each income tax payer, and mainly the PAYE worker, will contribute 84 per cent of his tax to repaying the national debt in 1985.  At the time the Coalition took office the corresponding figure was 80 per cent.  PAYE workers pay between 80 and 90 per cent of the total income tax collected.  The share of income tax to total tax revenue in 1983 was 35½ per cent while in 1984 it was 37 per cent and is estimated at 39 per cent for this year.  This must mean that more income tax will be taken from the everdecreasing employment force despite the Minister for Finance giving the impression that the amount in this regard would be less than has been the case.  It is difficult to understand how increasing levels of income tax can be got from a decreasing employment force.  Obviously, there is a need to broaden the whole taxation base so that the burden will be shared by more.  If this is not done those who are employed will lose the initiative to continue to work.</P>
    <P>There is a great need for a new understanding and a new national spirit.  More than 65 years ago our people fought for the right of self-determination, for the right to make their own decisions and to deal with their own affairs; but, regrettably, we are slowly but surely losing these rights.  Others are taking control of our trade and our finance.</P>
    <P>Our greatest national problem is unemployment.  Many of the 234,000 out of work are young people.  In addition, emigration is increasing.  Again, many of those leaving the country are young people.  The Coalition who have been in office for two years have a responsibility and a duty to create incentives and policies that would encourage and support our people in motivating them into a new national spirit of achievement and success.</P>
    <P>The people must realise that they too <Col N="1847" /> have a major part to play in helping to solve the problem of unemployment.  No Government can solve that kind of problem without the support of the people. Every country in Europe has an unemployment problem, so it would be foolish of us to think that any other country might be willing to solve our unemployment problem before they solve their own.  We must as a community solve our own problems, but this is a very difficult task especially if the people have lost confidence in the Government of the day. Young people are telling us that there must be less talk and more action.  The Coalition are losing touch with the people and should call a general election.  Fianna Fáil are the only party in whom the people have confidence to improve the employment situation.  On each occasion on which we were returned to office we were successful in that regard.  The people await eagerly the next election.</P>
    <P>A small community like ours, who have been members of the European Community for the past 12 years, have not succeeded in making the inroads we are capable of making into the European food and processing markets where there is a population of up to 280 million people.  All these people must eat too. Some of their foods may be different from the foods we are accustomed to, but they must eat.  We must survey the markets and ascertain the kinds of food that we could sell best there and the prices those people are willing to pay for their food. Surely many of our educated young people would be capable of assisting in finding and promoting these new markets. There is not much point in investing large amounts of the taxpayers' money in educating young people for the emigration ship thereby allowing other countries to reap the rewards.  We are inclined to look at other countries and say matters are easy for them, that they have oil, coal, silver mines or some other minerals.</P>
    <P>Yet, we have our own asset &mdash; the land of Ireland.  We have a good climate and a good workforce: what we lack is the commitment and the initiative to realise and to develop these assets.  Let us put <Col N="1848" /> more taxpayers' money into ventures such as food processing, dairy products and marketing.  This will create real employment.  With proper Government, leadership and initiative there is no reason why such ventures will not be successful. Surely the Government have confidence in their people?  With proper investment and incentive, with better production and management, continuity of supply, quality goods, packaging and marketing we should be able to create new markets in Europe for our food and dairy products.  Our best future lies with Europe.  Let us get down to the job now because if we delay it may be too late.</P>
    <P>We could create a market for more food and dairy consumption at home if we encouraged more tourists here.  This is another area in which the Government are failing.  What is needed is a definite, long-term plan for tourism, to give encouragement and incentives to people who have invested their money and also to encourage those who would like to invest in the tourist business.  Sweet money pleases the child for only a short time and that is the way I see the recent VAT reductions in respect of tourism. The Government should give serious consideration to the matter.  There is not much sense in reducing VAT while at the same time the price of petrol is increased. That is like a seesaw, with no long-term benefits for those involved in the tourist business.</P>
    <P>Tourism is of primary importance but we do not seem to develop it properly. We have our people and their way of life, castles, historical sites, rivers, landscape, sports, our song and dance, festivals, and we have our special kind of welcome.  But what we do not appear to have is good value for money.  Our taxes and VAT rates as they affect tourism are far too high.  If we reduce these taxes we would create more wealth.  We want more money to come into this country and we want more money spent on food and services. All of this would create more employment.  By reducing taxes and VAT in this area we would get a good return.</P>
    <P>We should carry out necessary repair <Col N="1849" /> and maintenance work on our castles and historical buildings.  In Trim, County Meath, we have one of the most important castles in the country.  It is called King John's Castle.  At present it is being allowed to fall into decay and complete ruin because for the past 20 years the Department, the Office of Public Works and others involved cannot come to an acceptable understanding.  It is not a Trim or County Meath monument: it is a national monument of great importance. Nothing is being done to repair the castle and that is a national disgrace that would not happen in any other country.  I appeal to the Minister to get rid immediately of all the red tape that is obstructing this development.  There is enormous tourist potential here and employment could be created in an area that is a crisis unemployment area.  What is needed is an honest decision by the Minister.  He should tell us clearly if his Department will provide the necessary finances to repair and maintain King John's Castle. It is no excuse to say that the castle is in private ownership and, therefore, that State money cannot be spent on it.  Such money has been spent on this castle in the past.  It is a national monument and it is the duty and the responsibility of the Government to preserve it for the people and for the next generation.</P>
    <P>King John's Castle, Trim, is owned privately by the Dunsany family and has been in their ownership for many generations. Recognising the historical and architectural importance of the castle, the Commissioners of Public Works made it the subject of a preservation order on 3 November 1965 and the reason for such an order was that the castle was falling into decay through neglect.  On 27 October 1966 the Commissioners of Public Works appointed themselves guardians of Trim Castle in accordance with the National Monuments Act, 1930.  Section 12 of that Act states that where the Commissioners are the owners or the guardians of a national monument they shall maintain that monument.  Clearly they have a statutory duty to maintain this castle.  Extensive maintenance works were carried out between 1970 and 1977 <Col N="1850" /> to the greater portion of the walls, including the gatehouse and the barbican, at a cost of £48,000, which is equivalent to £100,000 at current prices.  The Commissioners of Public Works estimated that the cost of completing maintenance work of the same standard to the castle walls east of the barbican and to the keep would be a minimum of £250,000.  They have not spent any money on the castle since they took it into guardianship in 1966 when, in their own words, it was falling into decay through neglect.</P>
    <P>While commending the excellent work carried out at the request of the Commissioners during 1970, the &ldquo;Save Trim Castle&rdquo; Committee were deeply distressed that such a stalemate as ownership clarification should be allowed to continue. This would be serious enough if the condition of the castle were stable but it continues to deteriorate each year.  One effect of this deterioration is that when repair works are carried out ultimately there will be much more work to be done and at greater cost.</P>
    <P>These are difficult economic times. The &ldquo;Save Trim Castle&rdquo; Committee are not asking that the existing budget for national monuments be increased but rather that Trim Castle be given priority in the scope of the present budget.  The Commissioners of Public Works point out that their present national budget is less than £3 million and they estimate that maintainence work to Trim Castle would cost a total of £250,000.  Nobody expects £250,000 to be spent on Trim Castle in one year.  We are asking the Commissioners to undertake a programme of works on the castle to be spread over the next five or ten years so that the annual proportion of the national budget used will not be enormous.</P>
    <P>In 1172 history records that the first fortification was erected by Hugh de Lacy on this castle site and he was granted the then lands of County Meath by King Henry II.  The present castle was built around 1220 by William Peppard, Lord of Tabor.  History also records that within its walls parliaments were held frequently during the 15th century.  An immediate meeting with the Minister is urgently <Col N="1851" /> requested by all interested parties and I hope it will be successful.  It is obvious that this castle is an integral part of our Irish heritage and as such deserves the support of everybody for its preservation and especially the support of the Coalition Government.</P>
    <P>Employment can be increased in the industrial area, but our problem is that the tax system crucifies both the employers and the employees, especially PAYE workers.  Let me give an example.  A company with 50 employees makes £1 million profit and another company employs 500 people and also makes £1 million profit, but both companies pay the same profits tax.  This is clearly not giving employers an incentive to increase their number of employees.</P>
    <P>I would like to see some type of investment trust funds in parish areas where local people would be prepared to put their money in to the local trust fund and so create employment for young people. I would like the Government to give some financial encouragement to that type of development.  The problem facing young people today is that when they go looking for a job the first question they are asked is if they have any experience, and usually the answer is no.  That is the reality and we must accept it.  We must find other ways to give encouragement to our young people to set up in business, perhaps by forming a co-operative.  This would create a great deal of work for many young people.  I believe the people in local areas would come forward with their money to invest in such a scheme if it was supported by the Government.</P>
    <P>It appears that the investor with capital has decided to look elsewhere where he will get better terms.  It would also appear that those on social welfare are just as well off, if not better off, than those in employment.  If this situation is allowed to continue our financial and economic position will continue to worsen.  Action must be taken by the Government to correct this situation.  I cannot understand why very high taxes are taken from PAYE workers and employers to create new agencies of administration to help <Col N="1852" /> young people find employment when part of that money could be left with the employers and the employees to invest in their own business and create more jobs themselves.  This would cut out the ever increasing administrative costs which are a burden on production.</P>
    <P>It is interesting to record that over the past three years employment has been maintained in the public service sector but there has been massive unemployment in other areas.  This trend cannot be allowed to continue because if it does, our production will become less price effective as a result.  Too much administration versus production must be identified as a tax on production.  That means our products will become less competitive, consequently, with less employment. As a country we would be much better off if we had people in profitable employment.  We have reached the stage where production cannot afford the administrative costs it has to bear.</P>
    <P>The introduction of a proper attractive national retirement scheme would help to create employment for young people. I look at employment as if it was water going through a pipe, and the water represent unemployment.  If the pipe cannot take the flow of water, the water will accumulate at the inlet forming a lake.  We have a huge lake of unemployment which has been greatly increased over the past two years.  How do we get rid of this lake?  We can build another pipeline and this will release the water; but it will cost more to build these pipelines and that means borrowing more, which we cannot afford to do at present because our national debt will reach a record £18½ billion by the end of 1985. Building a new pipeline is out.</P>
    <P>Another option would be to make the water flow through the pipe faster.  This is where a good and attractive national retirement pension scheme would be most effective.  It would be possible to offer an attractive pension scheme to those willing to accept early retirement. The finance being used at present to pay dole to young people could be diverted into such a pension scheme.  People who can afford to retire earlier should give it <Col N="1853" /> serious consideration to allow our young people to work at home.</P>
    <P>If something is not done quickly by the Government we will end up with a ten year span of lost youth, a youth in which the taxpayers have heavily invested.  Due to emigration other communities can benefit from our young people's education and skills free of charge.  There should be a national early retirement pension scheme with a scale of payment based on age of retirement and on the numbers unemployed.  Our young people are anxiously waiting to play their part in the future development of this country and they have a right to make that demand.  It is the duty and responsibility of all politicians to seek ways and means of allowing young people to avail of this right.</P>
    <P>At present there is a limit to the amount of employment that can be created within our community and unless we can produce and sell more at home and abroad it will be difficult to improve the situation.  But a more serious national effort must be made by the Government. I fear for this country.  I know our young people are willing to make a strong contribution to the development of this country, but if they cannot we will be much worse off as a country in the future.</P>
    <P>I would like to say a few brief words about agriculture.  I welcome the extension for another year of the existing stock relief arrangements to farmers and the stamp duty exemption to young trained farmers.  However, I am disappointed that the rescue package for interest subsidy relief has been discontinued.  Many farmers now have no option but to sell out.  Dairy farmers do not know what their quotas or prices will be as a result of the milk super-levy.  There is nothing but worry among dairy farming families. If we expect more agricultural production and exports, this area needs special attention by the Government.  Recently, Clover Meats in Waterford closed down and many farmers were left without their money.  Something is seriously wrong that a situation like that could arise.  The farmers worked hard tending their livestock <Col N="1854" /> and so on and sent the cattle to the factories and then they were not paid for them.  There should be some system of insurance bond to cover that situation. Some years ago there was legislation where people involved in livestock cattle marts &mdash; solicitors and auctioneers &mdash; had to open up a client's account and the money was put into the client's account and it was not used in the trading of the company.  I understand that beef factories do not get paid for the cattle until perhaps months later but the Government should be able to safeguard the payments to farmers for the production of cattle.  Unless something is done to solve this problem farmers will become cautious in trading and this will seriously affect the co-operative movement and further agricultural production.</P>
    <P>In relation to education I am disappointed that the grant in aid fund for sports organisations has been reduced by 9 per cent from £1,196,000 to £1,085,000. When we add to that the 6 per cent inflation rate sporting organisations will have to operate under a 15 per cent reduction. It is ridiculous that the Government made such a decision.  People working in sporting organisation work voluntarily to help young people to find an alternative occupation to being unemployed.  It is also a good form of health education.</P>
    <P>In relation to child care assistance in national schools for the handicapped we have seen a 1 per cent increase of £416,000 to £422,000 and if we deduct 6 per cent inflation we arrive at a minus 5 per cent situation.  I regret the reduction in this area.  I am pleased that the residential homes and special schools will be getting extra money.  Percentagewise it looks big, but in real terms the amount is small from £26,000 to £53,000.  I welcome the increase from £500,000 to £970,000 for building and equipment in special schools for the handicapped and I hope that such schools in my constituency will receive some of this extra finance to continue their good work.  The schools for the handicapped in County Meath, St. Mary's in Delvin, St. Ultan's in Navan and St. Peter's in Castlepollard are all doing great work.  The population of <Col N="1855" /> Meath has increased tremendously over the past few years and there is a long waiting list for new schools and improvements to existing schools.  We are waiting for an extension to St. Patrick's classical school in Navan, we are waiting for a new community school in Kells and a new secondary school in Trim.  There is no secondary school in west Meath and there is a large population there.  The children from those areas must go to Drogheda or Dublin.  Either Duleek or Julianstown would be an ideal geographical situation for a new secondary school and there is a demand for it in the area.  Another area crying out for a secondary school is the Ashbourne, Dunboyne, Ratoath, Dunshaughlin area.  I appeal to the Minister to take a serious look at these problems and give an early decision.  In relation to vocational schools in county Meath we are awaiting extensions to schools in Longwood, Oldcastle, Dunshaughlin and Athboy.  We are also awaiting a vocational school in Nobber and in Trim.</P>

    <P>It is obvious that we cannot continue to accept that there are no better systems of spending taxpayers' money than those which prevail.  New and better ways must be found.  I should like to take the example of the OPW, a large and complex organisation with more than 1,000 staff costing in salaries, wages and allowances £12.384 million in the 1985 Estimate.  In terms of financial responsibility the gross budget for the OPW in the 1985 Estimate is £111.151 million.  One can add to this the capital works amounts included in the Estimates of other Departments which are managed or designed by the OPW. They are estimated at approximately £60 million for 1985.</P>

      <P>I appreciate the decision of the Chair.  The area of responsibility exercised by the OPW in 1985 will be approximately £171 million.

      <P>I regret to have to tell the Deputy that he is completely out of order and I cannot allow him to continue in this manner.  The Minister for Finance, wearing another hat, is responsible for the OPW but this is not a matter for the budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ColmMHilliard" hpid="Mr. Hilliard Mr. Hilliard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hilliard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is strange that no matter what projects are decided on none appear to be completed on time.  Very <Col N="1857" /> few, if any, end up at the original estimated cost or even close to it.  However, if any persons in business outside the public sector were to run their businesses in a similar fashion they would not be too long in business.  Keeping projects on target, within the projected estimated cost and with proper management control is essential if we are to get the maximum benefit from spending hard earned taxpayer's money.  It is also essential that Departments are not allocated money on budget day that will not be fully spent during that year.  Otherwise other deserving and worth while projects will be delayed.  Time is money and it should be the ambition of all workers, professional and otherwise, to ensure that projects planned and costed in advance are kept on schedule if at all possible.</P>
      <P>I should like to deal with the question of extra taxation outside the budget.  It must be made clear that we have more than one budget annually.  We have an ESB budget and a telephone budget.  We have local authority budgets.  They occur because less money is given by central Government to local authorities.  If one looks at newspapers one will see that in Limerick water rates jumped from £50 to £60, in Galway water rates jumped by 10 per cent, in Cork and Kerry by 10 per cent, in Meath by 5 per cent, in Westmeath by 15 per cent, in Mullingar town by 19p in the £ and in Mayo by 10 per cent.  In Waterford there was a 100 per cent increase in water charges.  Those increases represent extra taxation at local level which could have been included in the budget if central Government were giving more money back to local authorities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Even with increased charges in my constituency we will have to cut out maintenance of our main and county roads because we do not have the money.  Surface dressing on our main roads will be reduced by 21 per cent and on our county roads by 10 per cent in 1985.  Our county roads are getting worse daily but nothing can be done about it by Meath County Council if they do not get State aid.  I appeal to the Minister for the Environment <Col N="1858" /> to act now and assist that council because the roads must be repaired.  If the repair work is not carried out now the cost in the future will be much greater.</P>
    <P>We have a unique problem in County Meath because we have a lot of traffic going to and from Dublin city using our county roads which our ratepayers are financing with some State aid.  It is not right that the ratepayers of County Meath should maintain roads for traffic going through our county in these circumstances. Putting more capital into our roads would be another way of giving extra employment especially in County Meath.  Since the Coalition took office in 1982 unemployment in Trim has increased by 80 per cent, in Kells by 60 per cent and in Navan by 30 per cent.  We now have 4,500 people unemployed in my constituency.</P>
    <P>I am disappointed that the Minister for Finance did not consider the serious business and financial problems that the carpet and furniture manufacturers in my county are in, especially in my home town of Navan.  They are struggling to keep people employed but the Coalition have forgotten them again because they are asking them to continue to pay the very high VAT rates.  There is no provision in the Estimates for the development of Drogheda harbour which is in urgent need of attention.  The harbour is in a bad state of disrepair but the Government do not appear to have any interest in it. Many business people in my constituency as a result will have to use other port facilities at a greater cost.</P>
    <P>Money has not been provided in the budget for the protection of the Meath coastline from Donacarney, Bettystown, Laytown to Gormanstown.  Meath County Council give £10,000 annually for that work but that will not go too far.  I am disappointed that the Comptroller and Auditor General does not appear to have got any extra finance to bring the books of semi-State bodies up to date.  In the course of his report he stated that many of the semi-State bodies were in arrears with their accounts.  I cannot understand how the Minister overlooked that.  If we cannot keep our books up to date in the <Col N="1859" /> area of semi-State bodies we could find ourselves in serious trouble in the future.</P>
    <P>I should like to point out that postal service costs in the Estimates have increased from £46½ million to £52 million. The Department of Social Welfare spent £16.435 million on postal services; the Revenue Commissioners, £10.507 million; the Garda Síochána, £4.83 million; the Department of Agriculture, £3.319 million; the Department of Finance, £1.657 million; Houses of the Oireachtas and European Assembly, £1.48 million; the Department of Education, £1.256 million; the Office of Public Works, £1.139 million; and the Department of Communications, £1 million. They are frightening figures.  These are all servicing costs.  This is an area which should be investigated to find out if we are getting the best value for this money.</P>
    <P>Consultancy services have gone from £3 million to £3.84 million &mdash; an increase of 27½ per cent.  Travelling expenses within all the Departments have increased by 10 per cent.  These are figures worth recording in the House and they are areas which need investigation if we are to spend better the taxpayer's money.  It is now clear that this budget will seriously affect the spending power of the average family.  Most people certainly will be less well off in 1985 as a result.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTreacy" hpid="Mr. S. Treacy Mr. S. Treacy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Treacy</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is based directly on the policies and projections contained in the national plan.  It is not in itself an instrument of direct income policy, as a good budget should be.  It merely marks time.  It has little or no relevance to the real issues confronting our people, such as the massive unemployment, lowering standards of life, crime and violence rampant throughout our country, nor does it effect to any appreciable extent the oft-sought reliefs from the crushing burden of taxation affecting our PAYE sector in particular. All these issues simply have not been faced up to in this budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The more one analyses the budget from these various standpoints, the more one <Col N="1860" /> comes to the viewpoint that it is disappointing and most ineffective in dealing with these social and economic problems. Despite the various measures taken to provide jobs for our people &mdash; and this is to be acknowledged in respect of many Ministers in the Government who strive desperately to provide job opportunities for our people &mdash; other Ministers would seem hell bent on destroying job opportunities. That is evident from the cutbacks and the curbs on the employment of people in all the State services.  Despite these genuine measures taken to provide work, especially for our young people, it must be said that these various employment schemes are in the main of a short term nature &mdash; part time jobs, blind alley jobs, leading to nowhere at the end of a few months.</P>
    <P>There is no semblance of security involved in these various work schemes, no real prospect of planning ahead and the blight on our young people's lives remains for the future.  The need effectively to tackle unemployment has simply not been faced up to.  The overall problem of mass unemployment has been very largely sidetracked.  There is no long term policy to tackle this great social evil.  It is extremely disconcerting to realise that at the expiration of this three year plan we shall still have as many people unemployed as were unemployed at the beginning. This is a frightening prospect, and intolerable situation which this House cannot and must not condone.  We must never accept the doleful philosophy that the poor, the poverty stricken, the unemployed masses we shall always have with us.  That that unemployment problem is so great that it is incapable of solution seems to be a philosophy with which we have to contend here.  That is a philosophy which I reject and repudiate.  I also reject the philosophy that our fiscal and economic problems can only be solved on the backs of a vast army of unemployed.  I contend that idleness is the devil's workshop and that from it flow many of the attendant evils of crime and violence and of drug addiction which is so prevalent in our society today.</P>
    <P>If we provide jobs for our people it will <Col N="1861" /> bring about a rich reward, and many of the evils with which we are contending today will certainly diminish or fade away.  Mass unemployment is the great contributory factor to crime, violence and fear in the life of this country at present.  Central to the plan for job creation is the speedy establishment of the National Development Corporation, designed to give a new commercial and strategic thrust to public investment in industry.  I have always regarded the establishment of such a corporation as the real engine of activity in creating work for our people.  Without this National Development Corporation there is no prospect of making any worthwhile impact on unemployment.</P>
    <P>Clearly, private enterprise has failed down the years to do the job, despite all the lavish State aid conferred on it by various Governments.  We have all seen in recent years so many thousands of workers discarded, declared redundant and thrown on the unemployment scrap heap, sacrificed on the altar of greed and profit.  I submit that in these circumstances the State has a bounden duty to intervene directly in providing jobs for our people.  If private enterprise fails to do the job and the State is not intervening, to whom do we look to provide work for our people?  Are we to leave this whole matter to the free flow of the market, of supply and demand, in which the weak always go to the wall?  I said before and say again that unemployment is a great cancer eating away at the body politic in this country and we ignore it at our peril.</P>
    <P>The flagrantly unjust system of taxation is the other most disturbing and disuniting element in our society.  This budget does not provide the reliefs required, especially in the PAYE sector. Sleight of hand tactics will not do.  There must be real reform of the tax code.  The tax net must be extended to all sections who can and should pay.  Equity, fairness and social justice must be seen to be provided in respect of our taxation code. The overbearing crushing burden of taxation on the PAYE sector must be lifted.</P>
    <P>What was meant to be a painless exercise <Col N="1862" /> in the extraction of tax from the pockets of the working class people has become naked robbery of the hardearned wages of working class men and women.  PAYE, which was sold to us in this House as the painless extraction of tax, has become a detestable system, a robber's system, a vicious system, an avaricious monster plundering, in the main, one section of our people &mdash; the working class people.  It is a disincentive and it is damaging to the whole future of our country.</P>
    <P>The enormity of the injustice done to the PAYE sector is highlighted by the facts and figures revealed by the Minister for Finance in this House.  He told us that last year 44,000 farmers, including those with another trade or profession, paid an average income tax bill of £724 compared with an average leavy of £1,875 on PAYE workers.  The Minister also disclosed that the average tax bill for PAYE workers had increased by 600 per cent over the past ten years.  Between 1979 and 1983 the average tax take from a PAYE worker rose from £915 to £1,875.  In the same five year period the average tax payment made by a self-employed person rose from £714 to £1,573.  For the top 20 per cent of farmers the increase was from £488 to £724.</P>
    <P>These startling facts illustrate the injustice done to the PAYE worker.  Leaving aside an aspect of taxation which the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have yet to deal with effectively, as was promised in recent time, I avail of this opportunity to pose the question: when will the national income related pension scheme be introduced in this House?  I observe that my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Social Welfare, is present.  I would be grateful if he or the Minister concerned would indicate to us when we shall see this measure.  As an industrial worker I realise that no provision is made by way of pension at the end of their working lives for tens of thousands of workers.  This type of callous treatment does not apply merely to small firms but also to the multi-nationals, the big ones, many of whom show a callous disregard for the welfare of their <Col N="1863" /> workers when it comes to retirement.</P>
    <P>The national income related pension scheme would also apply to the self-employed. I look forward to its implementation. When will it be introduced in this House?  Will it be introduced between now and the summer recess, or will we have to wait until Christmas or perhaps next year?</P>
    <P>I have strong reservations about certain aspects of the three year plan upon which the budget is based.  I mentioned the area of job creation and relief for the PAYE sector.  I do not believe that the ban on employment in the public service should continue when so many of our young, highly educated, talented people are seeking desperately for jobs.  I have already commended Ministers for striving to create jobs, but I cannot understand the mentality of other Ministers who prevent job creation at a time of massive unemployment when a quarter of a million of our people are unemployed. I appeal to the Government for a more consistent and humane approach to this problem so that young people may be afforded an opportunity to apply their talents and their genius to the service of their own country.</P>
    <P>There is another very serious aspect of the ban on jobs in the public service.  As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts I have been appalled at the inability of various Departments of State and semi-State bodies to operate effectively and efficiently without additional staff.  In the area of taxation to which I have already adverted, it is deeply worrying to realise that thousands of people are getting away without paying any tax whatsoever, or very little.  Those of us in the PAYE net are mulcted.  We are sitting ducks.  We are exploited.  Other categories of persons seem to get away with virtual murder.</P>
    <P>Taxmen have failed in recent years to collect some £680 million.  At least £677 million in tax remained uncollected up to May of last year.  The figure could be a lot higher.  The Revenue Commissioners' books put the total amount due at £3,500 million.  They admit that their <Col N="1864" /> assessments are grossly inflated and £677 million is the best estimate of what could be collected eventually and is in fact due.</P>
    <P>The Comptroller and Auditor General gave us these figures at our meeting. He was critical of staff shortages which impede him in his great national work as the watchdog of State expenditure.  It was impossible for him to carry out adequate audits of Government accounts because of an acute shortage of staff in his Department. How can we, as a committee, or he fulfil our constitutional obligations, being so handicapped by lack of manpower at a time when there are so many brilliant young boys and girls crying out for jobs?  The audit carried out recently and the lack of proper assistance to do the job have far reaching implications for this House and nation.  There is evidence of a wide range of fraud, overruns and undoubted wastage in public Departments. Inadequate staffing has meant that it was not possible to achieve an adequate level of audit examination in very many vulnerable areas.  Many anomalies have been turned up which have not been resolved satisfactorily primarily because of the Government embargo on the recruitment of personnel to various Departments.  The whole situation is fraught with the most serious implications. It is a futile policy that must be changed.</P>
    <P>In respect of income tax and taxation generally the report received by the Committee of Public Accounts reveals that sheriffs and county registrars have been swamped with orders to enforce collection of unpaid taxes.  It reveals that in January 1983 there were 69,000 cases on hand, with another 96,000 cases having been referred to them during the year; but they could manage to clear only some 51,000 cases, ending the year with a massive 114,000 cases outstanding in respect of almost £300 million.  In 1983 they managed to collect a mere £30 million.  This inability to collect taxes, which impinges so much on all of us taxpayers, is due primarily to the rigid implementation of the embargo on recruitment of people to the public service.</P>
    <P>I do not wish to dwell unduly on this <Col N="1865" /> budget and its many aspects affecting our lives on this occasion as we shall have an opportunity of going into greater detail on the various Estimates.  However, I wish to avail of this opportunity to appeal to the Minister for the Environment to bring forward his proposals for the reform of local authorities, for their restructuring and, most important of all, for their proper financing.  As one who has been in public life for a very long time I wish to see real power devolved on members of local authorities.  I wish to see real democracy prevail in rural areas. I wish also that the powers now vested in the Minister and in central Government be curbed and devolved on members of local authorities.  The virtual dictatorial powers now vested in county managers should be curbed and be devolved on members.  I do not know how members of local authorities can carry out their duties responsibly and effectively unless proper power devolves on them.  Therefore I want to see real, local democracy.</P>
    <P>Of course, the most urgent necessity of all is the proper financing of our local authorities.  There are many alternatives from which to choose as we scrutinise the manner and method of funding local authorities in other countries, many similar to ours.  There are many alternatives and examples available.  But, so far as the Minister is concerned, the most fundamental aspect of all is that there must be a change in respect of the use of charges &mdash; charges must be abandoned.  Multitudinous and every-increasing charges, conjured up at the behest of a county manager must cease, and there has been a violent reaction to them on the part of the general public.  It should be remembered that these charges impinge most of all on the lives of working class people, council and corporation tenants, many of whom are unemployed.  Those who are working are scourged already by an unfair taxation system in regard to PAYE, VAT, ever increasing costs, a lowering of their standards of living and a clear inability to secure proper remuneration in these times for the efforts they make in their working lives.</P>
    <P>I deplore the failure of this budget, and <Col N="1866" /> indeed of the national plan, to exploit effectively our resources whether they be in agriculture, fisheries, forestry, turf production, mariculture, gas and oil or mineral resources generally.  There is no real effort made to exploit these natural indigenous resources which could put so many of our people in productive work.</P>
    <P>I deplore the failure to increase children's allowances in this budget.</P>
    <P>I come now to deal with duty on certain items.  I observe that there has been no increase in duty on beer, wine or spirits in this budget.  It should be remembered that the price of spirits had already been reduced prior to the budget.  I find it difficult to understand why the Minister has not found it possible to reduce the price of the working man's pint.  It was an unwise decision, economically and socially, to reduce the price of whiskey, brandy and gin and to make them more attractive to the consumer to the detriment of the traditional pint.  The Minister should seriously consider reducing the price of the pint instead of encouraging people to drink spirits which have a high alcoholic content.</P>
    <P>I am also concerned at the decision of the Minister to increase the duty on cider and perry.  My native town, Clonmel, is traditionally the home of cider making. It is one of our basic industries and is vital to the economic life of the town. Cidermaking is a modern industry and it is so advanced that it has its own orchards and engages in the crushing of apples. The Minister raised the duty by 20p per gallon, including VAT, on the ordinary strength cider with a smaller increase for middle strength cider and perry.  In picking out a small local industry, confined in the main to my native town, the Minister deliberately struck a blow at cider making.  His decision is all the more startling because we heard rumours that the Minister had been canvassed by certain beer barons, especially those in Munster, to increase duty on cider and obviously they were successful.  I do not know why cider was picked out and this increase threatens the jobs and future of the industry in Clonmel.  The Minister must explain his decision.  My county is <Col N="1867" /> suffering enough from the recession without this added burden.  It is not as if cider was made generally in this country; it is made primarily at Clonmel, and I wish to convey the strong feelings of resentment felt by the workers, the unions and the people of Clonmel in respect of this matter.  The Minister did not increase duty on beer and he must have realised that increasing duty on cider would militate against the company in question.</P>
    <P>In County Tipperary many industries have been closed, including Tipperary Anthracite, the boot factory in Clonmel and Clonmel Foods, an adjunct of Clover Meats, Waterford, and the Minister should indicate what is being done to reopen these centres of activity.  We understand that there are proposals for the utilisation of the anthracite plant at Lickfinn, Ballingarry, and also in regard to Clonmel Foods.  I appreciate the difficulty of reviving the boot and shoe trade because it was one of the industries destroyed by our entry to the EC.  The closure of the hub of the industry, Clarks of Dundalk, is proof positive that the industry was destroyed by free exchange of men, money and materials involved in our acceptance of the Rome Agreement. Can the Minister give any definite information regarding the reopening of the Tipperary Anthracite factory and of Clonmel Foods?</P>
    <P>I was the convenor and chairman of a number of important meetings, along with my colleagues in the Dáil and Seanad, in order to try to avert the closure of Clover Meats and their subsidaries. Naturally, therefore, I am gravely concerned that these factories should be reopened and jobs restored to the workers. The farming community also suffered substantial losses in respect of the supply of cattle, pigs and so on to these factories and they should also be properly compensated.  Compensating them, however, I hope will not defer the opening of plants in Waterford, Clonmel and Wexford.</P>
    <P>The Government are now at the half way stage of their term in office and we <Col N="1868" /> have had to contend with cutbacks and lowering of standards in a deep recession. Job losses have reached a horrific total and there is an increasing incidence of crime and poverty.  It is now time for a new beginning, to bring hope and help to our people.  A radical change of attitude is called for to resolve the serious afflictions of our people.  The time for change is now, because time is running out for the Government.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBrowne2" hpid="Mr. Browne Mr. Browne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>This budget is perhaps the greatest non-event of the year.  Using a high-powered public relations exercise the Minister introduced the budget as one of the most radical and economy boosting budgets in years.  At that time and on the following day some economic commentators referred to the budget as innovative and far reaching and one that would boost the economy significantly.  However, as the days passed and the budget implications were teased out, we realise that we had been presented with what was no more than a sham budget that had been put together to satisfy Fine Gael backbenchers and the socialist conscience of Labour.  Initially one got the impression that this was a soft budget, that the reliefs in taxation would result in job creation and in controlling foreign debt.  We were told that unemployment was on the wane, but the minister should realise that <Col N="1869" /> our people are not naive.  They are educated and are well capable of realising that the budget will do nothing to create a climate in which jobs will be operated.</P>
      <P>The morale of the people has been shattered by this disastrous Coalition Government who have abdicated their responsibility to the people in terms of governing in a practical and commonsense way.  The Government are pursuing policies which have resulted in putting 234,000 people out of work.  In addition, these policies have imposed a crippling burden on the PAYE taxpayer and have destroyed any incentive for business people to invest.  Indeed, the Government's policies have destroyed any incentive there might have been for any sector.  Perhaps what is most appalling is that the lives of a whole generation of young, highly educated and talented people have been sacrificed in the interest of balancing the books.  The social problems that result from 80,000 young people being out of work are obvious and must concern all of us.  Are we as politicians blind to the fact that the democratic process is crumbling around us? Young people who have nothing else to do are turning to crime, vandalism, drug abuse, joy riding and many other social evils.  I have close contact with young people and I know that they consider themselves to have been let down by the Government and by politicians in general with the result that they are now very cynical of politicians and of what we stand for.</P>
      <P>Our young people are not seeking too much.  They ask only for the dignity of jobs, for the right to work for themselves and their country.  It is a matter for the Government of the day to ensure that there is an environment in which young people can be hopeful and confident.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I accept that the Minister of State at the Department of Labour has made a small effort in this regard by way of his announcement recently regarding a teamwork scheme.  We are told that up to 5,000 young people may be employed as a consequence of that scheme.  I congratulate the Minister on his efforts, but they may be just too late to stem the <Col N="1870" /> rising tide of anger and frustration that exists among our young people.</P>
    <P>Taxation is perhaps the greatest curse of our nation, especially as it applies to the PAYE worker.  I welcome the Minister's attempts to simplify the income tax code so that we will now have only three bands &mdash; 35, 48 and 60 per cent &mdash; but let us not be under any illusion that the Minister's proposals represent a radical reform of the tax system.  For too many years the ordinary PAYE worker has carried the burden of taxation.  There is urgent need for a total reform of the tax system with a view to giving to the worker an incentive to produce more and in turn to encourage employers to invest and develop in the best interest both of themselves and of the nation.</P>
    <P>There are very serious inequities in the tax system but there is no effort made in the budget to rectify this situation.  In July last the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism announced that the Government would be introducing indexation of taxation in the budget this year.  I concede that some attempt has been made at indexation but we are probably about £50 million short in terms of what whould be needed for full indexation in the income tax year.  The PAYE workers will be contributing this year £160 million more than they contributed in 1984.  There was a promise in <i>Building on Reality</i> that the overall burden of income tax would not be increased, yet the budget proposals proved that that was an idle promise.  How can the Government expect to collect an extra £106 million without increasing the taxation burden?  This is another example of the typical and mysterious juggling of figures in which the Government engage.</P>
    <P>The suggested radical reform of the taxation system is no more than a camouflage, a window dressing exercise by the Minister for Finance, while the burden of taxation has been shifted to the middle income group who are the new poor in society.  This section have been the constant target for attacks by the Government in terms of high taxation rates, increases in mortgage rates and no increases in the tax bands in respect of <Col N="1871" /> allowances for children.  In many ways that constitutes an attack on the family. Reform of and equality in the income tax system are essential.  The PAYE sector are not prepared any longer to carry the burden.  It is the duty of the Government to ensure that all sections contribute to the taxation net in a fair and equitable way.  The Government must ensure that those sections who are not paying their fair share are put in the position of having to do so.  There are well-heeled farmers and business people who are not contributing their fair share in taxation.  I submit that we are on the verge of a revolution in so far as the tax burden on the PAYE sector is concerned.  We should look to the report of the Commission on Taxation so that we might devise a more radical and equitable system, one that would help to satisfy the complaints of ordinary working people.</P>
    <P>Another area in which there is no investment in so far as the budget is concerned is agriculture.  For the past number of years there has been a serious decline in investment in this sector.  We are in the era of quotas &mdash; beef, grain, sugar and milk quotas.  I am beginning to wonder whether there is any future for farmers in Ireland.  Agriculture is an industry which should be yielding many jobs, especially at a time of high unemployment. We must have regard to the whole area of import substitution in the area of food.  Too much of our land remains with farmers who are too old to make the maximum use of the land. There is a need for a radical change in the pension scheme so as to encourage those older farmers to hand over their land at an earlier stage.  It is imperative to ensure the availability of low interest loans for farmers who are prepared to acquire and develop land.  There should be interest free loans for young farmers who are prepared to develop agriculture in such areas as vegetable growing because this development would be a help in our balance of payments in that it would eliminate the need for the large quantities of vegetables and other products that are imported.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> The younger farmers are not getting a fair deal from the Government.  I trust there will be a resumption of the farm modernisation scheme and of the AI and lime subsidies so that once again farmers may be given the incentive to develop.</P>
    <P>We must extend also the cow suckler scheme with a view to maintaining our beef herd levels.  That is one area in which there is tremendous scope for development and for farmers to make profits. Overall the farming sector has been neglected.  Many small farmers are on the poverty line.  They are living on a meagre income that makes it impossible for them to look after their families properly.  I know many farmers in County Wexford &mdash; and I have made representations on their behalf &mdash; who are looking for social welfare payments and for help from the health board to tide them over certain periods of the year.  Farmers have to suffer periods of drought and they have to endure bad harvests and those who are on a low income have not enough resources to tide them over such times.  I should like to see this Government and future Governments put a major investment into the agricultural sector, to radically develop the industry and to provide a proper plan that would evaluate the structure and importance of agriculture. By doing this we could help job creation that is so essential for the country.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is at the ridiculous figure of 234,000 and that may not be an accurate figure because there are many young people on short-term schemes or staying on in school for an extra year. Possibly the unemployment figure could be as high as 260,000 or 270,000.  That kind of figure may bring us to a flash point.  Many people are looking for work: some of them have lost their jobs through no fault of their own but others have never had an opportunity of working. Too many young people have never worked since they left school and many of them are married with young families. That is not in the best interests of the country and it behoves us as politicians to tackle the problem.</P>
    <P>In Wexford unemployment has <Col N="1873" /> increased to an unprecedented level in the past year.  The rate of increase was particularly severe in November and December 1984 and throughout January 1985.  Now some 7,580 people are unemployed; in the county.  In Wexford town 24 per cent of the workforce is unemployed; in Enniscorthy the unemployment rate is 17 per cent; in New Ross it is 19 per cent and in Gorey it is 17 per cent.  This gives an average of 20.4 per cent throughout the county while the national average is 17 per cent.  County Wexford is 3 per cent above the national unemployment average.  Yet, in deputations to Ministers and in representations to the Government we are told that Wexford should not be given priority treatment in regard to unemployment.  This Government have a duty to create jobs in every county but particularly in counties that are hit harder than most.  In Wexford we are 3 per cent above the national average and we are in need of priority and instant action in the area of job creation.</P>
    <P>There are three Fine Gael Deputies in Wexford and one Labour Senator.  The three Deputies have neglected County Wexford.  It is a marginal constituency but they have not put the pressure on the Taoiseach and Ministers to ensure that we get extra priority.  If this Government remain in office for the next two years, which seems unlikely, I hope those three Fine Gael Deputies will manage to get some jobs for Wexford and give some hope to the unemployed.  People have the right to obtain jobs and have the dignity of work.  If those Deputies do not succeed in this task, I am sure that only two of them will be returned to the Dáil, and possibly only one.  Their efforts are being examined and in my opinion and that of many others they have done nothing for the county.  I have no doubt they will be given their answer at the next general election whenever it takes place, whether it be next month, next year or in two years time.</P>
    <P>There are areas to which we should look for job creation and one such is natural resources.  Successive Governments in the past have gone down the road of having big industries, of the <Col N="1874" /> IDA giving massive injections of grant aid to various concerns who leave after three or four years.  In my town of Enniscorthy we had many instances in which this happened and in which there were massive job losses.  In the future Governments and politicians should look to our natural resources for job creation. This applies to forestry, fishing, tourism, building and the agricultural industries. If the same investment were given to these sectors by the IDA or some other body that might be set up to consider our natural resources, I am sure we could create jobs at a cheaper rate.  We could ensure that the money would remain in the country and that we would not have to import vast quantities of timber and vast amounts of fish, to mention a few items.  I should like us to set up a proper structure within some Department &mdash; perhaps in the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the Department of Fisheries and Forestry or the Department of Agriculture &mdash; where the various sectors could be considered and where development could be carried out that would be in the best interests of the country.</P>
    <P>The development of our natural resources has been neglected for many years.  Only 25 per cent of the timber requirements of the construction industry are supplied by the home market but our timber resources are in the region of £1½ billion.  We are doing nothing to manage or to regulate that resource.  It could make a major contribution to the development of the country but it is not being looked after properly.  At the moment a number of sawmills are closing down, are going into voluntary liquidation or are being put into receivership by banks or other lending institutions.  That is a grave crime when we should be developing the industry and providing the requirements of our building sector.</P>
    <P>In fishing there has been some commitment by the Government: in particular there has been some development work by the last two Governments to help this sector.  There is tremendous potential in this industry for job creation.  However, we must have investment, the proper <Col N="1875" /> strategy at top level, proper marketing and the right loans structure to enable fishermen to invest at low interest rates in boats and in the processing industry. Many fishermen are hardly able to survive in view of the very heavy repayments they have to make on their boats and some of them are in arrears with their payments and are unable to meet their commitments.</P>
    <P>I should like to see the IDA play a greater role in the fish processing industry.  In Wexford and in Kilmore Quay in particular in the past few years two factories were grant-aided by the IDA and now there are about 300 people working in a small village.  There is much more scope for such kinds of development. I hope the Minister will continue to ensure that the rights of fishermen are protected.</P>
    <P>We are threatened by Spain and Portugal's entry.  I would like to see the Minister adopting a very tough line but I doubt if he has the financial resources or the manpower to take action against the Spaniards if they decide to fish our waters illegally.  At present we are not in a position even to control salmon fishing on our rivers.  There is massive salmon poaching and interference with salmon fishing, and in the eastern inland fisheries area they are very short staffed.  They do not have a pollution officer or an inspector and two or three years ago they had five people patrolling the River Slaney but now they have only two.  The Government do not seem to have much of a commitment to the control and development of the inland fisheries industry.  I doubt if the Minister is in a position to protect larger fishermen but I hope he will make some effort to ensure that their rights are protected and that the factory type ships used by the Spaniards are not allowed put our fishermen out of business.</P>
    <P>I welcome the 10 per cent VAT reduction on newspapers.  This is essential if we are to protect the jobs of those employed on local newspapers.  We have two local newspapers in Wexford, one on a three day week.  This reduction in VAT is a step in the right direction but perhaps <Col N="1876" /> the Minister will go a stage further and give our newspapers a chance to complete with the British tabloids.  Those newspapers are selling for 17p or 18p each and they are being bought by many young people.  May be it is because of page three or the sporting coverage but whatever it is, I would like the Minister to make it more difficult for these papers to be sold here.  Many people buy a paper for sporting information.  They may want to back a horse or to take some sort of a gamble. They are not interested in what type of paper it is.</P>
    <P>The Minister should look at the possibility of having a nil VAT rate on newspapers because the present tax is a tax on people who want to read the news and what is happening elsewhere.  I read a short time ago that the British Government were trying to introduce VAT on newspapers but there was a public outcry. I would like to see action taken to ensure that fewer of these trashy newspapers come into this country.  We should protect our own industry because our daily and Sunday newspapers provide an excellent service and they can hold their own with newspapers of any other country. We have excellent reporters.  We should support the newspaper industry, local and national, and do our best to protect them.</P>
    <P>A number of representations were made to me about private cinemas.  The VAT rate on private cinemas has put some cinemas out of business and will put even more of them out of business in the near future.  Many private cinemas in major towns have closed down or are about to close down because of the high VAT rate.  One of the councillors in the Enniscorthy area owns a cinema.  He has tried to provide a service for the people, particularly the young people, in that town where we have a massive unemployment rate, and the young people have hardly anywhere else to go.  I hope influence will be used to reduce the VAT rate to 5 per cent for privately owned cinemas.  They have been part and parcel of the life of our towns and villages down the years and it is only right that they should be helped to survive.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1877" /> We hear a lot of talk about this Government's commitment to social welfare and the Labour Party being the conscience of the working class and the poorer section of our society but one can only be amazed at the small increase in social welfare payments given in this budget &mdash; 6 per cent for old age pensioners and the long term unemployed &mdash; not even in line with inflation.  This will increase the hardship and poverty felt by many families and old people.  The Minister should have another look at this area and the increases should at least keep pace with inflation to help the old people, the long term unemployed, the underprivileged, deserted wives and all those living below the poverty line.  These people should have a decent standard of living but with the present social welfare payments they are finding it more and more difficult even to survive.</P>
    <P>There has been no increase in children's allowances.  This could be described as an attack on the family.  The children's allowances should have been increased because this money is used to pay the electricity bills and other commitments every month.  As I said, the Minister should have given a substantial increase in the children's allowance. There has been talk that at some stage children's allowances would be abolished by this Government and that the new allowance would be means tested or index linked but, whatever Government are in power, I would not like to see these allowances abolished.  I would not like to be part of a Fianna Fáil Government which tried to interfere with the children's allowance.  It is sacred to the housewife.  These allowances should be maintained regardless of income or family circumstances.  I will fight to ensure that children's allowances are never abolished.  I ask Coalition Members to ensure that children's allowances will always be part and parcel of family life.  A person some people might consider as well-to-do might be more dependent on the children's allowances than those who might be described as ordinary people because she may be in very difficult <Col N="1878" /> circumstances and have many problems to face.  I would like to see children's allowances retained.</P>
    <P>The building industry has been devastated by the increase in the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent.  The effect of this increase on the construction industry will be to increase the VAT take from the industry by £75 million in 1985-86. Private housing, agricultural areas and other commercial developments will be reduced by £40.5 million and £30 million will be taken from public works done by the private sector.  The building industry at present is not job creative due to lack of investment by the Government. I wonder why all Coalition Governments seem to shy away from investment in the building industry.  The increase has been delayed until 1 May, but I hope that on that date the Minister will not increase the VAT rate from 5 per cent to 10 per cent but will reduce it from 5 per cent to a nil rating.  If he does that he will have done a tremendous day's work in relation to job creation in the building industry. At present 50 per cent of building workers are unemployed.  We should put a massive investment into the building industry.  Not alone would it help that unemployment problem and help to create jobs but it would solve many of the social problems that exist because of the need for schools, houses, regional colleges and whatever.  I hope the Minister will see his way to completely removing VAT from the building industry. There has been an increase in the grant from £1,000 to £1,750; but the increase in the price of the average house will be £1,714, so the house purchaser will lose about £1,000 despite the fact that the grant has increased.  That is all due to the increase in VAT.  It was a nonsensical decision by the Minister.  Representations had been made to the Minister but he failed to realise the consequences of this increase.  After the budget there was a delay in the implementation of the increase to 1 May and I hope that the Minister has delayed the implementation in order to have another look at it with a view to removing it completely so as to protect existing jobs in the industry and <Col N="1879" /> to help create more jobs.</P>
    <P>Many problems facing the country must be tackled by the politicians.  Many people see politicians in general as living in an ivory tower in Dáil Éireann protected by huge salaries and getting perks such as ministerial cars and drivers, expenses and so on.  We must ensure that the people have confidence in politicians. We must ensure that their right to earn a decent living and to the dignity of a job is respected.  The people have the right to develop this country as they wish.  It is appalling that our highly educated young people cannot, because of the lack of jobs, contribute to the growth of the country.  They want to work and contribute, but they cannot.  Regardless of political persuasion it is important that we as politicians realise the consequences of our present situation for the future.  We should be prepared to give the people the type of country they want for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>In welcoming this budget I congratulate the Minister on his efforts, but as a Border Deputy my congratulations have to be muted and qualified.  Welcome as the measures are, they are not enough.  I am concerned about what is happening to the north-east region where I live and which I would describe as the hind tit of Ireland.  The pendulum of deprivation has swung in recent years from the west to the north-east region, the Border region, which in last year's European Economic and Social Council report was identified as being among the most deprived areas in Europe.  Those who have the misfortune to live in the region are well aware of it, as evidenced by Deputy Faulkner's speech last night.  While the Minister deserves some degree of congratulation for trying to alleviate the hardship that is being felt in that region, he has not gone far enough.  Before I concentrate on my parochial area I will touch on some other sectors to which the Minister applied himself in the budget.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first sector is the newspaper industry.  Like many other speakers, I <Col N="1880" /> welcome the reduction of VAT on newspapers. I have been in the newspaper industry all my life, not in the glamorous journalistic section but in the basement section, the distribution area.  I am well aware of the tremendous increase in the cross-channel newspapers that come here.  There is a sizeable population here who relate more to Britain because of buying the <i>Daily Mail, The Star</i> and <i>The Daily Mirror.  The Daily Mirror</i> is the one newspaper with a climbing circulation here.  They have now got a very significant hold on the market.  The reduction in the VAT was very timely, because the bell was tolling for the Irish newspaper industry and there were many newspapers in great difficulty.  This reduction was welcome and I congratulate the Minister on it.</P>
    <P>The Government should look at the possibility of creating a Press Council because the level of journalism has undeniably slipped.  The existence of a magazine called <i>The Phoenix</i> and the licence it takes should be curbed.  It is deplorable that reports that frequently appear in a mass circulation Sunday newspaper are totally fictitious.  In many cases the stories are clearly unsubstantiated. It does not reflect great credit on the newspaper industry.  It is a tragedy to see a paper of the calibre of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> in difficulties while another mass circulation newspaper yearly announces tremendous circulation increases.  It does not say much for the readership and it is an indictment of many of them.  It underlines the need for adult education classes.</P>
    <P>The other area I would like to touch on is in relation to the betting tax.  Here I would take a slight bow on behalf of my colleague, Deputy McCreevy and myself, in giving the nudge to the Minister to reduce the betting tax from a penal imposition of 20 per cent to 10 per cent.  I know the Ceann Comhairle would not know much about the racing industry&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>A continuous monthly expenditure monitoring system has been in operation in the Department of Finance for almost 20 years.  The purpose of the system is to provide up-to-date information on expenditure trends both capital and non-capital. This enables the Government to track potential budgetary variances from an early stage in the financial year and to take corrective action when necessary. At present, under the improved arrangements which have been in operation over the last two years, at the beginning of the financial year, each Department compile a profile showing month by month how they intend to spend their approved budgetary allocations, both capital and non-capital.  When these profiles have been approved by the Department of Finance, they provide the framework for monitoring expenditure trends during the year.  The spending Departments report <Col N="1882" /> each month to the Department of Finance on how actual expenditure is progressing by reference to the profiles.  This information is incorporated in monthly budget trends reports prepared by my Department for the Government.</P>
      <P>The effectiveness of the monitoring system has made an important contribution to ensuring that overall budgetary targets for public expenditure in recent years have been adhered to.  The monitoring arrangements are reviewed from time to time, however, to ensure that they continue to generate good quality information on expenditure trends.  In this regard, work is proceeding in my Department on computerising the processing of the monthly returns.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister has pointed out that there has been a monitoring procedure in his Department for 20 years and suggested that this is now being computerised and I should like to know if he will explain to the House why the Government have found it necessary to appoint a committee, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Defence, not Finance, to monitor public expenditure in the fashion which has always been the responsibility of the Minister for Finance.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The last matter raised by Deputy O'Kennedy does not have anything to do with the subject matter of the question.  It does not have anything to do with monitoring expenditure.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to refer the Minister to statements issued last week through Government spokesmen to the effect that a committee of the Government, under the Minister for Defence, was being set up to monitor public expenditure.  Is that not an indication that the Government have found that the Minister for Finance is ineffective in his job in his Department?  Will the Minister indicate the role of the committee under the Minister for Defence in terms of monitoring public expenditure or will he repudiate what has been said by a Government spokesman and <Col N="1883" /> reported in at least three newspapers last week?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>It falls to me to say &mdash; I say it with every confidence &mdash; that the Government have, I think I may say, complete confidence in the Minister for Finance in so far as the discharge of his functions in relation to public expenditure are concerned.  I should point out that the Government would be confirmed in that view by looking at how things have progressed since 1980 and particularly in each year at the difference between the original budget figures and the final outturn figures at the end of the year.  We have enormously improved budgetary forecasting and we have also demonstrated that if Governments wish to do so they can ensure that expenditure remains on target.  That is the purpose of the process which was the subject of my answer.  The job being done by the committee referred to by Deputy O'Kennedy, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Defence, is a completely different job.  It illustrates how the Government take very seriously the principle of collective responsibility.  It is one manifestation of the Government's intention to review critically all areas of public expenditure to ensure that taxpayers are getting good value out of the way the Government spend their money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is not prepared to indicate how the committee will monitor public expenditure beyond making the general statement that it is in line with Government policy.  In view of the provisions of Article 28.4.3º and Article 28.7.1º of the Constitution which clearly imply that the control of public expenditure is a matter for the Minister for Finance, does the Minister not acknowledge that this seems to suggest that the Minister is not effectively discharging his responsibility in the view of the Government?  Will the Minister agree that it is totally unprecedented to have any Minister other than the Minister for Finance, and his Department, monitoring public expenditure?  Will the Minister comment on the fact that the role of the <Col N="1884" /> committee, as stated by the spokesman, is to effect savings in view of the fact that already the budget will be off target by £50 million due to wrong projections for unemployment benefit and the impact of the consequences of the Government's dollar borrowing policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The setting up of the committee does not suggest any of the things which Deputy O'Kennedy in his wistful wishful way has suggested.  The setting up of the committee does not in any way interfere with or cut across the statutory and constitutional duties of the Minister for Finance.  For Deputy O'Kennedy to try to suggest otherwise is, I suggest, downright plain mischievous.  The function of the committee is completely different.  Its function is to review overall public expenditure with a view to ensuring that we find ways of making certain that the taxpayer gets good value out of public expenditure. It is a completely different matter altogether and one on which the Government are properly taking a collective view.  Deputy O'Kennedy is barking up the wrong tree.  The claim he makes about the budget being off target at this stage is not justified by reference to any other matters he referred to.  It might be interesting to give the figures.  The difference between the budget projected expenditure and the final outturn on the current side in 1980 was £186 million; expenditure was £186 million over the projected target.  In 1981 the difference was £397 million.  In 1982 expenditure was £92 million below the budget target. In 1983 current expenditure was £8 million over the budget target and in 1984 current expenditure was £57 million below the budget target.  That indicates clearly that I, and my Department, in the exercise of our control functions in relation to public expenditure have been discharging that duty with an improved degree of effectiveness over the past two years.</P>

What the Minister presents as progress means that we have the highest budget deficit target and I should like to ask the Minister if that means that we have the highest budget deficit target already of £1,234 million and the highest on record in terms of GNP percentage.  Will the Minister acknowledge that £50 million is the figure being mentioned in comments on the committee?  Will the Minister agree that the only way the Government can reach that £50 million which is a consequence of his wrong calculations on unemployment and borrowing is to cut back on normal services, be they social welfare, health or otherwise that were originally sanctioned in the Estimates published&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that right at the heart of the administration of Government we have an obsolete, inefficient and totally wasteful power station burning in the order of 3,000 to 4,000 tonnes of peat per annum, giving very bad temperatures varying from almost subarctic to Sahara Desert temperatures in this House and throughout the entire Government building complex?  This includes the National Gallery, from which have come complaints that some of the works of art are under threat from pollution as a direct result of this power plant within a stone's throw of where we are sitting today.  Surely the Minister would not dispute the fact that it is a matter of extreme urgency that we convert this obsolete power station to natural gas without delay.  It is a terrible example to the nation, given the fact that our smoke levels are 50 per cent up on last year.</P>

It is intended that the 20 installations now being converted will be used to monitor the success of the transfer and that the experience there will be taken into account in further installations.  Some solid fuel installations are being converted to natural gas, but we have concentrated on oil burning stations because of the oil being imported.  Solid fuel is generally a native fuel, as is natural gas.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance the reason for the delay in sanctioning an extension of the River Robe drainage scheme so as to include Hollymount River which was the subject of a report commissioned by the Office of Public Works, as the report was presented to the Department some months ago and nothing in it precludes drainage in the area, fear of which was the reason given for not having drainage of this river included in the scheme long before now.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commissioners of Public Works have been examining the economic and environmental implications of including the Hollymount River in the Corrib-Mask-Robe catchment drainage scheme.  They have also been considering the feasibility of the works in the light of the report of their consulting hydrogeologist on the likely effects of drainage on groundwater conditions in the area.</P>
      <P>Until the examination of these matters has been concluded, I cannot say if or when the Hollymount River might be included in the scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am given to understand that the studies have been completed and that the report has been with the Minister's Department for a considerable time now.  I understand that there is nothing in the report which precludes drainage in the area.  In view of the urgency of having this matter decided fairly soon, because the scheme is drawing to a close and because of the nature and extent of flooding in that area and the acreage of good quality, fertile land involved, would the Minister have immediate attention given to this report, if that has not been done already?  Would he divorce this matter from the overall review which is taking place in his Department with regard to drainage?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>It is true that the report is in my Department.  The Deputy is well aware that that report does not preclude drainage of the area.  At the same time, it is quite clear that certain precautionary measures would have to be taken.  When the Corrib-Mask-Robe scheme was started it was considered that this area was outside that scheme.  The Deputy was on a deputation which met me about this question.  I appreciate that the question has been on the Order Paper for some time.  A few things would have to be considered &mdash; for example, the effects of the drainage of the area on the local water supplies and in particular on the Ballinrobe supply.  Furthermore there are environmental implications which are under consideration in consultation with <Col N="1891" /> the Department of Fisheries and Forestry. Until all these matters are resolved no decision can be taken in regard to the drainage of the Hollymount River.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickJMorley" hpid="Mr. Morley Mr. Morley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it not a fact that the principal purpose of commissioning the report of the hydrologist was to determine whether drainage in that area would interfere with other water schemes in south-east Mayo including the Ballinrobe water scheme?  The finding of the hydrologist and his team indicated clearly that drainage at Hollymount would not in any way interfere with the Ballinrobe water scheme or any of the other water schemes in the area.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Morley</NameTxt>
      <P>People were given to understand that if the hydrologist's report so found, the scheme would go ahead. Would the Minister now consider making the necessary funding available to allow the scheme to commence?  With regard to the cost benefit analysis?  is the Minister aware that experts in his own office have already reported that the extra cost involved in carrying out the scheme would be more than compensated for by the minimal expense which would be required to maintain it because of the quality of the land and the nature of the terrain in the area?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>What the Deputy insinuates in his supplementary question is not quite correct.  Drainage could be done.  That is in the report, but certain specific things would need to be done which would add to the cost.  This has to be considered.  Further environmental implications are under consideration in conjunction with the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  The Deputy is well aware of all this because we discussed it at length when I met the deputation.  It was not in the original scheme because it was considered to be too costly.  I was not in office at that time.  That was many years ago, before the Corrib-Mask-Robe scheme started.  It was not considered <Col N="1892" /> economic at that time.  That consideration has still to be taken into account. Since it was not included at that time the full statutory obligations of advertising the scheme and displaying exactly what was being done would have to be met before it could be included.  All this would add to the cost of the scheme.</P>

The Deputy knows the legal process we would have to go through to do that, which would also add to the cost.  It would then have to go back to the Government for sanction, because it would be a new scheme since it was not included seven or eight years ago in the original scheme.

As part of a contract which has been carried out to provide improved heating in the National Library it was found that some old asbestos insulation was breaking loose on the original heating pipes.</P>

      <P>All the information I have here and all I know is that the area was deemed to be satisfactory by a factory inspector of the Department of Labour.  It was also deemed to be satisfactory by the IIRS, who are the experts in this field.  It was considered to be all right and safe for anybody in it.  The pipework in this area has been reinsulated with an improved insulation material.  A contract has since been completed for the removal of asbestos insulation and reinsulation of the pipework in the pump room in Leinster House.  It is proposed to carry out similar works in conformity with standard safety measures in other parts of Leinster House.  These works will continue, particularly when the heating station has been closed or when the House is closed during the summer months, as and when it can be carried out.  These are old buildings where there has been <Col N="1896" /> asbestos.  I should say there is no asbestos being used in new buildings being built by the Office of Public Works.  I am satisfied that every precaution is taken for the protection and safety of everybody in connection with asbestos.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>The Erne scheme is included in the national list of arterial drainage being undertaken.  It is a priority scheme.  A scheme for the southern reaches of that catchment out from and through Belturbet into Upper Lough Erne was prepared by the commissioners as far back as 1970.  It was not proceeded with at that time because its costing was considered uneconomic.  The catchment as a whole was the subject of a comprehensive study carried out in 1979 prepared for the Governments of the Republic and the United Kingdom and carried out in collaboration with the European Communities.  One of that study's recommendations was that the drainage scheme of this part of the catchment should be undertaken.  The House should remember that that was a recommendation only.  Since then, with the resources available, it has not been found possible to proceed further.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Actually there were three surveys carried out in that region concerning the drainage of the Erne catchment.  The purpose in each case was economic development, North and South, relating to agriculture and tourist development.  That was accepted by Ministers, North and South, by the British Minister and was submitted to the EC Commission.  We were told a month ago <Col N="1900" /> that it is now of poor economic merit. Who took that decision?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>However, that is vastly different from a recommendation. One scheme is now ready to start.  By the criteria given by the Office of Public Works on the economic value of a scheme, there is nothing to prove that this is economic now.  When it was examined in 1970 it was declared uneconomic and there is nothing to lead me to believe that anything has changed since then in spite of the recommendation.  Having regard to existing commitments and pending the outcome of the review of arterial drainage, I cannot say when the possibility of carrying out such a scheme could even be considered.  If there was plenty of money available&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that one of the cost-benefit analysis criteria for arterial drainage is the productivity of the region in which the drainage has to be done?  Does he also agree that it is singularly inappropriate to mention 1970, three years before we joined the EC?

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure that there is validity in Deputy Wilson's remarks.  However, I wish to point out that all these questions are about the review of arterial drainage and it was decided in October 1982 that arterial drainage should be reviewed.  Note the date.  The decision then was that a review of arterial drainage policy should be undertaken to ensure that satisfactory returns from investment in this area would be achieved.  It was decided that a report should be prepared for submission to the Government.  Those decisions were <Col N="1902" /> made by a Fianna Fáil Government in 1982&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>A comprehensive study of the Ballinamore-Ballyconnell canal, which includes hydrological considerations, is at an advanced stage and it is expected that a full report, which will enable a decision to be made on the question of restoring the canal, will be ready by mid-1986.</P>

      <P>At a time when there is so much talk about canals, does the Minister agree that the benefit of a linkage between the Shannon and Erne systems, from the point of view of tourism, would be beneficial?  Does he also agree that it would be one of the finest waterways in Europe and that it is important to proceed with restoration as quickly as possible?</P>

      <P>I agree and this restoration work has been going on since 1971 but progress was very slow until last year.  Additional staff were assigned to the work in early 1984 by the Office of Public Works in consultation with myself and in response to points made by the Deputy.  Since then the work has accelerated. The studies will encompass also drainage aspects as well as the restoration of the canal.  We hope that the work will be finalised in mid 1986.  One might say that the progress was nil up to early last year.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that, following a deputation who met here with senior engineering staff of the Office of Public Works on 19 December 1980, a decision was made to conduct the study?  Would the Minister agree also that the decision to suspend arterial drainage and to disregard the Erne will have serious effects and will result in a failure to get the best value from the scheme?</P>

      <P>I will not deny that a decision to conduct a survey may have been made in 1980 but, as I have said, there was hardly any progress on the work until the Office of Public Works and myself early last year appointed additional personnel to the scheme.  I stand over those facts.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister distinguishing between the problem of drainage and the problem of equipping the waterway as a navigable link between the Erne and the Shannon?  Since there is a Canals Bill before the House, would the Minister consider taking over this canal scheme totally just as the Royal and the Grand Canals have been taken over?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two aspects in this regard.  There is the drainage aspect and the navigation aspect.  The canal has not been open since 1870 so we should not become too panicky about it. However, I believe it should be opened and I indicated that early last year by putting additional people to work on the project.  I am sure that this canal, like the Royal and Grand Canals, could be taken over also but not within the terms of the current Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JosephBermingham" hpid="Mr. J. Bermingham Mr. J. Bermingham">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bermingham</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not accept that.  We are a statutory body and we have the function of collecting the moneys spent on drainage schemes and coastal protection work.  The amounts are estimated some time after the middle of the year for the following year and include any shortfall that may have arisen in the previous year.  For the past couple of years we have been limited as to the extent by which we can increase the amounts.  Last year we were limited to 6 per cent while in the previous year the figure was 5 per cent.  The increases are based on the previous year's experience which is different from basing them on the previous year's estimate.</P>

      <P>Until such time as the law may be changed, we are bound to collect the money.  As a member of a local authority I am well aware of their problems; but we have a statutory obligation, first, to maintain the rivers &mdash; we can be prosecuted for not doing so &mdash; and, secondly, we are bound to collect the cost involved from the local authorities.</P>

      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1907" /> not agree that prior to the abolition of rates there was a separate charge in respect of drainage works and that therefore, moneys that were collected in that way are no longer available to local authorities?  This leaves them in a very serious position.  It is time that the charges were withdrawn completely and met by the Exchequer because county councils are not able to meet their obligations in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGahon</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we adjourned the debate I was congratulating the Minister for giving much needed relief to the hard-pressed newspaper industry. There is no doubt the Irish paper industry was in a parlous condition and that many jobs were at risk in provincial newspapers and in national newspapers.  There was a question mark over the survival of at least two national newspapers.  I suggested that the time was ripe for the creation of a press council because I think the level of journalistic licence has exceeded the bounds of acceptability in some journals. The reduction in VAT was welcome and opportune because the circulation of the Irish papers was wilting under the onslaught of papers such as the <i>Daily Mirror, The Star and The Sun.</i> Our papers were unable to compete with the cover prices of the English newspapers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I congratulated the Minister and Deputy McCreevy for combining so effectively to reduce the penal imposition of 20 per cent VAT on betting to the more realistic figure of 10 per cent.  I do not have to tell anybody here of the importance of the Irish racing industry. We lead the world in few things but we lead it with the Irish thoroughbred.  The whole Irish racing industry will benefit from the reduction in tax to a more realistic level.  The man in the street, the bookmaker and the racing industry will benefit but the chief beneficiary will be the Minister because it is an open secret that there was very considerable evasion of betting taxes.  I should like to think that perhaps my own honesty was to a small degree rewarded because Deputy McCreevy and I had to run the gauntlet of some rather self-righteous and sanctimonious criticism, including that of that unofficial ombudsman, the noted letter writer, Liam T. Deegan.  However, we succeeded in getting the tax reduced and from various contacts I believe it will be <Col N="1931" /> a success.  While there are a few cowboys in different areas, the Exchequer will benefit tremendously.  If the bookmakers and the punters play their part, I hope we may have a further reduction to 5 per cent next year.</P>
    <P>Unemployment is the burning topic in this country, next to the biggest problem which concerns the rising crime rate. Many speakers have suggested that the unemployment level is a recent phenomenon, something that has occurred since we came to office, but that is ridiculous. Unemployment is a problem that is relative to each year and the reason Fianna Fáil are in the political wilderness is because of the level of unemployment in recent years, allied to the ball and chain that hangs around their feet, namely, the 1977 manifesto.</P>
    <P>I suggest the time has come for a radical reappraisal of the unemployment situation. Up to now we have been following conventional, stereotyped Civil Service schemes but they are no solution.  The various schemes put forward by AnCO and the National Manpower Agency are welcome but basically they are 20th century relief schemes.  There is no continuity and many young people are frustrated when they find after completion of a six-month course that there is no possibility of continuing employment. That is why the Government should address themselves seriously to this whole matter.</P>
    <P>Many radical proposals will have to be considered.  The concept of work sharing will have to be examined and that will be bitterly resented by those who are fortunate enough to have jobs.  However, if the thousands of young people are to have any hope of employment, work sharing must become a reality in the future.  I suggest that the Government should consider the introduction of an attractive, tax-free retirement incentive scheme to allow people in the public sector to retire at 60 years and ultimately at 55.  In that way we could create employment and set a good example in respect of work sharing.  The abolition of overtime will also have to be considered.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> Another thorny question that will have to be looked at is the number of married women who are working.  I am sure I shall draw the wrath of most of the married women when I say that but I believe there are many elderly married women who are working who do not need to work.  In this connection I refer in particular to the nursing and teaching professions.  There is a school outside Dundalk where there are seven married women employed and each of them is married to a person who is in good employment.  I do not think that should be allowed to continue.  In the case of elderly ladies whose families are reared, they should move aside and allow young people &mdash; perhaps their own daughters and sons &mdash; to get employment.</P>
    <P>I should like now to say a few words about my own devastated region.  I referred to it earlier as the hind-tit of Ireland, the neglected region of the country. I suggested the pendulum of deprivation had swung from the west of 25 years ago to the north-eastern region of today. In the report last year of the European Economic and Social Council it identified the Border areas as the most deprived in Europe.  I have lived all my life in Dundalk and I can vouch that Dundalk is on its knees.  It is pleading for help and I am pleading on its behalf for some Government support.</P>
    <P>In the 16 years of the horrific Ulster troubles no other town has suffered as badly as Dundalk and compensatory measures have not been introduced by any Government.  Yet, the British Government have introduced compensatory measures for the border towns in the North.  They have provided millions of pounds for extensive developments, for housing programmes, leisure centres, libraries and swimming pools.  My town has been denied any of that kind of money but the more serious aspect is the unwelcome tag we have been given by the foreign media of El Paso.  That has definitely proved to be a deterrent to the efforts of the IDA to attract industry to my region.</P>
    <P>The last investment in Dundalk was in 1969, 16 long years ago.  Dundalk is the <Col N="1933" /> largest town in Ireland with 27,000 people.  Our problems have been further exacerbated by the slow demise of the footwear industry.  For many years we were proud of our footwear industry. Dundalk was the home of the footwear industry but now the bell is tolling for that industry.  There is very little hope for it because of our entry to the Common Market and the removal of various tariffs.  At one time more than 2,000 people were employed in the footwear industry in Dundalk but now there are only 100 to 150 with the proposed closure of Clarks (Ireland) Limited.</P>
    <P>Several Fianna Fáil speakers from my constituency have suggested that the Irish Government were at fault for this closure but that is nonsense.  There has been a gradual demise in this industry since our entry to the EC ten years ago.  I refute the suggestion that the Government did not react quickly enough to the closure of this factory.  I want to say quite categorically that this Government were monitoring the situation and were fully aware of the precarious existence of Clarks factory.  Contrary to the usual procedure, in which companies in difficulty come to the Government looking for help, this Government called in the management of Clarks on two occasions and offered them very attractive incentives to stay here.  But Clarks had a death wish; they wanted to fold up.  I believe the Brighton bombing was the final nail in the coffin.  That spelled the end of Clarks as we knew it in Dundalk.  I want to state categorically that this Government acted very responsibly in this case.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has done a lot to alleivate the hardships in the Border region but he has not gone far enough.  If the measures he has introduced, such as the reduction in spirits, are effective, why not do the same for beer which is the drink of the average working man?  I believe the law of diminishing returns exists in that area; but, if the Minister reduced this tax on beer, it would discourage people from crossing the Border.  The real reason people cross the Border is because of the difference in VAT rates and the only answer in the long term is <Col N="1934" /> the harmonisation of VAT rates North and South of the Border.  A country with 3,500,000 people cannot compete with a country with 60 million people and more efforts must be made to harmonise VAT rates.  Otherwise the north-east region of this country will be decimated.</P>
    <P>The increased price of petrol has only increased the attractiveness of crossing the Border.  I would like to draw the Minister's attention to the figures released by the Ulster Office.  They said that £500 million was spent across the Border last year.  I cannot understand how that can be condoned.  The once ghost town of Newry has been turned into an El Dorado as a result of Government policies.  Recently the chairman of the Newry Chamber of Commerce stated that 80 buses each Saturday were going into Newry and that in the 12 weeks before Christmas people from the Republic had spent £150 million in the Six Counties.  Dundalk and other Border towns are haemorrhaging as a result of that.</P>
    <P>I would like to mention the threat posed to one of Dundalk's remaining industries, an industry of which we are particularly proud, and that is the 150 year old industry of P.J. Carroll.  They employ 600 workers.  This firm made 115 people redundant last year for the first time in their very proud history.  This is one of the showpieces of Irish industry and is the particular pride and showpiece of Dundalk.  Out of the £350 million which the Exchequer take from the cigarette industry, P.J. Carrol contributed £175 million plus a further £12 million in employees' taxation last year.  That is a very sizeable contribution.  While I appreciate that there is a very definite health hazard associated with cigarette smoking, in a democracy the right to choose is paramount.  I believe the threat posed to the industry by the Minister for Health is very serious because of its unfairness to home market producers. They cannot advertise yet imported magazines carry large glossy advertisements which were placed outside the country.  That puts the future of the Irish tobacco Industry at risk and does not <Col N="1935" /> make for fair competition.  The industry recognise that there is a health hazard associated with cigarette smoking, but they feel they have been penalised unfairly.</P>
    <P>A further inequality associated with the cigarette industry is the fact that each year they are regarded as fair game by successive Ministers for Finance.  Everyone accepts that, but each year the industry is taxed at double the rate of inflation.  That is very unfair to the man in the street and to the industry, which is worth £350 million to the Exchequer. Some recognition of the value of that industry should be introduced.  I suggest that the drink industry brings more hardship, and in some cases even death, to families and the time has come for an easing of the taxation burden on the cigarette industry.  This is the heaviest taxed industry in the country.</P>
    <P>Dundalk cannot wait for a possible harmonisation of VAT rates in years to come.  Some method must be found to stem the flood of people converging on Belfast, Armagh and Newry from every county.  The Southern Irish market is so lucrative to the people in the North that the Belfast City Council have taken a stand at the Leisure Fair Exhibition in Dublin.  They are offering all types of incentives to people to cross the Border, including the offer of free holidays to the winners.  Last November we had the spectacle of CIE carrying 2,000 people across the Border to leave their money with Margaret Thatcher.  A semi-State body should not offer cheap excursion fares.  The people should be asked to spend their money here so that their children will have a future.</P>
    <P>I commend the Government on the definite success of the enterprise allowance scheme introduced this year.  It was introduced as a pilot scheme with 100 places and there was an avalanche of applications.  The Government opened the doors to receive them and up to 6,000 were accommodated in self help enterprises. This is an excellent scheme which allows people to try to initiate some type of business for themselves with State <Col N="1936" /> help.  Outside of Dublin the Dundalk area was one of the best successes.  It indicates the level of unemployment in my town, a level which has now risen to 24 per cent of the workforce.</P>
    <P>I listened to other speakers enumerating the difficulties of their counties on the employment front and, while I understand their plight, the plight of Dundalk is the worst.  The unemployment problem here as well as the money flowing across the Border has combined to ravage the whole area.  There are more shops for sale in Dundalk than at any other time. We are in a desperate plight for employment. Dundalk has been upgraded by the IDA in recent times but the emphasis on obtaining employment in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick has not been placed on obtaining employment for Dundalk.</P>
    <P>The Government have now accepted the great need for employment in the town and I urge them to bring in a major replacement industry for the shoe industry which sustained Dundalk for so long.  The Government should give priority to the needs of the Border areas and must accept that the biggest town in Ireland, Dundalk, has been denied a major industry for too long.  Political expediency could attract industries to that region and on behalf of the people of Dundalk and north Louth I demand that this Government bring an industry to Dundalk in the next two years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is the last day of the budget debate.  I studied the budget carefully for some weeks and I conclude that it is nothing short of an unimaginative budget.  There is a start in it to the process of taxation reform, and I support the Minister in that.  But if he adheres to existing policies the promise which he made to this House of a comprehensive tax reform within the lifetime of his Government will be exposed as a bogus promise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The budget does not contain any measure which will directly stimulate employment, and certain measures will have the opposite effect.  There is nothing in the budget to stimulate investment, which is <Col N="1937" /> projected to decline in percentage terms over the next few years, and at a time when the need for productive investment was never greater.  The Government's fiscal strategy is failing and the cost in terms of redundancies of the Government's attempt to tax their way into fiscal balance has been horrendous. There has been no appreciable progress in reducing the current budget deficit despite the Taoiseach's statement some weeks ago in an interview that since coming to power his Government had halved the Government deficit.  The projected current deficit this year is 7.9 per cent of GNP which has little changed from that when the Government took office.  Unless the Government introduce further deflationary measures later on in this year to take account particularly of the underestimation in the provision to finance unemployment there will be additional slippage in the current budget deficit this year.</P>
    <P>This time last year the Government were still insisting that they could totally eliminate the current budget deficit by 1987.  In order to adhere to the fiscal targets that are quite clear in the national plan, of which this budget is a first instalment, the Minister has used seriously misleading data.  It took over a year for some of us on this side of the House to convince the Minister that the levels of VAT and excise were counter-productive and that diminishing returns were setting in.  Now the Minister has gone to the opposite extreme and relies on buoyancy to create £58 million.  Hardly was the ink dry on the Minister's speech when additional cuts of £28 million were announced.  It is now clear that the provisions for unemployment assistance, which is now costing £1 out of every £3 contributed in income tax, have been significantly underestimated.  The budget figures are quite clear.  The budget is based on having an unemployment level of 217,000 and the Minister admits that the figure is now 20,000 higher.  The budget makes no provision to pay this extra 20,000 people.  How can we say in the budget that unemployment will be 217,000 and put a figure in to pay for that <Col N="1938" /> and then stand aside and watch it go up by another 20,000 without a comment as to how it will be paid for?  Does the House realise that unemployment has risen by another 20,000 since November and this is only the beginning of March?  Is it possible that the Minister with all his advice can be so far out in his Estimates as to predict an unemployment figure of 217,000 and bring forward his budget figures on that basis and then two and a half months later find he is off target by 20,000?  That question has still to be answered to the satisfaction of this House.</P>
    <P>In the 26 months that have elapsed since the Government came to office the unemployment figure declined by miniscule amounts on only two occasions before returning to its upward trend. Unemployment will continue to rise even though emigration is at levels we have not seen since the hungry fifties.  This budget does not provide any stimulus to help industry to produce the kind of employment we need for our population.</P>
    <P>I wonder do people realise this or do they just regard it as another statistic, but industry here is operating at 60 per cent of capacity.  The EC average today is 80 per cent.  Why are we so far out of line with the rest of Europe?  It gives the lie to the suggestion that this is a worldwide depression from which Ireland cannot escape.  Our industry is working at 60 per cent of capacity compared with 80 per cent throughout the rest of Europe.  That means that Irish industry will take another 40 per cent just to fill its order books.  That is the difficulty facing us. It is not only our capital, factories and machines that are being underutilised; it is also our people.  The percentage of the manufacturing labour force which is unemployed is continuing to rise.  Two weeks ago in this House the Taoiseach informed me in reply to a question I put to him that over 20 per cent of the manufacturing labour force were out of work.  One person in every five in that key area of our economy, the area we look to to create growth, the jewel in the crown, is now out of work.  There is more than 20 per cent unemployment in the <Col N="1939" /> engine of growth in our economy. Another engine of growth is the building industry, our second largest industry. Virtually half of the labour force in that industry are out of work.  Are we able to get behind that figure and think of the devastation it brings to those who work in the industry and to the country?  Let us look at the picture: one in five are out of work in manufacturing and one in two in the building industry.  If those two sectors do not improve our economy will not improve.  It is important on this the last day of the budget debate to stitch that into the record again.</P>
    <P>At this stage most people are tired of the debate on the budget which has been going on for weeks.  It is almost a grinding end to a elgthy, boring debate but it is not so boring or so much of a chore for us as it is for those in the manufacturing or building sectors who must face the unemployment figures on a daily basis.  It is hard to convey to the House the sense of depression that must be in those industries. It is hard to convey how such people feel about the matter.  After all it is looked upon as just another debate with the politicians waffling on about unemployment.  I consider it more serious than that.  We should try to convey the depth of human misery involved in all of this.</P>
    <P>The recent small reduction in electricity charges was welcomed but our industries are at a major disadvantage <i>vis-avis</i> other member states with regard to the cost of electricity.  The evidence in the recent NESC report shows just how much out of line our electricity charges are compared to our trading partners. The decision to levy an additional 10p on a gallon of petrol or road diesel will exacerbate the difficulties of the industries that depend on transportation. Many industries depend on transportation and I do not need to list them.  Many of our industries are also extremely vulnerable to changes in interest rates. According to the Confederation of Irish Industries, had the Government managed their financial affairs better in 1984 <Col N="1940" /> the pressure which caused the sudden rise in interest rates in December might have been avoided.  The importance of this lies in the fact that companies' dependence on borrowing has continued to rise.  I wonder if we realise that more than 50 per cent of the profits of most Irish companies goes to pay interest.  Most companies are working for the banks with 50 per cent of their profits, which are miniscule, going to pay interest rates.  They must make 50p in the pound to pay back the interest on borrowings before they make any profit.</P>
    <P>Real interest rates here are over 8 per cent, after one adjusts for inflation, and that compares with a figure of under 4 per cent in Germany.  How many projects can currently be expected to yield anything like that rate of return?  It is clear without labouring the point that the budget did little or nothing to ease the interest rates.  Stemming directly from the Government's financial handling of the financial position, particularly in 1984, this year they will borrow an additional £2 billion.  We should be clear about this because if one throws out a figure like £2 billion it sounds very interesting but we must remember that the additional borrowing of £2 billion brings the total debt of this small nation on the edge of Europe to £18 billion.  I do not wish to be unduly political about this because I know that all Governments have made some attempt to do something about borrowing but, unfortunately, the saga goes on.  Unfortunately, nobody seems to be able to put a stop to it.  Last year we owed £16 billion and, although I have read speeches by Ministers to the effect that the Government were tackling borrowing, that the figure was being reduced, it was under control, we were turning the corner and the books were back in order, this year the figure has risen by £2 million.</P>
    <P>If the unemployment price we had to pay here was one that gave us a reduced foreign debt, if I could say to unemployed young people that we cannot tackle unemployment and deficits at the same time but the sacrifice they were making in not having a job was worth it in the <Col N="1941" /> national interest because the debts were being reduced and we were getting the books into shape, they would feel that they were serving the nation in some way by being unemployed.  What can I say when I sympathise with them for not having a job but go on to point out that we owe more money now than we did last year?  It is a poor deal for the unemployed. On the one hand we do not appear to be able to tackle the problem of unemployment but at the same time the deficit is rising.  In other countries, such as the UK, there is some benefit from the huge unemployment problem to the extent that the borrowing is coming down.  Here we have the worst of both worlds, rising unemployment and deficits.</P>
    <P>We cannot sustain a debt of £18 billion. We cannot go on increasing it by £2 billion annually and cod ourselves into the conclusion that we are tackling the nation's finances.  I do not know what it will take to tackle the problem.  I have put some proposals before the House but I must point out to all politicians, in Government or in Opposition, that we cannot be here next year and owe £22 bilbillion and two years later owe £22 billion. Where will it stop?  Who will pay for it?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no easing of advance corporation tax or VAT at the point of entry in the budget.  In effect they represent a free loan from hard pressed industries to the State.  There is hardly a board of directors that does not have the question of more redundancies on its agenda for its meetings.  The reason is not the low productivity of workers or the excessive take home pay.  It is not the wage competitiveness which seems to obsess the Minister for Finance.  The real problem is that excessive non-wage labour costs such as PRSI are discouraging employers from taking on workers and provide every incentive to employers to let workers go.  It is the first element <Col N="1942" /> in any cost cutting programme.  This is compounded by an industrial policy that makes it significantly cheaper to use capital rather than labour.  If an employer uses a machine he gets a grant and a significant tax concession.  If an employer takes on a worker he is taxed 20 per cent PRSI on that worker.  That is a 20 per cent tax on jobs.  Why should any board of directors put on their agenda a proposal to increase their workforce when they have to pay 20 per cent tax for each worker?  Is it not better for them to deal with the IDA and get handsome grants for increasing machinery.  We need a more sensible and balanced approach to industrial policy and the relationship between capital and labour.</P>
      <P>The national plan states that the fall in manufacturing industry over the last four years was attributable in large part to excessive increases in labour costs.  Yet the Government's analysis in their <i>Review and Outlook 1984</i> shows clearly that wage competitiveness has improved <i>vis-á-vis</i> our main trading partners.  This obsession with labour costs overlooks the fact that for many new industries wage costs are not the major factors which determine competitiveness here.  It is also overlooked that it is the non-wage labour costs, mainly the PRSI type of taxation, which are increased in the budget that are pushing up labour costs.  It is therefore all the more regrettable that there is no decrease in PRSI contributions in this budget.  It would have given employment here a marvellous boost.  I have called for that in this House time and time again. It makes no sense to put a 20 per cent tax on everybody employed in Ireland when we have 250,000 people on the streets. Would we not be far better having a PRSI structure which says that the more people you employ the less tax you pay?  Is that not the type of policy needed in this country, one which is called a pro-employment policy, based on employment, instead of saying to every employer: &ldquo;The more people you employ the more tax you will pay&rdquo;?  Is that not so remarkably simple as to be essential?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>You could have a sliding scale of PRSI bringing it down to, say, 2 per cent to <Col N="1943" /> 3 per cent when you get to over 100 employees.  The more people you employ, the less PRSI you should pay; and the sums that I have looked at in that regard would suggest that that system would pay for itself.  The extra people employed would almost certainly give the Exchequer a similar return.  I am quite convinced &mdash; and have not been contradicted as yet &mdash; that most insurance companies if given 20 per cent of everybody's salary would be able to provide an insurance scheme as good as that which we have at present.  I would not accept that giving an insurance company that kind of income on a long term basis would not allow them to provide that kind of scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister increases PRSI &mdash; directly the wrong policy for this nation at this time.  That makes it more unattractive to employ people.  I want to quote what the Commission on Taxation have said about the PRSI contributions.  Ministers quote from it when it suits them, but unfortunately when it does not they tend to ignore it.  They say:</P>
    <P>These contributions are a discriminating tax on employment and they are contrary to the declared national goal of achieving full employment.  They also reduce the competitiveness of Irish made goods on the home and the export market. </P>
    <P>A budget which fails to take account of that criticism must be exposed as unimaginative and bogus in that it has claimed to tackle the unemployment question but ignores the Commission on Taxation's proposals on how to tackle unemployment.</P>
    <P>The average family, especially those in the PAYE net, will find that their standard of living has been eroded in the past 12 months or so.  Unfortunately, the State has become adept at taxation by proxy.  In 1984 the Government's take from the PAYE sector rose by 18 per cent.  That is an increase of some 9 per cent or so in real terms.  That is quite apart from the quasi-taxation such as income levies, water rates, increases in <Col N="1944" /> health charges, utility charges generally. The net effect in these circumstances was that, after tax, income of most families fell sharply.  It ill becomes a Minister who has presided over the imposition of such a harsh tax regime to claim in this House credit in the budget for not increasing the tax burden further.  The burden is still alarming, at a rate of 36 per cent of GNP. It should be reduced.  Instead, the tax take from the PAYE sector is being increased in this budget.</P>
    <P>It is the ordinary depositor attempting, despite all the odds, to save some money who will end up picking up the bill for the levy imposed on the banks and the building societies.  It is nonsense to say that this is a tax on the banks and the building societies.  It will be a tax on the depositor, passed on to the depositor.  I should like to see measures to ensure that the banks and building societies are not in a position to pass this taxation on to the depositors, otherwise the Minister might just as well have announced an increase in taxation.  It would have been just as simple to collect it in that way.</P>
    <P>The standard of living of the average family will be hard hit by the imposition of VAT on clothing and footwear outside the context of the general form of tax system.  Higher prices for these basic necessities follow hard on the heels of the insensitive removal of the food subsidies last year.  Against this background it can be seen that the so-called tax cuts are totally inadequate.  For many families ri = "4"they will hardly offset the increase in value-added tax on petrol and cigarettes.</P>
    <P>The budget will also make it much more difficult for young couples to buy their own homes.  The Minister seems to be trying to create the impression that the increase in the grant to first-time house buyers covers the increase.  That is misleading. It is quite clear that it will not do that.  In most instance house prices will rise by 5 per cent, or about £1,500 on a £30,000 house.  Even then young couples and others with mortgages face increased repayments amounting to upwards of £30 a month.  The fact that all home owners and prospective house <Col N="1945" /> buyers now face higher repayments stems directly from the decision of the Minister in the budget.</P>
    <P>I was alarmed recently to read that some building societies are now saying that they will not lend people the additional money to pay the VAT on their houses.  I call on all building societies to continue their normal lending policy and lend for the additional VAT increase. Where are young people to get the additional cash on top of the deposit to pay VAT?  It is no consolation to young people to tell them that they will be lent the price of the house but that they have to find the value-added tax themselves. They will not be treated very sympathetically if they walk into any bank and ask to borrow the cost of value-added tax on their homes.</P>
    <P>How sensible is that policy when we have a massive waiting list for public housing?  Public housing is costing the taxpayer £4,500, £90 per week per house of a subsidy.  That is not the cost of building the house, but just the subsidy.  We are driving people out of the private house market into the State housing programme where we will have to subsidise them to the tune of £90 per week.</P>
    <P>This budget will also increase the very real poverty which is spreading like a cancer throughout the so-called middle class areas, the middle income groups. The Government's high tax regime has forced many into redundancies.  I represent a constituency with a high proportion of these people.  The after tax income of many of these who are still at work is now totally inadequate to meet their commitments to their families.  I have seen evidence of middle class poverty in my constituency &mdash; for example, massively increased indebtedness to banks and financial institutions.  Bankers have told me that most couples are now up to their necks in debt with little prospect of clearing such debt.  The St. Vincent de Paul Society recently reported 10 per cent of middle income families being in debt, not only to banks but also to moneylenders. That is totally unacceptable.  The policies contributing to that situation must change. <Col N="1946" /> I see also in my constituency forced sales of the family home.  Building societies have indicated that many families now have fallen behind in their mortgage repayments.  The number of repossessions, although still small, is growing and an increased number are being forced to sell their homes, for which they worked so hard, and to trade down, if they can, to a smaller house.  Some that I know personally are forced to sell at prices which represent a crippling loss.  Most building societies would admit that the owners of a number of middle income familes have been increasing to quite a worrying rate.</P>
    <P>The number of families who can afford to run a car is also falling.  There is plenty of evidence for that.  New car sales have halved in the past few years.  The total number of cars in the country has declined significantly.  The Automobile Association have quantified how much this budget will cost the ordinary family motorist.  The Minister has criticised the Automobile Association for exaggerating, but he is wrong and the figures confirm this.  The motor industry and the family motorist know it.</P>
    <P>There is evidence also of increased marital strain.  While the causes and effects are not always easy to disentangle, all the indicators point to the reality of growing despair behind the lace curtains and the French doors of modern suburbia.</P>
    <P>The incidence of crime of all kinds has increased sharply.  I do not have to emphasise that point in this House.  They are clearly related to rising levels of unemployment.  They are not my words. The recent NESC study has shown that there is a direct link between crime and unemployment.  Some months ago I asked the Minister if he would provide tax relief for the parents of unemployed teenagers.  I repeat my request to the Minister in this House today.  Hard pressed middle income families, most of them deeply in debt, need some kind of relief if they have unemployed children in the household.  It is ridiculous that tax relief is not available to them.</P>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister also that he <Col N="1947" /> should cut out the nonsense and abolish the residential property tax.  When this was introduced the Minister told me in this House &mdash; and it is on the record of the House for anyone to check &mdash; that it would generate £6 million in a year.  I told him at the time that it would generate no more than £2 million.  Both of us were wrong.  It brought in £1 million.  It cost more than £1 million to run that scheme. The result to the State of all the fuss about the residential property tax, hours of officials' time, and so on, was a net loss.  The State lost money on that scheme and are still losing money on it.  That is not the only point.  For many families who have chosen to put their savings over many years into improving their homes, this tax symbolises the determination of the Government to penalise them as if it were some kind of crime to provide themselves with a home.</P>
    <P>The deficiencies in the budget reflect a wider deficiency in the national plan, of which this budget is the first instalment. As such one has to take a wider look at the budget.  The plan sets the parameters of the budget.  It is not enough to merely state the aim of reducing unemployment or restoring the public finances.  Everybody now shares these aims.  What is required is a coherent and comprehensive set of policies to achieve those aims. What is required is a series of budgets which provide for the implementation of these policies.  This House and the country have been disappointed on both counts.  The present policies are not coherent, inevitably so given the divergent ideologies involved.</P>
    <P>The controversy over the National Development Corporation, that ideological albatross, is but one example.  Nor are they comprehensive.  There is no discussion in the national plan on the financing of the national plan.  Nowhere in the national plan is there a mention of how it is to be financed.  Nowhere in the national plan is there any discussion or proposal on monetary policies.  Let me highlight those briefly before I conclude. There is no comprehensive proposal in that plan, of which this budget is an instalment, <Col N="1948" /> to reform taxation.  The measure in this year's budget falls short of anything like reform.</P>
    <P>In this context I should like to put before the House again, as I have done on two previous occasions, the words of the Tánaiste before the plan was published. He said they believed that any national, economic and social plan which failed to address the inequity in our system, an inequity which results in the PAYE sector paying a disproportionate share, is not worth the paper it is written on and that on present policies by 1987 the PAYE sector will be paying a disproportionate share of income tax.  We all know that.  The plan said taxation will not be increased further.  It is quite obvious that is not the direction to go in.  We should be trying to reduce it.</P>
    <P>Investment is set to decline over the duration of the plan.  That is in the plan. Yet the scope for productive investment and the need for such investment was never greater.  Unemployment, excluding special schemes, is set in the plan to rise in percentage terms.  The jump in unemployment in recent months which I mentioned earlier not only invalidates projections in the budget but also in the plan as a whole.  That is not just a politician talking.  A number of independent experts recently criticised the data in the plan on job creation as optimistic, even though it is predicting that unemployment will not get any better.</P>
    <P>In a series of Dáil questions recently I have been trying to press the Minister to give us more detail on the national plan. Unfortunately that is not forthcoming.  I challenge the Minister to say that this plan is anything more than a continuous squeeze on the PAYE sector, on public sector workers, and on those who depend on food subsidies.  The national plan of which this budget is part, is technically deficient and quite an inadequate response to the massive challenges which face this country.</P>
    <P>I want to conclude by saying that any objective analysis of this budget will show that the measures it contains cannot secure even the limited objectives which the Minister for Finance has set.  Already <Col N="1949" /> the Minister has been forced into a series of U-turns which further undermine the credibility of the budget.  It does not improve the environment for increasing employment.  How can it, when the measures it contains have increased industries costs, reduced profitability still further in Irish industry, and left a tax on employment in the form of PRSI at an alarming level?  It does not reform the tax system. It introduces a degree of simplification in the tax system which I welcome.  That falls short of anything which could be called taxation reform.</P>
    <P>The Commission on Taxation called our tax system muddled, complicated and inefficient.  Already the burden of taxation is at an excessive level.  That does not need to be stitched into the record of this House any further.  The budget ignores the position of thousands of middle income families caught in a poverty trap.  The full consequences of this are only now becoming apparent in increasing personal distress and growing social disorder in middle income Ireland.</P>
    <P>There is a positive alternative.  It is based on the central thesis of restoring the public finances in step with comprehensive and imaginative pro-employment policies.  Such processes will require the restoration of incentives to work, to save and to employ.  Over the past two years in this House I have proposed many steps forward which can be taken to restore growth.  I will not delay the House with the details of them today because many of them are on the record.  I suggested venture capital schemes, mobility between the public sector and the private sector.  I suggested a tax regime on firms directly related to the numbers employed and other pro-employment policies.  I put forward imaginative taxation schemes directed towards winning foreign markets. I suggested establishing Ireland as a European base for the financial services sector which is ideal for a country with very little capital and many unemployed. I proposed the establishment of agricultural zones which would allow for a Shannon Airport type of development around our smaller towns.</P>
    <P>I have suggested a total reform and <Col N="1950" /> overhaul of our semi-State companies because they now control the high ground of our economy, turning over £3 billion and employing some 54,000 or 55,000 people.  These are positive proposals I have put to the House time and time again over the past two years.  Unfortunately, all I can see in the budget is not so much that the detail but the direction is wrong.  We are not moving in the direction that will restore growth and some type of hope to the economy.</P>
    <P>I might conclude by giving the House a small example of one scheme I suggested during the year to do something about import substitution.  I spelled out the details of such a scheme on one or two occasions in the past, but let me show the House the need for such a scheme.  There is a small food distribution company in this city which imports £4 million worth of food every year.  I stress it is a small company only.  Their total sales amount to £4 million.  Yet they import £4 million worth of food.  I said to that company recently: &ldquo;Surely with all the young people unemployed you could start buying that amount of food domestically?&rdquo; They told me they had advertised in the national media, that they had contacted the Confederation of Irish Industry, the ACC, anybody who might be able to help them to find people who would manufacture the products.  The answer they received was that there was nobody in Ireland who could manufacture those products to the standard required by Irish supermarkets.  I asked them what these products were.  I said: &ldquo;They must be very sophisticated if you must import £4 million worth of them&rdquo;. I was supplied with a list of them.  Just to illustrate to the House the work that has yet to be done in this country, these products included for example, £150,000 worth of coleslaw, £50,000 worth of pork pies, steak and kidney pies, sausage rolls, smoky bacon, pies, cheese and onion quiche, celery salad, potato salad, vegetable salad, hamburgers, and so the list continues.</P>
    <P>I do not just pick that list out of the blue.  I put it before the House to demonstrate that in a country where we should <Col N="1951" /> be able to employ our young people by tackling industries like this there is a company in this city that must import £4 million worth of this type of product. Coleslaw must be imported because the people in the trade cannot get it manufactured here.  What do we do?  We pay out £600 million every year in unemployment rather than being imaginative, pushing out the boats, having some imaginative, radical policies.</P>
    <P>Let us take some risk on taxation, let us give some people a reason for working and for taking up such opportunities.  If, in the process, it creates a few millionaires, so be it.  Let the young generation at least aspire to being among that group of young millionaires rather than say to them: &ldquo;This country does not like people getting rich.  This country does not like people making money.  If you want to go on with that kind of nonsense you had better go to America.  You had better not try that kind of nonsense in Ireland because this is a socially-concerned State and we do not like people getting ahead of themselves&rdquo;.  We must change that philosophy and thinking.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately this budget has added to the despair in the economy rather than opening up the windows, showing people that while we believe in this nation, putting in a floor below which we do not allow our people to fall, we do not put in a ceiling just six inches above it and say: &ldquo;You cannot climb any higher&rdquo;.  Let us remove the ceiling.  Let people climb as high as they like.  Let them grab opportunities like the one I put to the House today, in that way pulling up the rest of the nation with them.  Let us keep the floor, because we are a socially concerned nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GodfreyTimmins" hpid="Mr. Timmins Mr. Timmins">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Timmins</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been suggested in recent years that in an economy such as ours with all the factors that govern it, budget day has no place in setting the targets necessary for its efficient working. There is no doubt but that this theory was gaining certain acceptance in many quarters recently, particularly in a time of depression which we have been experiencing <Col N="1952" /> now for a number of years.  This year's budget has certainly put the nail in the coffin of that argument, setting the tone for many years to come for us to pull ourselves out of the difficulties we have been experiencing.  The effects of this budget cannot be underestimated.  It is clear that it has been accepted by the majority of fair-minded commentators. Our people have seen at least that there is light at the end of the tunnel.  With the incentives afforded in this budget we shall at least see our people shake free of the depression into which we were slipping in recent years.</P>
      <P>The message is clear from this budget: we can and will overcome the obstacles and difficulties that have beset this nation.  No amount of praise on the part of Government Deputies or criticism by Opposition Members will add to or detract from the fact that our people have accepted the challenge posed them by the Government in this budget.  They are prepared to give them the necessary support in order to achieve a better standard of living for all.</P>
      <P>There has been constant speculation in the media and elsewhere that this constitutes the first budget of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Alan Dukes.  It must be remembered that, while, this has been the third budget introduced by this Minister, the first two were introduced in very different circumstances &mdash; the first when the Government had been only a very short time in office and could not give the necessary consideration, needed to budgetary strategy.  In last year's budget it was necessary that the Minister continue the process of re-establishing confidence in our national finances by bringing forward budgetary targets that could and were achieved for the first time in a considerable number of years.  The outcome for 1983 and 1984 showed clearly that the Government achieved those targets.  It must be accepted by all that confidence has now returned in the matter of the handling of our national finances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to deal briefly now with the overall position of our economy, and it is against this background that the budget must be viewed.  It will have been <Col N="1953" /> accepted by all that the current recession has been deeper and of longer duration than had been anticipated at its outset. We suffered here particularly because of the manner in which we spent our natural resources at a time when a more prudent attitude and approach were called for.  I am confident that we are now on the right road.  Given the basis of the national plan we can once again achieve an expanding economy.  The fact that inflation has been reduced dramatically over the past 18 months, together with the control of the budget deficit, means we are now placed in a better position to benefit from whatever international improvements there may be in the long and short term.  There is no doubt but that a major improvement has taken place in the United States. While the strength of the dollar has had a detrimental effect on our loan repayments and on the value of our currency, let us hope that at EC level Western Governments can become convinced of the need to act together in order to achieve the economic stability necessary to bring about the improvements of which we are all desirous.</P>
    <P>One of the major features of this budget is the radical reform of the VAT tax system and its beneficial effects on everybody.  Of their own admission the Government see this as the initial process in achieving a fair and equitable tax system for all our people.  The fact that this decision was taken clearly indicates that the Government are prepared and are able to take the radical steps necessary to get the country back on its feet. There have been the psychological effects on housewives of the reduction in the VAT rates which in many cases equates to a drop of 9 per cent in price and which will do much to illustrate that their concerns are heeded.  We are hopeful that in time the Government will be in a position to move to a single VAT rate struck at the lowest possible level.  For many years various critics of the Government have pointed to the high rates of VAT applicable here as against those in our competitor countries.  But in that time we lost sight of the fact that there were many <Col N="1954" /> things zero-rated here that were not zero-rated in those countries with which we were compared.</P>
    <P>In the budget the Minister has given an indication of his attitude and approach to the problem.  The improvements in the income tax system are extremely welcome and demonstrate that at last the Government are prepared to take the decisions necessary to lighten the burden on the PAYE taxpayers.  However, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that those who are liable for tax contribute their full share and this was mentioned recently at a meeting of a committee of this House.  The impracticality of collecting taxes from certain groups was also mentioned.  The answer is not to employ further tax inspectors but to devise a different system of payments for these groups if the current systems are not viable.  It is imperative that the overall tax take must be equitable, which will mean a greater tax revenue, thus ensuring that the burden is eased on the PAYE sector.</P>
    <P>I have already said that this budget will be seen in retrospect as a landmark in our economic development.  It could be described in many ways as a neutral budget, but its importance lies in the fact that it signals clearly that we are at the start of the long road back to a normal economic climate.  This has been demonstrated clearly by the favourable reaction in general which the budget has received. When one removes the arguments put forward by the Opposition as to why they oppose the budget it is obvious that, in their hearts, they accept that the Government have taken the right decisions on this occasion.</P>
    <P>While easing the burden of direct and indirect taxation is important, we must not lose sight of the fact that there is a long road to travel.  I agree with many of the observations made by Deputy Brennan, but one cannot travel the proper road unless one realises and recognises what the problems and difficulties are and, having recognised, understood and appreciated them, then tackle them.</P>
    <P>We must continue to look critically and honestly at the level and degree of public <Col N="1955" /> spending to ensure that we are getting value for money.  We must appraise certain activities in which the State should not be involved.  I am not dogmatic in this respect and I do not think that the State should only be involved in certain loss-making services.  Let us not be dogmatic in suggesting that the services now operated by the State must be operated by the State if they could be more economically organised within the private sector.  Having appraised the various services that should be run by the State, whether directly or through semi-State companies, we must as a matter of prime public importance ensure that in the spending of public finances we receive the greatest possible value for money. We are not doing enough to ensure that waste and duplication of resources are eliminated as far as possible and we must continue to support the Government in their task of seeing that scarce public resources are put to the best possible use. We must transmit a clear message to the public that, in decisions concerning the allocation of finance and the method by which Departments and semi-State bodies are run, finance is used prudently and wisely.</P>
    <P>The Government's decision to accept the independent pay award to the public service, despite the increased cost to the Exchequer, has received wide media coverage.  One could criticise the Government for not adhering to the stand they have consistently taken in the past in regard to pay claims.  However, that would be to misunderstand the role of Government and politics in general. Governments must achieve a consensus of sorts and they must be prepared to compromise if they believe it is in the public interest to do so.  The Government have shown good faith in this matter and I have no doubt that their gesture will be reciprocated throughout the public service. In the final analysis it will be seen as the right step to take.  I do not suggest that there may not come a time in the future when the Government will have to stand firm on demands made by various groups, but the gesture at this time will <Col N="1956" /> clearly show that the Government are not seeking confrontation, which would have a disastrous effect on the nation as we can see in examples from our neighbouring country.</P>
    <P>We must not confine our comments on industrial relations to the public sector: the private sector companies and unions also have a responsibility in this regard. We must all bear in mind that unemployment is our biggest problem.  All employees must modify their demands if firms are to survive and achieve the necessary growth to earn additional income to finance the necessary further employment.  Everybody who has a job must realise that no company, no matter how solid, is immune to closure if it cannot control its costs.  It must also be remembered that new technology and work practices play a significant part in the drive towards further employment. Those at work must modify their pay expectations and be prepared to give up outdated work practices which have no place in the 20th century.  Workers should have a self-interest in accepting these changes because the greater level of employment produced will mean a lesser burden on the State from claimants for unemployment and, consequently, the burden of taxation will also be lessened.</P>
    <P>Government and employers also have a part to play and their response must be radical.  The challenge of new technology is currently changing the face of industrial production with its consequent effect on employment levels.  We must realise that scientists have managed to reduce the manual content of everyday work and, therefore, have reduced employment levels in all Western economies.  We must share work so that all may benefit from involvement, although not necessarily for the length of time as at present.  This will have to be achieved by reduced working hours and by work sharing, which has tremendous implications for the current structure of society.  We must also educate our people so that they may benefit from their leisure time.</P>
    <P>When one examines the various proposals which the Minister introduced in the budget, it is clear that it is a challenge <Col N="1957" /> and, irrespective of party, we all hope, in the national interest that the Minister and the Government will be successful in their efforts to tackle the difficulties and problems which beset us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government should be in no doubt about what the people were looking for in this budget.  They wanted to see our massive unemployment rate tackled in a positive way because it is the cause of many of our problems, social and otherwise, at present.  The burden of taxation is also a cause for concern and no determined effort has been made to undertake a review of our outdated tax system.  There is no reduction in the level of taxation.  No effort has been made to restrict growth in taxation to the level of inflation, apart from taxation at the top of the scale.  Personal taxation for those in the upper middle bracket remains much higher in Ireland than in any other country.</P>
      <P>I should like to pinpoint a few areas in which the Government's policies have failed.  This year an extra £2,000 million is being borrowed to run the country. In the past two years our national debt increased from £12.7 billion to £18.5 billion and by the end of this year the figure is expected to be £21 billion.  Our foreign debt amounts to almost £8 billion as against £5.2 billion two years ago.  The unemployment figure is 234,000 or one in every six of the workforce.  Statistics indicate that the majority of the unemployed are in the 18 to 25 age group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have not escaped this problem in Kerry where the unemployment rate is very high.  Our only hope of improving matters lies in the setting up of a single estuary authority to control the Shannon. Through the Minister for Communications and the Tánaiste we have made submissions to the Government in this regard.  In addition we have had a number of meetings with our counterparts in Clare and with the Foynes and Limerick Harbour Commissioners on the matter. Our counterparts in Clare have agreed with us on a submission to be sent to the Minister regarding the setting up of such an authority.  This is our only hope for <Col N="1958" /> the development of that massive land bank along the Shannon between Tarbert and Ballylongford which has been in the hands of the IDA for a number of years. Such development would go a long way towards solving the unemployment problem in the region.  I appeal to the Minister to consider seriously our submissions in this regard.</P>
    <P>The weaker sections of the community have been treated badly, too, by the Government.  The minimum increase in social welfare payments is of the order of 6 to 6½ per cent payable from 11 July next.  That represents less than 3 per cent in a full year.  The double payment for the unemployed was not made at Christmas. The housewife is to be deprived of an increase in children's allowances.  Apart from the loss to her directly there is the general loss of not having that extra money in circulation.  There is to be a reduction also in pay-related benefit.  Let us contrast these policies with the policies adopted by Fianna Fáil in their last two budgets when every effort was made to increase the standard of living of the weaker sections.</P>
    <P>Regarding the change in VAT in respect of theatres, I understand that those concerned would have preferred if this had not happened because the change is a disadvantage in many ways.  Instead of exempting theatrical activities from VAT, they should have been zero-rated.</P>
    <P>The 5 per cent VAT increase on the construction industry is a further blow to that industry which is now estimating a loss of 5,000 jobs in the coming year.  We are told that employment in the industry is 60 per cent less than the summer 1981 level.  Public capital investment in the construction industry has been very much reduced and private investment in the industry is now almost nil.  The section 23 incentive has been abolished.  The cost of a house will increase by a minimum of £2,000, thereby putting house purchase beyond the reach of many young couples.</P>
    <P>There is no incentive in the budget so far as those engaged in the tourist industry are concerned.  Last year the Minister of State with responsibility in that area promised a reintroduction of <Col N="1959" /> the refurbishing grants and the introduction of interest-free loans to help that very depleted sector.  In Kerry alone more than 3,000 jobs have been lost in tourism in the past four years but those jobs could be regained by the Government taking the initiative and providing for some incentive in this area.  I am appealing for a commitment from the Government for a reintroduction on a permanent basis of the Cork-Pembroke ferry service.  I appreciate that £500,000 is being made available for a service for this year only because of the 800th anniversary celebrations taking place in Cork. Having regard to the importance of tourism to the Cork-Kerry region, it is imperative that the Government give a commitment regarding a permanent service on the Cork-Pembroke route.  We have been deprived of the services by vested interests.</P>
    <P>Cork and Kerry have done more for tourism than has any other county and we have done so with very little State aid.  We are still prepared to respond by investing in tourism but we must have a positive response from the Government.</P>
    <P>As a member of the Kerry Health Committee I am very concerned about the shortfall in the allocation to the Southern Health Board.  Are the Government and the Minister for Health slowly dismantling our health services?  The indications are that all the health boards will have to effect massive reductions in their services.  Last year a new general hospital was opened in Tralee with the promise that it would be operational fully by the end of October 1984 but that promise has not been fulfilled.  Instead, there is a threat that 80 of the 200 beds in operation may be closed.  This should not be allowed happen especially when there is such a massive shortage of geriatric beds in Kerry.</P>
    <P>Private and semi-private hospital accommodation has been increased by a massive 20 per cent.  In allowing this increase the Minister has ensured that many of those who up to now opted for the voluntary health service will no longer be able to afford their subscriptions in <Col N="1960" /> that regard and, consequently, will have to revert to the general hospital services. But these services are not at all adequate to cope with such an influx of patients.</P>
    <P>There continues the embargo on recruitment to the public service with the result that most Departments are now operating with greatly reduced staffing levels. I should like to refer particularly to the staff level in the office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  As Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee, I am aware that in the past six months there has been a massive shortage of staff in the various Departments.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has pointed out the extent of the workload in his office and how the embargo on recruitment in 1981 had affected the staffing levels and, consequently, his capacity to carry out his work.</P>

      <P>Deputy J. Leonard has been given permission to raise on the Adjournment the question of the closure of McElroy's furniture factory at Castleblayney.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to thank the Chair for the opportunity of raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I regret very much that I have to speak of the closure of one of the major industries in County Monaghan, one for whose products there is a market.  Unfortunately the industry was caught in the depression.  It was on short time a few years ago and often that is the beginning of the end because the cash flow suffers.  Probably the owners could not see any light at the end of the tunnel and they decided to take this action.  This industry was in a strong position for a long time but that situation changed and it shows how vulnerable all industries are at the moment. It also poses the question whether any industries are safe.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1961" /> This factory was established in the forties. It was started by two brothers from very small beginnings but through hard work and good business acumen it is now one of the finest production premises. Included in the complex is a machine shop roughly 30,000 square feet, a factory and assembly plant of about the same dimensions and there are also display centres and an administration area.</P>
    <P>This factory is located in what could be called the home of furniture.  The furniture and footwear industries are in the locality where the major sources of employment were when I first looked for a job shortly after the war years.  This factory was considered one of the best business places in the area.  Two years ago it had 120 employees who had steady employment: I have not the recent figures but I think the number has dropped to about 50 per cent.  The wage bill was approximately £500,000 and that loss will have major effects in the area.  The owners were good employers.  The conditions were good and the product was excellent.  The factory manufactured every kind of furniture, for the sitting room, dining room, kitchen and bedroom and all of it was in good quality hardwood. It was a fairly expensive product. After the war the factory manufactured a cheap product made of plywood but now people are more demanding and the factory changed its product to keep up with the times.  In 1981 they won the Furniture of the Year award in Birmingham. At that time they were on the crest of the wave.  They had a highly skilled workforce, fine premises and up-to-date equipment.</P>
    <P>In 1983 we imported furniture valued at £24 million.  The committee of Ministers of State that was set up to consider the question of import substitution should monitor the situation, through the IDA or Fóir Teoranta, to enable them to become aware of what is happening throughout industry.  The firm involved in this instance moved with the times and they employed some of the best designers. Those who visited the furniture <Col N="1962" /> exhibitions in Monaghan in the past few years were very impressed with the products of this factory.  I always attended those exhibitions and I realised that the quality was constantly improving.  This firm, with another group in Monaghan, were the trail blazers in the furniture business.</P>
    <P>In this Border area we are hit very badly in many sectors.  I am not so naive as to say that the Government are to blame for the closure in this case.  I am familiar with the background and I have been at meetings with the directors of that company with other Deputies.  We were also in touch with the IDA and Fóir Teoranta and were aware of problems with regard to cash flow and stock.  Even when we were talking to the firm they were negotiating with interests outside the country and considering linking up with an international group to supply furniture through their factory.</P>
    <P>The Department of Labour, the Department of Finance, the IDA and Fóir Teoranta should get together to consider the position of many industries. Many factories that closed did so because they were not competitive or because the markets abroad collapsed.  However, in this case we are talking about a saleable product, where there is a highly skilled workforce turning out a quality article. We will face a serious situation if, when this depression bottoms out in two or three years time, we find that we have lost valuable industries like this.  In this case in particular the factory had good markets in England and Northern Ireland where they could compete with the best.</P>
    <P>We have the Crannac example before us.  The Minister may say to me to go and organise the workers but it is not as simple as that.  In the past few months when the workers of this factory found that their business was slipping I am sure many were depressed and lost confidence. The most important thing for any industry is confidence.  It is my conviction that an air of depression is fatal for any undertaking.  I hope the various Departments I mentioned will get together and consider this whole matter.</P>
    <P>There is a serious problem when the <Col N="1963" /> liquidator moves in and I saw this recently in a factory in Clones that had a labour force of 40 people.  The public representatives had problems dealing with the liquidator, although we were trying to influence takers of that factory.  There should be some section in the Department which would negotiate with the groups involved.  Crannac was a shining example.  Many other firms tried to set up as a co-operative but collapsed. Nevertheless, in my view this is worth trying.  Many of those men got fairly substantial redundancy payments and I believe some of them would have been interested in getting a little help.</P>
    <P>In the early part of this century selfhelp was preached by many, Arthur Griffiths especially.  The co-operative movement was preached by men like Father Finlay, Horace Plunket and Paddy the Cope.  Never was the application of that co-operation spirit more needed than it is today.  We must have a hard look at workers' co-operatives.  We have read of such co-operatives in the west of Ireland and in the Basque area of Spain where entire areas were developed and revolutionised.</P>
    <P>There is no point in my telling the Minister that he should give these people money or get Fóir Teoranta or the IDA involved.  They have been trying to do that up to now, but I am asking the Minister to look at this firm again and maybe he will visit the factory before it goes into liquidation.  If he does, he will see that this is one of the best and most adaptable factory spaces in the country.  There is always a little strife in business but by and large labour relations there were good. They turned out a very good saleable product and the labour force was adaptable.</P>
    <P>When the first group were made redundant I met a man at my clinic who had worked 25 years in that factory.  He said he had never done anything but woodwork but over the previous month he had tried to get a job in every manufacturing outlet in County Monaghan without success.  He said that if he had to spend the rest of his life unemployed he did not <Col N="1964" /> know how he would face it.  This is the most serious problem.  Men with 15 or 20 years of their working life before them will find it almost impossible to secure alternative employment in my area.</P>
    <P>In every report carried out on the Border regions my area has been recognised as underdeveloped and disadvantaged. Over the years the IDA did terrific work developing industries but they are in a valley period at present.  The development organisations in the North are revving themselves up.  The factory in Clones is drawing workers across the Border because they have set up a textile industry there similar to that which closed on this side of the Border.  I can see serious implications here.  On the one hand, workers who regrettably lose their good jobs could be attracted across the Border because the Northern authority are setting up enterprises along the Border with the sole intention of supplying the market on this side.  We are not complaining because this is a two-way traffic but we could lose some of our best workers this way.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to ensure that all avenues are examined through the IDA and Fóir Teoranta and through discussions with some of the directors of that firm and the workers.  He can be assured that the public representatives of that area, without making political play of this, will do all in their power to get a taker for that factory or to ensure that a workers's co-operative will be set up.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EdwardCollins" hpid="Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins) Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)">
      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. E. Collins)</NameTxt>
      <P>First, I want to give Deputy Leonard an assurance that every effort will be made to find a new owner for the company.  He can also be assured that all the State agencies involved, particularly the IDA, will take every possible step in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to join with Deputy Leonard and the Ceann Comhairle in expressing regret about the difficulties in which McElroys have found themselves.  This has been a flourishing business for quite a long time, giving good, sound employment, and it was one of the largest furniture <Col N="1965" /> manufacturers in the country. Unfortunately, while many companies in this sector has been able to withstand the recent recessionary conditions, and indeed prosper within them, this company have been unable to overcome the difficult environment which currently exists on the home and export markets.</P>
    <P>Deputy Leonard was very fair when he went to some length to say that he did not want to point the finger at this Government.  He was quite right.  Each company has a responsibility to guard against an adverse trading condition. There is always a very grave responsibility on management to ensure that the financial, marketing and managing needs of the company are catered for.  That is often a very difficult task and in recent years the environment has not been the best for encouraging many industries.</P>
    <P>However, I do not think this enterprise should be written off and the Deputy can be assured that the relevant State agencies are doing all in their power to secure a takeover of this company. Deputy Leonard referred to the need for the Department of Labour, the Department of Finance, Fóir Teoranta and the IDA getting together.  The main rescue agency is Fóir Teoranta.  The IDA and Fóir Teoranta meet weekly to review cases of firms in difficulty.  That practice has been long-established and I review firms in difficulty on a weekly basis to ensure that the necessary steps are taken to protect companies and to ensure that companies in difficulty are either rescued under existing ownership or through new ownership.  That is a well-established practice in my Department and in the Department of Finance, who have responsibility for Fóir Teoranta.</P>
    <P>Obviously it would not be possible for me to go into detail of the discussions with the interested parties, or indeed to identify such parties in a takeover.</P>
    <P>However, I am hopeful that these present discussions will result in a favourable outcome for the workers and the other stake-holders in this long-established company.  I am particularly concerned for the future of the workers who have taken such a pride in their work and <Col N="1966" /> possess such valuable skills built up over the years.  Deputy Leonard pointed this out clearly.  It is an aspect of this case which must be fully considered and which will be an asset in relation to affecting a takeover.</P>
    <P>I would hope that, in the event of a takeover of the assets, the new developments occurring in the furniture industry in Ireland, especially in the area of the new export market initiatives now being taken, will find a ready response from a revived firm.</P>
    <P>While I would not wish in any way to minimise the very serious problems which have beset this company we can be encouraged that the furniture industry in general has weathered the economic recession perhaps better than many other sectors.  The industry has increased its share of the Irish market and also has made significant inroads into export markets in the teeth of intense competition from foreign manufacturers.  That is a healthy sign for the industry.</P>
    <P>My Department have always maintained a special interest in the furniture industry.  The Task Force on the Furniture Industry, which is chaired by my Department, comprises representatives of all the relevant State agencies as well as of the furniture industry itself.  The task force have done considerable work in the promotion of the furniture industry and have been particularly active in connection with the recent Córas Tráchtála initiative for a new concept in export marketing by Irish firms.  This new initiative, known as the Link Programme, has brought international marketing expertise together with the skills of the Irish furniture manufacturers to penetrate new markets in the United States and elsewhere. I hope that this programme will be well underway this year and will significantly boost Irish exports of furniture.</P>
    <P>I hope that a revived project arising from the McElroy operation will be able to avail of the significant advantages afforded by the Link Programme.  The prospects of being associated with such a programme should make the McElroy firm all the more attractive as a takeover prospect and I will ensure that the IDA <Col N="1967" /> and the other State agencies involved will spare no effort in securing a resumption of the high quality furniture with which McElroys has been associated in the past. The Deputy raised the question of co-operatives. I assure the Deputy that any proposal made to the State agencies involving the concept of a co-operative will be treated under the same criteria as other proposals to take over the firm. Any takeover of any firm must satisfy standard criteria in relation to finance, marketing, management and viability. We would be happy to see a co-operative structure evolve if it is a sound, viable proposition.  There is only a favourable climate towards co-operatives on the assumption that they are commercially <Col N="1968" /> viable.  That assumption is central to the consideration by State agencies of any takeover situation.</P>
    <P>To my knowledge there have been no industrial relations problems in the firm. There have been very good relations on the factory floor.  The situation in McElroys is an unhappy one.  Because of its tradition, the employment they have given and the high quality product they have produced I would be optimistic of a viable project coming out of the present difficult situation of the company.  I am optimistic that a solution will be found for this company.</P>

      <P>The latest assessment of his means entitles him to an old age pension at the reduced weekly rate of £9.30.

    </Speaker>
    <P>The person concerned was in receipt of the maximum rate of flat-rate unemployment benefit to 26 December 1984 <Col N="1922" /> when he exhausted 156 days of benefit. He did not fulfil the contribution condition for continuous payment of unemployment benefit at the maximum rate and accordingly his weekly rate of unemployment benefit was reduced from £61.40 weekly to £53.20 weekly from 27 December 1984.</P>
    <P>He is entitled to pay-related benefit of 56p weekly in addition to flat rate unemployment benefit.  Combined payments of £53.76 weekly continue to be made as they become due.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>Following the recent completion of inquiries, the pay-related benefit entitlement of the person concerned has now been determined.  He is entitled to this benefit but at the reduced rate of 60p per week.  The relevant legislation provides that pay-related benefit cannot be added to flat rate benefit to an extent which would cause total weekly payments to exceed 75 per cent of average weekly earnings in the relevant income tax year.</P>
      <P>In the case of the person concerned, the relevant income tax year is 1982-83 in which his average weekly earning were £94.96, 75 per cent of which is £70.85. He is in receipt of flat rate benefit at the weekly rate of £70.25 and his pay-related benefit entitlement is, therefore, 60p per week.</P>

Particulars of the number of gardaí of all ranks at each of the stations situated in County Meath on 31 December in each of the <Col N="1927" /> years 1982 to 1984 and on 28 February 1985 are given in the table hereunder. The Garda authorities have informed me that they propose to allocate an extra member to Ceanannus Mór station when the next group of recruit gardaí complete their training at the end of this month and that the question of allocating additional members to stations in County Meath will be kept under review.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the question of increasing Garda strength at Navan station to deal with drug abuse, the Garda authorities <Col N="1928" /> report that they consider that the current strength at the station is adequate to meet the present police needs of the area, including the need to prevent and detect drug abuse.  A total of 17 members assigned to Navan station have completed a special in-service training course on the various aspects of drug abuse, preventive measures and the special skills needed in the investigation of drug offences and while these members are not engaged exclusively on anti-drugs work, they pay particular attention to the problem.</P>

        <i>(Limerick East):</i> I am informed by the Garda authorities that a total of thirty-five offences against elderly persons were reported to the Garda in County Donegal between 1 November 1984 and 28 February 1985.  While attacks of this nature would always have to be regarded as serious, I understand that in only one case was physical injury caused to an elderly person.</P>
