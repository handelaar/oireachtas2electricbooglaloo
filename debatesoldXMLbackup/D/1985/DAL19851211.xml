      <P>The ruling made by my predecessor, and adopted by me, which I read out in the House was calculated to cut out unnecessary interventions on the Order of Business and to stop Members raising matters on the Order of Business that could be raised otherwise. What Deputy Cope Gallagher proposes to raise now does not come within that ruling.  It is as simple as that.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:</P>
      <P>In page 4, lines 33 to 43, to delete subsection (1) and (2) and substitute the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(1) Whenever an order is proposed to be made under sections 3 or 15, a draft of the order shall be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and the order shall not be made until a resolution approving of the draft has been passed by each such House.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that any alteration in sections 3 or 15 would have to be approved by a positive resolution of the Minister being approved by the House.  In my experience here I sought to have amendments to regulations relating to fuel allowances discussed in the House but I found it impossible to do so under Standing Orders.  If subsection (1) is allowed to stand the Minister can delete or add companies to the First or Second Schedule simply by presenting his order in draft, tabling it in the House and, if a resolution is not passed within 21 days annulling it, the order will stand.  Under Standing Orders the only opportunity a Member has of presenting a resolution seeking to annul that order is in Private Members' Time as the Government, as a matter of precedent, have refused to allow resolutions of this nature to be taken in Government time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The net effect is that, unless the major Opposition party are prepared to table a resolution and have it debated during the three hours of Private Members' Time each week, then individual Deputies who <Col N="1827" /> are not associated with that party are not in a position to have any regulations which are brought in under this kind of order annulled or even debated.  I draw attention to the earlier experience in relation to the fuel allowances where an order was made which we could not debate despite strenuous efforts and appeals, both to the Government and the main Opposition party.  In October, the Minister for Health found it necessary to table another amendment to his original amendment because he found his first amendment to be faulty.  There is no doubt that, had the debate been allowed, that fault would have been seen, recognised and deleted in the first place.</P>
    <P>As a matter of principle Deputies should be able to discuss orders made by Ministers if they so wish.  As Standing Orders stand at present, the kind of order proposed to be made under section 4 (1) will not be debated unless the main Opposition party of the day permit it to be done during Private Members' Time. I have examined the Official Report and over recent years there has never been such a resolution tabled by that party. That is why this amendment has been tabled.  Also, whether the Minister should add State-sponsored bodies or State-sponsored commercial companies to his First or Second Schedule is a matter of legitimate concern to Members of this House.  Consequently section 4 (1) should be altered as proposed in the amendment.</P>

      <P>First, I think that the Deputy would be importing an unduly bureaucratic procedure into what should be a simple process.  All that this order-making power allows is the addition of a new State body to the list of bodies in the Schedule with which the NDC could be involved in joint venture activity.  If one were to require an affirmative resolution of the House simply to add X State body to the list, that would delay the House considerably.  It is likely that the establishment of the new State body &mdash; and we have endeavoured in one existing list to be quite comprehensive as to existing <Col N="1828" /> State bodies &mdash; would have been approved in the House and its addition to the list of bodies with which the NDC could enter into joint ventures would require a second debate of a purely formal character.  It would serve no great purpose if the Deputy's amendment were to be met.</P>
      <P>Also, it is possible that the necessity to obtain Dáil time could delay investments being made.  From listening to the Deputy contributing in the House, I imagine that he is in favour of the State making investments.  I would have been less surprised had the amendment proposed come from the direction opposite rather than his direction.  In a sense what the Deputy is proposing would hold up the possibility of a particular State investment being undertaken if a new State body were coming into being and one of its early acts were to seek conjunction in some enterprise with the NDC.</P>
      <P>The Deputy made a number of interesting and fairly valid points about the availability of time for debating motions to annul orders.  This is a defect in our procedure from which I remember suffering when in Opposition.  In some cases in the past the Government did provide time but, in more recent times, successive Governments have not done so, and therefore what the Deputy has said is broadly true.  However, this order-making power is so procedural in nature that it would not warrant the kind of guarantees for which the Deputy is looking. I am afraid that the order will have to stay.  I hope that I have answered reasonably the Deputy's comments.</P>

      <P>I wish to seek clarification from the Minister as to whether there might <Col N="1829" /> well be unnecessary delays, especially as this order would have to be laid before the House for 21 sitting days.  In the event of an order being made, for instance at the start of the recess, one could find that there would not be 21 sitting days for perhaps four or five months and I would be worried about that.  It might jeopardise the prospect of a number of projects getting under way.  Could the Minister get around that type of situation?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That would not happen, because the procedure is that, once an order is made, even though it has not run for the 21 days on the Order Paper, anything done under it after it has been made is not invalidated, but is legal.  If it were to be annulled within the 21 days nothing could be done under it subsequent to the annulment, but anything done prior to the annulment would be legally valid.  I do not think the danger about which the Deputy speaks is likely to occur.</P>

      <P>The Minister is quite correct in saying that we are anxious that there should be investment in State-sponsored commercial companies.  There is nothing in what we have proposed which would inhibit that.  The Minister argues that perhaps it might create delays, but the procedure which we are seeking to introduce in relation to section 4 (1) does not place any time limit on when the order may be introduced.  There is no reason why a Minister cannot introduce an order into the House on the day on which it is required to be passed.  In my experience, certainly in the number of years that I have been here, the House has always been exceedingly helpful when Ministers have requested legislation to be passed in a hurry.  Indeed, some very major legislation has been passed in a matter of a half hour or hour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see no real opposition being brought forward to the inclusion of companies in the schedules concerned. There may well be opposition if the Minister or the NDC want to delete companies.  This section gives the Minister power to add <Col N="1830" /> companies to or delete them from the schedules.  If the Minister in his capacity as the person responsible for Dáil reform were to give me a commitment that he will listen &mdash; I do not know if he is listening&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>One of the procedural reforms in the works, so to speak, at the moment is one for allowing reports to the Dáil presented to committees or under statute to be debated here without a division being taken on the day of the debate.  Possibly this could be done on a Tuesday morning.  That is a proposal I have made but it has not yet been approved by the Government and I am not sure whether it will be approved.  It is possible that it could be extended to allow a debate on orders if Deputies felt they should be annulled, but the division would have to be some other time.  I am prepared to look at the possibility which the Deputy has urged in the context of what I have just described.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy is a bit naive if he thinks that there would be no problem in finding time for an affirmative motion of this kind on the Order Paper.  There may be needless delay because there is too much legislation, all of it urgent to some extent, at a given time on the Order Paper to be taken in the time available.  The Deputy <Col N="1831" /> may say that in very extreme cases matters can be dealt with on the day of introduction, but if we did that with all legislation there would be total chaos.</P>

      <P>I do not propose to delay the House much longer on this matter.  The Dáil is sitting until 11.30 p.m. or midnight at present to enable Deputies to participate in discussion on various points.  Perhaps that could be considered for one or two nights a week to enable items of this kind to be debated. I take the Minister's point in relation to unnecessary delay and I hope I am not too naive in relation to these matters.  A large number of regulations are made in this House by way of these &ldquo;negative&rdquo; orders on which Deputies have no opportunity to make their views known.  Some of these orders have quite wide-ranging effects.  That is why I intend to continue proposing this kind of amendment until such time as the House alters procedures to enable Deputies to debate these orders.  In view of the Minister's indication that he will look at this area of reform I will withdraw the amendment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 3:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following paragraph:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(a) to establish either alone or in co-operation with a State-sponsored commercial enterprise, any enterprise which, in the opinion of the Corporation, is capable of becoming profitable and efficient and has reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment;&rdquo;.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1832" /> The purpose of this amendment is two-fold. Firstly it transposes the existing sub-clause (c) to make sub-clause (a) of section 10(1).  This is to put the clauses in a more logical order.  What was sub-clause (c) is an innovative power, something unique to the corporation.  Its other activities will be conducted in conjunction with others and it seems more sensible to put this provision at the top.  The amendment also alters the wording of the existing subsection at section 10(1)(c) to make it consistent with the wording used in the remainder of the section.  This is achieved by inserting the concept that any enterprise established by the corporation under this subsection must, in the opinion of the corporation, be &ldquo;capable of becoming profitable and efficient&rdquo;. The wording does not require the enterprise to be profitable and efficient at the time the investment is being made.  It could not be since it is a new investment.</P>

      <P>I want to address briefly the amendment of section 10.  I mentioned it earlier at the beginning of the debate.  Without harping too much on the amendment, the Minister has given only a vague reason for finding it necessary to introduce an amendment to his original Bill.  It might expedite matters if I dealt with several amendments together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>The end of the Minister's amendment contains the words &ldquo;expansion, growth or providing viable employment;&rdquo;. I understood that the point in introducing this Bill setting up the National Development Corporation was to provide viable employment.  Section 10 and this amendment indicate that we have a choice.  I am concerned that we <Col N="1833" /> either become involved in enterprises which will become profitable and efficient with reasonable prospects of profitability, development and expansion or in the provision of viable employment.  I understood that the principal objectives of this Bill would include links with State-sponsored bodies and State-sponsored commercial enterprises and I suggest that there is a very real fear that such links would merely result in an additional layer of bureaucracy and I said so on Second Stage.  There are excellent examples of existing State-sponsored commercial enterprises which have developed new projects, many of them in areas well removed from the initial commercial mandate of the organisation.  The opportunity to develop a new project can best be encouraged by facilitating the development of existing organisations rather than by placing an additional layer of administration over and above them.  The doubtful word &ldquo;or&rdquo; providing viable employment should be changed to &ldquo;and&rdquo; providing viable employment.  They are two small words but very important and I ask the Minister to reconsider the wording.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I think Deputy Flynn made that point &mdash; or perhaps it was Deputy Lyons &mdash; on Second Stage and I have been thinking about it.  There is sense in the thinking which prompted this amendment and I have dealt with it in amendment No. 18 which says &ldquo;in carrying out its objects the corporation shall have regard to its general duties under section 13&rdquo;.  One of their general duties is to assist in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State.  Therefore, an umbrella provision affecting all the items in section 10 is the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State.  Under section 10 the corporation must have that in focus all the time.  Under section 13(b) the corporation must carry out their objectives in such a way as to enable them to make a reasonable return on any investment made by them.  That requires that the profit motive must apply to the corporation in respect of all their activities. <Col N="1834" /> The point which the Deputy made is being met in another way.  There is a slight danger that his provision would be unduly rigid and I will elaborate briefly in that regard.  His amendment requires that any investment would have to have reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth and providing viable employment, because that is the interpretation when the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; is applied.  If you put &ldquo;and&rdquo; in place of &ldquo;or&rdquo; each of them has to be achieved. However, there could be cases where a company has prospects of profitability and provides viable employment but who, for one reason or another, do not wish to or cannot expand.  That could conceivably, although it is not very likely, be a problem.  In response to the points made on Second Stage I am dealing with it in a better way than that suggested by Deputy Lyons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting the change of words at the bottom of each section. The Minister suggested that I was introducing a change of wording right through the section.  I have no such proposal.  My amendment merely suggests deleting &ldquo;or providing viable employment&rdquo; and substituting &ldquo;and providing viable employment&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Maybe we are talking about different things.  I am not just looking at amendment No. 8 in the Deputy's name but also at amendment No. 4 where he deals with subsection (1)(a).  In amendment No. 5 he substitutes &ldquo;and&rdquo; for &ldquo;or&rdquo; in subsection (1)(b) and the same applies right down to amendment No. 15. These imply that the projects would have to have reasonable prospects of profitability, development, expansion, growth and providing viable employment.  I do <Col N="1835" /> not think that that is what the Deputy wants but my advice from the draftsman is that that would be the effect of his amendment.  In practice, it is likely that any investment which has a prospect of achieving profitability and viable employment will also probably provide development, expansion and growth, so I concede that the Deputy's amendment would not cause enormous problems. However, in theory it could, and in drafting legislation of this kind we try to avoid even theoretical dangers.  As I said, I tried in amendment No. 18 to meet the Deputy's point by making the whole section subject to section 13.</P>

      <P>My amendments on section 10 are consistent because they are so repetitive.  When there is such repetition the words need to be examined very thoroughly. I accept what the Minister has said, that technically and theoretically there may be problems, but this is not the case in practice.  The Minister referred to section 18 but what he said does not remove doubts I hold.  When this Bill was introduced we were told the purpose was to create viable employment.  There has been no definition of the word &ldquo;profitability&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>I am sure the Minister understands my concern in this matter. To create employment any development must be profitable.  People may have an ideological hang-up about profits but if profits cannot be made people will not invest.  Profit is necessary to create employment.  The development and expansion of growth would provide this extra employment in the normal course. I am concerned that we use the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; providing viable employment instead of using the word &ldquo;and&rdquo; and I am concerned this may have an adverse effect in achieving the aims of the NDC.  Section 10 is a very important section of this Bill.  Perhaps the Minister will see if he can allay my concern in the matter.</P>

Though <Col N="1839" /> the private holding companies have not been very successful, it is something new for the State to get involved as a holding company.  I should like a clearer definition of &ldquo;holding company&rdquo;.  Would the Minister indicate, too, how he proposes to get funding for the holding company? I understand that a holding company means an undertaking that would operate from one base, that it would have funding available to buy up something new.</P>

      <P>In the original draft of the Government plan and the party programme, the NDC were envisaged as a holding company for virtually all semi-State bodies.  We considered it carefully and came to the conclusion that this would simply add another layer of bureaucracy.  There would be discussions between semi-State bodies concerned, the holding company and the Minister, so there would be three lines of decision making.  Such decisions should be made immediately in many cases, and we dropped the idea that the corporation should be a holding company for all State companies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this section we are giving the corporation the power to be a holding company, perhaps for a group of State companies. For instance, Údarás na Gaeltachta might establish a commercial fish farming undertaking and we might have some other State company, the ESB for example, developing the same type of activity in their hydroelectric undertakings. The NDC are already involved in fish farming and from the point of view of national management it might be better for the NDC to act as a holding company for the fish farm operations rather than have the ESB holding shares in one operation and Údarás na Gaeltachta holding shares in another.  The whole operation would be gathered together under the NDC with that body overseeing the operation and using their expertise.  We considered that such an arrangement should be facilitated in this section and I hope Deputies will see it in that light.  We do not want to lumber the NDC as a holding company for all State <Col N="1840" /> companies because the corporation should be concerned only with new operations rather than the resolution of old problems.</P>

      <P>It is, but it is not possible through this section for the corporation to become a holding company for existing State enterprise unless that enterprise is starting a new activity.  After the passing of the Bill, such a State company could transfer its operations to the NDC.</P>

      <P>If a future Government were to decide that portion of a State company, for instance, Irish Life, the ICC or Aer Rianta, were to be floated, would it not be convenient to have a vehicle such as the NDC as a holding company?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so because any remaining shares that might be held in such event by the State should be held by the responsible Minister.  He would have better oversight of the policy concerns than would the NDC.  There would be no point in lumbering the NDC with a lot of administrative responsibility for existing policies and decisions.  The whole notion in the Bill is that the NDC should be a body revolving their portfolio all the time, making new investments continuously and dispensing with old ones.  In this way the corporation will be in the forefront of new technology rather than being bogged down in obsolete technology or in older organisations.</P>

These include marketing, research and development and also business in the industry in general.  In the Second Schedule, 24 State-sponsored commercial enterprises are listed and these cover a very wide range of business and industry. It is very difficult to understand the need for another development agency or another public enterprise corporation.  I am making this point in the interest of being consistent with regard to the whole question of the setting up of the corporation. The Minister has confirmed that the corporation will be able to assist, manage or act as a holding company for any State-sponsored commercial enterprise established after the passing of the Act Does that mean that the company would be one established only after the legislation comes into operation and that the other companies listed in the Schedules will not be affected?</P>

      <P>The Bill refers to it being the opinion of the corporation that a venture has a reasonable prospect of success but that it not being ambitious in any way.  The doubt should be removed from the section.  In other words, more <Col N="1842" /> ambitious wording should be used.  The whole Bill is about ambition.  The Government declare the setting up of the NDC to be a very ambitious step but I am very concerned about the doubt inherent in the section.  Such wording as &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and &ldquo;or providing employment&rdquo;, is not good enough.  Firm and strong wording is needed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We are talking here about decisions that will have to be made in the future and about investing money to back some view that might be held. We could provide that the corporation invest only in projects that will be profitable. That would be very positive wording but profitability could not be guaranteed. Equally, we could omit the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; and substitute such wording as &ldquo;prospects of profitability&rdquo;.  In other words, if a venture had a chance in 100 of becoming profitable, that would be acceptable but people will be using their reason anyway in regard to the decisions that have to be made.  By including the word &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; we are saying that something that had a minor chance of being profitable would be ruled out because it would not be reasonable in such circumstances to assume that there was a basis for profitability and prospects for providing viable employment while by requiring it to the opinion of the corporation that a venture would be profitable, efficient or capable of being profitable and efficient, rather than saying simply &ldquo;investments which will be profitable and efficient&rdquo;, we are leaving it clearly as the responsibility of the corporation to take a view about whatever is involved.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Deputy in his private life has made investments in his own enterprise and perhaps in others so he, too, will know that there are no certainties in investment. He invested because he believed he would make a profit but that profitability could not be guaranteed from day one.  The NDC must have the freedom to act with the same use of judgment that the Deputy in his private business affairs would apply.  They cannot be put into a straitjacket where they would not be <Col N="1843" /> allowed exercise their judgment or act without accountability but neither can they be required to be certain of success before making an investment.  Should they seek certainty, they would not act at all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that the NDC will guarantee the success of enterprise and investment?  There is no lack of funds for investment at this time.  The problem is that the return from any such investment is too low by comparison with gilts and other investment opportunities.  If there is any hope for this proposal of the NDC the atmosphere will have to be changed to get people to invest in these &ldquo;capable of becoming profitable and efficient enterprises&rdquo; about which we talk in section 10, amendment 9.  We must focus on developing viable commercial enterprises.  The NDC will have to encourage, if possible, projects being developed by individuals or groups of individuals.  In this Bill we seem to concentrate too rigidly on State-sponsored commercial enterprises.</P>

      <P>Section 10 is the kernel of the Bill in terms of its principal objectives. Each paragraph in section 10 sets out to promote, assist and develop, in general terms.  There is nothing wrong with that but I fear that the incumbent board of directors with responsibility for trying to implement section 10 will not have a clear set of guidelines on which to operate.  The Minister and the Department are attempting to be as unrestrictive as possible in this, but I would like to see included in section 10 a much clearer set of guidelines.  Deputy Lyons said that there was no shortage of money for investment.  My understanding is that to replenish stocks of investment to sustain output at its present level costs £1 billion of new investment every year and that that is running at around £600 million this year.  The problem may be the rate of return on investment but the area in the industrial sector where there is not the resources is in the small farm sector.</P>

      <P>In relation to Deputy Lyons's question about this holding company business, it will only be a holding company for a new State-sponsored enterprise established after the passing of the Bill or any enterprise established by a State-sponsored commercial body.  That could be something already in existence but in respect of a new State-sponsored body as distinct from a subsidiary of a State-sponsored body.  The corporation can only be a holding company for new enterprises established after the Act.  I explained broadly the type of area where common problems might exist and there might be a need to group these companies together under one financial umbrella.  I do not think this will happen on a large scale and it will not be a very important part of the corporation's activity.  It is there as a permissive power.  The corporation will be better engaged in setting up new enterprises or investing in new enterprises rather than engaging in any type of holding company activity which is a sort of permanent burdensome activity as against the developmental role which should be the primary role.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 11:</P>
      <P>In page 6, subsection (1), between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following new paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  to invest in any enterprise&mdash;</P>
      <P> (i)  involved in advance technology;</P>
      <P>(ii)  engaged in the establishment, promotion, development or provision of marketing and related services;</P>
      <P>(iii)  engaged in the commercial exploitation of research carried out in Irish colleges or research bodies, or licensed in from overseas;</P>
      <P>(iv)  commercial research projects in third level colleges, research institutions or other suitable bodies;</P>

      <P>where such an enterprise in the opinion of the Corporation, is profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient and has reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth and providing viable employment;&rdquo;.  </P>
      <P>In paragraph (vi) I am suggesting some leeway for the Minister so that he would not be too hide-bound by some of the &ldquo;ands&rdquo; and &ldquo;ors&rdquo; we have already discussed in the other sections.  I might suggest that the amendment speaks for itself and hope the Minister will find it possible to accept it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The other point I raised comes up on this amendment because <Col N="1848" /> this amendment seeks to open up the provisions in terms of what companies can be invested in by the National Development Corporation.  My point is that there should be a restriction in terms of specifying that, in the venture capital market, the areas of greatest weakness and of greatest financial equity need are in small firms.  They are over-dependent on bank borrowings and their debt equity ratio is all wrong.  Therefore, venture capital is often vulture capital for them.</P>
      <P>I put it to the Minister: surely it would allow a greater spread in terms of employment if the primary role of the National Development Corporation was to have a revolving equity structure for small firms under the same terms of reference as the business expansion scheme, say, a five-year period which is already an up and running equity scheme.  With the maximum investment in any one venture of £150,000 I suggest that more companies would be aided.  I say this because the risk ratio means that half of the projects aided will fail.  In America a figure of two out of ten is considered an acceptable success/failure rate.  I am suggesting that one would be spreading one's risk a lot better and, in so doing, would be able to cover all the different sectors that Deputy Lyons and the Minister have outlined in their amendments and in the Bill itself. Furthermore, one would be addressing the area of greatest need.  Rather than being too generalised in an attempt to be as unrestrictive as possible it would be better and less ambiguous to the new board of directors to set out clear guidelines of where the focus of investment should lie.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>There is some merit in what Deputy Yates has said.  But one must ask what will be the source of funding of venture capital?  If it has to come from the market place it will have to be loaned at rates over and above the market price prevailing.  That would render the problem to which Deputy Yates referred even more complex.  They would be better off in the situation obtaining rather than moving into a new one.  I do not know what will be the source of funding <Col N="1849" /> for the National Development Corporation. But, if those funds have to be borrowed from the market place, they will have to be loaned at rates over and above the prevailing market price.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>It would be impossible to stop the Deputy at that stage.  May I intervene in an effort to clarify the matter.  First I have to say that I do not think Deputy Lyons' amendment is really necessary and, in one respect I consider it dangerous.  For example, paragraph (i) of the Deputy's amendment is dealt with in section 10 (1) (i) as it is on page 7 of the Bill.  Also paragraph (ii) of his amendment is already dealt with in section 10 (1) (h) of the Bill.  Paragraph (iii) of the Deputy's amendment is already dealt with in section 10 (1) (i).  Also paragraph (v) of the Deputy's amendment is dealt with in the existing powers of the corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1850" /> The section of the Deputy's amendment which I feel to be dangerous is (vi) which provides that the corporation could invest in any enterprise of any such a nature which the Minister might from time to time direct.  That is a bit dangerous. We do have power to give the corporation directions as to broad sectors and so on in which they should invest. But I do not think it desirable that we should allow a possibility that the Minister could direct them to invest in a particular enterprise.  That would be highly dangerous.  I think the Deputy himself could quite easily imagine that there might be somebody who, let us say, was setting up an enterprise who was a supporter of some political party, unnamed. If the Minister of the day were to direct the corporation to invest in that body there could be all sorts of accusations of improper behaviour and so on, even though it might be a perfectly reasonable thing to do from a commercial point of view.</P>

      <P>Sorry, I know that.  I am not trying to infer any improper motive to the Deputy.  I am quite certain that is not what he intended.  Unfortunately, what counts is what goes into the Bill.  Subsequently in drafting the power I have to give general directions as to policies in section 31, I was very careful to exclude from that directions in respect of particular investments.  There is a danger that that could be imported in the Deputy's amendment.  My main point really is that section 10 as it stands already meets in greater detail the various purposes which the Deputy is seeking to achieve in his additional amendment.  I do not think there is need to put the same thing in twice in different words.</P>

The amendment says &ldquo;between lines 39 and 40&rdquo; and I do not indicate that I wish to interfere with any of the other lines after that.  The Minister <Col N="1851" /> saw fit to take the word &ldquo;direct&rdquo; in his literal concept of directing somebody, saying: &ldquo;Do as I tell you&rdquo;.  That is not what is intended.  If possible I would prefer &ldquo;to invest in any enterprise of such a nature which the Minister from time to time would see fit&rdquo;.</P>

      <P>Despite all the listing of names of groups, colleges, technological institutions and the various bodies mentioned right through the sections, I am thinking of the possibility &mdash; and it is always a possibility &mdash; that some group, body or institution may not be so accounted for or included in these various listings in section 10 of the Bill.  That is why I put in paragraph (iv).</P>
      <P>The Minister did not comment on the phrase &ldquo;structurally sound, wholly Irish owned firms&rdquo;.  We should give consideration to that.  I accept what the Minister says, that many of the paragraphs I have included are covered in section 10 and I accept that, but I wanted to broaden it. I was not putting those in here in the amendment to the exclusion of any of the others already listed.  The Minister seemed to suggest that at one stage in his contribution.</P>

      <P>Far from it, I was being very specific in saying only &ldquo;between lines 39 and 40&rdquo; to include that.  That gives an indication that there is no proposal or suggestion that they be not included.  I accept the Minister's point that that word could be misinterpreted in many ways, for instance, in &ldquo;which seeks to ask the Minister to direct people&rdquo;.  That is not what is intended.  Maybe we can amend it on Report Stage and if the Minister sees that paragraph (vi) in the amendment is worth including, then I have no problem about putting in suitable wording to take the inference out of it that the Minister would direct in the sense that he spoke about.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already dealt with that problem as far as ministerial direction is concerned in section 31.  We have dealt with it in a reasonably balanced way, and the Deputy's amendment is not necessary in that regard.  One point in the Deputy's amendment that I did not deal with adequately is paragraph (v) &ldquo;structurally sound, wholly Irish owned firms&rdquo; in which he wants the NDC to invest.  I have been advised that if we were to say that the NDC were restricted to investing in Irish firms possibly that would be contrary to EC law, and we do not want that to be the case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>However, in practice the NDC will be investing in Irish firms and the use of the words in section 10 companies that have &ldquo;reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth&rdquo; etc. by definition are companies that by having this development, growth, profitability, expansion and so forth are becoming structurally strong, Irish owned firms.  I know the use of the term &ldquo;structurally strong, Irish owned firms&rdquo; is borrowed from the Telesis report, NESC reports and so on, and I share the Deputy's desire that the NDC should put equity into these companies to help them to become bigger.  I notice that Deputy Yates has gone.  I do not think that small firms on their own while remaining small can solve our problems. We need small firms that become big firms because in some markets you must be big to survive.  I would see the NDC investing in some companies and helping them to become bigger.  I see nothing wrong with that.  On the other hand I do not see the NDC remaining permanently involved with any company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to say in response to Deputy Lyons's amendment that we have been advised that the use of the term &ldquo;structurally sound, wholly Irish owned firms&rdquo; would run into the EC rules.  Also, the draftsman feels that it is not a very precise term.  What is &ldquo;structurally sound&rdquo;?  We must be guided by the draftsman when <Col N="1853" /> he feels that this is imprecise wording and has no legal meaning that is understood and accepted.  Therefore, we have done it in another way, by providing in all the sections in respect of all the investment powers in section 10 that the NDC have, that they shall be capable of investing in companies that have the prospects for growth, expansion and so on.  That really is the same thing as being structurally strong.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 16:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(f)  to prepare a co-ordinated development plan for commercial state-sponsored manufacturing companies within the national and economic planning process;&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We agree about the correctness of the general outline of the various sections but <Col N="1857" /> the provisions are <i>ad hoc.</i> For example, the section provides that the corporation may invest in any enterprise involved in the exploitation, development, production or marketing of natural resources but where such enterprises will come from one does not know.  There is no co-ordinated plan as to how the corporation will promote companies through investment. There is a need for a co-ordinated plan.</P>
    <P>I must point out that in drafting our amendment we used the wording in the Fine Gael-Labour Programme for Government published on 30 December 1982 in regard to a national development corporation.  That programme stated that the corporation would prepare a co-ordinated development plan for commercial State manufacturing companies within the national economic and social planning process.  The Irish Congress of Trade Unions also expressed considerable worry about the contradictions between the White Paper on Industrial Policy and the National Development Corporation in relation to manufacturing companies. They made the point that the White Paper seemed to indicate that the Government's idea on a national development corporation was not in accordance with the original idea or with their views.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

    <Speaker pid="TomasMacGiolla" hpid="Tomás Mac Giolla Tomás Mac Giolla">
      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>Congress differed from the Government particularly in regard to the potential for State-sponsored bodies developing new companies in the manufacturing area.  It is the investment in companies and assistance in management in the manufacturing sector that will create new jobs and new wealth.  It has not been sufficiently emphasised in the Bill that there is a need for the developing of commercial enterprises in the manufacturing area.  Our amendment is designed to co-ordinate all efforts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1858" /> The NDC would be acting on a co-ordinated development plan in the specified areas of natural resources, for example, forestry, food processing, or fisheries.  To have a co-ordinated development plan for manufacturing companies in those areas is the purpose of amendment No. 16.  It would strengthen the Bill and would clarify that the corporation would be able to move into the manufacturing areas, establishing new State-sponsored or assisted companies in the area of natural resources.  Once they had that co-ordinated plan they would not be just reacting to someone else's views but to their own ideas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The point here is that the NDC are an investment body looking for investment opportunities in the market place.  The Government considered the matter and set down in the White Paper on Industrial Policy alternative arrangements for corporate planning and overall planning in State companies. These were discussed in very great detail last night in the debate on the motion for the extension of the terms of reference of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  Essentially, we are not giving the corporation the job of doing overall planning for State companies; we are getting the State companies to do that in conjunction with the parent department.  I would like Deputies generally to understand that we are doing so.  I think the reasons are good.</P>
      <P>If the NDC were given some sort of overall responsibility for planning manufacturing in the country at large, it would create a terrific number of consultancy reports, studies and plans and a considerable amount of paper work, without necessarily all that much output at the end of the day.  Confining the corporation to not becoming involved in looking at the big picture and in making great planning decisions but looking for investment opportunities existing in the market place gives a better focus for the operation. They would be developmental as distinct from prescriptive in their activities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not believe &mdash; and this may be an area in which Deputy Mac Giolla and I <Col N="1859" /> would not fully agree&mdash; that it is possible to plan the economy in the fashion in which one would plan military procurement during a war where one would measure how many boots one needed for the Army and what the casualty rate is likely to be and place an order then for a given number of boots.  You plan who is going to produce the boots in how many factories and the whole thing is done on such a planned basis.  It is not possible in a small, open economy, regardless of the social system, once we have free trade. That is quite apart from who owns the industry.  To my mind, that detailed planning of the economy is not on.  The only people who attempted that &mdash; and it was in a very large economy in eastern Europe&mdash;were in the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics.</P>

      <P>This is not an interruption, it is a contribution to the debate.  Of course, the National Development Corporation will plan in the sense that they will be looking at individual sectors and finding out an opening which can be filled, either by investing in an existing company developing that sector, or making an investment by setting up their own company.  They would be planning in that sense.  The Deputy's amendment would mean that the NDC would take on the job of preparing a co-ordinated development plan for State-sponsored manufacturing companies, in other words, they would be responsible for the <Col N="1862" /> planning of NET, Irish Steel and any companies owned by the State in other areas of manufacturing.  These would all be the responsibility of the corporation. To my mind the corporation have plenty to be getting on with in creating new jobs without being given the responsibility of planning for these companies.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;... commercial State-sponsored manufacturing companies&rdquo; is a phrase used at a particular point in time.  It applies to commercial State-sponsored manufacturing companies that exist at the time the phrase is used.  At present they are Irish Steel and NET.  That is the only thing the Deputy's amendment could be referring to.  It would not be sensible to give the NDC the role of becoming involved in a co-ordinated development plan.  There is an implication that NET and Irish Steel need in some way to be co-ordinated.  They are in quite different sectors of the economy and do not need to be co-ordinated.  We need a body to make specialised investment in specialised sectors and get on with selling the results of that investment. One can co-ordinate initiative to death.</P>

      <P>This is becoming more and more painful.  Let us take forestry, an area which has become the subject of some controversy over the past six months.  According to the Bill the NDC will be very much involved in this.  Surely this is one area where some development plan is absolutely essential.  It is tangled up with the Department of Forestry in the marketing and development area and needs a development plan.  If there is <Col N="1863" /> such a plan and the NDC are involved, presumably manufacturing enterprises will arise from it.  Marketing will also be involved.  If ever a co-ordinated development plan was required it is in the forestry area, covering planting, the take-out from the forests, the development of manufacturing enterprises, saw mills, paper manufacturing and all sorts of other enterprises which could create jobs.  Private enterprise has had a free hand for 60 years and has not been able to do very much.  There are one or two good enterprises but most have collapsed.</P>
      <P>Forestry is one example.  There are others such as food processing, fishing and the area of mineral development.  A coordinated development plan is needed. I am suggesting commercial State-sponsored manufacturing companies who are prepared to go it alone or to co-operate with others.  The Bill already provides for this to be done.  I am not referring to NET or Irish Steel.  The amendment deals with the development envisaged in the Bill and the manufacturing companies which would arise from this development. Could the Minister confine himself to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>We will have to agree to differ.  My interpretation, backed by official study of the Deputy's amendment, is that it would involve the NDC in preparing a co-ordinated plan for existing State companies.  While it needs to be done, I do not think the NDC is the body to do it.  It would be better done by the bodies concerned.  As far as timber is concerned, it might be better to discuss that point on amendment No. 17.  Of course the NDC will be planning their investment strategy very carefully.  To some degree the Deputy's amendment may be based on the original provision in the Joint Programme where the NDC was to be a holding company for a large number of existing State companies.  If it were a holding company then it would be appropriate to have an overall development planning role in respect of existing companies.  It is not going to be a holding <Col N="1864" /> company but an investment body, not in the sense of taking minority shares but in the sense of looking for new openings rather than concerning itself with existing companies and their inherited problems.</P>
      <P>The NDC will not have a very large staff and will have to be selective in the type of person recruited.  If one is looking for somebody good at preparing long term development plans with lots of figures about projections into the future and the macro-economic nature of the environment, one goes perhaps for an economist.  If, on the other hand, one is looking for people whose eyes are turned down to the ground, looking for immediate openings and investment opportunities, one is looking for a different type of person.  What I want is an action oriented corporation which will be seeking out individual investment opportunities, not a theoretical body preparing plans and blueprints for the future.  I am not saying that is what the Deputy has in mind and I will be careful not to provoke him as to our definitions of what planning means. There would be a danger in giving the NDC an overall planning role when they should be looking for specific, immediate investment opportunities which will create jobs.  I cannot accept the amendment because it would be sending off the NDC in the wrong and less productive direction.  That is not to say that this planning should not be done, but it should be done by the Government rather than the NDC.</P>

      <P>The discussion on this amendment has served to confirm my view that the NDC is improperly titled because we have now been assured by the Minister that it will not be a development or planning corporation but at best a national investment corporation.  I have been looking through the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  Paragraph 12.1.2 refers to a new method of direct State equity investment in new or existing ventures through a National Development Corporation.  Paragraph 12.5 refers to one of the recommendations of the Telesis report that policy towards existing <Col N="1865" /> indigenous industry must be re-organised to emphasise the development of structurally strong Irish firms rather than strong agencies to assist weak firms.</P>
      <P>I want to take this opportunity to indicate clearly what the concept of the National Development Corporation may be as far as the public are conerned. Paragraph 12.6 of the White Paper says that the overall intention is that the NDC will provide for a form of direct State participation which will be both innovative and developmental, particularly towards potential growth areas of the economy.  However, the Minister said that the NDC will have no function in development or planning &mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>The Minister's statement put the NDC in its proper perspective. The White Paper also said that the National Development Corporation should be securely guided by commercial considerations.  The functions of the NDC are also mentioned in paragraph 12.7.  They are envisaged as acting as a State investment company in existing or new private sector enterprises.  One would have expected that the National Development Corporation, by their title, would be just that.  However, it is becoming clearer that the NDC are merely an investment company and have no responsibility for planning and development. Are we to assume, without it being clearly defined, that the corporation will have no function in planning or development?</P>

      <P>This is not my amendment and I had not intended to speak on it but the contribution by the Minister and Deputy Mac Giolla forced me to do so. We will have to address ourselves to the role of the National Development Corporation. The Government will probably succeed in passing the Bill, but if the National Development Corporation do not have any function apart from investments without planning or development they will not be successful.  If the functions of the NDC are not laid down in very definitive terms, the whole thing falls flat.  It is absolutely essential in the broadest context that the National Development Corporation must be what their title says&mdash; a development corporation and not just an investment corporation, an assisting body or all the other phrases which the Minister used.  It appalled me to hear the Minister say that they had no function in development or planning for development that is the same thing&mdash; you must plan for development.  I ask the Minister to note that and ensure that the role of the National Development Corporation will be provided for.  The end result should be to create an atmosphere conducive to the provision of employment and the encouragement of investment in industry to provide the employment which is so badly needed.</P>

      <P>The position is that the corporation will be investing for national development.  Any investment they undertake will be designed, as was made clear, to create viable jobs and so help national development as a whole.  That is what the corporation are intended to do; but they will not take over the functions of Government in so far as planning the economy is concerned or in so far as planning existing State companies are <Col N="1867" /> concerned.  The planning of their activities should be drawn up by the companies themselves in conjunction with the Ministers responsible.  As I said in response to Deputy Mac Giolla, the corporation should concenterate on looking for new opportunities for investment which would create jobs.  This requires particular skills.  If the corporation were to be given the job of drawing up a comprehensive co-ordinated development plan for commercial State manufacturing, which would essentially be taking over the role of the Government, or if they were given responsibility for a comprehensive plan for food processing, which would mean taking over the functions of the Department of Agriculture and of the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, they would have to recruit an entirely different type of staff as they would be involved in the direct placing of investment in individual projects with a view to making money and creating jobs rather than in an administrative co-ordination planning role, which is properly the responsibility of Government Departments.</P>
      <P>The NDC will not take over the job of the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism, the Department of Agriculture or the Department of Fisheries and Forestry.  Those Departments must continue to do their own job. It would be a complete error to give the NDC overlapping responsibility with existing Departments.  Nobody would know what they were doing.  I want to confine the NDC to an area where there is a need for a body of this kind to seek out new investments and to create new jobs that will contribute to national development through investment.</P>

There is a resource in this country we have failed to tap, and I do not know if the State sector can harness that resource. What we need are people who have the entrepreneurial flair to create extra <Col N="1868" /> employment.  It will be very difficult to attract them into the State sector.  It appears from what the Minister has said that he shares my outlook on this matter and he should try to convince his Government of the desirability of encouraging entrepreneurs.  We are an open economy and we are operating in free trade.  An open economy is the best economy. Western economies are of more help to their people than other economies we hear about.</P>

      <P>The Minister has said that an investment company will not do the job of existing State companies. However, it appears that the NDC will do a certain amount of the job of the IDA.  It is becoming more difficult to pinpoint the difference between the NDC and the NEA.  I understood the NDC would initiate new manufacturing projects. Surely they would be interested in getting the ESB, who import a considerable amount of the materials they use, to join with them in the manufacture of a product to supply their needs?  In other words, it would be a new enterprise for an existing State enterprise.  Is the Minister <Col N="1869" /> saying that is solely the job of the ESB or would the NDC be interested in a project like that?</P>

      <P>If the NDC do not have a development plan they will not get anywhere.  The Minister said they are to leave the existing State enterprises to do their own thing and presumably this applies also to private enterprise.  Surely the NDC must have some development plan to create jobs in the manufacturing and service area.  The Minister has downgraded this aspect of the work of the NDC.  It appears it will be rather like the IDA where they will be given a few pounds to get off the ground.  What the Minister is proposing is just an investment company.  At the end of Second Stage my understanding was that we would have a development corporation to develop new enterprises either on its own or with the assistance of existing State bodies.  We understood the function of the NDC would be to develop new enterprises and projects.  Because the Bill seemed to us to have the NDC reacting to events rather than the corporation having their own development plan, we put down this amendment.  I gave the example of the ESB where there could be a joint venture.  The Minister has not given us any examples to indicate what the NDC will do.  I agree with Deputy Lyons that there is a grey area here.  It is a very vague concept.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course the NDC will plan their own activities but they will not plan the activities of everyone else as well.  They will not be responsible for doing the work of the Department of Agriculture, of the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism or of the IDA.  They will be quite separate from the IDA, who are a grant-giving body while the NDC will be an equity investing body.  The NDC will be empowered to invest on a joint venture basis with the ESB if they want to develop a manufacturing industry in association with some product they are buying.  The <Col N="1870" /> NDC can approach the ESB and the ESB may approach the corporation.  On the other hand, either of them can go ahead on their own.  There are three options available to them.  What I do not want and what this amendment would achieve &mdash; this applies also to amendment No. 17 &mdash; would be to give the NDC a huge administrative burden of doing work for other people who are already charged by this House with that work.  I refer to Departments and other development agencies.  I want to keep the NDC concentrated on developing new projects and new jobs that would not otherwise come into existence, either by helping the private sector along the way or by doing it themselves.</P>
      <P>God knows, 70 per cent of our GNP passes into the Government's hands already and one thing we do not want is to have the corporation looking into what three or four other bodies are doing.  I do not think that is what Deputy Mac Giolla intends by his amendment.  My anxiety is that the corporation would concentrate on creating new viable jobs.  That should be their sole work.</P>

I wholeheartedly support the Minister's thinking, but I suggest the Minister should follow that to its logical conclusion and get rid of section 10 altogether, because the section calls for the corporation to invest, in consultation, where appropriate, with State-sponsored ation to manage and assist and participate in joint ventures.  This goes right through the section.  What the corporation should be doing is trying to create jobs in association with semi-State bodies, and I do not think it is logical for the Minister to make the statement he has just made and then leave this section as it is.  There are enough State agencies, as we know as members of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-sponsored Bodies.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 17:</P>
      <P>In page 7, subsection (1), between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following paragraph:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(m) to develop a comprehensive plan for revitalisation of the food processing industry through profitable innovation by the state sector, the private sector, and co-operative societies.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The amendment refers in particular to food processing.  We need new enterprises and developments in that area and our idea is that the NDC would take an overall look at the matter and devise a comprehensive plan for development. They should not be going around with a mission of hope, wondering if they should assist this man or that.  They should concentrate on a particular sector of food processing and develop it.  It is a huge industry and a variety of technologies are involved.  Therefore, the corporation should not be hopping around from one section of it to another.  This function for the corporation was included in the original Programme for Government, which stated that the NDC would have a special responsibility for indigenous Irish resource development.  We know that thousands of jobs, not 50 or 60, could be created in this industry.  Our amendment asks for the development of a comprehensive plan for revitalisation of the food processing industry.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister agrees that the next couple of decades will be particularly difficult because of the huge increase in the labour force, and that therefore we must think much bigger about jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1872" /> There is enormous potential for jobs in the food processing industry and I hope the Minister will tell us what his idea of a plan is for the NDC, or if he thinks there should be any planning at all.</P>

      <P>I do not see any difficulty about the thinking in the amendment, which carries a laudable request, but I do not think we could put it into legislation because it would mean overlapping the work of the IDA.  To my knowlege the latter body have been doing this work for years.  There is nothing to prevent the corporation from investing in food processing or developing a comprehensive plan.  That idea is sensible, but it could not be written into the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The NDC will be empowered to be involved substantially in the food processing sector as the Deputy will note from section 10 (1), paragraphs (f) and (g).  In paragraph (f), they are being given a general responsibility to invest in the agriculture, fisheries and forestry sectors while in paragraph (g), they are being mandated specifically to develop long term supply contracts between producers and processers in such enterprises with a view to developing these sectors to the maximum.  The problem of seasonality of supply will be addressed by the development of contracts. Seasonality is a factor that affects adversely almost every sector of agriculture in Ireland.  It is the cause of the under utilisation of our resources.</P>
      <P>In the beef sector, for instance, four times as many cattle are slaughtered in the last quarter of the year as are slaughtered in the first quarter.  That means that the meat factories are under utilised.  I could talk at length as to the reasons for that.  Deputy Mac Giolla or others might superficially blame the farmers for this, but the farmer only reacts to the price he will obtain for his produce and to the cost of production at different times.  In an effort to overcome those short term seasonal factors we must have long term supply contracts.  The NDC will be mandated to develop such contracts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>By way of assuring Deputy Mac Giolla, <Col N="1873" /> he may be confident that the NDC will be doing this in a planned way.  They will be taking account of the IDA plan for the food processing sector.  The NDC would regard that plan as one in general terms and then ask themselves what sort of specific plan they should draw up for investment, a plan that would support that broader plan and achieve the corporation's specific objective which is to make money and create jobs.  As Deputy Brennan has pointed out correctly, to give the NDC the role of drawing up a comprehensive plan for the entire sector, apart from those matters that will be within their direct remit, would be to give them a quasi administrative role which would not be desirable, which would cause overlap and a misdirection of resources.  They should be directed specifically towards investing, either on their own or in conjunction with others, in job creating projects or in projects that will make profit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>When talking about joint ventures, there is some merit in saying that the co-operative sector will have a role to play in terms of the NDC because all our co-operatives are fairly starved in terms of capital.  I should hope that if what is envisaged for the NDC should come to fruition some of the co-operatives and especially the more advanced ones in the food processing sector would put forward some projects which the corporation would be forthcoming in assisting.  There is a vast resource in that whole area in terms of technology and skill and this could be utilised for job creation in downstream processing but the major problem is a shortage of funding.  The money is not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister referred to the factor of seasonality of supply, but the only area in the food sector that I would consider vulnerable in that respect is the area of milk production.  In all the other areas, seasonality is a factor throughout the world.  Sugar beet and such vegetables as cabbages and carrots are harvested in late autumn or early winter.  That is the case here as well as elsewhere so I do not understand why the Minister would refer <Col N="1874" /> to seasonality as being a problem.  Those of us who have travelled on the Continent will be aware that the position is similar there.  On many occasions I have seen sugar beet being harvested near Schipol Airport in Holland in the month of December so that is a seasonal commodity.</P>
    <P>We have allowed our food industry to go into decay.  We have lost out on marketing and on downstream processing in the added value area mainly because the farming community did not have the money to fund the industry as neither did the sources or agencies with whom they traded.  If there is anything worthwhile in the NDC, this is one area in which they must have a role to play so far as joint ventures are concerned.  What concerns me about the capital aspect, though, is that the corporation will have to acquire their capital in the market place and they will then lend to the other agencies at rates higher than the market place rates. That is where I see the weakness in the NDC.</P>

      <P>I was interested in the Minister's point about paragraph (g) and in particular his references to long term supply contracts and to the seasonality aspect.  I agree with Deputy O'Keeffe that seasonality is a factor in regard to most crops but it can be overcome in the case of beef and to a great extent in the case of dairying.  It is a problem that has been overcome to a far greater extent on the Continent in the dairying industry than is the case here where there is a 14 to one difference between summer and winter production levels compared with a ratios of two to one on the Continent.  Therefore, there is a great possibility of improving the seasonality aspect in the areas of milk and beef.  The Minister said that this is one of the areas in which the NDC would interest themselves.  That would be good because it would make an enormous difference in the area of the production of soft cheeses, for instance, to have an all year round supply of milk.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing in the Bill that would prevent any one in the agricultural area <Col N="1875" /> or in any other area from telling the NDC that their involvement is not desired, so how then will the corporation be able to move into such areas?  The co-operatives and the Department of Agriculture have been dealing with this whole area for years.  They have been dealing with the matter of seasonality, so how are the NDC to move in and say that they will alleviate whatever problems may be involved?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There is an answer to that.  The new paragraph (a) will give the NDC the power to set things up themselves. They will not necessarily have to be in co-operation with anyone else. Paragraph (c) of subsection (1) will empower them to establish, either alone or in co-operation with a State-sponsored commercial enterprise, any enterprise which has reasonable prospects of success.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn) Ruairí Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Labour (Mr. Quinn)</NameTxt>
      <P>The number of such housing units provided by local authorities in the years 1980 to 1984 were as follows:&mdash; 1980 &mdash; 625, 1981 &mdash; 631, 1982 &mdash; 550, 1983 &mdash; 609, 1984 &mdash; 1,008.</P>
      <P>The main guidelines on the building of such houses, issued by my Department to local authorities, are:&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  in the measurement of housing needs in their areas, local authorities should give special attention to the needs of senior citizens,</P>
      <P>(b) an appropriate proportion of local house building programmes should cater for the special needs of such persons,</P>
      <P>(c) dwellings provided for senior citizens should normally be integrated with other housing,</P>
      <P>(d) where feasible, sheltered housing should allow senior citizens to live in their own homes within a complex of dwellings served by the necessary basic community facilities without being forced to use these facilities,</P>
      <P>(e) where specially designed housing is provided, there should be close liaison in planning with the health and social welfare services to ensure that the necessary support services will be provided. </P>
      <P>My Department issued a comprehensive memorandum to each local authority in April 1982 on the standards to be applied in the design and construction of all dwellings provided by them, including accommodation provided for elderly persons, and, in August 1982, also, issued a separate booklet containing design guidelines on the provision of housing for the elderly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not have that information to hand.  The Deputy is an active member of a local authority and will therefore be aware that it is the local authority, which is the housing authority, who in the first instance bring forward design proposals for any housing schemes.  I would be happy to make available to the Deputy the standards which I have outlined briefly in the reply.  It is the responsibility of the housing authority to ensure that the technical support staff of their local authority from within their own ranks and from within the ranks of their consultants provide the kind of housing schemes which they want.  Over the last number of years the Department of the Environment have been extraordinarily progressive in the amount of money made available for such schemes but the primary responsibility for complying with these standards is with the local authority.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MervynTaylor" hpid="Mr. Taylor Mr. Taylor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Taylor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister saying that the Minister for the Environment does not have a responsibility to ensure that specialised housing of this nature is provided? Would the Minister not agree that schemes should be set up, as they have been set up in other countries, under which sheltered housing is provided, by which I mean a complex of buildings where aid and assistance would be on hand in the form of nursing help, caretaker help and so on?  Are the Department of the Environment prepared to set up a target of doing that even on a pilot basis in a number of densely populated areas and to ensure by direction to the local authorities that these things are provided?</P>

In order for my Department to consider this revision to the preliminary report it will be necessary for the corporation to submit details of the form of treatment now envisaged.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if, in view of the high number of deaths resulting from tractors overturning, he proposes to introduce legislation so as to harmonise Irish laws with European laws in relation to the provision of roll-over structures in order to facilitate trade in these vehicles.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Road Traffic (Construction Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations, 1969 make it obligatory to fit safety frames to tractors not exceeding 7¼ tons unladen weight, or practically all agricultural tractors, while being used in a public place.</P>
      <P>The evidence available to me suggests that there has been a significant reduction in fatalities and injuries due to tractors overturning since the above regulations were made.  The average number of persons killed in the three years up to and including 1969 was 12 per annum compared with an average of six per annum in the three year period 1978 to 1980. Figures for 1981 and subsequent years are not readily available.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The regulations require that safety frames must be capable of satisfying a standard code for the official testing of agricultural tractors published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation <Col N="1882" /> and Development.  The European Communities (Vehicle Type Approval) Regulations 1980 also provide, <i>inter alia</i>, that tractors fitted with safety frames in compliance with Directive 77/536/EC shall be regarded as being in compliance with the Road Traffic (Construction Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations.</P>
    <P>In the circumstances, I do not propose any further legislation.  I understand that my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, has made general regulations implementing Directive 77/536/EC for type approval purposes in Ireland &mdash; the European Communities (Agricultural or Forestry Tractors Type Approval) Regulations, 1979.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he can offer any explanation for the high incidence of coloured water constantly flowing through the town water system at Portlaoise, County Laois; if non-filtered water is in use by the public of the town; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In accordance with section 65 of the Public Health (Ireland) Act, 1878, responsibility for the supply of pure and wholesome water is a matter for each sanitary authority, and I have no function in the matter.</P>
      <P>However, I understand from inquiries of Laois County Council that certain areas of Portlaoise town are affected by discolouration of the water supplies, which arises from the inadequacy of the present filtering system.  The quality of the water is continually monitored by the director of Community Care with the Midland Health Board for chemical and bacteriological quality and has been at all times passed as safe and suitable for human consumption.  To alleviate the problem certain remedial work has been carried out locally and further measures will be undertaken, I understand, over the months ahead.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In accordance with Laois County Council's proposals for the long term <Col N="1883" /> improvement of the water supply situation in Portlaoise I approved on 22 January 1985 the acceptance, by Laois County Council, of the tender submitted by Messrs.  Dick Collins (Croom) Ltd. for the civil works contract of the Portlaoise water supply improvement scheme.  It is now a matter for the council to advance this scheme to construction stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OliverJFlanagan" hpid="Mr. O.J. Flanagan Mr. O.J. Flanagan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O.J. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>Can the Minister give any assurance to the public in Portlaoise in relation to this matter, bearing in mind that it is an expanding town, a growing population and where there has been very great concern that so many people had to use coloured water for domestic purposes?  Can it be taken that the Minister's statement constituted an assurance to consumers of water that, even though it may be coloured there is no health hazard or danger whatever in relation to the supply?  Perhaps the Minister would ask an officer of his Department to keep a close and watchful eye on the matter even though he has now indicated that his Department have no responsibility?  During the period in which I was in that Department there was a certain responsibility and the Department always kept a close, watchful eye on the matter.  Perhaps the Minister would be good enough to keep the matter under constant review by way of assurance to the people in Portlaoise?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will agree that the close and watchful eye of the Department of the Environment can never match the scrutiny of Deputy Flanagan in matters relating to the County of Laois. Therefore, the assurance I am giving the Deputy &mdash; repeating from my reply &mdash; comes from the director of Community Care with the Midland Health Board who, no doubt, is known personally to the Deputy.  He has the technical qualifications available to him to repeat the assurance I have given already and which can be relayed to the people of the town of Portlaoise, which is that while the water may be discoloured it has been <Col N="1884" /> passed and is constantly monitored as being safe and suitable for human consumption.</P>

I put it to him that there are other proposals in relation to the provision of additional finance in respect of which Laois County Council are awaiting approval and which is urgently required to carry out a full development programme in relation to the water supply in the town.</P>

I should have thought that getting on with that work, as a start, would constitute progress in relation to the problems <i>vis-á-vis</i> water supply in Portlaoise.

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the serious deterioration which has taken place in the structure and condition of the county and regional roads in County Clare due to a number of exceptional factors such as the provision of water supplies and the huge increase in traffic resulting from <Col N="1885" /> the construction of Moneypoint power station; and if he will provide additional funding to Clare County Council to prevent the total collapse of the county road structure especially in West Clare.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the condition of roads generally in County Clare, including regional and county roads, and of the factors referred to by the Deputy.</P>
      <P>The road grant allocated to Clare County Council for 1985 at £3.49 million represents an increase of 24 per cent relative to 1984.</P>
      <P>Responsibility for the planning and execution of works on regional and county roads in their administrative area, including the provision of the necessary finance, rests with Clare County Council. I have, however, provided road grants totalling £1.011 million to the local authority in 1985 for improvement and maintenance works on regional roads and for improvement works on county roads.  In addition, as a special measure, I have agreed to a proposal from the local authority to expend £1.027 million on the restoration of roads damaged by construction traffic associated with the West Clare regional water supply scheme.  I understand also that, as a condition of planning permission for the Moneypoint project, the ESB have contributed £388,000 towards the cost of road restoration works consequent on the construction traffic associated with the development of the project.</P>

      <P>Might I draw the Minister's attention to the fact that in spite of the fairly substantial amounts of money which he has indicated as having been notified to the local authority, there is still widespread dissatisfaction with the condition of the county roads?  It has been estimated by the local authority that to put Clare county and regional roads into a reasonably satisfactory state of repair at present would cost in the region of £7 million.  In relation to the Estimates being prepared for next year, would the Minister say whether special account will be taken of the serious and dangerous situation which has developed in the county <Col N="1886" /> especially in west Clare in the last year or two where the whole roads structure is in danger of breakdown and will be irrepairable unless something is done urgently to deal with the situation? Further, would he be prepared to meet a deputation from Clare to discuss the issue before the Estimates are finalised for the coming year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me stress that with the 24 per cent increase on last year against a projected finalised rate of inflation this year, 1985, of no more than 5.5 per cent, the increase is substantial.  In addition, £1 million, in round figures, has been provided uniquely to Clare in relation to this problem which undoubtedly exists, and on top of that £388,000 has been made a condition of planning permission to the ESB in respect of Moneypoint.  For 1986 and 1985 that represents considerable progress.  However, I will take note of the points the Deputy has made.  With regard to the question of a deputation, as I am substituting for my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, I am not in a position to give that undertaking but I will convey the Deputy's request to him.</P>

It is under consideration that some of the investment in the national roads plan will be redirected to the county roads and will this be taken into account?  There are a number of projects, one in particular, in the county for which there does not seem to be any widespread demand or any urgent necessity.  I am talking about the Bunratty by-pass which will cost something in the region of £15 million and there is no widespread public demand for a scheme of that nature.  On the other hand, the local community are up in arms at the state of the roads in the county when they see a Vote for which there is no public demand&mdash;&mdash;</P>

All the Department <Col N="1888" /> of the Environment do is pay for them. It is the local authority, who I understand have substantial Fianna Fáil representation, who designate the priority in the first place.

      <P>The national roads plan will not change the relationship between local authorities on the one hand and the Department of the Environment on the other.  It is for local authorities to decide what their priorities for national primary road schemes are.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Proposals for a directive on measures to be taken against air pollution by gases from engines of motor vehicles were presented by the European Commission to the Council on 6 June 1984 and have been under discussion since then at community level.  Substantial agreement in regard to principles was reached at meetings of the Council (Environment) on 20 March 1985, 27 June 1985 and 28 November 1985 on the establishment of European standards to be adapted by categories of motor <Col N="1889" /> vehicles and on the dates for introduction of the new standards in respect of the different categories of new vehicles. Work on the translation of these agreements into a Council directive is proceeding at present but it is not possible to say when this will be adopted by the Council. Any estimate of the cost implications of the requirements for motor vehicles would be speculative at this stage.</P>
      <P>It is envisaged that the requirements of any new directive on vehicle emissions will be implemented at the appropriate time partly through the type approval system for which the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is responsible and partly through regulations to be made by the Minister modifying the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985, provides for revision of the boundary between Dublin city and county Dublin and for necessary consequential arrangements such as financial and property adjustments between Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council.  It also defines the territories of the three new county councils which will replace Dublin County Council and Dún Laoghaire Corporation.  The definitive establishment of the new councils is a complex matter requiring detailed assessment of financial implication and appropriate provision for redeployment of staff, property, assets and liabilities and various consequential re-arrangements. Considerable progress has been made in the preparation of the necessary legislation and in consultations on technical aspects at official level.  This work is proceeding and the target date for the new authorities to become operational, taking account of the detailed planning and preparations required, is 1 January 1987.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand from my information, though this will be subject to confirmation by way of a letter, that the entire process will be negotiated and will be arranged for as a single operation to come into effect on 1 January 1987.  Any details such as the transfer of responsibility for the Ballymun complex will, I presume, form a part of that.  However, that precise information is not available in my brief and I will arrange for the Department of the Environment to contact the Deputy and inform him of the position.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that there is considerable confusion between the corporation and the county council as to who is responsible for what, and when responsibility will transfer?  Is the Minister aware that there are a considerable number of problems in the Ballymun area which need to be dealt with urgently?  I do not think they can wait until January 1987.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I fail to see how there can be any confusion between local authorities in relation to their obligations and statutory liabilities as of now.  My understanding of the law is that their existing liabilities will prevail until such time as the order under the new legislation arranging for the transfer from one authority to another is made.  That is targeted for 1 January 1987.  I do not see why legal responsibility in regard to the functions of any local authority should become confused <Col N="1892" /> at this stage because of proposed changes that will take effect from 1 January 1987.  The existing liabilities which are clear in legal terms &mdash; I am aware that there is some problem in regard to the boundaries in Ballymun &mdash; will stay in place until they have been formally changed under the new legislation.  That will not occur, according to this reply, until 1 January 1987.</P>

      <NameTxt>Proinsias De Rossa</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister pursue the points I have raised by way of letter to me because, while the Minister may be correct in regard to the legal clarity of the position, the fact remains that there is at least a reluctance on the part of the county council to do certain work pending the take-over by the corporation of land, roads and so on.  That is leaving the people in parts of Ballymun in a bad state.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Their reluctance to do certain works is different from a legal confusion as to who is responsible for what. If that is the problem I suggest the way it could be responded to would be for Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council to try to work together on it.  The Department of the Environment as such will have no direct function in regard to that.  If work has to be undertaken in an area under the responsibility of Dublin County Council which, in the rearrangement of boundaries, may become part of Dublin Corporation, the reluctance may be understandable but their responsibilities have not changed and will not change until 1 January 1987.  If work is required to be done the previaling framework is the one within which they have to operate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he is aware of the state of county roads in County Donegal and his proposals to improve these roads.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the condition of roads generally, including county roads, in County Donegal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1893" /> The State grant for roads allocated to Donegal County Council for 1985 amounted to £5,775,000.  Because of the damage caused to roads in the county as a result of severe frost earlier this year, the grant has been increased to £6,425,000.  This grant represents an increase of 16 per cent relative to 1984.</P>
    <P>In addition, the local authority were allocated a grant of £750,000 for improvement works on regional roads under the European Development Fund for special Border area programmes.</P>
    <P>Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of improvement works on county roads rests with the local authorities. The expenditure involved falls to be financed by the local authorities from their own resources which may be supplemented by the block grant for roads paid annually by the Department.  The block grant may also be used, in the case of county councils, for the improvement, maintenance and management of non-national main roads, and for the implementation of traffic management measures.  The disposition of the block grant, including the extent, if any, to which it is to be applied to improvement works on county roads, is a matter for each local authority.</P>
    <P>Earlier this year, I announced that a grant of up to 75 per cent of the cost will be paid towards the cost of approved improvement works on the more important county road bridges, with a view to the preservation of the county road network.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister agree that the main reason for the deterioration in the condition of county main roads is that grants paid to county councils in lieu of rates on agricultural land and domestic dwellings have not kept pace with inflation?  Will the Minister agree that because of that county councils have less money each year in real terms to spend on county roads?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with the Deputy and if farmers had paid the rates which were outstanding prior to the constitutional case, the county roads which are <Col N="1894" /> primarily used by them, and the large commercial trucks which service them, would not be in the state they are in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The two counties are Ulster counties.  Will the Minister agree that it is time the Department took into account the amount of heavy traffic using roads and related the grant paid out of the motor tax fund to that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I would not.  I suggest to the Deputy, and to other Members who represent other counties of which I have some knowledge, that if the arrears of rates from farmers due before the legal action initiated by the Wexford branch of the IFA were paid, very few local authorities would be in a position where they cannot undertake all the roads maintenance and improvements programmes they want to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the Deputy that we have given Donegal more than £6 million plus £750,000 under the special Border area programmes.  The Deputy intervened to deal with Ulster generally and I made the point that countrywide there are still arrears of rates due to local authorities and if paid in by those who owe it that money would go a long way towards improving the county roads system, a system that is being damaged in many cases by agricultural and agri-business traffic in the first instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, as already announced, the maximum amount of recoupment by the Department to local authorities in respect of individual cases of essential repairs has been increased from £300 to £600 with effect from 1 December, 1985. The administration of these grants is a matter for each county council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister accept that a grant of £600 for essential repairs would not go very far if the person wanted a good job done?  The grants are very useful in areas where houses have to be held together, especially for old people.  Will he accept that as a result of the decision to increase the house improvement grants there should be a <i>pro rata</i> increase in the grants for essential repairs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I sympathise with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy but I should like to remind him that those grants uniquely, unlike all other home improvement grants, are 100 per cent grants.  A recipient does not have to put up any cash while, in the case of other house improvement grants, the norm is a maximum of one-third of the cost and in respect of the new £5,000 pre-1940 houses it is two-thirds.  In this instance we have increased by 100 per cent the amount of money available and the recipient does not have to make any contribution. Clearly, there are constraints in regard to the amount of money we can give but it is not fully understood that this scheme is confined to rural areas and that there is no contribution required from the recipient.  A grant of £600 is available for approved improvement works.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister <Col N="1896" /> accept that, from information that I have received, this grant is administered in various ways?  Some county councils have their own method of applying the grant. For instance, in Mayo the maximum grant payable at present is £1,000.  There seems to be some discretion as far as county councils are concerned in the administration of the grants.  In all cases it need not necessarily be a 100 per cent grant.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will readily appreciate, my constituency is different from his but, from the information supplied to me here and in respect of the reply which I gave to the Deputy, the administration of these grants is a matter for each county council.  The sum of money is the same nationwide.  There could, however, be some supplementary allowances that a particular local authority are adding.  I refer the Deputy to his own county manager to check the position, but it may be possible that the special aid for the elderly scheme could assist some people who are not otherwise in a position to receive assistance.  It may very well be that what he is referring to could come under that category.</P>

      <P>The practice of requiring a bond for the satisfactory completion of housing estates is one of a number of measures available to planning authorities to ensure that housing estates are completed to the required standard.  It is a matter for the planning authority to decide the amount and type of security to be given in any particular case and the conditions under which it should be used.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>In relation to the bonding system, it has often been found that builders have inadequate bonds.  Is the Minister considering the extension of the National House Building Guarantee Scheme to take into account unfinished estates and also insolvencies, where purchasers' money is lost when a builder goes into liquidation?  Is a major review being undertaken by his Department in relation to this scheme which has now, I believe, over £3 million in assets and very few liabilities because of its terms of reference? It is a scandal and needs reviewing.</P>

      <P>It is understood that the road in question is a county road. Responsibility for the planning and execution of any works on the road, including the timing and the provision of the necessary finance, rests with Laois County Council.  In the case of improvement works, the local authority may at their discretion use the block grant for roads to supplement expenditure from their own resources on such works.  Maintenance works on the road fall to be financed from the local authority's own resources and, in accordance with the practice established by successive Governments, State grants are not provided for such work.</P>
      <P>I understand that the local authority are considering the question of remedial works at the location mentioned and including a provision for this work in the estimates for 1986.</P>

      <P>Does the Minister not consider that the residents of Shanahoe are in a very awkward and difficult position since after every heavy rainfall, which means during most of this year of 1985, they were unable to negotiate the floods in order to get to Church, to the cemetery or to business premises in the area?  While Laois County Council, like other local authorities, have a statutory responsibility, surely the Minister's Department must take the necessary steps to protect the public in the event of the local authorities not complying with their statutory responsibility to provide free access to these places and use of the road in general?  Could the Minister actively interest himself in ensuring that this will be the last year in which the people of Shanahoe will have this appalling experience?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1985 Laois County <Col N="1901" /> Council received £303,000 in the block grant for works which can be done, including remedial improvement works for the area of Shanahoe.  On 30 October of this year the Laois County Council engineer reported to the authority that the remedial and improvement works required to avoid the problem that has visited the people of Shanahoe in the past would cost approximately £18,500.  I am sure Deputy Flanagan will be able to use his position of seniority in Laois County Council to effect in 1986, so that that small sum of £18,500 can be made available out of a similar block grant for 1986 for road improvements.</P>

      <P>In relation to delays in other areas mentioned by the Minister, are there any plans for his Department to allow local authorities to employ additional staff to avoid these backlogs?  I welcome the decision to employ a legal assistant in the Dublin area but clearly there are backlogs and there is a very heavy strain on staff in the loans and grants sections of local authorities. Serious problems are developing for people availing of the new grants, who, by and large, cannot afford bridging finance.  I would appeal to him to indicate what variation the Department propose to allow in the appointment of additional staff.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously, all local authorities have to operate within the constraints of overall resources and the embargo, but that does not necessarily mean that within their own staff allocations they do not have sufficient personnel to process loan applications of one kind or another.  Lack of money is not an impediment to loans becoming available; but there are some staff shortages, particularly in the larger local authorities. We have already dealt with the request for additional legal assistance in respect of Dublin Corporation.  There can also be delays unrelated to processing, such as matters of title, over which the administration may not have an immediate or direct effect.  Sometimes the prospective purchaser is not made fully aware of such delays by the solicitors involved.</P>

      <P>Local authorities are responsible for the levying and collection of rates.  The Supreme Court found the levying and collection of rates on land by reference to the Valuation Acts to be inconsistent with the Constitution.  It would be a matter for each local authority in consultation with its legal advisers to decide what action, if any, can be taken to recover rates outstanding before the court decision.

The legal proceedings which culminated with that decision began in 1982.  Prior to and throughout the course of the legal proceedings arrears of rates on land were accumulating and by the end of 1982 amounted to £20 million.  I understand these rates would be legally collectable because they were charged while the legislation was still in force.  I do not know how much of the £20 million has been collected since then.</P>

      <P>A new house grant cannot be paid in this case as the floor area of the house exceeds the statutory limit of 125 sq. m. &mdash; 1,346 sq. ft.  The manner of calculation of the floor area is set out in paragraph 6 of Memorandum H. A. 1, which is issued to applicants for new house grants.  An attic may be disregarded for floor area purposes only if it is undeveloped.  One of the factors determining whether an attic space is undeveloped or not is the number and size of windows in the attic.  In this case, the number of windows was excessive &mdash; two gable-end windows and two dormer windows &mdash; and this area had, therefore, to be included as part of the total floor area of the house.  Consequently, the overall floor area of the house was in excess of the maximum allowable.</P>

      <P>Planning is proceeding at present in regard to the Lucan-Kilcock road and a public inquiry into the motorway scheme will be held next year.  Subject to the outcome of the inquiry, work is scheduled to commence in 1987.  With regard to the Balbriggan by-pass, planning is proceeding at local authority level while work is scheduled to commence on the road plan in 1987 and it is hoped that this target will be met.  With regard to the downstream crossing of the River Lee, a public inquiry into Cork Corporation's application for a bridge order was held in October 1985 and the transcript is at present being typed.  Work is not scheduled to commence on this project until after 1987.  The Lucan road-Navan road proposal is currently being discussed with Dublin Corporation and there is a toll road proposal of which the Deputy might be aware.  It will cost a sum of £23 million and the design is well advanced in relation to it.  The possibility in regard to the <Col N="1909" /> Newbridge by-pass &mdash; and it is no more than a possibility &mdash; is that private sector investment in this project is under discussion between the relevant authorities and I am not in a position to give an indication as to the outcome of those discussions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for the Environment if he agrees with the conclusions in the Report on Impact of 1985 VAT Budget Increase on the Construction Industry published in November 1985, by the Society of Chartered Surveyors in the Republic of Ireland and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.  In connection with the subject matter of the report, I would refer him to my reply to Question No. 12 answered on 25 June last and Question No. 41 answered on 7 November last in which I referred to the effect of the increase in the rate of VAT on building services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would also like to point out that since the report was produced, the recent package of measures, comprising financial, taxation and employment incentives in the construction sector, has been introduced. The report does not, therefore, <Col N="1910" /> take account of the beneficial effects which these measures should have on both output and employment in the building industry.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister agree that the increases in VAT had a serious impact on the building industry and that they have been delivered a death blow? Is he aware that skills which have taken many years to acquire have now been lost to the trade and that in some cases many of the people with these skills have emigrated? I should also like the Minister to give an indication of the number of new house starts from May to November 1984 as opposed to the same period in 1985 so that we could make a comparison, which I am sure will show that there is a definite downturn in the construction industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand the Deputy's concern regarding the building industry and I share it.  However, I am sure he will agree that the state of the building industry is a reflection of the level of economic activity rather than a determining component.  Demand within the building industry in respect of large sectors of the commercial area, such as factory and office accommodation and agricultural business accommodation, has declined.  Were it not for the enormous contribution made directly by the Government at national and local level &mdash; approximately 75p in every £ spent in the building industry comes from the taxpayer &mdash; the industry would be even more depressed.  The effects of the measures which we announced in the Barrettstown package will generate a lot of activity in the housing sector.  There is, quite clearly, a level of oversupply in the other three sectors to which I referred.  It is also hoped that, while the increases in the rate of VAT on the construction industry had a direct negative impact of some order, that impact was offset by the reduction in the levels of VAT generally and in the positive effect it had on economic activity, thereby stimulating a certain degree of fresh economic demand within the economy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MJNolan" hpid="Mr. Nolan Mr. Nolan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Nolan</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot understand the Minister's mathematics when he says that there was a reduction in costs as a result of the changes in the VAT rate.  An ordinary house which previously cost £30,000 has now increased by £1,500.  Does the Minister agree that a mistake was made in the last budget?  If so, would he now encourage his Cabinet colleagues to make positive moves towards restoring confidence in the building trade because, if not, many skills will be lost for ever?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy did not quote me correctly.  I did not say that increases in VAT had reduced the cost of construction; clearly, that would be a contradiction. I appreciate the Deputy's concern: the building industry is in difficulties at present and that is the case in every country in the Community.  The Government are contributing up to 75p in every £.  The building industry frequently prides itself on being the flag carrier of private enterprise and many of its spokesmen articulate their support for the economic system.  The building industry needs a little private enterprise investment from the same people who in the good years made enormous sums of money from the industry with resources which were supplied in the first instance by the taxpayer. The reality is that the level of economic activity in the construction industry is a function of economic demand within the economy generally.  Perhaps the Deputies can point to new areas of economic demand in agriculture, industrial buildings or office accommodation &mdash; the three main areas of non-residential private sector activity &mdash; because there is no area in which the Government are not stimulating construction demand, whether in hospital programmes, local authority housing or roads.  We have the biggest construction programme ever undertaken by any Government in respect of house improvement grants, schools and any other areas of the public sector of the economy to which anyone wants to refer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sadly, all of that enormous activity which is funded by the taxpayer is still not enough to deal with the requirements for employment and to sustain the skills <Col N="1912" /> to which Deputy Nolan referred.  I should not like to give the impression that I was not accepting the Deputy's point.  It has had a direct negative effect but we believe that effect has been somewhat offset &mdash; although it is impossible to measure &mdash; by the reduction of VAT levels generally and the simplification of the taxation system.  This survey on which the Chartered Institute of Surveyors made their assessment of the construction industry and the economy was made before the impact of the Barrettstown package. While we are concerned about the matter, I believe there is the possibility that their predictions will not be borne out when the full effects of the Barrettstown package are felt.</P>

The number of inspectors employed is 64, some of whom are also engaged on inspections of new houses.  The estimated expenditure in 1986 will be published shortly in the Book of Estimates.

      <P>Will the Minister state what financial provisions the Government have made for the payment of house improvement grants for 1986?  On the basis of the tentative figures by various commentators it is estimated that the Department may accept some 50,000 applications.  On the basis that the maximum grant is £8,500, and taking a round figure of between £1,000 and £3,000 per grant approval, this would give a figure of from £50 million to £150 million.  What provision have the Government made in their Estimates for this sum?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RuairiQuinn" hpid="Mr. Quinn Mr. Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>The Book of Estimates will be published shortly and provision will be indicated in respect of the matter raised by the Deputy.  It is clear that the number of applications received is an indication of the demand in the private housing sector for home improvements. When the grants are added to the moneys invested by the private sector, this will generate considerable activity in the private sector where it is needed.  It is not possible at this stage to say precisely what amounts will be required or have been allocated.  The Deputy may be assured that this successful scheme, which has been welcomed by all sides, will be responded to by the Government.</P>

Further, will he confirm that in the event of undue delays he will provide extra staff in the Department?  Where does he propose to get the extra staff if they are required?</P>

Farmers try to get as much as possible for their products. That industry is hazardous and farmers must make an effort to get as much as they can.

      <P>Will the terms of association that it is intended to apply to State-sponsored bodies, in accordance with section 10, apply to co-ops?  If co-ops become involved what structure will apply to them?  We must remember that the co-op movement is involved in a different type of activity from that of State or semi-State bodies.  If we are to invite co-ops to become involved for the purpose of investment, as suggested by Deputy O'Keeffe&mdash;investment is about the only way the NDC will be involved &mdash;will the terms of association be the same as those in the Bill for State-sponsored bodies?</P>

      <P>As the Deputy will be aware&mdash;I am sure Deputy O'Keeffe will confirm this&mdash;although the co-ops were set up under the industrial and provident societies they have already been establishing limited companies and subsidiaries. The NDC are not precluded from investing in co-ops as such but as they have a strong duty under the general duty in section 13 to obtain a reasonable return from investment&mdash;essentially co-ops do not give out very large dividends normally and tend to re-invest the money&mdash; I expect that the vehicle whereby co-ops would seek to attract NDC investment <Col N="1952" /> would be on the basis of them establishing a subsidiary company in which they and the NDC would invest.

I would like an assurance from him that that desire to develop the food processing industry extends to what are <Col N="1953" /> called the 12 western counties because I was a little perturbed when the National Economic and Social Council recently indicated that they favoured having another look at the designated areas.  The implication was that some of the special facilities would be removed from those areas.  After looking at the National Economic and Social Council personnel I was extremely dubious about the qualification of most of the people on that council to assess the economy in the 12 western counties.  Consequently, I ask the Minister to assure the House that his commitment to the development of the food processing industry extends to those 12 western counties without modification of the present aids.  Apart from representatives of the IFA and the ICMSA, neither of whom as far as I could make out are from that area, the remainder of the council would seem to me to be lacking in experience of conditions in that part of the country.  An assurance from the Minister that his approval is a blanket one and that he is taking into account that the aids that obtain now for such development will be continued will be welcomed by the House.</P>

      <P>Not at all.  I am sorry to have to repeat myself but I must point out that the National Development Corporation will be investing in companies in the same way as a private venture capital company or as the Industrial Credit Company invest.  The IDA, CTT and others give grants for activities.  No company will be disqualified from getting money from the IDA just because the NDC happen to have a 10 per cent or, for that matter, a 51 per cent share in it and companies will have no guarantee of getting grants just because they are a NDC company.  If the IDA do not think the project put forward is a good one although the NDC may think it is, the IDA will not be under any obligation to invest.  Likewise, if the IDA are grant-aiding a project and refer the people concerned to the NDC the corporation will not be under any obligation to invest in it simply because the IDA supported it.</P>

      <P>I agree.  Subsection (f) states that the corporation may invest in any enterprise involving the exploitation, development, production or marketing of natural resources, including agricultural, fishery or forestry resources. I must again refer to the Minister's emphasis that the job of the NDC is to invest enquity or venture capital unlike the IDA which grant-aids.</P>
      <P>Subsection (f) refers to investing enterprises in those areas only, whereas under other sections the NDC are to manage and assist enterprises financially or otherwise and in other cases may establish an enterprise either alone or in co-operation with a State-sponsored commecial body.

      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the NDC would do this on a planned basis.  The IDA are engaged in this area.  They have a separate food sector and presunably they have lots of ideas which they will be <Col N="1956" /> putting to the NDC asking them to invest in the various ventures.  It will be new for the IDA to approach the NDC in the first place regarding any possible area of investment.  Will it be the case then that the NDC will be reacting to prodding from the IDA or from any other quarter, or will the corporation have their own plan?</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that they will know what they are at instead of reacting to what other people may request of them especially in the area of the revitalisation of the food processing sector.  I am trying to ensure that the corporation would have a cohesive and co-ordinated plan but there is no such provision in the Bill.  Is it the intention of the Minister that they would set out proposals for him as to what they intend doing about the food processing industry?  There should at least be guidelines for them instead of legislating in a way that would result in their hopping around from one place to another.</P>

      <P>The Minister made the fair point that we should look at this matter in the overall context but he is saying continually that basically the difference between the IDA and the NDC is that one can invest in equity whereas the other are involved in grant aid.

      <P>On this whole question of investment an incorrect impression has been given throughout the debate so far.  In some cases the IDA have taken equity shareholding to the extent of 15 or 20 per cent.  It is being said now that we need the NDC so that they may invest in companies and the impression is being created that, while <Col N="1957" /> the IDA deal with the grants side, the corporation will look after the investing. Details of the companies in which the IDA take equity investment are to be found in the annual report.  Why not ask the IDA to continue that process of equity investment?</P>

      <P>Similarly, the IDA give loan guarantees.  There was the case of CRH where they had an equity share holding which was paid back recently as we find from the annual report.  Therefore, there is a grave contradiction in what we are talking about because the involvement of the NDC is to be similar to that of the IDA.  One can instance Asahi in which the IDA have equity shareholding.</P>

      <P>But I take it that the main point of the amendment relates to a comprehensive plan rather than merely to the food processing sector and that Deputy Mac Giolla is suggesting that section 10, as drafted, is somewhat inactive and passive in its approach and that he is suggesting planning as an alternative.  Is it within the brief of section 10 that the NDC should try to put together better corporate structures and better management teams?  Obviously the other option is better worker co-operative structures. There is a danger that if the NDC merely sit and wait for projects to be brought to them, they will be waiting a long time and that, therefore, there is a need for a more active initiating effort on the part of the corporation.  It is well recognised that the real lack is in terms of projects being brought forward, that this lack is even greater than the lack of venture capital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Leyden has disappeared.  I must explain again to Deputy Mac Giolla that there is a distinction to be drawn between the NDC planning their own investment strategy which of course they will do, and their being charged, as Deputy Mac Giolla is trying to provide for, with the job of planning the entire sector.  That would be beyond their competence.  It is a matter for the Department of Agriculture, for the IDA and for all the State agencies involved in that sector.  I have no wish to lumber the NDC with the huge remit of planning everything in the food sector.  Instead, I am anxious that they concentrate on certain investment opportunities, but they must approach that in a planned way.</P>
      <P>Clearly, they will not simply wait for projects to be brought to them.  They will consider the sector as a whole, identify certain niches where investment opportunities exist and seek out people already in that sector with a view to expansion. If the corporation should find that the people involved are not able to do the job, they would consider moving in themselves or perhaps putting together a consortium or using some other company, such as Guinness, for example, and asking them whether they would like to diversify into the area concerned with a view to putting together a project with the NDC and perhaps with some one else.</P>
      <P>Planning for investment opportunities is different from planning for the entire agricultural and food sector, which the Deputy's amendment would ask them to do and which is a task which should not be given to them if we want them to be a lean mean investment oriented body rather than a big bureaucracy with pretensions to running everybody else's business except their own.  That is the reason for not giving them too wide a remit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Brennan pointed out that the IDA make investments and I had been making the point that it was primarily a grant giving body.  The Deputy suggested by implication that it would be a bit incongruous to have both the NCD and the IDA making investments and taking <Col N="1960" /> equity in companies.  It is not really incongruous, although it is one area in which there could be needless over-lapping. The type of investment or equity which the IDA take is in companies where they are trying to put together a financial package and they have gone five-sixths of the way and need another sixth to finance the project and bridge the gap.  In that sort of situation, because they have exhausted all the grants available, the IDA may decide to take equity as well.  That is not a desirable practice as a general rule, because the grant limits were set for a reason, and if they have been exceeded the IDA should ask themselves why it is necessary for them to take equity.  It would need to be a very good project for the IDA to take equity.</P>
    <P>I will be asking the National Development Corporation and the IDA to work out between them an operating agreement to clearly delineate the areas where overlapping might arise and lay down rules to avoid it.  One area where this could occur would be in respect of projects where the IDA are considering taking equity.  In so far as possible all equity investment should be left to the NDC and the IDA should stick to the grant giving activity.  However, there will be the occasional case where the IDA will take equity.  American companies do not seem to want the Government to take equity but Far Eastern companies tend to want the Government to take equity as an assurance of their welcome from the Government.  Where, for instance, the IDA are giving grant aid to a Japanese company coming here, rather than referring the case to the NDC for their 10 per cent equity, there is no harm in the IDA putting in the equity.  The power contained in the Industrial Development Bill should remain for that purpose. It is my intention to lay down clear guidelines to restrict the IDA from getting unduly involved in equity cases and to leave that to the NDC generally.  I have ample powers available to do that, first through my approval of the operating agreement between the NDC and the IDA and through the powers I have to <Col N="1961" /> give directives to both bodies under relevant sections of the Industrial Development Bill.  I have forgotten Deputy O'Keeffe's point.</P>

      <P>That essentially gives them a mandate to establish on a commercial self financing basis a type of shell company in the marketing field which might be useful for a number of small manufacturers to use, a joint subsidiary for marketing activity, where individually they do not have the resources to engage in marketing.</P>

      <P>Perhaps the wording is bad but the Minister has misinterpreted the purpose of the amendment. The amendment refers to a plan:</P>
      <P>&mdash;for revitalisation of the food processing industry through profitable innovation by the State sector, the private sector and co-operative societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are the three groups involved in the food processing industry.  In the State <Col N="1962" /> sector there is the Sugar Company and what is left of Erin Foods, and then there are private enterprises and co-operatives. We need a plan for development projects in relation to those three areas.  We should have a plan to develop areas which are not being developed or which are not being developed sufficiently, or for marketing.</P>
    <P>The Minister indicated that he would insist that the IDA and the NDC would clarify a line of demarcation so that there would not be any messing about.  That is part of a plan.  I am glad the Minister will insist on that because the Bill does not force the NDC to make any arrangements with the IDA.  I hope the Minister will also accept that some type of planning is essential at least to give the Minister an idea that they have in mind the same thing that the Minister has in mind for them.  If the Minister would indicate that he will insist on some planning of that nature I will be prepared to withdraw the amendment.</P>
    <P>The Bill does not indicate sufficiently that the NDC will be actively promoting projects and opening up new areas.  The NDC have all these powers but they need some plan so that what they develop will last and will continue to develop of its own accord.  They should perhaps get into a whole new area of the food processing industry which has not yet been touched. Some such plan should be put before the Government to indicate that the Bill will work.  That is the only reason for the amendment.  Those two amendments were on the same basis.  The Bill was leaving the NDC to react to whatever happened, to various lobbies, and to invest in this, that and the other, whether it be in co-operatives, the private sector, the IDA, the State sector or whatever, all asking them to do different things with no plan, no guidelines on where they are going, when they would be hopping around in all directions.  That is the only reason these two amendments were put down.  Perhaps the Minister would indicate that he intends that that will not happen.</P>

      <P>I would be quite happy <Col N="1963" /> to ask the corporation to place their investments in the food sector within a broad strategy which they would devise for their involvement in that sector, a strategy which would clearly have to take into account a broad scale development process for the food sector.  Certainly I would not wish the corporation to be making entirely random investments without any conception of where they were going or what they were trying to achieve from a national development point of view.  I hope that assurance is sufficient for the Deputy.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;(2) In carrying out its objects the Corporation shall have regard to its general duties under section 13.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This is simply to meet the point made by Deputy Lyons and others earlier in the debate, to indicate clearly that, in carrying out their objects under section 10, the corporation must have regard to their general duties as set out in section 13. Deputy Lyons was concerned that all the activities of the NDC, as set out in section 10, should have the overall duty of creating the maximum number of jobs. That is achieved by this amendment.  This amendment also ensures that, in respect of the fulfilment of all their objects, the NDC shall have a policy of realising their investments as soon as is financially and commercially prudent in such a manner as to enable them to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by them and to ensure that funds are available for the Revolving Investment Fund for Employment.</P>

      <P>It is impossible to debate this amendment without serious reference to section 13 because it proposes that the corporation shall have regard to their general duties under section 13.  If that is passed, therefore, section 13 is written in there.  I respectfully suggest that the Chair take a lenient view because section 13 is clearly written in there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to put one point to the Minister, and I do not want to appear to be splitting hairs about this.  Section 13, which is referred to here, provides that the general duty of the corporation shall be &ldquo;to carry out its objects, which shall include the realisation of investments...&rdquo; My reservation is about the inclusion of the word &ldquo;objects&rdquo; there.  The Minister should be crisp and clear in telling the House that that really means &ldquo;objectives&rdquo;, that that is the aim of the corporation. One could read that: &ldquo;to carry out its objects which shall include the realisation...&rdquo; I am not a lawyer but I could foresee lawyers reading that phrase &ldquo;to carry out its objects&rdquo; as somehow suggesting that it was necessary, almost mandatory, certainly stronger than a wish <Col N="1965" /> that it would happen.  I know that the word &ldquo;objects&rdquo; is used earlier in section 10 but in that case it is quite clear that the principal object shall be to do certain things.</P>
    <P>In the context in which it is used here, it quite clearly says that it shall be the general duty of the corporation &ldquo;to carry out its objects, which shall include the realisation of investments made by it as soon as is financially and commercially prudent...&rdquo; I should like the Minister to be very clear for the record in assuring the House that that is an objective of the corporation, that the phrase as it is used &ldquo;to carry out its objects&rdquo; is not somehow suggesting that it is necessary or essential for them to do so.

The whole purpose here is to ensure that, in carrying out all the objects in section 10 the NDC shall do so in such a manner as to enable them to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by them, and ensure that <Col N="1966" /> funds are available to the Revolving Investment Fund for Employment.</P>

      <P>The point is relevant, but for the reasons stated we may not get through this section.  I think the Minister acknowledges that it is difficult to deal with a reference to section 13 on section 10 without addressing oneself to the amendment of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;may&rdquo; or &ldquo;may&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;shall&rdquo;.  I have indicted that section 13 does not appear to add anything new to the objects of the NDC, and it reduces the sharpness of the Bill.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I want to make a point which, like the Deputies opposite, I cannot make without briefly referring to section 13.  Section 13 contains in a position of prominence the expression &ldquo;viable employment&rdquo;.  I realise that Deputy Lyons put down an amendment which was discussed earlier in which he sought in section 10 to substitute for the <Col N="1968" /> expression &ldquo;or providing viable employment&rdquo; the expression &ldquo;and providing viable employment&rdquo;.  I am sorry that I did not hear what he had to say about that, but he might not have made the point that the word &ldquo;viable&rdquo; is not defined in the Bill and can mean different things to different people.  The emphasis which has now been given to it by the Minister's amendment in which he, as it were, is piling one viability on a set of other viabilities, makes it important before we leave this section to get this absolutely clear.  The apprehension in my mind is that &ldquo;viable&rdquo; perhaps in the minds of the Department and the Minister does not mean &ldquo;viable&rdquo; in the commercial sense but in some other impalpable and so far not yet discussed sense.  I have that apprehension because in various clauses in the first subsection of section 10 to the expression &ldquo;profitability&rdquo;&ldquo;development&rdquo;, &ldquo;expansion&rdquo;, &ldquo;growth&rdquo; and &ldquo;providing viable employment&rdquo; are mentioned disjunctively with the word &ldquo;or&rdquo; as though to suggest that viable employment can be there even though profitability is not.  I hope the Minister can dispose of this and assure the House that what is intended is to define &ldquo;viable&rdquo; in such a way as to put it on a par with commercial viability, and no project would be commercially viable and the employment in it would not be commercially viable unless the project was profitable.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy would look at the various clauses in section 10 which he is quoting he will see that the requirements are that the investments must be profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient and have resonable prospects for profitability, development etc., so &ldquo;profitability and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient&rdquo; is a free standing requirement.</P>

      <P>I do not think the amendment is really necessary.  Section 10 lays out that &ldquo;the principal objects of the Corporation...&rdquo; and at the end of that the Minister wants to put in &ldquo;In carrying out its objects...&rdquo; and the objects are listed.  The amendment reads, &ldquo;In carrying out its objects the Corporation shall have regard to its general duties under section 13&rdquo;, which are to carry out its objects.  The general duty of the corporation is to carry out its objects.  That is in section 13.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>No. The Deputy is not reading it.  Section 13 provides that:</P>
      <P>It shall be the general duty of the Corporation&mdash;</P>
      <P> (a)  to assist in the creation of the maximum amount of viable employment in the State, and</P>
      <P>(b)  to carry out its objects, which shall include the realisation of investments made by it as soon as is financially and commercially prudent, in such a manner as to enable the Corporation to earn a reasonable return on any investment made by it and ensure that funds are available to the Revolving Investment Fund for Employment. </P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>Under section 13 the general duty is to carry out its objects.  If section 13 were <Col N="1970" /> moved forward to follow section 10 it would serve the same purpose.  I do not see the point in putting in an amendment which is already in the Bill, that the NDC's general duty is to carry out their objects, and then the Minister says that in carrying out their objects the corporation have regard to their general duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The need for it is to make sure that in undertaking the various objects that they have been given in section 10 the corporation have regard throughout to their general duty which applies in respect of fulfilment of all their objects which are set out in section 13, which are twofold: (1) to create the maximum number of jobs, (2) to earn a reasonable return on any investment they make.  Those are the two general duties which apply to all the objects.  Lest there be any doubt that in fulfilling their objects the corporation at all times and in respect of all their objects have regard to their general duty, we are putting in an amendment to make it absolutely clear in section 10 &mdash; a cross-reference from section 10 to section 13 &mdash; that nobody can say, &ldquo;We are in accordance with section 10 so that absolves us from following section 13&rdquo;.  We are making clear that in doing anything under section 10 we must comply with sectin 13.  It is a system of cross-referencing to make sure that the thing is watertight and clear.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 19:</P>
      <P>In page 8, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following subsection:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;(5) Nothing in this Act shall be construed as enabling the Corporation to give grants to any enterprise.&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This is to make it clear that the corporation will not be giving grants.  The term &ldquo;assist&rdquo; is used at different points in the <Col N="1971" /> corporation's objects and &ldquo;assist&rdquo; does not mean giving financial grants.  It means making financial investments or giving non-financial assistance.  In this amendment we have excluded them from giving grants.  That would be designed to meet the general wish in the House that it should be abundantly clear that the NDC will not go into competition with the IDA or SFADCo in giving grants.  They will perform a separate role.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>I concur that it is necessary to put that in.  It will erase any doubts in anybody's mind.  There were some expressions along those lines at the announcement of the setting up of the NDC by people speaking in favour and so on, that all this money was available. A figure of £300 million was being thrown about in suitable places, and they gave the impression that the NDC were another arm of the State handing out money like the IDA or the multiplicity of groups that we have.  I am glad that the NDC are not such an organisation giving grants or aid in the way that people had conjured up in their minds.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree entirely with the thrust of this amendment.  However, the corollary should not be enforced as strongly as the Minister seems to suggest, namely, that the IDA should never take up equity.  He said that that might be the thrust of his directive about the arrangement between the NDC and the IDA. That would be dangerous.  I see equity as being a useful vehicle instead of solely grants for an agency like the IDA, quite distinct from the NDC's role.</P>
      <P>Amendment agreed to.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That section 10 as amended, stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="1972" />
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>Before we conclude on section 10, when are we going to get time to amend it?  This is the last opportunity because it will be guillotined at 6.45 p.m. I know it is by agreement and I accept that, but at this stage when we reach the end of section 10 it is time to stop and reflect on the first ten sections.  It can be said that the first nine of those ten sections are for the setting up of the NDC and the tenth provides how and where the corporation will make their investments. From the words used it could be said that, apart from giving financial assistance, the corporation would appear to be given power to become involved in management. If that is the case, could it be said that the corporation will end up with more employees than the enterprises they intend to assist?  We will come later to director-employee requirements.</P>
      <P>If an enterprise ends up in the ownership of the NDC, will the corporation involve themselves in management and not just investment?  Any such involvement by the corporation would qualify for Government grants and other State assistance &mdash; the Minister's previous amendment qualified that somewhat. Section 10 contains the principal substance of the Bill, and in it the corporation must be capable of funding new projects.  Therefore, we must be careful how we address this provision.  The corporation will have to be dynamic and they could play a catalytic role, particularly sensitive about new techniques and processing. That is desirable if the objectives as well as the objects of the NDC are to be achieved.</P>
      <P>The section does not set out a predetermined time limit and when he is finalising the establishment of the corporation I hope the Minister will ensure that targets in relation to time will be set for the NDC.  If we accept all the provisions in section 10, the corporation will be making large investments and it is therefore essential that a timescale and targets would be set.  I am not so sure we have dealt fully with that aspect of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The whole of section 10 deals with the principal objects of the <Col N="1973" /> corporation and I suggest that the drafting of section 10. particularly subsection (1), leaves much to be desired.  I do not think anybody would hold out the first clause in the section as being a model of utility.  I cannot understand the recurrence of the idea of profitability twice in two lines or three times in three lines. Paragraph (d) refers to &ldquo;reasonable prospects for profitability, development, expansion, growth or providing viable employment&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>At the risk of being tedious, I must repeat that the Minister is giving the impression that there is a difference between the third and the second legs of the criteria in section 10.  The Bill should make it clear that the provision of viable employment is not something separate from profitability.  I hope the Minister does not think that these clauses, because of references to profitability, are a clear answer in a most unlovely piece of drafting.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Paragraphs (c) and (d) have been amended.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>So there will be a &ldquo;profitability&rdquo; clause in all of these paragraphs. Between now and Report Stage I suggest the Minister should look at this wording and ask himself if he is not leaving loopholes. He will be anxious to preserve such funds as the State will make available to the NDC, but is he not leaving it open to future Ministers to look for employment through some criteria other than profitability?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I agree that is the way the corporation should operate, but there is another thing about the section: it does not refer to the location of the enterprise which the corporation would be in business to assist.  The Bill refers to enterprise, but the location is not mentioned.  We could be anxious to invest in a foreign enterprise, like sending building or hospital staffs to the Middle East, which did not happen 20 years ago but which is now emerging.  If I were the NDC I would want to know what the capacity would be for such enterprises.  I would want to see <Col N="1974" /> that the legitimate object of the corporation would be beyond doubt.  It is not excluded, but I wonder would the Minister put this beyond doubt.  Perhaps I have overlooked something, but in case a doubt should arise about a foreign based operation in which Irish capital and staff would be involved, I should like to see this expressly mentioned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The gist of section 10 is that the corporation will invest with semi-State companies and the emphasis is on getting into a business with State bodies.  Under this Bill we are setting up a State enterprise to go to other State enterprises and ask about getting into business together.  They in turn will set up a third organisation which will then do the business.  Is it not the height of lunacy in a small country like this to be following such a procedure?  If there is business there to be done, why do the existing semi-State bodies not do it, for example the ESB, Aer Lingus, Bord na Móna?  There is no reason why such companies cannot look at a profitable investment, seek the funds and do the business.</P>
      <P>There is the Aer Lingus work done through the Dunfey's Hotels and foreign investment.  They did an excellent job of investing in subsidiaries and in profitable opportunities.  Why do we lumber ourselves with a new organisation to get in touch with existing State companies of which there are hundreds, to set up a third organisation to create jobs?  That could bring a chain reaction.  It makes no sense for this economy at this time to be taking such an approach.  I feel extremely strongly about that.  It is at the core of this Bill and is very woolly and faulty thinking.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Section 10(e) mentions assisting financially or otherwise and managing or acting &ldquo;as a holding company for any State-sponsored commercial enterprise established after the passing of this Act.&rdquo; In other words, the National Development Corporation can act as a holding company for any State-sponsored commercial enterprise established after the passing of the Act.  Supposing the suggestion is accepted that we have a semi-State <Col N="1975" /> company to take over the Department of Forestry, as an example, because that suggestion happens to be doing the rounds, does it mean that under that section Forestry could be handed over to the corporation which would then act as a holding company?</P>
    <P>I am not being devious in making this point but I am worried about it and it is important that the record should show that somebody made it.  Under this section if the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, who at the moment are somewhere in Limbo-land, were formally to become a State-sponsored commercial enterprise, the corporation could act as their holding company.  Why say that it could be a holding company for future semi-State companies?  If the Minister does not mean as much as that, he should tighten up the section now.  I accept what the Minister is saying, and his own intentions in this regard, but future Ministers could use the NDC as a holding company for all future semi-State companies under section 10(e).  If he does not mean that to happen, he should take it out of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Under Section 10(2)(e) the corporation might participate in partnerships. How is it possible for a limited liability company, which the NDC will be, to hold a share in partnership?  Will that not be a difficult legal trick to organise?  How can a limited company have a share in partnership if the partnership is not a limited partnership?  I do not see how that could happen in the ordinary sense of a partnership.  The Bill would suggest that the word &ldquo;partnership&rdquo; is used in the sense of, say, a firm of solicitors or accountants in partnership.  The wording is much too loose and the Minister should amend it.  Section 10 (2)(k) states that the corporation shall have power:</P>
    <P>to make a loan to any enterprise provided that such a loan is not inconsistent with the provisions of section 15.</P>
    <P>I do not want to discuss section 15 because the Leas-Cheann Comhairle <Col N="1976" /> would jump on me, and rightly so, but that section says that the corporation shall be empowered &ldquo;to make no more than one loan to each enterprise in which it invests&rdquo;.  That is also written into section 10, with reference to section 15.  Is that not the height of commercial nonsense? One loan could be anything from £1 to £1 million.  What is important is the size of the loan.  I have never seen such a phrase in any legislation with which I am familiar.  Some time later it might be discovered that there was a tremendous opportunity in that company and under the legislation they could not get another loan.  Surely the correct thing is to put in the extent of the loan, which the Minister did before.  He has written figures into Bills previously.</P>

      <P>With regard to section 10 subsections (3) and (4) I am not a legal person, but I see some danger in them.  There are people more qualified than I to comment on some phrases used, but I ask for clarification.</P>
      <P>The subsections are as follows:</P>
      <P> (3) Nothing in this section shall prevent or restrict the inclusion among the objects of the Corporation as stated in the memorandum of association of all such objects and powers as are reasonably necessary or proper for or incidental or ancillary to the due attainment of the principal objects aforesaid and are not inconsistent with this Act.</P>
      <P>(4)  The Corporation shall have power to do anything which appears to be requisite to or which appears to it to facilitate the performance by it of any of its objects as specified in this Act or in its memorandum of association and is not inconsistent with any enactment for the time being in force.  </P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the subsections the following phrases are used &ldquo;as are reasonably necessary&rdquo; and &ldquo;which appears to it to <Col N="1977" /> facilitate the performance by it of any of its objects&rdquo;.  These are opting out phrases.  The wording is extremely loose and dangerous.  Some subsequent board of directors of the NDC long after our time could say that something was reasonably necessary or that it appears to be necessary to facilitate the performance of their duties and it is much too open-ended.</P>

      <P>It is Section 10 is the anchor part of the Bill.  That fund to create employment will accumulate from the sale of assets or investments which will be productive or successful is very difficult for me to believe because that situation has not arisen before in the semi-State sector.  We have not gone into the public market for money for further investment.  What does the Minister propose to invest in the first year of the setting up of the corporation?  The amount is pegged at £300 million, but there is no initial suggestion of what the capital would be on day one.  Is it £1 or £500,000?  That is quite important.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen many enterprise people investing outside the country and people have not got confidence in investment because the climate is not right.  That is where the problem arises.  The opportunities are not here because one cannot get a proper return on investment.  Until we get all those things right we are in real <Col N="1978" /> trouble.  The more often this is said the sooner we will come to grips with the problem.  When we have the climate right for investment the system will work.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Kelly was concerned that there would not be sufficient emphasis on profit as an overriding requirement for viable employment.  We have stitched this into the objects of the corporation in a very definitive manner. All the objects are subject to the overriding general duty that they must be carried out in such a way as to earn a reasonable return on the investment.  A reasonable return equals profit.  That is the first line of defence against unprofitable investment. In respect of every one of the subheads of the objects there is the requirement that the investment must be in an enterprise which is profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient.  That stitches it in as clearly and definitively as one could ask.  Those two provisions stand on their own and are not subsidiary in any way to the &ldquo;or&rdquo; that appears in any of the remaining clauses.</P>

      <P>Yes, I had forgotten about that.  The general duty is to create the maximum amount of viable employment in the State.  I do not think the corporation would set up companies that would employ people on a permanent or semi-permanent basis overseas.  That would be outside their objects.</P>

      <P>I thought I had satisfied him.  Deputy Brennan was concerned about the requirement of acting as a holding company and asked whether this would mean that the National Development Corporation would be likely to be the holding company if a new State company were being set up in the forestry area.  It is possible that the NDC could be used as a holding company and it is permissible under this section but in my view it would not be desirable.  One is talking about setting up a company to run an on-going business, whereas the general thrust of the corporation should be to invest in new business.  I explained that on one of the amendments where I saw this holding company power being used. Let us assume that the ESB, Údarás na Gaeltachta and the NEA are individually involved in fish farming or aquaculture. These three State companies are responsible to different Ministers.  From the point of view of managing the State's investments efficiently it would not make sense to have an aquaculture expert employed in each of these bodies.  It <Col N="1980" /> would make much more sense to transfer all the State's shares in these companies to the NDC where one aquaculture expert could probably look after all of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Efficiency is the best assistance to job creation.  Job multiplication for the sake of multiplication is no use.  That is the sort of situation where I would envisage this power being used. I would not be in favour of the NDC becoming a holding company for a large existing State company because it would sap the dynamism of the NDC into administration, crisis management and oversight in respect of a large existing operation, whereas the thrust of the NDC should be towards new investments, getting them up and running, getting out of them and setting up more new ones.  That is the whole idea of the revolving fund &mdash; to maximise the effect of State involvement in industry by ensuring that it is constantly on the frontiers of technology and moving forward.  Many of the people who debated this topic felt that because the NDC would be turning over their investment this represented in some sense a form of hostility to the State being involved.  On the contrary, it represented a desire to ensure that if the State became involved it should do so to the maximum effect from the point of view of the amount of money it put in and thereby making State investment more constructive and productive in general terms. That essentially is the philosophy underlying the section which we are debating.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan asked if this could be used to become a holding company for State shares in the Insurance Corporation of Ireland or an insurance company.  The definition of &ldquo;enterprise&rdquo; in section 2 excludes banking, insurance, legal management consultancy, advertising, public relations and financial services, so the National Development Corporation will not be involved with the ICI.</P>

      <P>It is out of order as far as this legislation is concerned.  Deputy Brennan raised a very interesting point.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>There are shelf companies and this is shelf drafting.  It is unlikely that they will be involved in an unlimited partnership.  Possibly they could be involved in limited partnerships which would still be partnerships under the law.  I see difficulties in a body which are limited undertaking unlimited liability which is what would happen if they were engaged in an unlimited partnership. I cannot see how that could arise but, if there is a problem in that area, I have the power under the directives section to give guidance to the NDC as to how they might behave in this regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect to Deputy Brennan, the Minister would be ill advised to make a change off the top of his head.  I should like to think about it and I am sure that any legal adviser would like to spend half an hour at the very least thinking about it.  I do not think it is fair to ask the Minister to amend it in that fashion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>I can look at it on Report Stage and, if necessary, there could be an amendment in the Seanad. Unfortunately, that means it would have to come back to the Dáil which I would not be terribly keen on because of our crowded programme.  However, if there is a genuine problem I should like to rectify it and I commend Deputy Brennan on his industriousness in discovering it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The other point mentioned was in regard to loans and he seemed to be under the impression that the corporation were limited to giving one loan which could be as large as they liked.  That is not the case and if he looks at section 15(3) (a) (i) he will see that the amount of the loan may not exceed 30 per cent of the initial investment by the corporation and the amount of the loan is limited by the total investment.  The reason for not having the ability to put in more loan capital is that we do not want the NDC to become a bank or rescue agency constantly being looked to for more loan <Col N="1983" /> capital with the result that the balance sheet of the company is badly geared through more loans being made available by the NDC.</P>
    <P>There are State agencies engaged in lending money to industry such as the Industrial Credit Company and, where necessary, Fóir Teoranta and if, subsequent to their initial investment, companies need loan capital that is where they would look to or to the national banks, not to the NDC.  If it is such a marvellous investment they should not have any difficulty in getting the loan capital, but if they have to look to the NDC for a loan possibly there is something wrong with the project.  You might then ask why they should be allowed to give a loan.  I am advised that it is desirable in initial investment packages to allow companies who are investing to be given loans as well as equity.  In respect of the initial package we are allowing them to give loans but not after that and subject to the limit of 30 per cent of the investment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Brennan asked about subsections (3) and (4) of section 10.  The memorandum will have to be approved by me. Subsection (3) says: &ldquo;...such objects and powers as are reasonably necessary or proper for or incidental or ancillary to the due attainment of the principal objects aforesaid...&rdquo; Allowing that that may be done, it is, however, stated that such additional material as might be included must not be &ldquo;inconsistent with this Act.&rdquo;  This Bill governs any flexibility one might have in that regard.</P>
    <P>As far as subsection (4) is concerned, it is not quite as important because it simply empowers the corporation to do things which facilitate the achievement of their objects as distinct from adding to their objects.  I suppose it makes sense to allow them to do anything necessary to achieve their objects as long as it is legal which the requirement is.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Keeffe referred to the revolving fund and seemed to be a little sceptical about it.  I do not share this scepticism.  I expect that the NDC will make a contribution to the revolving fund <Col N="1984" /> from a very early date.  The revolving fund will be drawing from sales of assets but also from profits on existing investments. The NDC will inherit a portfolio of investments of £3.5 million made by the NEA and possibly by next year it could yield profits which could be paid into the revolving fund.  That fund should be building up&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The NEA have been a very successful agency.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;almost from the foundation of the NDC and that is as it should be.  The requirement to have a revolving fund is useful quite apart from the funds provided for investment.  In addition, it provides an objective financial measurement of the success of the corporation and the officals.  If the corporation do not build up a reasonable fund it is a sign they are not doing what they should so far as making profits are concerned.  I am sure all Deputies will agree that profits are necessary for jobs. Some may argue where the profits should go but I think it is common cause in this House &mdash; presumably including Deputy Mac Giolla &mdash; that profits are necessary for job creation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>They are being divided in three different ways.  From what the Minister has said &mdash; I hope he is right &mdash; the NDC will be so successful that immediately there will be money going into the revolving investment fund for employment. I am sure that would be appreciated by the unemployed.  However, I am not sure that the future operations of the corporation are clear.  For instance, are we talking about operating expenses after five years and for the distribution of profits if private investors are allowed to hold shares in the NDC?  It appears that dividends will have to be paid to the Exchequer.  The Minister spoke about profits but he did not say what share will go into the revolving fund.  He also indicated another sector who would receive dividends from such profits, the investors.  I should like to know if the criterion used will be how soon the NDC <Col N="1985" /> become self-supporting.  It appears to me that five years is too short a period to allow adequate risk-taking in some areas.</P>
      <P>It is a pity that there are time constraints on us in dealing with this Bill.  We have not got half-way through Committee Stage and I know we will run out of time.  The Government should be doing everything possible to create the right climate so that people will be motivated to establish businesses and to earn an adequate reward to compensate for the commercial risks involved as well as to earn a profit.  Profit will provide the investment funds for expansion.  If the Government did this it would be of more benefit than what is proposed here.  Even as we go through the Bill on Committee Stage many problems are arising.  I do not want to throw cold water on something that has not even got off the ground. In all honesty I must say that I do not think the NDC will ever get off the ground and the more we consider the matter here the more convinced I become of that.</P>
      <P>The revolving fund is very important. It is not indicated what criteria will be used to ensure that profits from enterprises will be channelled into the revolving fund for the specific purpose of creating more employment.  Will the Minister please elaborate on the revolving fund?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>This is governed by section 31 (2) which states:</P>
      <P>The Minister may, from time to time, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, direct that the profits of the Corporation, in any year in which a directive is made under this section, be applied in such a manner as may be specified in the directive.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is my intention that in the early years the profits will be paid into the revolving fund for employment so that the NDC will be able to make more investments. It is possible under section 31 (2) that the Minister would direct the corporation to give the profits over to the Exchequer. However, I do not envisage doing this in <Col N="1986" /> the early years.  I think it desirable that the corporation should build up a reasonably healthy revolving fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>The drafting of this section is lamentable.  The reason is that two hands have been at work on this section: the hand of Esau and the hand of Jacob are visible in it.  I suspect these clauses were in draft when perhaps a politically coloured voice was heard, or a new element arrived on the scene, which necessitated the glueing to the ends of these clauses of a further few lines and this has disqualified the entire section from earning any prize for elegance in draftsmanship.  What Deputy Wilson would call the <i>caesura</i> comes after the word &ldquo;efficient&rdquo;.  That is the point at which Esau left off and Jacob took over. The clause, as originally and reasonably drafted, read &ldquo;which, in the opinion of the corporation, is profitable and efficient or capable of becoming profitable and efficient&rdquo;.  Then somebody in the Department said that will not do, it is far too hardheaded, capitalistic sounding and so on.  They said they would have to put in another two lines of waffle which will read &ldquo;and has prospects of profitability&rdquo;. Those words were put in in such a hurry that the tautology implicit in repeating the same criteria in the next line did not occur to anybody.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then we have &ldquo;development, expansion and growth&rdquo;.  For the extra 10 per <Col N="1987" /> cent we used to get for doing amhránaíocht in the honours leaving certificate, would somebody tell me the difference between &ldquo;expansion, development and growth&rdquo;?  Is one not the same as the other?  This is only padding intended to divert attention from the real point, the sneaky sub-criterion of &ldquo;the provision of viable employment&rdquo;.  That is in section 13, and why drag it into the clauses in this section?  I do not want to weary the House or the Minister with this, but I would ask him to look at this as a piece of legislation in respect of which he has to share responsibility with 167 other Deputies, and he should ask himself, if only for the appearance of the thing, how the section could be cleaned up, and if not, why not?</P>
    <P>My next point bears on his intelligent comments on my query about whether enterprises situated abroad would have a claim on NDC interest.  He said that if I was suggesting that the NDC should get into foreign enterprises which would also be foreign manned very largely, he could not see the virtue of putting public money into such enterprises.  Neither do I.  The Minister instanced a chain of American hotels.  I am not suggesting any such thing.  The American hotels which Aer Lingus rightly or wrongly went into are staffed by Americans with, possibly, a small module of Irish management or linkage between the American management and Aer Lingus, but basically no employment worth talking about is provided for Irish people through this dimension of Aer Lingus operations.  Though direct employment for Irish people is not provided, I have no doubt that those hotels serve a certain purpose in promoting Aer Lingus services.  In other ways, I am sure, they provided other advantages to the Irish economy.</P>
    <P>What I am suggesting is that, without striking anything out of section 13, which refers to providing employment in the State, a small subsection might be included providing that the section did not prevent the NDC from getting involved in enterprises a large dimension of which would be the provision of services <Col N="1988" /> abroad in which Irish people would be employed.  Surely a job for an Irish person outside Ireland, particularly if he is earning money for the Irish economy, is as good as one here.</P>
    <P>Is this more of the fetish about emigration that is damning us all?  Is this more of our superstition and taboo about it?  I remember when the late Seán Lemass was being praised here, and rightly so, for talking about merchant adventurers.  He wanted Ireland to do something which it had never done before, namely, to spawn and throw up a race of merchant adventurers.  How can you be a merchant adventurer if you stay down at the end of your own boreen? You have got to get out, as the English did, as the Dutch and the Portugese did, as all large trading peoples have done who were confined in a small geographical area not very highly advantaged, people who were driven out of their countries, so to speak, in order to make their living and in order to spread the influence and credit of their countries elsewhere.</P>
    <P>How did the British exploit India for a couple of hundred years?  It was through the East India Company.  Naturally, I am not suggesting anything like exploitation: I am merely saying those people did not do it by staying at home.  They got out and worked in other countries because there was not work for them to do at home.  This is such a fetish here that it is a political mortal sin to suggest it.  I think the sin is the other way around because it is wicked for politicians to keep this fetish alive.  I do not believe the Minister is guilty of it.  For all I know, he may secretly share my opinions about this matter.  It would not worry me one way or the other, but if what is behind his objection of the idea that the NDC ought to be put in a position that would give them some discretion about supporting Irish firms employing Irish staffs abroad, he would be doing a good and imaginative days work if he reconsidered it.</P>
    <P>I accept that the drafting of section 13 as it stands confines the employment which it is the duty of the corporation to promote to employment within the State. I cannot see the sense of that.  If we were <Col N="1989" /> able to put together a health care package which would involve the employment of Irish doctors, nurses, anaesthetists and so on, and sell it somewhere in the world, <i>in toto,</i> that would be something the NDC could very well get into.  I cannot see why they should be excluded, as they obviously are if we accept section 13 as it stands.  It is no use the Minister saying that as long as they remain within the Irish income tax net this could be considered. I do not see the relevance of that suggestion.  You cannot run a concern on the basis of going out for the odd weekend or for a few weeks or months. People have to expect to be out of the country for solid periods and regard the other place, even if only for a few years, as their home.  I do not want to waste the time of the House on this, but I urge the Minister not to tie himself down in this regard, to put in a little subsection on Report Stage which would give at least a degree of discretion so that Irish manned enterprises can be assisted outside the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>Section 13 is phrased in a very general way.  It provides that it shall be the general duty of the corporation to assist in the creation of the maximum number of viable jobs and the maximum amount of viable employment in the State.  That does not specifically exclude health packages.  Indeed, the Deputy may be surprised to know that the NEA have established a body to do precisely what Deputy Kelly is advocating, namely, to sell health packages in the Middle East.  I do not see that being struck down by this legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>However, if we were setting up companies which would be expected to function permanently overseas and employ Irish people who would remain overseas permanently, that would be outside the remit of the NDC.  People who would be overseas for a short period and in respect of whose work the profits would be repatriated with themselves, would be within the NDC remit.  I suppose it could loosely be described as the service export business.  I have no fetish about that. Indeed, I agree with Deputy Kelly that <Col N="1990" /> some of the best entrepreneurs in Ireland are those who spent three or four years overseas and who came back with some of the cobwebs sucked out of their heads and the inhibitions and inverted snobbery about what one should and should not do knocked out of them by working overseas. That is not emigration.  It is useful, relevant work experience to prepare people to achieve the fullest potential they have, and achieving it within this State.  It might be better if they did not have to go, but I would not exclude it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>That will be a matter for the board.  It would be my intention <Col N="1991" /> to advise them that they should try to obtain the best person possible for the job, that in that regard they should seek someone from wherever possible and not necessarily from within the State.  It will be of vital importance that the staff be well selected.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The articles of association will provide that the number of directors will be nine but the Minister will be aware that there is a danger in providing for such a large number of directors.  That is the danger of the board becoming a representative body with one organisation seeking to have two representatives on the board, another seeking the appointment of their person and the Minister nominating his two people so that we could end up with a kind of parliamentary assembly.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>In that case the involvement of people on the board would tend to be the protection of the interests they represented as opposed to furthering the corporation.  This is a problem encountered in all State companies but perhaps on this occasion we could endeavour to ensure that the board are comprised of a group of people fully committed to profitable investment in employment and leaving aside the interests they represented.  I appreciate that this can be very difficult to achieve in a small country but we must at least make the effort.  The people appointed should not be representative.  They should be included because of a proven track record and ability.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The section seeks to provide also that the period of directorship shall not exceed five years.  On a few occasions the Minister has made the point that the corporation should be at the forefront in respect of technology but the frontiers of technology today change every couple of months.  We will not talk about Mostek, for example, or organisations like that but in reply to a parlimentary question on this subject the Minister told me that <Col N="1992" /> because technology was changing so quickly one had to be considering continually those changes.  In that context I am wondering whether a five year term of office for the board makes sense.  Might a three year period not be more appropriate? Five years may be too long in the context of ever-changing technology.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (d) of subsection (2) provides that the remuneration of the chairman and directors shall be determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service.  There is no need to remind the Minister that we have a very good band of people serving as directors of our State companies.  That has been the case for many years but some more rational way of remunerating them must be found.  I know the Minister is concerned about this question but I am urging him to give it consideration in terms of this Bill.  If the remuneration is to be determined by the Minister with the consent of the Minister for the Public Service we will not be likely to find the kind of determination and dedication that will be required from the directors of the NDC.  We must move away from the couple of hundred of pounds a year regime and move into a whole new concept of compensating and attracting the best possible directors of State companies.</P>
    <P>Paragraph (e) of the same subsection is one on which I have a strong point to make.  It is not my intention to be political because that would not be the spirit in which this Committee Stage is being debated but the provision in this case is a recipe for all kinds of trouble in the future.  Goodness knows who the Minister will be when there is a row about this provision which is that the directors shall, with the consent of the Minister, appoint a managing director.  We should change that paragraph because to give the Minister the veto in respect of a particular appointment in a semi-State company is to repeat the kind of difficulty we have had for too many years.  This Bill affords us an opportunity to move away from that practice.  Why should we not take our courage in our hands and provide that the directors shall appoint a managing <Col N="1993" /> director?  Can we not do that this once? We should allow the board of this semi-State company to appoint their managing director, to set the terms of reference and income and to hire or fire that managing director as they see fit.  This is a crucial point.</P>
    <P>I wish to refer briefly to subsection (4) of section 27 which impinges on section 11 and which provides that the Devlin recommendations will apply to the role of the chief executive of the NDC.  This is a straitjacket that we should avoid from now on.  Again, why not on this occasion provide for the directors to appoint the chief executive on the basis of a two or three year term of office thereby ensuring that the directors would have to review the appointment on a regular basis?  If the Minister has difficulties he can remove the directors but why should he interfere with the appointment of the chief executive?  There is no need to tie in the appointment with the Devlin pay guidelines because if the chief executive is to make the right decisions, if he is to make that extra effort needed to effect a contract, if he is to make that trip to China or elsewhere, or if he is to work that Sunday to achieve the desired result, it will be important that he is in a position to deal with the board on his own terms and that they can agree his terms of remuneration.</P>
    <P>There is no sense in providing for the Minister having the final say in relation to the chief executive and allowing the State apparatus to have the final say in his salary.  Let us put our faith in the board and trust them to appoint a chief executive and to decide whether to pay him the salary they consider he is worth, whether that be £5,000 or £50,000?  Why once again in the case of this new organisation should we tie ourselves to something that has been shown clearly in the past not to have worked very well?  This is a real opportunity to make a break with the past and that is why we should delete the provision that the directors shall, with the consent of the Minister, appoint a managing director.</P>

      <P>I support Deputy Brennan in his argument that the terms of remuneration should not be referred to the DPS because that would be very restrictive for the chief executive of a company such as the NDC who will be expected to break exceptionally difficult new ground for the State sector.  That would apply to some of his senior executives as well as to the chief executive.</P>
      <P>In relation to subsection (f) which says the Minister for Finance will approve the appointment of the auditor, since the Minister for Finance will be a shareholder in what has a certain parallel to a venture fund, would it not be more appropriate to have auditors separate from the NDC? I understand that in the case of funds established in the private sector there is an auditor for the company who presents the company's accounts and there is also an auditor for the owner of the fund whose prime interest is the protection of the funds tied up.  As an item of control for the taxpayer as shareholder in this company, would it not be more sensible to have a separate auditing function done in that way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="NedOKeeffe" hpid="Mr. E. O'Keeffe Mr. E. O'Keeffe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>I was not finished when Deputy Bruton got in.  I agree with Deputy Brennan that the board should have the right to fix the remuneration and salary of the managing director.  One must pay for ability.  All people are not equal in that some have more talent than others.  This is one of the problems that has bedevilled the semi-State sector &mdash; ability is not being paid for.  That must be taken into account.  The restriction that the Minister for the Public Service has the right to veto the salary is not good enough.  We should move away from that.  The Minister would be wise to delete that section from the Bill.</P>
      <P>In relation to directors, remunerations and semi-State bodies, a semi-State body director receives a taxable income which at the end of the day is only a pittance. We are told about the lack of commitment of directors of semi-State bodies. In the future we must look to a different type of director and we must get people with a proper approach to the business.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1995" /> The whole area of directors' remuneration should be reconsidered and we should do that in setting up this new corporation.  The Minister is aware of the problem and he knows that managing directors should not be tied to the public service.</P>
    <P>Another problem is that in recent times civil servants have been appointed to semi-State boards and we have also appointed managing directors as company directors.  Those are areas about which I have reservations.  The managing director should not be a director of the company because, when it comes to a crucial decision, his independence as a director of the company is impaired by his job as managing director.  The managing director should be the managing director, assisting the board.  Recently there has been the appointment of civil servants to the boards of semi-State bodies.  That is a very serious impediment to the working of a semi-State body because civil servants by nature are conservative and they have a narrow outlook.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">

      <P>Civil servants work mainly in the interests of the Minister and if something ambitious or risky is involved they will consult the Minister and this might take from the efforts being made.  We are all talking about ambitious projects.  If there was a conservative civil servant on the board, that might retard progress.  It seems to be the policy of this Government to appoint civil servants to all semi-State bodies.  This will be a very serious impediment which will retard the success of the NDC.</P>

      <P>Would Deputy Mac Giolla mind if I got in?  I have to go over so much ground that I will have forgotten it and the Members involved may even have left the House before I reply.  In reply to Deputy Brennan, I do not intend <Col N="1996" /> the board to be representative.  They will be selected solely on the basis of competence, but they will be committed to making the thing work.  I do not agree with Deputy Brennan that three years would be reasonable.  I know technology is changing but, on the other hand, the assessment of the type of project which will be coming before the NDC is something on which directors will build up expertise through time.  If they were to be thrown out after three years and new people brought in, unless they were people who came directly from another activity where they were doing almost the same work, they would spend the first year learning the ropes.  To get rid of directors who have been properly operative for two years only, taking into account that they would have spent the first year learning the ropes, would not be the wisest course of action.  The five year period is better.</P>
      <P>I take the point made by a number of Deputies about terms and conditions for managing directors.  I draw the attention of Deputies to what I said in my reply to the Second Stage of this Bill:</P>
      <P>Deputies may rest assured that the Government intend to recruit a person fully qualified and competent for the job.  The fact remains that the actual salary rate, terms and conditions of this appointment are matters for determination between myself and the Minister for the Public Service.  The NDC, however, did not exist when the review body examined the remuneration of the chief executives, and clearly the appropriate level of remuneration for the NDC post will have to be considered in the light of the particular requirements of the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That takes the NDC out of the Devlin straitjacket and says that the post will have to be considered in the light of the requirements of the position on the basis that it was a job that did not exist when Devlin was setting down his standards. Of course account will be taken of the Devlin requirements but it will not be subject to any rigid requirement following Devlin.  That is the position.  The <Col N="1997" /> determination of terms and conditions of employment in the NDC is really something for the directors in the first instance. The directors of the NDC should look at the possibility of devising a remuneration package which contains an element of relationship to the success of the investment made by the corporation, or alternatively the success of investments for which certain project officers were responsible.</P>
    <P>This will be extremely difficult to devise.  The full fruits of an investment might not be seen until the person in question had left the NDC and there would be difficulty in devising a scheme to take account of that situation.  I invite the directors of the corporation to be as innovative as they can in making suggestions. Perhaps some of their suggestions will not be accepted and perhaps, if the directors act on the suggestion I am now making, when they get down to looking at the detailed operation of the scheme they may well decide not to consent to it. I should like the directors of the corporation to be creative in the way that they devise their packages for approval &mdash; as I think Deputies on all sides would agree &mdash; so that we can get the best possible staff.  Clearly one way of attracting people and motivating them in their work would be through some means of relating salary to the performance of the investments made for which the staff are responsible.</P>
    <P>Deputies S. Brennan, E. O'Keeffe and, I think, Deputy R. Bruton, were concerned about my consent being necessary for the appointment of the managing director.  After all, he is a managing director and director, as such.  The Government and I are responsible for the corporation and, hence, should have responsibility for the directors, including the managing director.  Therefore, it is reasonable that there should be such control. On the other hand if it was the chief executive of the board of directors we were appointing, that would be a different matter.  But, once he is a director, the shareholders must have a say over who <Col N="1998" /> the directors are, all directors, not just eight out of the nine.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I can see a lot of sense in what Deputy O'Keeffe was suggesting.  Obviously one is balancing a number of different factors here in trying to reach a decision on a matter of this kind.  There are strong arguments against having the chief operating officer of a company also a director of it.  I think clearly Deputy O'Keeffe would agree with that and, in many contexts, I would agree with him.  However, in this situation &mdash; to ensure maximum cohesion between the executive, the directors and the board &mdash; the case would be broadly in favour of the provision that we have. That is not to say that I do not acknowledge that there are arguments against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>To revert to the question about whether there should be a civil servant on the board, I have not made up my mind at all whether there should be a civil servant on the board of the National Development Corporation.  Certainly I would not think there would be any sense in having one, at the most, and I am not <Col N="1999" /> sure that there should be any.  However, I would say &mdash; whether this would apply to the National Development Corporation is doubtful because the corporation did not exist at the time this recommendation was made &mdash; the National Planning Board considered this matter and said that it was a good idea to have a civil servant on the board.</P>
    <P>My opinion about this is &mdash; and this is based on three and a half to four years experience when I was responsible for boards as well as finance &mdash; that Civil Service directors are useful in many cases.  First of all, they are full time and can devote much more time to the task than a part time director.  By their presence on the board they overcome misunderstandings which might arise between the parent Department and the corporation. Such misunderstandings can be sorted out informally without the board ever getting into a sort of confrontation position with the Department on some point of principle which really, when one gets down to it, is not a point of principle at all.  A director sitting in there, who is also a civil servant, who knows what is really worrying the Department about a particular course of action can tip off the other directors and say, &ldquo;Look, we know what you want, if you do it that way, probably you will run into difficulty.  If, on the other hand, you approach it this way you will have no difficulty&rdquo;.  All that sort of thing can be sorted out within the board without getting into the sort of difficulty that sometimes can arise when the chairman sends letters to the Minister requesting a meeting with him and the Minister cannot see him because he is tied up in the House, has to go to Brussels or is doing this, that or the other and there arises a sort of <i>impasse</i> about some matter which could go on for weeks because people get themselves into positions without really understanding what the other person is concerned about.  My general experience is that, having a civil servant on a board, can get around that type of difficulty.</P>
    <P>I am not so sure that those arguments apply quite so much in the case of <Col N="2000" /> the National Development Corporation as they would in the case of other boards because the NDC are being given a very discreet task of getting out into the investment area and they will not have to come very much into conflict or even contact with the Department to that degree so long as their overall operational results are all right.  Therefore, the argument I have advanced for Civil Service directors may not apply with as great force as it would shall we say, to a company like Irish Steel Limited who clearly were dependent on equity from the State or, shall we say, a board or body who are spending public money like the IDA. There is a stronger case in that type of situation than in the case of the NDC where the Minister's role is more limited because the statute says it all and it is a matter for the directors to get on with it.</P>
    <P>Perhaps if Deputy O'Keeffe had had the experience I have had the privilege of having over the last three and a half years of dealing with Civil Service directors on boards he might not be as hostile to the idea.  People who express themselves sceptically about this &mdash; and I can assure Deputy O'Keeffe that they are not all on his side of the House &mdash; usually are people who have not had the experience of being responsible Ministers for State companies.  Probably the strength of their views is in inverse relationship to the experience they have had of actually dealing with practical problems of State companies.  I found that to be quite a useful arrangement.  However, I am not going to do it in the case of the NDC. I would tend to move in the opposite direction in general because the NDC is different from the average State company.</P>
    <P>Deputy Bruton suggested the idea of a separate auditor, if you like, representing the shareholder as distinct from representing the board.  I am not sure how necessary that is.  First of all, the corporation will be involved in setting up companies and each of these companies will have their own auditor who probably will not be the corporation's auditor.  Therefore one will have the corporation's auditor and the individual company auditor <Col N="2001" /> looking essentially at the same material. To come along then and have a share-holders' auditor, as distinct from the corporation's auditor, which in many cases might be a third auditor&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>He would not really audit individual accounts to the same degree.  I am not adverse to the idea of having somebody standing back from the corporation.  But I would point out to Deputy Bruton and others that I have, at an advanced stage of preparation, a Companies Bill with 150 or more sections, a large part of which will be concerned with new responsibilities for auditors in general &mdash; and this would apply to auditors of State companies &mdash; where they will become, to a greater degree, protectors of the public good as distinct from servants of their employers, namely, the company.  That sort of distancing of the auditor from the company &mdash; which will apply to private companies as well as to the NDC and their subsidiaries &mdash; probably will go a good way to addressing Deputy Bruton's concerns in that regard.</P>

      <NameTxt>Tomás Mac Giolla</NameTxt>
      <P>May I appeal to the Minister to endeavour to be somewhat briefer because time is rapidly running out?  I want to make a couple of comments on this.  The Minister spoke at some length but he did not give us any real idea of what would be his concept of the directors.  I quite agree that there is no point in having directors with particular interests.  But, in the context of development, surely the Minister will be considering and probably will have his own concepts about the direction in which he thinks the corporation should go and which will be reflected in the directors he appoints.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should have different areas of development in mind in the employment of directors.  If you appoint somebody from the heavy engineering and construction area he will not be the slightest bit interested in fish processing <Col N="2002" /> or something of that nature.  The areas that the Minister sees as requiring development and having the greatest scope for it would be surely those in which he would like to appoint directors with those interests, be it food processing, forestry or whatever and, most essentially, the marketing area.  I thought the Minister would outline some of his ideas on the appointment of directors.  He did not do so and I hope he will.  I have no objection to one civil servant; that might be a good thing; but I am particularly interested in ensuring that the fish and food processing area and the marketing area are included and that we have directors who know their business in there.</P>
    <P>I want to confirm something in my mind.  The Minister can appoint eight directors, the chairman and seven, and they appoint a managing director.  I presume the maximum the Minister can appoint is eight, but he can appoint fewer.  Presumably he can appoint three or four directors, a chairman and three, or a chairman and four or five, and let them go ahead and appoint their managing director.  If the Minister feels at a later stage that there is another area into which he needs to put somebody he would still have one or two to appoint.  I would like the Minister to confirm that that is the way he is thinking, that rather than putting in all his eight appointments in the beginning he would appoint, say, five and the chairman and let them appoint their managing director, and leave a couple over whom he can appoint later.</P>
    <P>The Bill allows the Minister to appoint directors for a period of three years.  It provides for not more than five years, so he does not have to appoint them for a period of five years.  I am opposed to appointment for just a period of three years.  That would not give them scope or opportunity to do the job they are put in to do.  Let us be realistic and accept, as in every other board, that these will be political appointments and when a new Government come in they will be ready to shift them to put in their people.  If the Minister makes it three years they will be <Col N="2003" /> shifted with every change of Government, but if he makes it five years there is a very good chance that they will outlast the next change of Government and will have a decent period of office.</P>

      <P>I cannot let the Minister go on to two points.  One is the question of Devlin.  I accept the Minister's good wishes, but good wishes are different from legislation and here we are passing legislation.  His good wish that the chief executive might be rewarded in some reasonably commercial way with a percentage of good investments or whatever is the right kind of thinking, but section 27 (4) of the Bill provides that:</P>
      <P>In determining the remuneration or allowances for expenses to be paid to its officers or servants&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;who would include the managing director&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;or the terms or conditions subject to which such officers or servants hold or are to hold their employment, the Corporation shall have regard either to Government or nationally agreed guidelines which are for the time being extant, or to Government policy concerning remuneration and conditions of employment....</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In other words, there is a requirement in the legislation for the corporation to have regard to nationally agreed guidelines.  If you write that into legislation and the corporation say they are going to pay this person £X,000 because he is doing a superb job, somebody can point out that that is a long way from nationally agreed guidelines and it could prevent or frustrate the wish of both the Minister and <Col N="2004" /> the corporation.  I do not accept that this is tied to Devlin.  I take the Minister's point that this is being set up, as it were, after Devlin, and therefore it escapes to to that extent.  If the Minister really wishes to escape Devlin in regard to the NDC we sould make it clear and say it in the Bill.  The opposite impression is given in that section in the reference to nationally agreed guidelines.  That would pin down the corporation and would prevent the chief executive being paid anything above nationally agreed guidelines.</P>
    <P>Secondly, I listened very carefully to the Minister's reasoning, and I do not accept it, in regard to the question of appointing the managing director.  He said something to the effect that because he is a managing director rather than a chief executive, therefore he is a director, therefore the Minister must appoint him, because he is a director as opposed to being a chief executive who might not be a director.  If that is the only reason, there is a simple way around it.  The board appoint a chief executive and the Minister appoints him a director.  The Minister appoints the nominee of the board a director of the company.  That gets over the problem.  Now the board appoints their own man and the Minister simply rubberstamps it.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;where representatives are put up and the Minister appoints the person.  If the board appoint a chief executive I have no doubt that any Minister would be prepared to appoint that chief executive to the board. That gets over the difficulty.  I suspect that is not the real reason why the Government are not prepared to let go the question of the consent of the Minister. It is crucial that in this semi-State company the chief executive, managing <Col N="2005" /> director, or whatever you call him, is appointed by the board without any say so from the Minister of the day.  The Minister should have no say in the appointment of the chief executive.  We should take our courage in our hands on that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>It is obvious in all of this Bill, but particularly this section, that the managing director will be the real driving force behind the corporation in that he is the one person who appears to have a permanent post.  I would not go along with the suggestion of a three year period for the directors.  Deputy Brennan proposed that the Minister should allow the board to appoint the chief executive, who will be the person who will be operating as managing director or whatever.  He will be there as chief executive and much will be required of him.  In a true sense he will be operating on a continuous basis.  Why not remove the tradition of the Minister's consent?  The person we will be requiring as the chief executive or managing director of the NDC will have to be the best available, and it would be totally wrong for this Bill or the Minister to put constraints on the board employing the most available, most suitable chief executive.  Are conditions to be tied into this section as the Minister is suggesting regarding the rate of remuneration and so on?  Section 11 (2) (e) provides:</P>
      <P>The directors, shall with the consent of the Minister, appoint a managing director on such terms and conditions as shall be approved of by the Minister after consultation with the Minister for the Public Service.</P>
      <P>There is a grave danger, as has been indicated by Deputy Brennan, that tying in restrictions on the remuneration conditions of the chief executive might not give us the best available person to operate as chief executive or managing director. The Minister should consider removing that anomaly.</P>

Will the Minister consider in regard to the nine appointees appointing at least two from the small business sector?  What will happen to the personnel, the chief executive and so on of the NEA if that body are to be subsumed by the NDC? Will we get involved in costly hand-shakes, compensation and redundancy payments or will there be a smooth transition? I have in mind the chief executive of the NEA.  I want to know if we can agree not to get involved in costly compensation. There should be an expeditious and amicable transfer from that agency to the corporation.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Mac Giolla made some interesting suggestions about the way we might go about appointing the board.  It would be my intention that it should be a multi-disciplinary board in so far as possible though there will be sectors that will be left out no matter what.  We will have to rely on their good judgment and commercial sense, that they will be able to understand opportunities in sectors outside their own.  I agree with Deputy Yates that it is desirable as far as possible to represent different sizes of businesses, including the small business sector.  I hope the NDC will invest substantially in the small business sector. Under section 31 I have power to give them directions to do so.  If I discovered that the NDC were being unduly biased in favour of large businesses I would not hesitate to use my power in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Mac Giolla asked if the appointments would be political.  They will be political in the sense that the Government of the day are political but it is not my intention to draw people from any particular affiliation or no political affiliation.  I hope to have a reasonable cross-section of competent citizens appointed to this body, people who will be committed to making it work.  If Deputies opposite want to suggest names I can assure them that they will be considered. I do not want to have the board appearing to be one-sided in a political sense.  That would be most undesirable.  It has not <Col N="2007" /> been my approach in the appointments I have made.</P>

      <P>Deputy Brennan mentioned restrictions and referred, correctly, to section 27 (4).  I must point out to him that that provision is designed to prevent increases in pay above the national norm although it could be used to set the salary.  However, it is really designed to prevent the MD of the NDC, or some staff in the NDC, getting a 40 per cent increase in pay when the Government pay norm is a 3 per cent increase.  That would be undersirable because it would burst a Government's wages policy.</P>

      <P>I am aware of that but that is the intention.  As far as the setting of salaries is concerned I must point out, as I mentioned earlier, that it will not strictly come within the Devlin rules and it will be looked at by the Government in determining the pay level of the managing director in the light of the requirements of the job.  In a response to earlier interventions I invited the corporation directors to be as innovative as they can in suggesting remuneration packages so that we can get the best people in the most innovative way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first task of the board will be to look for a managing director and in so doing I expect them to come up with recommendations about remuneration. It may be that they will want to have a remuneration package approved by the Government before they start talking turkey to candidates.  I hope there will be a constructive discussion between myself, the directors and the chairman on how <Col N="2008" /> best to go about this.  It will be my intention to get the best person and pay him or her the necessary amount.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. E. O'Keeffe</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did the Minister go for the title, managing director, rather than chief executive?  I take it that the board will appoint the person and it will be up to the Minister to decide if he or she is considered suitable.  The Minister said that a civil servant appointed would be useful and would be full time but it may be that such an appointee may try to avoid confrontation with the Department. It is my view that civil servants are conservative and inward looking.  Such an appointee would be the ear of the Minister and would carry the message back and forward.</P>
      <P>I was rather surprised that the Minister was not available to meet the chairman or managing director of a semi-State company recently because there should be continuous liaison between such people.  The Minister will be aware that the political heads of those companies are very influential.  In the case of Irish Shipping, I understand that there was not communication between the chairman of the board, the managing director and the Minister.  It is possible that the debacle that occurred there could have been avoided if there had been communication. I am surprised that the Minister does not call for more communication between the managing director, the chairman and himself.</P>

I did not say that it was my intention to recommend a civil servant for appointment.  Sometimes civil servants are conservative but on other occasions they are not.  Very often they can be extremely innovative.</P>

      <P>On the Deputy's first point concerning standards, the standard will be the return on investment being in excess of the rate of interest being paid by the Government on money borrowed to give to the corporation.  If they did not have such return we would not be living within the terms of the statute.  There is another very strong performance related criterion in this legislation, which is in the section dealing with the administrative <Col N="2010" /> expenses of the corporation.  It is stated there that the administrative expenses will be payable by the Minister only for the first five years and at the end of that period the corporation will have to find their own expenses from within their own resources, that is, from returns of profit, disposal of shares and of their own investment.

      <P>In page 9, paragraph (b), line 4, to delete the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; and substitute &ldquo;may&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies Brennan and Lyons felt as I did in putting down this amendment that it should not be compulsory on the NDC in <Col N="2011" /> all cases to realise an investment within a specified period or as soon as financially prudent.  On re-reading the section, my amendment does not work in that way. This &ldquo;shall&rdquo; is not the kind of &ldquo;shall&rdquo; that I thought it was.  I meant the mandatory &ldquo;shall&rdquo; which I was changing to &ldquo;may&rdquo;. I meant that they must not be compelled in all circumstances to do so.</P>
    <P>This section makes it compulsory on the NDC to realise their investments even if they are very profitable and very useful in getting some other project off the ground.  Under this section they would be compelled to sell off that investment and move to something perhaps completely new.  This is an unfair restriction and might be dangerous for them. For that reason I put down this amendment. I am not quite sure if this has the desired effect, but the intention is that it will not become compulsory on the NDC.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisLyons" hpid="Mr. Lyons Mr. Lyons">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lyons</NameTxt>
      <P>When we touched briefly on this section earlier, I indicated that the Bill was full of restrictions, with references to realisation of investments and liquidating assets and other such terms. This entire section is totally unnecessary. It does not add anything to the objectives of the NDC.  Having listened to the debate for two hours, I find that this section reduces the sharpness of the Bill. The substitution of the word &ldquo;may&rdquo; for the word &ldquo;shall&rdquo; might give some element of judgment to the corporation.</P>
      <P>Section 13 also mentions the general duty of the corporation.  That is a very vague phrase.  In section (b) one may be talking about the selling off of a successful venture and keeping the lame ducks.  Is that hidden in this section?  Would the Minister comment on that?  Unless it is included for purely legal reasons, I am of the opinion that this section is unnecessary. The phrase &ldquo;as soon as it is financially and commercially prudent&rdquo; bothers me.  This may have been one of the problems in the gestation period of this Bill and I wonder did the two parties in Government solve the problem by way of this section?  I am not so sure.  I shall leave it to the Minister.</P>

      <P>On this amendment I wish to say that when recently the chief executive of the National Enterprise Agency came before the Public Expenditure Committee he was asked about criteria performance for investments undertaken by the NEA.  He was quite explicit in saying that there was only one test of performance which was whether when you sell the investment you reap a reward.  I would be opposed to Deputy Mac Giolla's amendment in trying to make it discretionary because I fear that, if there were not a degree of obligation on the corporation to sell, this crucial test of performance would be lost.  Contrary to what Deputy Lyons says, this section is designed to prevent lame ducks being continually supported.  If discretion is admitted in the matter of whether or not one gets rid of lame ducks, my fear would be that the lame ducks would be retained. However, this section guarantees that lame ducks will not be a continuing burden and drain.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the total opposite. It is the general duty of the NDC to realise their investments as soon as it is financially and commercially prudent. That is the mandatory legislative instruction to the NDC.  They must get rid of enterprises that are doing well.  I know what the Minister is trying to do but I think he has gone about it in the wrong way.  He wants to divest the State of holding companies because he wants to keep State involvement to a minimum. Then all of the companies should be disposed of, although in the case of some it might not be commercially prudent to do so.  The section makes it mandatory to dispose of a company when it is commercially and financially prudent in such a way as to make a reasonable return on the investment.  One might also sell a company to cut one's losses.  Money might be lost by selling the company and it might not be possible to get the return required under the section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It appears that the section would prevent the NDC disposing of a company showing a loss, although it would be the sensible thing to do.  Perhaps the section <Col N="2013" /> should omit the provision about return on an investment.  There may be an opportunity to dispose of a lame duck company in the portfolio but under this section it could not be disposed of.  I maintain that it should be possible to get rid of it as part of a loss-cutting exercise. There is no doubt what the section is about.  If it is mandatory to get rid of the good ones, then it is logical that the NDC will keep the bad ones.  That is the corollary. I should like to see a clause included that they would endeavour to get rid of all of them, including enterprises doing badly.  There is no reason why those doing badly cannot be rationalsied and sold off in the same way as the good ones are sold off.  Why keep the bad ones?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBruton" hpid="Mr. J. Bruton Mr. J. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that the corporation will carry out their objects in such a manner as to earn a reasonable return on any investment.  If an investment is going deplorably badly a reasonable return on that investment at that time may well be to sell it for a quarter of what was put into it because by retaining it, it might ultimately make only one-sixth of the original investment.  The corporation have the general objective to realise their investments as soon as financially and commercially prudent and they should do that in such a way as to earn a reasonable return.  That does not pre-clude the corporation from getting rid of loss-making companies.  I expect that they would endeavour to get rid of loss-making companies more quickly than the ones that are doing well because, in the latter case, there is the prospect that by hanging on they may make a little more. In the case of companies doing badly, the sooner they get rid of them the better.</P>

      <P>I will conclude by listing the reasons why I think the Bill should be opposed.  The first reason is that it provides for a dual system of recognition <Col N="2018" /> in relation to foreign divorces that differentiates between Irish citizens and non-nationals residing in this country in that it would provide for a more liberal system of recognition for non-nationals regardless of the length of time they have lived in the Republic.  In the context of Irish citizens it would curtail the circumstances in which we currently recognise foreign decrees of divorce and, as a result, it could contribute to the creation of more limping marriages than we have at the moment, that is, marriages regarded as dissolved in a foreign country but regarded here as still subsisting.  That dual system of recognition, treating families living in Ireland differently from other families living here could be, and probably is, unconstitutional.  If this Bill became law it would add a great deal of additional uncertainty and confusion to the law as it stands.</P>
      <P>The real intent of this Bill is not to abolish a wife's domicile of dependency but to put up a political smokescreen, to avoid confronting the need for a divorce referendum and domestic divorce legislation. It is another Irish solution to an Irish problem and the Bill should be opposed. There is a remarkable contrast between the confused and obscurantist provisions in this Bill and the clear, concise and welcome reforms in the Government's Bill which was published today.  That Bill would remove much of the uncertainty from this law and would avoid the discrimination and peculiarities built into the Fianna Fáil measure.</P>

      <P>Is áthas liom go bhfuil deis againn an Bille seo a phlé sa Dáil, Bille a chreidimse a bhfuil tábhacht faoi leith ag baint leis chomh fada agus a bhaineann sé go háirithe le go leor de mhná tí na tíre.  Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leis na Teachtaí ar an dá thaobh den Tí a labhair faoin mBille.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Confusion has marked the Government response to this Bill, and that is putting it mildly.  Last night the Fianna Fáil Bill was debated in this House and the Minister came in to reply.  On the <Col N="2019" /> first page of his speech he said that &ldquo;the Government have proposals of their own which are being drafted at the moment and will be circulated&rdquo;.  What was printed in after that was deleted conveniently and the word &ldquo;tomorrow&rdquo; was handwritten in the script.  That shows the haste with which the Government acted as a result of our Bill.</P>
    <P>It is four years since the Government promised to abolish the dependent domicile of married women.  It is four years since the Law Reform Commission produced their Working Paper No. 10.  It is nine months since the commission made their final report.  It is one week after we produced our Bill and, strangely enough, it is one day after we introduced our Bill. The Government have now produced a Bill of their own.  It is right to say that every effect has a cause.  I wonder which of these causes has stimulated the Government into action.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission were established by the Law Reform Commission Act, 1975, as a statutory body to keep the law of the State under review at all times and, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, to undertake examinations and to conduct inquiries of the law with a view to reforming it and to formulate proposals in relation to law reform.  The Attorney General made a request to the Law Reform Commission asking them to examine the law as it related to the domicile of married women.  The commission set about their work and they decided not just to confine themselves to that area but to examine the law on domicile in total.  They produced Working Paper No. 10 in 1981 and this was followed by their full report in 1983.</P>
    <P>I think it is appropriate at this time to send, as did my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, last night, my wishes to the Minister of State with responsibility for women's affairs.  To give her her due, she has worked extremely hard since she became Minister of State to bring this legislation before the House.  We talk about Dáil reform but one of the areas most in need of reform and definition is <Col N="2020" /> the area for which she has responsibility. It is quite clear she has not been given the kind of political power or clout necessary for her to be regarded as the boss or to be taken seriously by the Department of Justice or by the Department of the Taoiseach.</P>
    <P>The domicile of a person is the country where she or he intends to live permanently or indefinitely.  We know there are three different types of domicile.  There is the domicile of origin which is the domicile a person acquires at birth.  The domicile of choice is acquired by a person by living in a country with the intention of continuing to do so permanently or indefinitely. Where a person abandons his or her domicile of choice in a country but does not acquire a new domicile anywhere else, I understand the domicile of origin will be revived and that continues to govern his or her legal position until the person acquires a new domicile of choice or a domicile of dependency.  That brings us to the third type of domicile, namely, the domicile of dependency. This arises in respect of married women, children under 21 years and mentally disturbed persons.  Therefore, the domicile of children will depend on the domicile of the father except in special circumstances which there is no need to go into now. The domicile of a married woman, on the other hand, whether over or under the age of majority, is the same as that of her husband, and any time he chooses to change his domicile, her domicile changes as well.  Strangely, if the husband is under the age of majority, his wife's domicile depends in our law on the domicile of the person on whom her husband is legally dependent, which I suppose would mean her father-in-law.</P>
    <P>Domicile of dependency is that most women have to be concerned about because it is the one which creates most problems.  As Deputies have said here, a woman's domicile on marriage becomes that of her husband and remains so until the marriage is terminated by the death of either spouse or by a dissolution that is recognised here.  Therefore, if a woman born and at all times living in Ireland <Col N="2021" /> marries someone who lives in another country, her domicile immediately becomes that of the other country although she may never have been to the other country, and if her husband wants to move anywhere in the world her domicile would change to the spot that he would have chosen to remain in.</P>
    <P>The policy of subjecting the domicile of a wife to that of her husband makes social and cultural assumptions that are at variance with today's standards.  The concept of unity of domicile is an artificial one which in some cases might not bear any relation to the actual circumstances of the spouses because a wife can be domiciled in a country with which she has no real connection.</P>
    <P>The concept of domicile of dependency is, as we heard here last night, out of tune with the mainstream of the law relating to the rights and obligations of spouses, for example, maintenance, succession, guardianship and so on in respect of which the general principal of equality of rights applies.  The Law Reform Commission stated in Working Paper No. 10 of 1981 that the concept of domicile of dependency might offend against Article 40 of the Constitution because it discriminates invidiously between persons, even though Article 40, as we know, deals with personal rights, and some people might say that domicile would not be involved in the deciding of those personal rights. Nevertheless, domicile is used as a connecting factor in determining a large number of these personal rights, and Mr. Justice Walsh, in <i>Gaffney v. Gaffney,</i> expressed doubts as to the constitutionality of domicile of dependency in a case where a husband changes his domicile but a wife remains in the country of her domicile of origin.</P>
    <P>We are proposing in the Bill to replace that concept with the concept of habitual residency.  That is used increasingly in international conventions and municipal law as a connecting factor.  For instance, it was used in the 1965 Succession Act. It is used in certain British statutes, such as the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings <Col N="2022" /> Act, 1973.  It is being used in the EC, in the Convention on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgements, and the convention on the law applicable to contractual obligations.</P>
    <P>The Bill makes it clear that although each spouse has an independent habitual residence, the habitual residence of one spouse may be taken into account in determining that of the other.  It specifically states, and this is done to simplify matters, that when spouses are living together they are deemed to have the same habitual residence unless they can show that the contrary is the case.</P>
    <P>The Law Reform Commission, as I said, examined whether it would be better to reform the law on domicile or to replace it by habitual residence.  We have to pay some heed to the reports of the Law Reform Commission because they have facilities that we do not have to examine all aspects of law and to report thereon.  After much consideration, the commission expressed the view that on balance the better course would be to replace &ldquo;domicile&rdquo; by &ldquo;habitual residence&rdquo;. They had regard to the fact that having expressed the same view provisionally in Working Paper No. 10, the commission had not received any submission from any interested person or organisation arguing that such a step would be undesirable &mdash; the public had been asked to make submissions on the working paper.</P>
    <P>This Bill is the result of much research by the Women's Committee of the Fianna Fáil National Executive.  It is part of a comprehensive drive to bring about totally equal treatment in law for women. In that regard, I should like to pay tribute to those who worked so hard on this and to my colleagues on both sides of the House and in the Seanad who worked so well on a non-partisan basis on the Joint Committee on Women's Rights.  We all worked together to improve the lot of women, whether married or otherwise. The political note brought into the debate last night by Deputy Shatter was regrettable. We did not have that experience on the committee and I had hoped it <Col N="2023" /> would not have been our experience here while discussing women's rights and the provision of equality for them.</P>
    <P>The Bill proposes equal treatment for men and women in relation to divorces obtained elsewhere.  As we all know, in Ireland if a man from here established domicile abroad, in England or America, for example, and then got a divorce, as the law stands this would apply automatically to his wife without reference of any kind to herself or her family or, more important, to their feelings.  She has no choice but to accept that.  We are proposing that this would not be the case in future, that the divorce would not apply here unless the wife agreed to accept the jurisdiction of a foreign court.  Until then, she would continue to have all her own rights in Ireland as a married person.</P>
    <P>The Government are opposing this Bill, through from the speeches made against it it is clear that their opposition is based on a different interpretation of what the Bill contains, totally different views as to what is desirable.  The Minister opposes it because, he said, it opens a back door to divorce.  He said the Government Bill will not include a wide extension of the rules of recognition.  On the other hand, Deputy Shatter opposed the Bill for restricting the circumstances in which foreign divorces will be recognised.</P>
    <P>The Minister stated last night that the Government totally agree with the abolition of the independent domicile of married women.  Deputy Shatter said that such discrimination had beneficial aspects in some cases.  The Minister said that the different rules for Irish and non-Irish citizens is the proper approach, and it is precisely this difference that I heard Deputy Shatter attacking last night.  The Minister stated last night:</P>
    <P>The Bill before the House is acknowledged by the sponsors of the Bill to be closely modelled on the Law Reform Commission's report on domicile and habitual residence as connecting factors in the conflict of laws and on the recognition of foreign divorce and legal separation&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2024" /> The next two lines were deleted by application of a pen, and I will read what was in those lines:</P>
    <P>and as such must be taken to be a serious and important proposal meriting a serious and considered response.</P>
    <P>It is obvious that in the Department of Justice they looked on the Bill that we were putting before the House as something that was serious and important and which merited a serious and considered response but for some strange reason the Minister or someone close to him considered it necessary last night to delete those words.  That was regrettable.</P>
    <P>Our Bill is before the House.  It took the publication of that Bill finally to bring the Government to their senses, to apply the pressure in the proper places so as to ensure that their Bill was published this morning but the Bill from this side of the House is a better one.  It deserves the full support of everyone on these benches and I should like to see some people on the other side support it, too.  We have made a genuine effort to grapple with a situation which has existed for many years.  I regret that we did not have the opportunity when we were in Government to deal with the matter but we are attempting seriously to deal with it now.  I am glad the Government have published their own Bill and also that, as suggested by Deputy O'Rourke last night, instead of having a six hour debate on our Bill and then a debate of the same duration if not longer on a Government Bill, the people opposite have come to their senses and decided that there should be a vote on this Bill this evening.  Our Bill should be supported.</P>

      <P>My copy seems to have been Tipp-Exed on both sides.  I believe that the reason for the deletion was that on full consideration of the Fianna Fáil Bill it was recognised that quite unintentionally the Bill would have other effects which would not warrant the support of this House.  I hope to be able to explain why I think that was the case.</P>
      <P>I welcome very much Fianna Fáil's move to bring forward Private Member's legislation.  It is to the shame of the House that political parties, regardless of their participation in Government or otherwise, are not willing to promote items of legislation, or that groups of Deputies are not prepared to cross party lines to advance and promote Bills that would be of no particular cost to the State in terms of the budgetary position but which are desirable.  I am convinced that the collective experience and wisdom of all the Members could show up many areas that are in need of reform.  I, too, compliment the Joint Committee on Women's Rights and also the women's affairs group within Fianna Fáil who throughout a number of years have worked hard to bring about change.  The House should be much more flexible in its approach to matters of this kind.</P>
      <P>I have often had a swipe at Deputy Haughey in the House but I must compliment him also on the interest he has shown in what I will call this area of social legislation though in the narrower sense than the sense in which we often use the term.  When Mr. Haughey was Minister for Justice he promoted and brought before the House items of legislation that were of major importance and which had massive effects on the social life of the country.  One such piece of legislation that comes to mind is the Succession Act. I say this in a spirit of understanding the sincerity with which this Bill is being promoted and I say it also as a genuine word of compliment and of admiration for the work undertaken by Mr. Haughey in this kind of area during his time in the Department of Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having said that, there is something else I must say, though in a friendly spirit. <Col N="2026" /> On Friday last when I saw the presentation on television and heard Mr. Haughey interviewed on the subject of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Haughey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DavidMolony" hpid="Mr. Molony Mr. Molony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Molony</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;it occurred to me that this was perhaps the lowest common denominator of agreement in Fianna Fáil on the subject of marriage breakdown. Perhaps I was very wrong in reaching that conclusion but it was what occurred to me on that occasion.  However, I hope that is not the case and that the Bill does not represent the dust that is being thrown in people's eyes to cover Fianna Fáil's lack of position on other aspects of marital breakdown.  Having examined the Bill since, it is my opinion that if its sole effect were to achieve the purpose described last evening by Deputy Haughey, namely, to remove the blatant discrimination against women that arises, not from the concept of domicile, but from the concept of the domicile of dependency, it should be supported by this side of the House, but what is being sought in the Bill is the abolition of the concept of domicile itself.</P>
      <P>As has been pointed out by certain Members and as has been highlighted in the Law Reform Commission report and other reports, apart from divorce law there are many areas of our laws that are affected by the concept of domicile. Taxation is one such example because it depends generally on residency.  In some areas the concept of domicile can play a key part in the matter of a person's liabilities &mdash; their current liability and the liability after death for capital taxation. There is nothing in the Bill nor in the Fianna Fáil speeches to indicate that such matters have been considered.  This Bill should not be supported if only for that reason alone.  Its remifications have not been teased out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was the English experience of several years ago when the abolition of the concept of domicile was considered but then it was decided that, because of the taxation implications, they could not <Col N="2027" /> afford to take that road.  They have searched since for a solution but have not found one.  Unfortunately, from our point of view we live in a very mobile world.  Business people and others are moving frequently in and out of the country and if we were to pass a law, the effects of which had not been teased out in regard to the area of taxation, we would be doing a bad day's work.  This Bill wanders into an area in which it has no place if its only purpose is to achieve the purpose outlined by Fianna Fáil at their press conference on Friday last.</P>
    <P>The Bill will have another effect far beyond the removal of the discrimination against women who are stuck with this domicile of dependency and, that is, that Irish people are subject to the provision in our Constitution that we cannot pass a law permitting divorce.  Without any question, if this Bill were to become law, people could circumvent the divorce provision in our Constitution.  That might be good or bad but, as such, the Bill might be found to be unconstitutional or, worse, it would favour those who would be in a position to move in and out of the country either because of wealth, youth or their jobs, but it would fail to confront the dreadful issue and the awful problem that we must confront and that is the question of divorce.</P>
    <P>Domicile of dependency is offensive and grossly unjust.  The Government Bill deals with that point.  The abolition of the concept of domicile would have much greater consequences in the area of divorce.  Deputy Haughey described domicile well last night through it is a very difficult concept to define.  The essential difference between domicile and habitual residence is the difference between a subjective and an objective examination of a person's status at a given time.  Deputy Haughey said that to ascertain a person's habitual residence involves a much simpler inquiry than would be the case of establishing domicile.  He said that while habitual residence is a factual matter, domicile is purely a legal concept.</P>
    <P>I agree totally with that but let us take an example of an Irish person who qualifies <Col N="2028" /> as a doctor and who up to then has never lived anywhere but in Ireland.  If, then, as many doctors do, he decides to go to Canada for a few years to earn some money and acquire experience so that he might come back here and establish a practice he will have acquired habitual residence in Canada.  Such people do not have wealth in Ireland.  Their property and perhaps their wives are with them in Canada.  They thereby acquire, by any standards, the status of habitual residence in Canada but they never lose Irish domicile under Irish law because it is their intention to return after a few years.</P>
    <P>On the other hand, a case of domicile in the extreme is an English case, the name of which I cannot remember, of a man born in Scotland who lived in England all of his life except for a few weeks holidays in Scotland each year, who during the course of his life committed himself to paper saying that his heart was in Scotland and that was the place to which he wished to retire.  That man's domicile was determined by the courts to be Scotland, but by any standards he would have acquired habitual residence in England.  It is to that legal system in the terms of this Bill to which he will be attached.</P>
    <P>To take the example of the doctor, let us say he is married and goes to live in Canada with or without his wife and let us say both realise that their marriage has irretrievably broken down and they want to obtain a divorce.  They are habitually resident in Canada and they obtain a divorce decree in Canada.  They then come home and under this law that divorce must be recognised.  Even if the wife has not gone to Canada and has remained here, provided she submits to the Canadian jurisdiction, they acquire the qualification to obtain a divorce under Canadian law which will be recognised here.  That cannot happen under our law at the moment.</P>
    <P>That is the second major problem with this legislation.  I know it is not intended. If it were I would think that Fianna Fáil had been incredibly Machiavellian in all of this and that this was the great Irish solution to an Irish problem.  If anybody <Col N="2029" /> on the far side of the House believes this is the solution, it is not.  It is not the proper way to confront the problem of divorce.  Because one could sidestep things very easily this way and because of the reasons I have given, this Bill could be found to be unconstitutional.  I favour the removal from the Constitution of the Articles that prohibit the introduction of divorce law and that is the road we have to take.  It would be wrong of the House to use a Bill like this to circumvent the provisions of the Constitution.</P>
    <P>Many Fianna Fáil speakers have been very quick to associate this Bill with the proposals of the Law Reform Commission. The reality is that there are fundamental differences.  I have outlined the concerns I have about this measure.  The Law Reform Commission proposed in their most recent report in 1985 that domicile should go for divorce recognition purposes only and suggested a two tiered system which was far more severe than what is contained in this Bill.  In other words, Irish citizens or people who had the connection in Ireland so described, could not use this law, if passed, to circumvent the constitutional provisions.  They said in paragraph 7 of their recommendations for reform that the legislation should include a provision to the effect that the State may refuse to recognise a divorce or legal separation if such recognition is manifestly incompatible with the State's public policy.  That is the reality.</P>
    <P>The person who has gone abroad who can afford to maintain a home here and abroad would have an unfair advantage under this Bill.  I put it to Fianna Fáil that this Bill has ramifications which they have not considered.  I accept the sincerity of their position but, if the purpose of this Bill is to remove the discrimination brought about by domicile of dependency, then the thing to do is to remove the concept of domicile of dependency which the Government Bill will do. Unquestionably the issue of domicile is a complex and difficult issue which should be examined.  The whole divorce issue must be examined as should also the position of matrimonial breakdown.  If the <Col N="2030" /> purpose of this Bill is to remove the item of discrimination that Mr. Haughey mentioned last night&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I hope the example the Chair has made of me tonight will work well.  I am delighted to see that Fianna Fáil put forward a measure like this, and we should see more of it.  I accept the sincerity with which this Bill is promoted but it will discriminate in a different way in that it will give advantage to the wealthy and it will without question facilitate the circumvention of the provisions against divorce in the Constitution.  There has not been a Fianna Fáil speech in this debate that would suggest that they want to do any of those things.  I accept that neither Deputy Haughey, nor anyone in Fianna Fáil wants to do that, but if the sole purpose is to remove the discrimination so graphically described, they should stick to the Government Bill on this.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Fianna Fáil I thank Deputy Molony for his remarks. It would not be appropriate for me to congratulate ourselves, so I will resist the temptation to congratulate Deputy Haughey, Deputy Geoghegan-Quinn and the other people involved in bringing forward this much needed legislation.  I congratulate the Minister for Justice on the speed with which he responded to our proposals and on recognising that we had a partial case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As law undergraduates at UCD, we had to study a subject which was rather <Col N="2031" /> grandly called private international law and it was under that heading that we learned about the question of domicile.  I was fascinated with the subject as were my lecturers and professors by the tremendous academic theory and the arguments which surround this question of what constitutes domicile for legal purposes. It is still a fascinating academic subject but in practice it gives rise to decisions which are not only ludicrous but are manifestly unfair in many cases. When Deputy Molony referred to the case of the man born in Scotland, he made a case against himself because that man was held by the courts to be domiciled in Scotland simply because he wrote a letter to some distant relative in Australia saying that his heart was in Scotland. If that is not a ludicrous decision arising from this concept of domicile, I do not know what is.</P>
    <P>The Bill put forward is a very minor Bill.  Of all the legislation passed in this Dáil it is possibly the least in terms of practical change.  The Bill brought forward by the Minister is even less important because it sets out to do only half of what our Bill will do if passed.  We want to get rid of this concept of domicile and replace it by the more real, practical, understandable, explainable concept of habitual residence.  In addition, we want to get rid of this ludicrous rule whereby the domicile of the married woman is with her husband.  Despite the fact that the Government did not bring forward legislation, they have agreed that we are right to bring forward this Bill.  It is good legislation.  It is a desirable change.  That is why the Government brought forward their Bill to incorporate that change.</P>
    <P>With regard to this peculiar concept of domicile, one of the most ludicrous aspects of that whole archaic, outdated and historical branch of law was the rule that a married woman's domicile was in effect her husband's domicile.  The net effect of that rule was to treat the woman herself as irrelevant &mdash; she was not a person, she was merely an appendage of somebody else.  Deputy Molony mentioned people travelling between different <Col N="2032" /> countries, where one has to work out in detail a person's domicile.  I have come across many cases, most of them can be found in Cheshire's Private International Law where the courts had to go through tremendous ramifications to figure out a woman's domicile by figuring out her husband's domicile.  If ever there was a badge of servitude that was it.  We decided that that should be removed even though the practical effect in terms of the number of people who would be affected by this change would be small.  That is no reason why the change should not be introduced because it is a good, desirable one.  I thank the Minister and the Government for recognising that.  It is a progressive step.  It is perhaps somewhat unfortunate that the matter had to be left to the Opposition.  Nevertheless we welcome the Government's conversion in this regard and are glad to accept the minor concessions they are giving us.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Justice, being represented this evening by the Minister of State present, to go the whole way and accept our Bill in its entirely. The concept of domicile is an extremely artificial and archaic one.  Nevertheless it has practical effect in this sense, that there are many branches of law, such as intestacy, which depend on the domicile of the person about whom a legal matter has to be decided.  For instance, if a person dies intestate the law applicable to the distribution of his estate will be the law of his domicile.  Naturally the law relating to distribution in intestacy will change from country to country.  Then the courts must decide where exactly he was domiciled.  That is a concept that is rooted in history.  None of the Government speakers has argued against the principle of changing the concept of domicile to that of habitual residence. Government arguments have been based on technicalities, on our legislation given rise to unforeseen effects.  Had I the time I would be prepared to argue that these unforeseen effects are things that are seen only in the minds of Government Deputies who do not want to accept this Bill simply because it was brought forward by Fianna Fáil.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2033" /> Deputy Molony mentioned that it could open the flood gates to divorce. Yet in the next breath he mentioned that he personally was in favour of divorce. The reality of the situation is that we have carefully provided against that in our Bill where, in section 11(3) there is an in-built presumption that if this concept of habitual residence is being used to evade the laws, including the laws prohibiting marital breakdown &mdash; they are part of the laws of this country&mdash;&mdash; then there is a presumption that the concept will not apply.  We have endeavoured, in so far as it was possible for us to do so, to foresee that loophole and close it off.</P>
    <P>If the Government are worried about other technical aspects of our legislation, I would respectfully submit to the Minister for Justice that he has a whole Department of legal experts and another in the Attorney General's Office available to him.  There should not be any difficulty in solving those technical problems if the Government accept the principle of changing from domicile to habitual residence. I should like the Minister, when replying, to indicate to me whether the Government accept that principle because I have heard no argument against it.  All of the arguments on the Government side have been based on technicalities.</P>
    <P>I shall give the House the benefit of my experience in one regard, as to how artificial is this concept of domicile.  For a number of years I practised in the taxation department of a large accountancy firm in this city.  We were dealing with a number of multinational companies and with the tax positions of the executives of those companies resident in Ireland. From the tax planning point of view we took the person's tax position and, since personal taxation depended on domicile, we then decided in which country it would be to the taxpayer's advantage to be domiciled from the tax point of view. Then we read the various court judgments on domicile and we worked out seven or eight guidelines which the courts look at in deciding where a person is domiciled.  We then did our best to fulfil as many of those as possible on behalf <Col N="2034" /> of the client.  For instance, there were people buying graves in Canada and South Africa, buying plots of ground to be buried in here, writing letters expressing their wish to remain permanently in Ireland, or expressing a wish to go back to Canada.  That is just a small example of how artificial is the whole concept.  It is rooted in history and it is now time to sweep away all this archaic nonsense in many respects.</P>
    <P>Had I the time I could give the House a few more examples which would demonstrate the artificiality of the whole concept of domicile.  On the very rare occasion when I get a legal query which involves explaining domicile, I cannot do it.  I cannot explain domicile to an ordinary layman who does not have legal training.  It is an impossible concept, one that bears absolutely no relationship to practical reality as we know it.</P>
    <P>The concept of habitual residence is something which is easily understood and can easily be grasped by the average layman.  That is the sort of law we should be enacting.  Those are the sorts of law we should have, laws easily understood and which can be readily grasped by the layman to whom, after all, they apply&mdash;</P>

      <P>And woman, my apologies. Government speakers have mentioned various other problems we have and have expressed some doubts about Fianna Fáil's willingness to legislate on those problems.  Certainly we have many problems in this country relating to the status of women.  Happily some of these problems have been removed.  Many of our laws which discriminated unfairly against women have been swept away because of initiatives from both sides of the House.  That is not something confined to the Fine Gael party, even though to read certain sections of the media one could be forgiven for thinking so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are not purporting to argue here this evening that this Bill will solve all the <Col N="2035" /> problems; of course it will not.  I would describe it as a slightly progressive piece of social legislation.  It will not be the end of all those problems, of legislating for the situation of marital breakdown, or for the removal of discrimination against women.  We admit that it will not solve all our problems.  It is designed to solve two specific problems.  The Government appear to accept the principle that both those problems should be solved while in practice they are prepared to solve only one of them at this time.</P>
    <P>Despite Deputy Molony's fine words and congratulations to us it would appear that the real objection to our Bill is that it has been brought forward by the Opposition, not the Government.  That seems to be the real objection.  If there is a more valid objection on the Government side certainly I have not heard it.  Our Bill brings about changes which in reality and in practical terms are very small.  It seeks to remove two serious anomalies in the law.  The least the Government could do is accept it.  It will not involve any sort of social revolution.  In so far as the problem of marital breakdown is concerned Fianna Fáil will be quite willing to deal with that at the appropriate time in the appropriate manner.  This legislation is narrow but is progressive.  It takes us two steps forward.  The Government want to move only one step forward.  I would urge them to show a spirit of generosity here this evening and move those two steps forward with us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that this debate is taking place and that I have an opportunity of contributing to it.  I welcome the initiative shown by Fianna Fáil in introducing this social legislation.  This is what real reform is all about.  I say, as Deputy Molony said, that I would like to see Members crossing party lines and gathering together on an initiative of such concern on which perhaps they felt the time lapse had been too great, to bring in together a Private Members' Bill or perhaps introduce some other measure to do what we are seeking to do.  Certain archaic institutional traditions, dependent <Col N="2036" /> domicile being one, have up to now excluded us from this type of participation and co-operation, and I hope to see future initiatives of this sort leading to debate.  Deputy Molony was quite right in acknowledging that within his various ministries Deputy Haughey introduced certain social legislation which had tremendously advantageous implications. The Deputy mentioned the Succession Act, and no woman in Ireland would not acknowledge the implications of that.</P>
      <P>The report of the Commission on the Status of Women was initiated and that became the bible of women fighting for womens' rights.  Here I can criticise all sides of the House because I spent more years fighting outside the House than I have been in the House about long delays.  I was amazed to hear certain speakers in this debate describing this as a small, very minor Bill which will take only three hours to debate.  It should have been introduced long ago.  I have been lobbying women outside this House and sometimes inside it since 1973 and I ask them where in God's name the time went, or why this very minor Bill was not introduced before now, considering the archaic situation which had the deepest implications at the must fundamental level for women's individual freedom and responsibility.  I deplore that delay.</P>
      <P>I welcome this Bill for the reasons I am going to give, but I cannot support it.  I welcome also the Government Bill which will be coming in.  With constructive co-operation on both sides of the House we will have social legislation.  I am concerned, as I know the chairwoman of the Joint Committee on Women's Rights opposite me is, that so much still remains to be done in reform regarding women and their rights.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill has broad implications for a minor Bill.  In 1980 and 1985 at meetings of the UN Conference for the middle and end of the decade for women we could not sign the elimination of discrimination against women convention.  The Women's Representative Committee in their final report in December 1978 sought action on this.  This is 1985.  That <Col N="2037" /> was seven years ago.  Let us hope that tonight will see the start of the introduction of legislation which will never again take so long to implement.  In 1978 the Women's Representative Committee stated that the committee regarded the common law concept of the dependency of domicile for married women as outdated and anachronistic and recommended that the married women's dependency of domicile be abolished by statute at an early date.</P>
    <P>I take the point Deputy O'Dea made that in practical terms it might not have affected a large percentage of our population, but let me say to him that it affected every married woman or every women who wished to marry.  It affected their status so fundamentally upon marriage that usually it came as a great shock and a cause of anger to women to find that such an archaic notion existed and such an archaic law was on the Statute Book.  Very often it is not the number of people a law affects directly that matters but the psychological and political implications of it.</P>
    <P>I cannot support the implication of section 11 that there could be a recognition of certain divorces and not of others; that non-nationals, or foreigners as we call them, having foreign divorces could have their divorces recognised but Irish people could not.  That introduces into family law, I believe against the principles of our Constitution, a discrimination that all of us hoping and working to remove discrimination would reject totally.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WillieODea" hpid="Mr. O'Dea Mr. O'Dea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Dea</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the present position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MonicaBarnes" hpid="Mrs. Barnes Mrs. Barnes">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but I would have no hand, act or part in any legislation introduced here which would replace one discrimination by another, or introduce discrimination or differences between people.  The thrust in our legislation must be to be as liberal, open and non-discriminatory as possible, and constitutionally representative of all the people living in Ireland.  That is the principle which all our legislators in this House should uphold. <Col N="2038" /> However, unfortunately the implications of section 11 seem to negate that.</P>
      <P>The Minister drew attention to the fact that in some way the Bill as drafted differed radically from what the Law Reform Commission had recommended. For instance, he said: &ldquo;While it is, as I have indicated, modelled on the Law Reform Commission's reports, there are some important differences and there are aspects which would have to be looked at very carefully.&rdquo;  He went on to say that the Bill would apply to decrees of nullity in marriage in the same way that it would apply to decrees of divorce.  That shows there are tremendous differences between considerations that arise from the annulling of a marriage and a divorce. I agree with that.  The whole area of nullity and the grounds for nullity are quite different at present from those of divorce.  We would get into a quagmire and a minefield if we started to bring in any legislation that would align those two together, and in the debate and the legislation we must not add further confusion.</P>
      <P>The Women's Representative Committee recommended consideration of State nullity as a concept rather than the introduction of divorce.  Several other groups studies this also and made recommendations on it.  That committee after a lot of research regarded it as a very different legal dissolution.  Their final recommendation was that we should have a system of State nullity and of divorce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In all the studies I have been involved in in regard to the two subjects there has been a belief, based on legal expertise, that we should not confuse the two because the grounds for them and the implications afterwards are quite different. The Bill is also silent on the question of taxation laws.  I am sure Deputy O'Dea is aware of the complications of our tax laws.  I would hesitate to support anything that would add further to these complications. The Government's Bill, which took a long time to prepare because Ministers were trying to avoid the difficulties I have referred to, is a good one in the interim.  I presume that following the <Col N="2039" /> debate on the whole area in regard to marriage breakdown there will be a decision as to whether we should have a referendum on the divorce issue.  The Minister has said that the Government think that the wisest course is to limit the changes to be made in the rules and recognition of foreign divorces to as minor changes as possible until we have settled the whole problem regarding marriage breakdown, difficulties in regard to nullity and Church and State recognition of marriages.</P>
    <P>We must be careful to ensure that by removing the domicile dimension of the legislation we do not create problems in regard to dealing with the entire area of divorce here.  The question of nullity could be debated in conjunction with the divorce issue or after it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the contribution of Members to debates on social legislation and I am encouraged when I hear Deputies decry the fact that legislation that discriminates against women has been so long on the Statute Book.  I always wish that that type of urgency and awareness was prevalent in all our planning in regard to legislation. There is a belief among women outside the House that a lot of lip service is paid to the position of women and the inequities they still suffer from but there is little action.  When a minor piece of legislation is introduced some people feel that it is sufficient to keep women happy for another year or two.  When one is talking about such legislation one gets the impression that it is considered trivial, another sop to be thrown out to keep women quiet and that it is not part of the great national or international order. Such reforming measures do not get the same priority as other legislation.</P>
    <P>Anything that discriminates against women, that takes away from their freedom, their development and the independence of the person has an effect on men.  When we have introduced all the legislation necessary to remove inequalities against women, men will feel liberated. They will be able to stand dignified having helped to bring this about.  Far too <Col N="2040" /> many people feel that this should be left to women's groups to lobby.  Some hold the view that such discrimination does not affect men's lives but I would like to get across to Members, male and female, that nothing affects women in isolation, it reflects on men also.  As a Legislature, as constitutionalists and democratic parliamentarians I do not think we can feel anything but embarrassed and ashamed because in regard to various issues of discrimination we cannot sign and ratify the UN declaration for the elimination of all discrimination against women.  We have a high opinion of ourselves internationally and we have done a lot to deserve it.  Our standing in the UN is high and I want that to continue but I want the men to realise that there is no way we can stand high in the UN when half of our population, women, are so severely discriminated against to such an extent that we cannot sign the UN declaration. My plea tonight is to let us continue with the reforms that are needed.</P>
    <P>No side of the House should feel they have a monopoly on reform.  I want all Members to be proud that the House stands for reform.  I hope we will work together for reform and that by the end of 1989 we will have achieved our target. Ten years ago women believed that there was a bright world ahead of them.  It was accepted that the necessary reforms would not be implemented within one year but we thought they might be attained within ten years.  It is sad to report that we have a long way to go.  I do not want to enter the next decade without legislators being able to say that they have worked hard to bring about reform and that Ireland will be able to sign the UN declaration.  More than that, I trust that the women of this country will have understood that not alone have they brought about a change in the laws &mdash; which is certainly their responsibility &mdash; but that the eagerness and will with which they have brought that about assures them of not being second-class citizens or a minority interest as they are described, and that they can stand as equals, with exactly the same rights and opportunities as men.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2041" /> I would like to think that by the next decade we will have in this House more women representatives not alone contributing to debate but helping to bring about the kind of society that we all became politicians to bring about.  I do not think that will be achieved without the full and equal participation of women.  I would remind the male Members of this Chamber that I would like them to believe that also and to act upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="CharlesJHaughey" hpid="Mr. Haughey Mr. Haughey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Haughey</NameTxt>
      <P>It is something of a relief to those of us on this side of the House than the atmosphere in which this measure is being discussed this evening is infinitely better than it was yesterday evening. To those Deputies who have contributed to the change, I express my appreciation for their approach.  I understand that the Government parties intend to vote down this Bill of ours.  That is their decision.  I regret it but they will have to answer for it to a fairly wide constituency of people who welcome this Bill and look forward to its enactment.  The Government have put themselves in a very odd position by their attitude to the legislation.  The Minister for Justice could be summarised as saying that he approved of what the Bill was trying to achieve but nevertheless was going to vote against it.  That is not a very defensible position.  If he approved of what the Bill was trying to achieve then he should have directed his efforts to ensuring that the Bill did achieve what it was intended to achieve and not just vote it down.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of the younger Deputies might not know this, but it has been almost the general practice in this House that when a party in Opposition, or an individual, brings forward legislation which the Government of the day have to deal with, the approach has been that the Government would say to that party or individual; &ldquo;We approve of what you are trying to do, but your Bill is inadequate.  If you withdraw it we will bring in a comprehensive measure which will deal with this whole situation satisfactorily&rdquo;.  That has been the practice invariably since I came <Col N="2042" /> into this House, but here we have a different situation.  We have a Government which say to an Opposition; &ldquo;We like what you are trying to do in your Bill, but you are trying to go too far.  We are going to vote down your Bill and bring in in its place a much narrower, more limited, more restrictive measure&rdquo;.  In my experience that is the first time that that has ever happened in this House.  The usual approach is that the Government say; &ldquo;We have all the resources at our command, the parliamentary draftsmen, Government Departments, the Attorney General and we will bring in a Bill which will cover the whole area and deal with all the matters that your measure is not able to cope with&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Government must admit that their measure was rushed out and it is very narrow and restrictive.  It does not make any attempt to deal with the issue with which we are attempting to come to grips. Any objective view of what has happened here over this legislation must be that the Government have reacted in a mean and petty fashion to an initiative which we took in all good faith.  They simply did not want this side of the House, the Fianna Fáil Party, to get any credit for even this relatively unambitious and minor reform.  The gist of what Deputy Barnes said was that any reform is a major thing and I agree with that.  However, this legislation that we are attempting to have enacted could not be regarded as a major law reform by any standards. It is relatively straightforward measure to deal with a fairly restricted area of the law.</P>
    <P>This Government parade themselves as favouring a bigger role for this Oireachtas. We have heard this countless times.  They want to make the House more relevant to today, to the circumstances of the time and to involve to a greater degree the general body of Deputies, as distinct from the Government and the Executive, in the whole process of law-making, in particular.  The Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism is promoting a proposal now which is intended to ensure that there will be many more Private Members' Bills <Col N="2043" /> brought before this House.  I think that the Minister is sincere in what he is attempting.  I do not agree with the way he is going about it, but he is definitely making an effort to have that facility available to Deputies who are not members of the Government to bring in legislation and have it tested before the House.</P>
    <P>That is the Government's attitude on the one hand.  On the other hand, when we bring in this measure, instead of assisting and helping us and trying to see it through, they decide to vote it down and bring in a much more restrictive measure of their own.  No matter what way you look at it, that does place the Government in a very dubious position which it is going to be very difficult for them to defend.</P>
    <P>We were not out to upstage the Government on this issue.  I want to make it absolutely clear that that was not in any way part of our design.  As Deputy Barnes has kindly acknowledged, I have always had a great interest in law reform and have pursued that interest whenever I had the opportunity to do so.  I would remind the House that as far back as 1960 I published a White Paper, as Minister for Justice, which was entitled &ldquo;Women and the Law&rdquo;.  Deputy Barnes was talking about 1978 but that was 1960.  I think that our credentials in that regard are reasonably good.  The women in Fianna Fáil today, particularly our Women's Committee of the National Executive, were very anxious and eager for positive action by our parliamentary party in the area of law reform, and particularly where the status of women was concerned. It was in response to their insistence that we embarked on this legislation.  We have no other objective or motive.  We did not want to upstage or pre-empt the Government in any way. There are other ways we can do that if we want to.</P>
    <P>We have a situation where there was blatant discrimination against women in one particular area and the remedy was ready to hand.  The Law Reform Commission, a very expert and experienced <Col N="2044" /> body entrusted by this House with the job of law reform, particularly in this complicated and complex area, had studied this problem, gone into it in depth, produced papers and had finally come up with suggestions.  There was a proposal waiting to be implemented by somebody. On the other hand, the situation of discrimination was blatant and identifiable and readily curable.  Surely that combination of circumstances dictated simply one thing &mdash; that we as an Opposition party should proceed with this legislation. The discrimination was obnoxious, obvious and identifiable.  It was there for a long time and, in the words of different experts and judges, it was a relic of the past which should long ago have been done away with.</P>
    <P>We were clearly motivated by all those circumstances to take this initiative.  We went ahead and genuinely did not anticipate the Government's reaction of panic. They were distressed lest we might get some credit on these Opposition benches for something positive and they rushed out their own legislation.  I find that distressing but I will not make a party political point of it.  It is something which must be mentioned if only to be rectified.  I know there are on the benches opposite many Deputies who want law reform, who would like to see it progress on some sort of non-party basis and who are not prepared to wait for the Government, with all the pressures there are on Government, to bring forward reform. Surely this was an occasion when we could have made a good constructive, all-party, non-partisan beginning.  I regret very much that it has not worked out that way and that our Bill is to be voted down in few minutes' time.  I hope it will not happen again and, if somebody on this side of the House or on the Government backbenches takes an initiative of this kind, it will meet with a different reception by the Government.  I hope that the Government will have second thoughts about it.</P>
    <P>I am not at all impressed by the arguments put forward by anybody on the opposite side of the House about this Bill.  The objections to it are contrived <Col N="2045" /> and manufactured.  The argument about taxation is meaningless.  We are not doing anything major about taxation or changing any significant aspect of it.  We are purporting to substitute one sensible, practical, ascertainable test as distinct from a complex, unreal, unrealistic test. No matter what taxation codes there are of a national or international kind, that cannot but be an advantage.  I was astonished to hear the Minister advance in support of his argument some instance where foreign commercial gentlemen were living in London whose taxation position would have been adversely affected if the British had changed their concept of domicile.  The Minister advanced that to us as an argument against changing the concept of domicile.  The argument does not stand up; it is not real.</P>
    <P>Nor, with all due respect to Deputy Barnes, does the argument about nullity stand up.  We are perfectly prepared to put down one simple amendment to section 3, the definition section, to delete nullity. Deputy Barnes's problem would then disappear, if she has a problem.  I do not think it is a problem because we are doing nothing about nullity, no more than we are doing anything about divorce.  We are only providing a new criterion.  No matter how complicated nullity is and no matter what implications there are about nullity, it would not be changed in any way by this Bill.  If this Bill were passed, all we would have would be a new basis for deciding which international set of laws would apply in all nullity and divorce cases.</P>
    <P>I am not very impressed by any of the arguments put forward.  The one argument which would over-rule and overwhelm all others is the one put forward effectively by this side of the House, particularly by Deputy O'Dea, concerning the absurdity of the concept of domicile. If there was no attempt to improve the status of women in so far as discrimination is concerned and if we were doing nothing else but getting rid of this ridiculous and archaic concept of domicile, this Bill would be well worth while.</P>
    <P>Deputy Barnes talked about lip service and hoped that this Bill would not be <Col N="2046" /> treated as something which was a little gesture for the time being about the status of women while other major improvements would be put on the long finger.  I do not think it can be seen like that.  It is certainly not put forward by us in that way.  Here is a situation where there is blatant, identifiable and rectifiable discrimination.  Why not get rid of it while waiting for major reforms in other areas?  I would have hoped that Deputy Barnes might have used her influence, since the Fine Gael Party regard her's as an important voice in women's affairs, to get the Government to change their mind, let the Bill go through Second Stage and look at it on Committee Stage. If our Bill is lip service, surely a much more limited and restricted Government Bill is far more in the realm of lip service.</P>
    <P>We were quite prepared to take Second Stage last night and Committee Stage tonight and have it passed tonight or next week, if necessary.  If that had happened this piece of discrimination would be gone.  As it is, the Government have brought forward their Bill and our Bill is about to fall.  I do not know when the Government Bill will come before us again.  It will be put back until the Christmas recess and then we will have the budget and financial business.  Our Bill could have been put through now and this discrimination against women could have been ended.  Surely the sooner this is done the better.  I do not think it is worth the Government's while postponing the implementation of what we both have in mind just to deprive us of whatever kudos there are in this, which are not all that much.</P>
    <P>We were not attempting anything radical or revolutionary.  We just saw a piece of blatant discrimination regarding which the Law Reform Commission with all their constitutional knowledge and experience, pointed the way forward. The remedy was to hand and we sought to avail of it to take one admittedly small but nevertheless significant step towards the objectives which we have set ourselves and to which I have always set myself, that I will never regard my job as a legislator to be finished until such time <Col N="2047" /> as a woman and a man are totally, finally and completely equal before the law, because anything else is an absurdity and an anachronism.  This would have been one progressive and constructive step towards that objective.</P>
    <P>I bitterly regret the Government's attitude <Col N="2048" /> towards this and that they are now going to vote it down.  They are making a mistake but I hope it will be the last mistake in this area and that the next time we bring forward something of this nature we will be met with a different and more constructive attitude.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Before progress was reported on 9 July last, we had discussed section 2 at length and before the question is put I should like to indicate that I have been examining a number of the matters raised and have decided as a result that beyond reasonable doubt the Bill does what I said it would do when I introduced it in May.  I found that the fears expressed by the Opposition and elsewhere are grossly exaggerated.  On Report Stage I will be proposing an amendment to section 1, with a consequent amendment to section 8.  I cannot do that now.  The amendment would clarify the Bill and establish beyond any doubt that the fears expressed by the Opposition in the House and elsewhere are grossly exaggerated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I recall 9 July and the welcome we all gave to the indications by the Minister that he would reconsider the terms of the Bill.  I recall, too, the response then not only from the Opposition but by business and commercial interests throughout the country who had been clearly concerned at the impact the Bill would have, because it would lend a valuation base to equipment, containers, pipes and machinery which previously had not been covered.  In July we were reassured by the indications which the Minister seemed to be conveying to interest groups throughout the country and to ourselves.  It was a case of <i>parturiunt montes.</i></P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have waited all those months to see the effects of what the Minister undertook to do and the understanding which we in the Opposition were given and which legitimate interest groups outside had from discussions with the Minister. However, in the last two days we got copies of the amendment which the Minister has said he will move on Report Stage.  That amendment is not in any way adequate to give effect to what may have been the Minister's intention.  It is not acceptable to the Opposition and to interest groups outside.  I am satisfied, and <Col N="2051" /> my opinion is confirmed by the views of others, that the amendment does not in any way allay what the Minister called grossly exaggerated fears and misrepresentation. Unless and until the Minister is prepared to make really effective amendments which will tidy up and clean the Bill, such as the amendments I have proposed&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I referred to a Report Stage ministerial amendment.  The Minister will have seen our amendment and I suggest that they will put the matter beyond any doubt.  If we have a signal from the Minister that he will accept our amendments, which represent the views of the Opposition and of the legitimate interest groups outside, we will be prepared to allow the Bill to go through, and indeed to support it.  Otherwise, we will have to deal with the Bill in a lengthy and detailed fashion.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make a brief reference to the proposed ministerial amendment and to the Minister's suggestion that the claims made originally about the Bill were totally exaggerated.  If the Minister had shown me that he was correct I would have accepted it.  Much consultation has gone on between officials of the Department and the Valuation Office and a commonsense approach was adopted to the problems to which we genuinely pointed.  I am amazed at the good intentions expressed by the Minister to Irish industry.  If they had been set down in legal phraseology in the Bill we would not be here for 15 minutes tonight. Unfortunately they were not.  In the long debate that will take place, perhaps the Minister will be able to enlighten me about why the proposals suggested by the Opposition were not inserted in the Bill.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>All I am saying is that Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment would <Col N="2052" /> have the effect of transcribing the good intentions of the Minister and incorporating them in the Bill.  In response to the Minister's opening remarks on the section it is obvious that he has not moved ground in any way, that he has not done anything to remove the fears that were expressed.  I should like to think that those fears were exaggerated but having had the position examined privately and also having had the view of the CII of which I am a member, I find that they are not in any way exaggerated.  When it comes to interpreting the Bill, those concerned will refer only to what is in the legislation.  They will not be interested in what the intentions of the Minister might have been.  It is regrettable that after such a long period of discussion and negotiation we are back to the fundamental problem that the valuation base is being extended, that &ldquo;machinery&rdquo; has been changed to &ldquo;plant&rdquo; and that the definition of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; is widespread in the various sections.  The Bill is not providing what the Minister tried to tell us it was providing.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

      <P>I move amendment No. a1.:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2053" /> In page 2, subsection (1), in the Schedule, to delete the reference number &ldquo;3,&rdquo; in column (1) and all words from and including &ldquo;All cables&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;which pertain to them,&rdquo; in column (2).</P>
    <P>This amendment has been tabled in my name since the Bill was before the House last, that was in July.  The effect of the amendment would be to delete the reference to No. 3 in column (1) of the Schedule. In effect that would be to delete the reference to all cables, pipelines and conduits, whether underground, on the surface or overhead and including all pylons, supports or other constructions which pertain to them.  If that amendment were adopted the items referred to in the Schedule and which were not included previously in any Valuation Act since 1852 would be deleted.  The amendment I submitted today confirms a case I made in this House during the Second Stage and subsequently on Committee Stage.  I acknowledge that the amendment is an alternative because it seeks to delete the words &ldquo;all cables&rdquo; and substitute all easements or rights of way over or under land appertaining to all cables, pipelines and so on.</P>
    <P>Apart from those of us on this side of the House, the interest groups who have expressed concerns, and these include industry and business generally, would be happy if the Minister were to accept the amendment.  I wish to indicate the urgency and the need for the amendment. While acknowledging what the Minister conveyed in what I believe was good faith, both to ourselves and to the representatives of industry, nothing said in this House by him, much less anything he might say outside, has any legal effect and I speak as one who for the past 20 years has had considerable experience and practice in court.  This has been held to be the case down through the years.  In interpreting legislation the courts never referred to what was said in the Dáil or to what the Minister intended the words to mean.  The courts have regard consistently only to the terms of the law.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2054" /> The amendment the Minister has submitted and which will arise now only on Report Stage is totally inadequate to meet the needs the Minister indicated he would meet.  The Minister's amendment which proposes that plant shall include any fixture or structure which though free standing is of such size, weight and construction as to be of a permanent or semi-permanent nature, would mean that at law we would be including all such equipment as pipelines, cables and so on about which we have expressed reservations on the Stages of the Bill so far.  The Minister has indicated, admittedly honestly if not naively, in the explanatory note he supplied that the amendment he is asking us to accept as significant does not change the Bill or its purpose in any way so that all of these months have been wasted.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>After six months we are told that we have been wrong that the CII were wrong, that all the assurances they sought are not being given. What the Minister is telling us is that he has considered the matter and found that we were all wrong so now there is no need to introduce amendments of the kind we have been arguing for.</P>
      <P>It is not only pride that would force us to reject that approach.  It is a matter of the reasonable analysis of the ordinary meaning of the words the Minister proposes. For that reason I urge that one or other of the amendments in my name be accepted.  This would leave the matter beyond doubt and would exclude cables, pipelines and conduits, whether underground, on the surface or overhead and including all pylons, supports and other constructions pertaining to them.  If the Minister is not prepared to accept that I urge him to accept the alternative amendment since the existing valuation process applies to easements and to the property over which those pipelines and so on pass. The amendment would ensure that we would not be incorporating into the law equipment, plant, containers and pipes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It has everything to do with my amendment.  If we are to engage in the education process perhaps I should start now.  The amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), in the Schedule, to delete the reference number &ldquo;3&rdquo; in column (1) and all words from and including &ldquo;All cables&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;which pertain to them.&rdquo; in column (2).</P>
      <P>Is the Minister suggesting that what I have been arguing has no relevance to that amendment?  If so, it is hardly surprising that he is so confused as to come back here telling us that he is meeting our case when he is doing the opposite.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>They are all interlinked. These matters were not included in the valuation base and we are anxious that they be excluded now.  Either the Minister can accept the simple request I am making and delete that Schedule or else insert at the beginning the reference to easements over these matters.  That would be acceptable.  That is all I am asking.  If the Minister does not see fit to accept our amendments it will have a drastic effect on industry.  I do not share the view that the response of the Confederation of Irish Industry, individual industrialists or business people has been unreasonable or exaggerated.  The addition to the valuation base of matters included here which are used for manufacturing purposes or processes could add at least an extra £50 million to the rate paid&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It may be that the Minister is suggesting that the commissioners would not interpret the law in this way and that they in their discretion would not implement the law in this way, but they could interpret the law to include all of this equipment which hitherto has not been rated for valuation purposes.  In view of the Minister's refusal to accept my submission, is the Minister not aware that An Bord Telecom and the ESB, for instance, will have to face an extra bill of perhaps £15 million?  If these businesses find it necessary to pass the extra costs onto the private consumers and the business consumers, the productive sector will suffer even more.</P>
      <P>Most people are aware of the climate for industry and enterprise.  To add this burden through a deliberate extra charge by the State would be not only intolerable but insane.  The ESB are already paying something of the order of a £22 million levy in lieu of rates, a figure which most people regard as excessive having regard to the actual value of their property.  An additional £8 million, which is what would probably arise here, would be unsustainable and unjustifiable in any circumstances. Many people outside of the House are convinced that the Government are not aware of the effect of their actions on investment.  They do things for what they believe to be the right reasons but the consequences of their actions are disastrous for investment and enterprise. We need a major boost for enterprise and business and not the plethora of schemes and support agencies that are proliferating. We need to assure enterpreneurs that at last we are going to encourage them.  This Bill will just add an extra burden to the already crippling levels of taxation that they face.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In response to sustained opposition from these benches and from industry generally, before we adjourned last July we understood that the Minister would be coming back with a response to our <Col N="2057" /> proposals.  Despite all of that we now have an amendment which the Minister proposes to introduce which will not meet the needs.  The Minister seems to be guided by technocratic analysis and advice without any awareness of the impact of his decisions on commercial and business life.  It is becoming clearer that there is a very sharp distinction between how the Government promote a new era of investment&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I have been listening <Col N="2058" /> to the Minister for the past three years since he introduced his first budget and I regret that experience has shown that we were all too right and the Minister was all too wrong.  How often have I heard the words &ldquo;arrant nonsense&rdquo;, &ldquo;crap&rdquo;, &ldquo;jargon&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not use that word in here.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I could mention many occasions where the Minister just dismissed every suggestion from this side of the House with a dismissive gesture. Unfortunately the reality proved that we were all too right.  I am saying the same tonight.  I am pleading with the Minister to accept at least the second amendment. I will not insist on the first amendment. We should get back to where we were before the Minister introduced this Bill and simply insert the provision in relation to easements which would leave it beyond doubt that what we will be talking about will be the inclusion in the valuation base of easements or rights of way over or under land appertaining to cables, conduit pipes etc.  That was the case up to this.</P>
      <P>If the Minister is saying, as he did when he first introduced the Bill, that this has existed for 100 years, why is this Bill necessary?  If nothing has changed, if the valuation base is the same as it was in 1852, why is this Bill necessary?  If we want to reach agreement on the fact that the valuation base will be the same after this Bill as far as business and enterprise is concerned, then the second of my two amendments should be acceptable because it leaves it clear beyond doubt that we are talking about easements and not the actual equipment included in this section of the Bill.  I will leave it at that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I await the Minister's response but I am sure some of my colleagues would like to make their position known on this as well.  I would be glad if the Minister would signal to us that not only is the intention right but that the words to give effect to that intention will be introduced by way of an amendment and then we could all happily for once go out of here <Col N="2059" /> agreeing that what we intend we have written into the law.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The items that are at No. 3 in the Schedule in section 3, in common with all of the other items listed in the Schedule, have always been valued and rated.  To say just a little bit more about that, the inclusion of the items at No. 3 in the Schedule does not change the practice with regard to the valuation of cable, pipelines, conduits and so on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not interrupting the Minister, I just want to ask one question and, if the Minister can clarify this, we will be happy.  When the Minister tells us that the items included in No. 3 in the Schedule, about which I have been expressing concern, have always been included for valuation, would the Minister then mind explaining why it is that he has to add them to section 48 of the original Act?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy will allow me, I will come to that.  The inclusion of the items listed at No. 3 in the Schedule does not change the practice with regard to the valuation of cables, pipelines, conduits and so on.  Section 12 of the Act of 1852 provides for the valuation of these items on an easement basis&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the argument.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but the practice of valuing them on the linear unit basis, otherwise known partially as the contractors method, has been invoked for over 100 years.  What we are doing in the Bill is putting on a legal basis a practice of long standing.  It will not lead to an increase in valuations.  It provides merely for a continuation of the practice that has always been used.  For that reason obviously I cannot accept amendment No. a1 because the effect of that would be to remove these from the valuation base completely.  I would not be disposed to accepting amendment No. a1.a because that would take away the ability to follow the practice that has been followed for 100 years in valuing these items <Col N="2060" /> and which has turned out to be a very convenient method of dealing with this. The inclusion of these items at No. 3 in the Schedule does not in any way affect the actual valuation and rating of these items.</P>
      <P>If the House will allow me just a little latitude &mdash; and I will not stray any further than Deputy O'Kennedy did just now &mdash; that is my intent and I will demonstrate that it is my intent by limiting myself to saying, in reply to Deputy O'Kennedy's question as to why the Bill was necessary in the first place that I explained that very clearly on Second Stage when I made no bones of the fact that what I want to do with this Bill is to clarify the position in relation to valuations, to put beyond doubt matters that up to now seemed to have been in doubt and which, in the courts, have led to certain decisions having been made that have reduced the base in certain specific cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>If that was all the Minister was doing there would be no problem.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is the full extent of the intention of this Bill.  Since we are dealing with section 3 and the Schedule, I am not taking an excessive liberty in going a little further and dealing with what has actually happened since we last had a discussion on this matter in the House.  If I may use the phrase, I am hanging my remarks on No. 5 of the Schedule.  What we have done since our last discussion on this Bill in July is to take up the concerns expressed by a number of people, including Deputies in the House and a number of people outside.  We decided to put their contentions to the test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I arranged for representatives of the Confederation of Irish Industry, of the Valuation Office and people involved in the industries concerned to carry out six factory visits during the course of which the valuation officers would describe how they would go about valuation on the basis that this Bill were passed so that we would have a clear picture of what, in practice, the Bill would actually mean. The conclusion from each one of those <Col N="2061" /> inspections and visits was that the one problem that arose was a misunderstanding of the term &ldquo;plant&rdquo; as used in the Bill.</P>
    <P>In each case, on the inspection of a factory, carried out on the assumption that this Bill were passed and all of its provisions were in force, the inspection of the factories picked by the Confederation of Irish Industry, not by me, showed conclusively that the Bill did not change the practice, the procedure or the valuation of the premises, plant, equipment, machinery, all of the whole complex of things in each one of those factories.  It also allowed us to show very clearly that the difficulty arose from the fact that &ldquo;plant&rdquo;, in the terms of the Bill, has a specific meaning assigned to it.</P>
    <P>My amendment &mdash; if I may make a very brief passing reference to it &mdash; is designed to clarify that definition.  However, the misunderstanding arose from the fact that all of us, in the course of everyday business, used the word &ldquo;plant&rdquo; in several different ways.  Deputy Reynolds knows this as well as I do.</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I do.  That is why I cannot understand what the Minister is saying.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of us will use the word &ldquo;plant&rdquo; when we are actually talking about a whole factory.  A number of use will use the word &ldquo;plant&rdquo; to describe items of earth-moving equipment, plant hire.  A number of us will use &ldquo;plant&rdquo; on some occasions in the restrictive sense in which it is included in the legislation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I love that.  The Minister should go to the courts and find out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>What I have set out in my amendment is the specific definition of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; that is used in the process of valuing property.  That is what my amendment sets out to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlbertReynolds" hpid="Mr. Reynolds Mr. Reynolds">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>As defined by officials <Col N="2062" /> in the Valuation Office, by the Minister's officials or by whom?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>During the course of those visits we also looked at the specific question of process plant, again an area subject to some wondering on the Opposition side of the House and indeed outside the House.  Process plant would include a whole assemblage of vessels, pipes and other equipment.  We particularly took a creamery as being one of the specific areas mentioned, a good example of an operation which necessarily included a lot of process plant.  There was an impression abroad that process plant of that kind would be subject to valuation under the provisions of the Bill.  It has always been regarded as machinery by the Valuation Office and, therefore, exempt from valuation and will continue to be exempted from valuation under the terms of this Bill.  That is why I have brought in an amendment to clarify the definition of plant, and it is clear from definition that it does not include process plant in the concept normally talked about.  It was clear from each of the inspections that nothing in this Bill changes the approach that the Valuation Office use to the valuations.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>They were very educational and they showed conclusively to those who had expressed fears about the effect of the Bill that there was no foundation for those fears.  To make assurance doubly sure I have brought in an amendment which we will reach on Report Stage to make clear just what the definition of plant is that is being used here.</P>

      <P>I could go on at length about this, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and in case you have any doubts about the appropriateness of my remarks to the section, I remind you that it is in the Schedule that we refer to plant.  We could <Col N="2063" /> give the example of a creamery.  A cooling system in a creamery consists of a whole array of pipes, vessels and other usually stainless steel equipment which is commonly regarded as process plant and which it is feared might be brought in under the terms of the Bill.  It is regarded as machinery for valuation purposes because the equipment induces a change in the milk; for example, it cools it to a certain temperature.  If this change were to happen naturally or chemically, the vessels, tubes and so on would not be regarded as machinery.  They would be regarded as plant and, therefore, valued. Since it does not, they are not.  Again, it is to make that clear that I have brought forward the amendment which I will come to later which shows clearly that process plant of this kind&mdash;&mdash;</P>

I wish the Minister would address himself to the terms of the Bill and the amendment.  If he does that he will clarify in terms which will be definable in law the purpose of this Bill and his amendments.

I am still sticking to what is in the Bill and in the section.  I assure Deputy O'Kennedy that in referring to this tour of the country I would like to do here tonight what that tour did for the people in the CII who felt at the beginning that the Bill did a number of things other than those I said it would do.  If I am going on a tour of the country in this way, with your permission, Sir, it is simply to point out that there is nothing in this Bill that changes the practice or valuation base with the exception of the cases which I referred to very clearly in my introduction on Second Stage.  I do not deny that they are important.  Deputies on the other side of the House and, indeed, on my side of the House have written to me over the past few weeks in urgent and pressing terms asking me to get this Bill passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not for a moment accept that point of view and I do not think Deputy O'Kennedy means it.  He knows as well as I know that there are numbers of different ways in which deficiencies in legislation and in the working of legislation in particular can emerge. One is through decisions made in courts. If those decisions show that the legislation can be interpreted in a way that is not in keeping with the intent of a legislator, it is up to the legislator to make up his or her mind as to whether to take action.  I have made up my mind and the <Col N="2066" /> Government have made up their mind in this case that we are going to take action. We have that action in this Bill and it is designed to do what I said last May in this House it was going to do.</P>
      <P>Let me turn briefly to the Sugar Company. That was another case in which it was alleged that the provisions of this Bill would increase the valuation substantially. Inspection there showed that there is nothing in the Sugar Company in that factory that would be captured by this Bill that is not already included in the valuation base.  We come to the ESB. Deputy O'Kennedy pointed out that required of the ESB&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>On my amendment, the Minister is indicating, though unintentionally, that there is a need for these amendments.  As he put it, his purpose is to clarify the position and put beyond doubt matters that have been in doubt and also to ensure that interpretations by the court would now be brought into line with the original intention of the legislation. Clearly the courts and the courts alone are the people charged under our Constitution to give effect to the meaning of Acts passed in this Oireachtas or in the Parliament which preceded it.  Words have no meanings except those attributed to them where the test arises in court. For that reason words or intentions expressed in the course of debate by the Minister are of no consequence at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister told us that he is putting the matter beyond doubt in his amendment but I have to tell him that he is not doing anything of the kind.  Our case is that the ordinary meaning of the words he had in the original Bill, or in the amendment he has proposed, can only introduce into the valuation base plant, <Col N="2067" /> equipment, pipes and so on that were not included according to the decision of the court in a number of cases.  Nothing can be clearer than that.  Frankly, the Minister is trying to get around the decision of the court on the interpretation of the legislation that has been in existence for some considerable time.  He wants to add in matters that the court as of now will not include as being properly liable for valuation.  That is clear and the Minister is nodding his head in response to that. We must be clear on that if we are to talk in terms of clarity.</P>
    <P>We must make it clear that we vehemently oppose that move.  The Minister has placed great store on the trip around the nation to sugar factories, creameries and so on.  I must acknowledge that we do not for one moment question the bona fides or the intentions of the staff of the Valuation Office in this regard or what they intended to convey to those they met in the course of their journey. If we are talking about the legal interpretation the Minister will have heard &mdash; I do not know if the Minister was ever introduced to any course in law and I do not make that remark in any snide or critical way &mdash; of one of the basic principles <i>res inter alios acta</i>, matters done between all of us, which are of no effect at all in terms of the legal issue that will arise or the interpretation by the courts. The fact that some officers on one day gave assurances to people in Avonmore Creamery, the Thurles sugar company or else where will be of no consequence if an issue arises between the Minister for Finance and the industry of Deputy Reynolds or any other men of enterprise here.</P>
    <P>What the Minister has said is the actual law because the valuation staff said that was how they would use it, is equally of no consequence.  It is for that reason that we are saying that all the assurances here and outside do not matter.  We are only concerned with what we pass here.  It is about time that we were really determined to understand as best we can as legislators, not as lawyers, what these words mean.  The same applies to debates <Col N="2068" /> on Finance Bills.  Having listened to the Minister I have no doubt what these words not only mean but will be taken to mean in the future.</P>
    <P>It is my view that they will be taken to mean that areas which were not included such as equipment and plant will henceforth be included.  That is why I am insisting that the Minister should accept this amendment or introduce one to this effect.  If he introduces an amendment we will study it fairly and if it gives effect to what he states we will accept it.  However, there is no point in telling us what the valuation staff said in Thurles or elsewhere. There is no point in telling us in an assertive way that he is putting the matter beyond doubt.  There are other judges who will decide whether or not there is a doubt.</P>
    <P>I can give the Minister one opinion, which is reinforced by other counsel who do not wear two hats as I do.  That opinion is that it is far from being beyond doubt and that the Minister would be including areas that he says are not intended for inclusion.  The Minister should accept our amendment which would bring the matter beyond doubt.</P>

As far as I can see the Minister has not put down any amendment on Committee Stage but proposes to table one on the Report Stage. That is an extraordinary position.  Why he will not put down an amendment on Committee Stage and allow it to be properly debated I do not know.  He has had six months to do so.</P>

      <P>The reason Deputy O'Malley does not have a copy of the proposed amendment is that under the rules of the House I am not allowed to circulate it until we come to Report Stage.  I gave a copy yesterday to Deputy O'Kennedy as a courtesy because I believe in the maximum of clarity in these discussions.  If Deputy O'Malley wishes me to do that privately outside I will be happy to do so.</P>

      <P>I would be glad to receive it in due course.  I am extremely disappointed to find that we are in this position because we were led to believe during the recess and in recent weeks that the difficulty which arose and which was discussed at some length on 9 July had been resolved to the satisfaction of everybody. I understood that the Minister for Finance intended putting down amendments which would cover the points in question on Committee Stage.  We now find that he is putting down an amendment on Report Stage to define &ldquo;plant&rdquo; obviously in a way that seems on reading it not to be satisfactory.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to direct the Deputy's attention to the little addendum under the amendment.  It is very revealing.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>It states that much of the material appeared in the original section 7 (2), hence the second amendment. In the course of remarks on the section I heard the Minister say that there was no question of anything new being proposed. He said the Bill would not apply to processed plant.  If that is the case I <Col N="2070" /> should like to ask the Minister if, in order to make assurance doubly sure, he would accept amendment No. 4 in my name, the first amendment put down on 8 July last.  That amendment reads:</P>
      <P>In page 4, after line 25, to insert the following subsection:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;( ) This Act shall not apply to process plant or to any form of plant or machinery used to convert or change the substance of any material whether by way of manufacturing or otherwise.&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>That seems to be totally in line with the verbal assurances given by the Minister and if it was accepted I would not greatly mind what other amendments were made because that would cover the matter which a lot of other Members and I are very fearful about.  I doubt if the Minister's proposed amendment on Report Stage will have that effect.</P>
      <P>The Minister did not have to wait until Report Stage to introduce that amendment. He could easily have introduced it on Committee Stage as a new section.  It is most unsatisfactory to introduce it on Report Stage when we can only speak once.  If I ask a single question on Report Stage I am precluded from speaking again on the matter.  It is most unsatisfactory to introduce an amendment in that way. New amendments of that kind, other than technical ones, should be introduced on Committee Stage to allow the House to debate them.  I regret to have to say that it seems to me that this procedure is only a contrivance to avoid proper debate.  That amendment would not stand up to proper debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If the Minister is correct and means what he says, that the processing plant shall not be rateable, let him accept amendment No. 4, the first amendment of all which caused a flurry of amendments to appear at late hours, including some as late as today.  That would get over the whole matter and after that none of the other aspects would matter that much.  There is a problem on this question of pylons, but I am less concerned about that because clearly that is a matter for <Col N="2071" /> the ESB, RTE and Bord Telecom who are in a position to fight their own corner if they want to.  They have access through Departments to fight this matter, which industry generally does not.  Might I briefly make a procedural inquiry to the Chair?  Are all Stages of this debate agreed to be completed by 11.30 p.m. tonight?</P>

      <P>I am relieved to hear that.  Committee and all subsequent Stages by 11.30 p.m. tonight was on the Government Whip.  I am glad that that is not the case.  I am afraid that this needs quite a fair amount of examination, being a matter of some importance.  To my mind it is tragic to see us dragged into this unnecessary debate where, for entirely bureaucratic reasons, court decisions are sought to be upset under the guise that everyone knew what the law should be and was until the courts set it aside.  We had another example of that within the last 18 months and it has been dragging on for that length of time &mdash; that is the famous Air Transport Bill.  Is the same principle applying here?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is nothing like a court decision to enable bureaucrats to say, &ldquo;We only want to clear up the situation.  We will get the crowd in Leinster House including, it is hoped, our own Minister, to accept that this really means nothing.  It is only clearing up a court decision&rdquo;.  The court decisions involved here are fairly clear. They say that machinery is not rateable. The purpose of this Bill, basically, is to make machinery rateable.  We have heard from the Minister that he has had representations from a number of Deputies in County Cork, presumably made at the instigation of Cork County Council, urging him to have this Bill passed quickly.  Deputy Reynolds informs me that the industry concerned, from which they would hope to get a very large amount of additional rates is Whitegate, owned by the Irish National Petroleum <Col N="2072" /> Corporation.  I do not know how much is involved, but it is probably several hundred thousand pounds.  That is why they are so anxious about it.  I would say to Cork Deputies, and all Deputies, to think again.  It is not just Whitegate; it is not just Pfizer who fought a case successfully before Mr. Justice Costello in the High Court on 31 July 1984.  Cork County Council will have to remember that their additional income will not just come from Whitegate, which presumably because it is publicly owned is regarded as fair game, or from Pfizer which is foreign owned and looked on to some extent as fair game also, unfortunately, but from Golden Vale in Charleville, Mitchelstown, Ballyclough, Drynagh Creamery and the other creameries in west Cork and the creameries in east Cork.  That is a very serious situation.  How much more will all those processing industries have to pay if this Bill is passed?  There is no question but that they will have to pay substantial additional money &mdash; how much I do not know.  No one will know until the actual evaluation is done.</P>

Happily, most counties have and some like Cork and Dublin have a large number of them.  The consequences will be extremely severe.  All the assurances <Col N="2073" /> in the world given, no doubt, with all good faith by the Minister in this House are not worth the paper on which they will be printed in the Official Report, as Deputy O'Kennedy has pointed out to the Minister several times.  They mean nothing.  The only thing that will mean anything is the wording of the actual Bill that will be passed by this House and by the Seanad.  You can have all the Official Reports you want with all the assurances of the Minister, all the letters that you want from the Minister and apparently some people have letters giving them assurances but I have had to point out to them that those letters are absolutely useless.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a great word in the Irish Civil Service.  It is like a vacuum, it must fill itself automatically.  This is a loophole and therefore anything is fair game once you are closing off a loophole. The Government bring in this Bill which greatly extends the whole question of what is a rateable hereditament.  I have in my hand a letter which unfortunately I cannot quote to the House because it is from a public servant who deals in this area and knows a great deal about it, lamenting what has been done and saying that having read the debate on 9 July last he feels it is his duty to bring to my attention what is being done and what the consequences of it are going to be.  I wish I could quote his letter and his name <Col N="2074" /> but I cannot do so, but you have my assurance that he is a very senior man and expresses great concern and he is of the view that the situation will be quite different from what the Minister portrays it as, that it will greatly extend the whole concept of what is a rateable hereditament. He gives me the history of the different court cases which have brought about the present situation, why and how it was done.  He gives me the history of the 1852 Act and the amendment in 1860.</P>
      <P>Closing loopholes in those two Acts, which is the phrase used in relation to this Bill, really is a joke.  How can the processes that exist in 1985 ever have been in the contemplation of the Legislature in 1852 or 1860?  In 1852 the only motor power to which they could refer was watermills.  There was nothing else. You could only have a factory provided you were situated on a falling river.  What relevance has that to the modern processing industry that we are talking about now?  What relevance has it, for example, to a chip fabricating plant which we have in Limerick today?  How can you say that you are trying to restore into the 1852 Act what the Legislature had in mind but which was improperly cast aside by the court in 1984?</P>

      <P>I would suggest to the Minister, the Valuation Office, the Revenue Commissioners and whoever else is involved in this that the proper approach here is to say to themselves and to us as the Legislature that the 1852 and 1860 Acts are totally out of date.  Look at the <Col N="2075" /> language of them &mdash; long, &ldquo;raiméisy&rdquo; medieval English.  To say that you are amending those Acts in order to make clear the intention of the Legislature in 1852 when you are talking about genetic engineering plants or things of that kind is laughable.  What should be done, therefore, is to bring in a new Bill, having repealed those two Acts altogether.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a similar amendment to Deputy O'Kennedy's further down the list.  Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment has a sensible objective in that it is trying to prevent the expansion of a whole new concept of things, machinery, objects into the category of being rateable hereditaments.  For that reason I fully support it and I hope that these amendments will be pressed because the consequences of their not being pressed would be disastrous.  It is not enough just to press them.  The Minister cannot go on with this kind of legislation.  If he wants to raise an extra £80 million or £100 million from industry by way of taxation, let him say so and let us vote on it in the budget. That is the appropriate time to do it.  He should not use this kind of back door method, telling us we are only blocking a loophole which has arisen as a result of a court case.  We have seen the consequences of an attempt to block a loophole 18 months ago in the Air Transport Bill. It is not good enough.</P>
      <P>The Minister will agree that I do not trouble this House too often on legislation. I have spoken during the past year or so on only a small minority of Bills and only where I have been aware of an urgent need in the public interest to oppose some provision.  I know that in this Bill and in this provision in section 3 there is a wide extension of the whole concept of rateability and the consequences for industry at this time are especially harsh.  The Minister should not proceed with it, particularly in this way. If he wants to raise £60 million or £100 million from industry he should do it in a more open way in the budget.</P>

      <P>We have heard two eminent legal speakers regarding the interpretations of this Bill.  I am not well versed in legal matters but in ordinary language it means that what was contained in the old Valuation Acts in relation to easements and hereditaments is the valuation of what we commonly know as the right of way.  The Minister is proposing that the cables or pipes which run through that right of way are to be valued.  Is that right or wrong?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it was necessary to explain that the ESB did not pay on cables but that in future they and Bord Telecom will pay.  That is a fundamental change, a widening of the base of valuation.  Deputy O'Kennedy's amendment clearly sets out to go back to what the Minister said was his intention, that is, to preserve the old traditional <Col N="2077" /> basis of valuation.  That is what the amendment is about.</P>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister taking us around the country on an educational tour for the Valuation Office or the officials of his Department.  He is being less than honest when he tries to convey that everything in the garden is rosy.  That is not the position.  He should not try to tell us that the concerns of the CII have been dealt with and imply that we are putting up silly arguments.  The one company which is reasonably happy is the Irish Sugar Company.  Telecom could not be happy, although I do not know what view they have expressed. The situation has changed drastically in relation to equipment in communications exchanges.  Gone are the days in most exchanges when the old electro-mechanical equipment was in use.  The Minister needs to clarify the definition.  It is not in this section, a Cheann Comhairle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Reynolds</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister made a passing reference to it and to the various companies.  He will have to change the definition later because they are not safe in this situation.  He tries to give the impression that the fears expressed by the CII have been allayed but that is not the case.  The Minister has maintained throughout this debate that there is no fundamental change but I have gained an admission from him tonight that one fundamental change is taking place.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should press ahead with this amendment without wasting further time.  We are saying to the Minister in good faith that this section will have serious repercussions.  I have sought legal advice and I have no doubt as to the interpretation that will be put on this. Despite the Minister's good intentions expressed to the CII, we should not allow a move in the back door, whether the Minister admits it or not.  Fundamental change is taking place.  The basic valuation base is being expanded and we all <Col N="2078" /> know this is designed to bring in more revenue to the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>The commercial sector is bearing more than its fair share.  It is producing wealth to keep everybody else going.  It is working hard under many burdens and this is not the time to increase them.  There is a clear admission that this will happen, although I will not quantify it or exaggerate it.  Let us do the job in the open.  We should not try to pull a fast one or &ldquo;con&rdquo; the people into believing that no changes are taking place when there are fundamental changes.</P>

We must widen the scope of existing legislation to take into account the new situation which has arisen which has overburdened processors and the chemical industry which has a fair amount of plant, pipes and cooling facilities <Col N="2079" /> uncovered.

      <P>I move amendment No. <i>b</i>1:</P>
      <P>In page 2, subsection (1), in the Schedule, to delete the reference number &ldquo;5.&rdquo; in column (1) and all words from and including &ldquo;Plant falling&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;Valuation Act, 1985).&rdquo; in column 2.</P>
      <P>The purpose of the amendment is to limit the power of the Minister to add to the Schedule or to include for valuation purposes matters that hitherto have not been included.  Much of this ground has been covered already but, as is clear from the amendments, it follows that the sections in the Bill which we are proposing to amend or to delete, were inserted for the purpose of enabling the Minister of the day &mdash; other Ministers might not give the bland assurances this Minister has given &mdash; to add to or to amend the Schedule or to include matters not now included.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Let us look at the first amendment.  I am proposing to delete the reference in column (1) and all words from and including &ldquo;plant falling&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;Valuation Act, 1985).&rdquo; in column 2 of the Schedule.  We are not satisfied with the definition of &ldquo;plant&rdquo; and we are not reassured by the Minister's intent in the <Col N="2083" /> amendment he proposes to introduce on Report Stage, because that will only extend the valuation base in regard to fixtures and structures associated with premises, etc.  We are not satisfied that these items were ever within the valuation base under the original Act or within the determination of court decisions.  Therefore, we are not prepared to give an opportunity to this Minister to do any more in the future than he was empowered to do already, a Minister who would try to use these powers to extend valuations to matters not now covered.</P>
    <P>The second amendment in my name proposes, in page 3, lines one to four, to delete subsection (2).  I want to delete this subsection because it states very sharply that the Minister may by order add to the Schedule a category of fixed property specified in the order or vary the description of any such category.  We are not prepared to allow such an all embracing subsection to be passed here so that somebody might say that the intention of the legislators&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The amendment the Deputy is describing is not in the group.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>It is related.  In another amendment we propose to delete subsections (2) and (3).  We have made it as clear as a pikestaff that we will not allow the Commissioner of Valuation to value plant falling within any of the categories of plant specified in the Schedule, as provided for in subsection (2) of section 7.  The Commissioner of Valuation is given wide discretion.  The subsection I have referred to imposes an obligation on the Commissioner, because it states:</P>
      <P>The Commissioner of Valuation shall value plant...</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So much for the good intentions and the expressions of the valuation office staff during their national tour.  That subsection says so clearly that a primary school child could understand it that the Commissioner shall do these things &mdash; he is <Col N="2084" /> obliged to.  The Minister tells us we are mistaken and he gave us an assurance.  As Deputy Reynolds indicated, the Minister assured certain interests.  It is not for this side of the House or for any side of the House to make of this a partisan political issue but we are all aware that the CII, who are a very responsible representative group, have not been reassured and that even in the past few days they have indicated to the Minister that they are very concerned that should the Bill pass with the amendments tabled by the Minister it would be giving effect to the fears they have been expressing.  I am not questioning the good intentions of the Minister but this must be said.</P>
    <P>This relates to subsection (2) of section 7 because it again imposes the obligation to value plant.  It provides for the valuation of plant being &ldquo;so attached or secured to the premises comprising the mill, manufactory or building concerned as to be of a permanent or semi-permanent nature&rdquo;.  The word &ldquo;permanent&rdquo; has a meaning both in fact and in law that most of us could understand and which the courts would interpret in a clear and objective way but what are the words &ldquo;semi-permanent&rdquo; meant to convey? Such terms in legislation do nothing to clarify the intention that eventually would have to be interpreted by the courts.  Then there is reference to plant of such size, weight and construction as to be of a permanent or semi-permanent nature.  Will the Minister define what he means by those words, not that his definition will be final determinant of what the words will be intended to mean?  I cannot imagine anything more vague or anything that could be interpreted so widely as a phrase of that kind.</P>
    <P>It will not be the job of the Minister or of the officials in the Valuation Office to interpret words in the legal sense but there is an Attorney General and there is a staff of legal advisers available to the Government.  If the Minister were to ask those advisers how broad can be the interpretation of the words &ldquo;semi-permanent&rdquo;, they would have to admit that they would have no idea of how broadly it would be interpreted.  The chances are <Col N="2085" /> that the court might strike it down in any event on the grounds that it was not capable of reasonable interpretation.  In that case even the Minister's intentions would be defeated.  Again we are asking him to delete this section.</P>
    <P>I must deal also with section 8 in respect of which we are seeking the deletion of the reference, number &ldquo;1&rdquo; in column (1) and all words from and including &ldquo;all constructions&rdquo; down to and including &ldquo;or electric current&rdquo; in column (2).</P>
    <P>In effect what we are being asked to do here is to include in this valuation base all constructions affixed to the premises &ldquo;comprising a mill, manufactory or building (whether in or below the ground) and used for the containment of a substance or for the transmission of a substance or electric current&rdquo;.  It is clear, as the Minister has acknowledged, that such constructions affixed to premises used for this purpose, which in this instance would apply to pylons, cables and so on, have not been included in the valuation base. As the Minister acknowledged this evening they have not been included in the liability for valuation in terms of the ESB who pay a levy in lieu of rates but it has never before been attempted to include those areas within the category of rateable plant or equipment.  I shall go no further than that for the moment because I should like to allow other Deputies the opportunity of pointing out their reservations on these and on some of the other amendments.  What I have said already is enough to indicate that the amendments are very far reaching and very dangerous and would have a very damaging effect on the capacity of industry by reason of the extension of the valuation base.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil records will show that I spoke on the Second Stage because I was advised by some associates in the CII of the potential damaging effect of the Bill to those who are now the sole group in the community paying rates by way of the inclusion of certain types of plant that were being included as being eligible for rateable valuation but which were not included previously.  At that <Col N="2086" /> time I asked the Minister to ensure that the worst effects feared by the CII would not be realised.  I shared the concerns they expressed at that time.  I rise to speak now because the very same people who approached me then approached me since and informed me that all the matters which were raised by many Deputies at that time and which were subjected subsequently to detailed discussions by officials of the Department of Finance and representatives of the CII have been successful.  My understanding is that all matters pertaining to the clarification for rateable valuation purposes of plant were clarified to the satisfaction of the CII. That is indicated in their newsletter of early October last.  My understanding is that these issues were clarified either by way of amendment to the Bill or by way of correspondence from the Minister to the confederation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy's understanding was correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I have it in writing from the parties concerned that the problem was resolved but I am now puzzled about the whole matter.  No later than the middle of last month the CII informed me that the matters about which they had legitimate concerns were being resolved.  I received no subsequent notification from them that they are dissatisfied.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>There is a fair reason for that.  The Minister's amendment was only made available yesterday or the previous day so when they saw the amendment they realised that it did not give effect to the good intention.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>The headquarters of that office and this building are not poles apart.  The clarification was not only by way of proposed amendments to the Bill but it was given in writing by the Minister to the confederation and in the Dáil during the course of the debate.  I assume that whatever written commitment was given by the Minister still holds good, that there is good faith on both sides in this matter, and that the problem as <Col N="2087" /> outlined on Second Stage has now been clarified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>I hate to have to shatter Deputy Yates' innocence but I am afraid his belief in the goodness of man is misplaced on this occasion.  The CII are in an appalling state about this matter.  They were given certain assurances which they accepted in good faith, but they now find that the assurances are not being honoured and that letters from Ministers are useless.  Assurances given in the Dáil by Ministers about their intentions are useless. In our jurisprudence a court, in interpreting an Act, can only go on the words of the Act.  It cannot have recourse, as is sometimes done in Continental jurisdictions, to what was stated in the Legislature to be the intention if the intention is not clear.  Even if it is not clear the court must confine itself solely to the words of the Act.</P>
      <P>If this Bill is passed in its present form with only the amendments which the Minister now proposes to introduce on Report Stage, all the worst fears of the CII will be confirmed.  That is the position of the CII as confirmed to me today in detail and to other Members of the House.  It is a matter of great concern.  I ask Deputy Yates to use whatever additional leverage his position at the moment might give him to have these amendments made.  I am confined to simple open argument.  If I cannot convince somebody to do something that is obviously necessary, then I have failed but from experience I have found that these difficulties are often resolved behind closed doors rather than in this Chamber.  I urge Deputy Yates to use whatever powers he has behind closed doors to effect the necessary amendments which his friends feel are necessary and which have not been delivered on.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is interesting to see in section 7 (2) and (3) that it is those two subsections that give rise to the Minister's first proposed amendment on Report Stage.  If the Minister is amending those two subsections the place for him to do it is here and now.  Perhaps the Minister is not in the House long enough to know all the ins <Col N="2088" /> and outs of procedure, but it is not helpful to the House, to put it mildly, to have the only ministerial amendment of any consequence, and it is not of much consequence, proposed only on Report Stage because there is little or no debate as a result.  Since section 7 (2) and (3) are the two subsections which are being amended slightly by the Minister, they should have been amended on Committee Stage.  It is an abuse of the procedures of the House not to have done that.  The House should express its resentment at that.</P>
    <P>On the earlier amendment I made a number of points and the Minister replied to one only by asking what I was getting so excited about because machinery was excluded in one of the sections of this Bill and therefore machinery would continue to be excluded.  Machinery which was always excluded and which will still be excluded will now be in a much narrower category as a result of this Bill.  In his own amendment the Minister defines plant. The Minister also gives a definition in the Schedules in section 3 and section 8. These are all things that are plant and have become rateable as opposed to what was generally regarded as machinery before this Bill was introduced, and was not rateable.  One only has to look at the Minister's amendment to see how he broadens the definition of rateable plant as opposed to unrateable machinery.</P>
    <P>Something which is of such size, weight or construction as to be of a permanent or semi-permanent nature is to be considered plant.  Somebody down in the High Court or the Supreme Court will make a lot of money arguing about that definition.  That is so vague that it is impossible.  It would include machinery that would have to be fixed in or concreted in, for instance, a machine which vibrates, and engine or processing plant. That is machinery; it just happens that it must be secured in that way.  It was machinery since 1852 but, on the passage of this Bill in this form, it suddenly becomes rateable plant.  The machinery need not even be permanently fixed, but it will be considered as plant if it is semi-permanent or if it is big enough.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>What is big enough? What is heavy enough?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>How many days will someone have to spend in the High Court debating what is big enough or heavy enough or small enough to be machinery or plant?  That definition, with all due respect to the Minister, makes an unclear situation worse.</P>
      <P>We are told that this Bill is introduced because of High Court decisions which the Commissioners of the Valuations Office, the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Finance did not like. They will like this less.  It is unfair to industry that they will have to litigate day in and day out over this thing.  There will be dozens of these cases and they will be waiting for test cases to be decided.  In the meantime they will have to make provision in their accounts for huge amounts of rates, whether or not they are ultimately due.  It is most unsatisfactory. Industry needs every encouragement it can get and not this sort of nonsensical persecution by bureaucrats.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister for Finance has many good qualities but common sense is not uppermost.  I wish that quality on him.  In my time here, I have seen many Ministers for Finance in this House and the best of them were not necessarily the brightest of them.  They were common sense Ministers. A common sense Minister for Finance would not wear this nonsense for five minutes.  He would say: &ldquo;Go away, and if there is justification for making a major change we will make it by repealing these idiotic 1852 and 1860 Acts&rdquo;.  I am sure they were grand in their day when the only mode of power was water, when one had to build on a falling river because there was no other way you would get any power.  Then they had to make amendments in 1860 because suddenly steam-power began to become available where it was not before.  Then there were all kinds of complications when electricity came along.  It really is futile to try to retain these things, to go through the fiction that we are clarifying <Col N="2090" /> the minds or the intention of the Legislature of 1852.  Certainly we are doing no such thing.</P>
    <P>The other single point the Minister made in replying to the last amendment was that he was aware that the ESB was not there for 100 years but that that did not invalidate his point, that the practice was that all these things in No. 3 of the Schedule to section 3 and in No. 1 of the Schedule to section 8 &mdash; which I propose under amendment No. 2 to delete &mdash; were not in fact the practice.  The truth of the matter is that they were not the practice; they are not the practice today. It is simply manifestly untrue for the Minister to say that these make no difference&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>On a point of order, if I may.  Deputy O'Malley is saying to the House that something that I said is manifestly untrue.  He is accusing me of telling an untruth and he is in fact not quoting what I said.  What I said on the occasion to which the Deputy is now referring was that the practice in valuing cables, pipes, conduits and so on is now and has been for 100 years what is in the Bill here. As I said in that connection, what I am proposing in the Bill is to give statutory legal effect to what has been the practice rather than the theory for the last 100 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>With respect, that is not the case.  These conduits and pipes are not subject to rateable valuation at present, they simply are not, and it is not enough for the Minister to say that that has been the case for 100 years.  Pylons are not subject to rateable valuation nor are transmission lines.  I know the ESB did not exist for 100 years &mdash; that does not invalidate the argument &mdash; they have existed for 59 years and they have never paid rates on their transmission lines. They will now have to pay rates on their transmission lines under the first category in the Schedule to section 8, the Schedule of the 1860 Act &mdash; which I propose to delete &mdash; and which reads:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2091" /> All constructions affixed to the premises comprising a mill, manufactory or building (whether on or below the ground) and used for the containment of a substance or for the transmission of a substance or electric current.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>It speaks for itself.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>The transmission of a substance, for example, gas, or the transmission of electric current.  That is now a category of plant that is rateable.  It is not currently rated but it will be if this is passed.  Therefore I suggest, with the greatest respect to the Minister, that it is manifestly untrue to say that it makes no change from the current practice.  It has to be manifestly untrue to say that because it makes a major change from the current practice.  I suggest that these words be deleted and that is the effect of amendment No. 2.  It is simple.  One must ask have words got to the stage that they no longer mean anything or they mean only what somebody wants in his own mind to think or wish that they mean? But all the assurances in the world mean nothing.  What will matter is what words are in this Bill if and when it is passed by this House.  The High Court and the Supreme Court will have to interpret it and there will be a flood of cases.  In the meantime some industries will have rates demanded from them that will be three, four, five or six times greater than what they are currently paying and that will put quite a number of them down the drain.  That is tragic.  I ask the Minister &mdash; there is nothing political in this and there is nothing in it for me &mdash; for goodness sake to take another look at this and not have himself led into this situation which is so ridiculous and damaging.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There was a feeling one time that Departments existed for the purpose of encouraging people of enterprise in this country.  One could not get that feeling today with many Departments.  This sort of thing is just crucifying people.  What does the House think the reaction will be on firms that have been here for some <Col N="2092" /> time when suddenly this change is demanded of them, when instead of paying perhaps £5,000 a year in rates suddenly they will be paying £25,000, £50,000 or £100,000?  There is a limit beyond which they cannot tolerate that kind of attitude within an administration or a country.  The time has come to call a halt to this because it simply is not good enough.</P>
    <P>The Minister has no reply to these points, other than to give a sort of bland assurances that are meaningless, that fly in the face of all the facts and in the face of what is stated here.</P>
    <P>The Minister's proposed amendment to subsections (2) and (3) of section 7 is a restatement of what is already there, but in my opinion, a restatement in a way that makes it even clearer that various things that were not subjected to rating before will now be subjected to rating. It makes it even clearer.  The existing subsection (2) is rather vaguer than what he is now proposing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why we are all here this evening when we thought we would not be&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, we thought the whole thing would be agreed.  There is a way out for the Minister &mdash; I am not saying it is the only possible way out &mdash; but it is a simple way out, that is that if amendment No. 4, which is now subject to discussion, is accepted &mdash; notwithstanding all these problems in the earlier sections and so on &mdash; that will get over a lot of it.  It will not get over all of it, it will get over it as far as industry is concerned, not as far as people like the ESB, Bord Gáis, Bord Telecom and so on are concerned.  But it will get over it as far as industry is concerned because the words contained in the amendment read:</P>
      <P>This Act shall not apply to process plant or to any form of plant or machinery used to convert or change the substance of any material whether by way of manufacturing or otherwise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That will cover things like distillation <Col N="2093" /> vats, for example, as well as things where there is a direct process involved.  If the Minister is sincere or really means what he says, that it is not the intention to include process plant, then let him accept that amendment.  It will get over that. There will still be a problem in regard to the ESB and all the rest of them.  I do not know what steps the ESB are taking. They are a State body and it is easier for them to make their case through their Department.  One would have thought they would have done it because, it seems to me that there will be an extraordinarily heavy additional imposition on them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">

    <Speaker pid="DesOMalley" hpid="Mr. O'Malley Mr. O'Malley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Malley</NameTxt>
      <P>Of course it lies only temporarily with the ESB.  Ultimately it will lie on all electricity consumers in the country.  That covers most points in these amendments.  It may not cover every one of them because they are complicated but it covers most.  The fact of the matter is that I have here before me the assurance of a man who has been dealing with these matters all his life, the assurance that they greatly extend the present scope of the law.  One of the points he makes, for example, is that it will be very unfair because it will be very uneven.  It will be of only limited benefit to some rating authorities who will get only a few hundred thousand pounds extra, whereas others, for example Cork, will get millions of pounds extra every year from these industries, and he thinks that is very unfair.  Some of the smaller, less developed counties obviously will get very little because, unfortunately, there will not be many industries of the kind concerned in them.</P>

    <P>He makes the point that he is a man of very considerable experience.  He considers that it is quite possible that this Bill is not constitutional in that it will increase the base on which rates are assessed for some industries while not affecting all other types of industry and non-manufacturing business.  You, Sir, will recall the Wexford farmers' case a few years ago <Col N="2094" /> where they challenged the constitutionality and validity of the rateable system on agricultural land which had remained basically unchanged since Griffith's valuation. The Supreme Court declared it to be unconstitutional on the grounds that it was not comparing like with like, that it was an arbitrary fixing of valuations done in the 1840s and 1850s when agricultural practise was totally different from what it is now.</P>
    <P>He is a man of great experience.  He has spent his lifetime in this field.  He makes the point &mdash; he is probably right &mdash; that exactly the same principle is involved here.  Suddenly there is to be an arbitrary placing on certain types of industry of a huge additional imposition which will not be placed on other industries.  On the basis that the Supreme Court probably will follow their own decision in the Wexford farmers' case, on the face of it they are likely to find this procedure of a considerable expansion of the rateable base so far as industry is concerned as potentially unconstitutional also.  It makes this thing rather futile.</P>
    <P>Apart from the legalities of the thing, how can the Minister justify an extremely heavy additional imposition on certain industries and none on others?  I do not think it can be justified.  It all depends on the type of plant and machinery they are using.  It is entirely fortuitous as to which kind is used in one industry and which kind is used in another.  Perhaps in some industries very good machinery and plant will be thrown out because they come within these definitions and a different kind will be imported at great cost because it will be classified as machinery rather than plant in accordance with these definitions.  If you have two pieces of machinery that are essentially of the same nature but one is small and portable and the other because of its size is regarded as difficult to move and therefore semi-permanent, the small one is free of rates and the big one is subject to rates.  That cannot be disregarded by the High Court when they are looking at these matters.  The definition proposed now is making a bad job worse.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to consider these <Col N="2095" /> points.  They are not made lightly.  I do not come into this very often, I do not argue the details of legislation very often, but when I do I am usually right.</P>

      <P>I am only an ordinary man.  I have no legal background, needless to say, but over my long years here in this House my interpretation of any Bill that went through this House was on what was in the Bill, not what was supposed to be in it, or on what interpretation was going to be placed on the Bill. It was on the wording of the Bill.  The Minister's interpretation and possibly the interpretation of the law and the courts are another thing.</P>
      <P>I have been here a long time now and I cannot understand this.  It was not general procedure here to have an amendment such as the Minister is now proposing to bring in on Report Stage brought in like that.  I do not want to use the words &ldquo;sleight of hand&rdquo;&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but &ldquo;lack of etiquette&rdquo; might be a better expression.  I do not intend to be derogatory but if that is it, so be it.  We were not accustomed to that but probably now it may be put down as due to bad advice or perhaps an attempt to get the Bill through quickly. On Report Stage we can speak only once.</P>
      <P>Many industries in the midlands where I come from have been in touch with me in regard to this matter.  Members who spoke in the House did not speak in a political way.  They spoke about the consequences it will have for industry and the owners of industry.  I would like every Bill that goes through here to be seen as in the best interest of the community.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The wording is flawed and will be interpreted in several ways.  If the Bill is passed in its present from, with all due respect to the legal people, it will be a bonanza for them.  They will bore holes in it in every court, the Supreme Court, the High Court, the lot.  The Minister's wording on this goes back 100 years.  We have teased out that underground piping, gas <Col N="2096" /> mains, electricity and BTE are all to be involved in this and to be rated.  They have a very easy option open to them. According to the figures here, the ESB may have to add £15 million per year to the £22 million.  To whom do they pass that on?</P>

    <Speaker pid="GerardCConnelly" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>To the hard pressed industrialist &mdash; we are dealing with him first because that is what the Bill is all about &mdash; plus the ordinary private customer. BTE serve industry.  Many people hope that gas can be brought into industry and thus save costs.  Now An Bord Gáis will have to pass this on.  Where will we be then?  The industrialists will be crippled again and the ordinary consumer will be drawn into it also.  The consequences of this will be far reaching.</P>
      <P>I cannot understand why the Minister does not put the exact wording that we suggest into the Bill.  I will go further.  If he brings in another amendment we will look at that amendment to see if it will meet the criteria we want it to meet in the national interest, because that is what it is all about.  Many companies are hard pressed to keep their heads above water and there is little need for me to elaborate on that.  Why is it that a Bill such as this is full of legal jargon?  A man remarked to me on one occasion that it was up to the legal people to make right wrong and wrong right but who pays?  A man who approached me about a case I was interested in remarked that had I been in court No. 4 I was right but that court No. 2 was no good.  Legislation like this will result in people having to go through the courts and that will be a sad day for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Members on this side of the House have put a great deal of thought into the Bill because of its importance.  We are concerned about the effect it will have on companies and on the workforce.  If plant is of a vibrating type and has to be set in reinforced concrete, will it be eligible for rating?  My view is that it will and that small plant which is not moveable is not. Will industrialists have to replace such plant because of the danger of being crippled <Col N="2097" /> with rates demands?  They may have to buy new equipment to avoid having to pay rates.</P>
    <P>As long as I am a Member of this House I shall not agree to any legislation that does not spell out precisely what is intended.  I accept the Minister's good faith to a point but not when it comes to legislation.  In today's arena many pieces of legislation passed by the House have been contested successfully in the courts. It is up to us to see to it that we do our job correctly.  The provisions in the Bill represent a major change.  If it is not, as we have been given to understand, then I wonder why industrialists are trembling with fear.  In my view they see they will have to pay thousands of pounds in rates when the legislation is passed.  Deputy Yates is being slightly naive when he says that everything will work out satisfactorily.</P>

      <P>I will return to that later.  Why is it that the Minister gets so hot under the collar when I refer to such matters?  If that was the position the Minister would not find me, or my colleagues, <Col N="2099" /> here at 11.30 p.m.  We have the same common sense approach to this matter as the 400 members of that body and we are expressing that concern in a legitimate fashion.  The Minister should not try to convince the House that everything in the House is rosy when that is not the case.</P>
      <P>The Minister said I had not read section 7 but in the short few minutes available to me to consider it I have come to the conclusion that it is even more dangerous than some of the other provisions.  How would one define in law the following, &ldquo;...manufactory or building concerned as to be of a permanent or semi-permanent nature or, if free-standing, being plant of such size, weight and construction as to be of a permanent or semi-permanent nature&rdquo;?  That is beautiful bureaucratic language.  The Minister has tried to convince us of his intentions but he has indicated to us that, in the case of easements, there is a change although we have heard for the past six months that there is no change.</P>
      <P>In the future we will show the Government very many more changes that are not obvious tonight in relation to the processing industry.  The fears that are held in many processing industries are genuine.  I cannot understand why there are not fears in relation to the ESB and Bord Telecom.  Perhaps they could pass the expense back to the consumer and the hard pressed industrialist and further weaken the competitiveness of Irish industry.  There is far too little competitiveness at the moment.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to thank the <Col N="2100" /> Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity, even at this unearthly hour, to raise this matter on the Adjournment. With his permission I wish to divide my 20 minutes with Deputy Daly and Deputy Coughlan.  I am assuming that the relevant order was imposed on Friday last. At the beginning of 1985 we impressed on the Minister the inadequacy of the quota for that year of 80,000 tonnes as compared with 85,300 tonnes in 1984. We sent telegrams to him and raised this subject on a number of occasions and supported him in his efforts in Brussels to obtain an increased quota.  Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful in those efforts, which is very disappointing.  It had never been known in the history of our membership of the EC that the quota would have been set at such an early stage but perhaps that was because it was Ireland's Presidency and the Government wished to show what good Europeans we were.  To give a comparison, the British quota this year is 220,000 tonnes, the Dutch 35,000 tonnes, the Germans 34,000 tonnes, the French 16,000 tonnes. We understand that the announcement of the present order was made over Malin Head radio.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatTheCope" hpid="Mr. P. Gallagher Mr. P. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. P. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>An announcement was made over the radio for the boats to return to port but then it was said that the order was rescinded and they were allowed to fish on.  We appreciated the fact that the Minister was on his way to Brussels and we hoped that he would get a supplementary quota which would be relatively high, in view of the fact that 60,000 tonnes of the British quota will not be caught by the end of this year and they are fishing in the same area off the north west coast of Scotland.  It is an absolute outrage that the Minister has done nothing whatsoever about obtaining a supplementary quota for the whole of 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all knew from March of this year that it was necessary to introduce a ban <Col N="2101" /> on fishing only if the supplementary quota could not be obtained from Brussels but the fishermen then agreed to suspend fishing until September-October. Their boats are not too versatile and types of fish available to other boats are not available to them.  They have major overhead expenses on these boats, insurance, and various other expenses particularly when the boats are tied up but they agreed to this suspension in the best interests of the fishing industry.  They did so in the hope that the Minister would grant them a licence to commence fishing from 1 October.  The matter dragged on into one week in October, with pressure from the industry.</P>
    <P>It is ironic that, during the week commencing 2 October, we were in a position to purchase fish from boats fishing off Scotland and landing their catch at Killybegs while our boats were not allowed to fish mackerel.  It was as a result of the embarrassment caused by this that the Minister introduced licences on 14 October.  We must remember that those licences were current only from that date until 16 November and again from 17 November to 13 December and the most important period of all is from 1 December to 14 December.  There was no question of further licences being issued subject to mackerel being available.  On the evening of 6 December the boats were told over the radio to return to port but that order was rescinded.  We did nothing about it until the Minister signed the order, we understand, in Brussels. Do we have to use that type of pressure? Do the Europeans not trust our Minister enough to let him postpone signing until after he had returned to Ireland?</P>
    <P>We must look at the importance of the mackerel industry.  There may only be six major boats and about 20 boats in total involved but that constitutes about 60 per cent of the total fish landings.  There are from 1,500 to 2,000 people directly involved as a result of the decision taken this week.  One could pose the argument as to why we should be allowed to exceed the quotas, but I shall give one very good reason.  The Dutch, with a quota of <Col N="2102" /> 35,000 tonnes, have to date from the autumn fishing landed 110,000 tonnes, exceeding their quota three times.  We are not allowed to exceed our quota by even 4,000 or 5,000 tonnes to finish out the end of this week.  We are not just dealing with fish, but with human beings in a depressed part of the country.  These are people who need the extra income, particularly at Christmas.</P>
    <P>I do not believe that it would happen in any other industry, or in any other country.  It certainly would not happen in the agricultural industry.  We have already caught slightly in excess of 80,000 tonnes and we should be proud that we are able to do this.  We have proved that we need an increased quota, as we insisted early this year.  No efforts are being made to get a supplementary quota while, at the same time, the British quota of 220,000 tonnes will result in a shortfall of 60,000 tonnes.  I do not believe that one tonne of the 80,000 we have caught has gone for fishmeal.  Of our catch, 90 per cent was taken ashore and helped in the creation of jobs, whereas in the UK 80 per cent of the mackerel go to freezer vessels and are sent abroad without creating any employment within the EC. A strong case should be made by the Minister to obtain 50 per cent of that shortfall of 60,000 tonnes.  He would find himself in an extremely strong position to look for an increased quota as against the scientists' recommendations for a reduced quota of 62,000 tonnes.</P>
    <P>We must ask that consideration be given to the inter-Governmental contract between Ireland and Egypt, a country which the Minister visited this year when he secured a contract for 15,000 tonnes. We must also remember that part of that contract was a rerun of a contract obtained by Deputy Daly as Minister for Fisheries from November to February 1982.  No consideration was given to the fact that a percentage of this quota was to leave this country on the high seas for Egypt.  No consideration was given to the fact that preference bonds were being jeopardised, that the financial arrangements which the industry had entered into were being jeopardised.  The only <Col N="2103" /> consideration was that we were to be good Europeans.  The Dutch have got away with an increased quota of 70,000 tonnes, which is similar to our own catch to date.</P>
    <P>We speak about venture capital and trying to stimulate an interest in the industry but I do not believe that anybody with venture capital would consider investing in the industry, apart from those who have been committed to the industry over the past ten or 20 years.  Boats were purchased a number of years ago when there was heavy investment in freezing facilities and there was an assumption that we would have a quota of at least 95,000 tonnes or 100,000 tonnes.  Our boats have a capacity to fish 120,000-140,000 tonnes and our factories are in a position to freeze that catch.  Even more important, the enterprising industrialists are in a position to sell it and we have the labour available.  However, we want to be good Europeans and we have not looked for a supplementary quota.  The total allowable catch off the north-west coast will be down this year.  The Dutch are to invest another £70 million in more freezers and they want to catch well in excess of 110,000 tonnes.  They are coming to the north-west coast, the most prolific grounds in Europe.</P>
    <P>In my area we have an unemployment rate of 2.5 times the national average. There are people there who have heavy commitments and it was a sad reflection on the Government that they introduced a ban such as this without making any efforts to get a supplementary quota.</P>
    <P>We must question the scientific evidence which is available.  Research has been carried out but I understand the working groups have not received the facts as yet.  We should not agree to any quota until the evidence is available and if we are bound to agree to some quota it should be 60,000 tonnes for the first three months of the year.  We could then negotiate, following a review at the end of March, to establish quotas for the remainder of the year.  The scientists have been proved wrong regarding the herring stocks.  They are being over-cautious now <Col N="2104" /> because the herring stocks are being depleted while they suggested the opposite.  They have also suggested that the salmon stocks are being depleted but I contend the opposite.</P>
    <P>The people who were most vociferous in the past about problems in the fishing industry have been conspicuous this week by their silence.  They are now in powerful positions and are not prepared to echo the problems of our fishermen.  There is a lack of commitment by the Department and the Minister and they are failing to instil confidence among those involved in the industry.  We would support fully the Minister's efforts to get an increased quota next year.  The problem which has now arisen is something we will have to accept but I hope it will highlight the situation and that the Minister will make every effort to obtain a greatly increased quota.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Coughlan Mr. Coughlan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Coughlan</NameTxt>
      <P>I come from the Killybegs area which is hardest hit by this problem.  There is grave concern among the fishermen and those engaged wholetime or parttime in the processing factories there.  They have now very little to look forward to.  Usually they obtain seasonal work but this year after only a short time they have been told that the whole thing is terminated.  Many of these people were in receipt of unemployment benefit during the summer but the benefit is now exhausted and the prospect of further claims being processed before Christmas is unlikely.</P>
      <P>I am critical of the Minister because the problem was very obvious as long ago as last March.  We had a mackerel quota of some 82,000 tonnes but it was obvious at that stage that there would be overfishing. From March to October or early November we had to make arrangements to increase our quota or to ensure that the fishermen would be allowed to fish until the end of the year when a renegotiation could take place.  That could and should have been done.  Britain did not reach the quota and an extra 60,000 tonnes of mackerel could have been caught.  Had it been done properly we might have been able to negotiate part of that for our fishing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2105" /> We do not seem to have a proper fishing policy and consequently there is much fragmentation.  The state of the fishing industry, especially in regard to mackerel fishing, leaves a lot to be desired.  Our quota for 1986 is to be reduced to 62,000 tonnes.  This is almost unbelievable in view of the fact that so many boats are engaged in mackerel fishing.  There is nothing else for them, no other form of livelihood.  I would ask the Minister to adopt the suggestion put forward by Deputy Gallagher and accept a quota of 60,000 tonnes in the early part of the year in the hope that this can be renegotiated and raised for the rest of the year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to add my support to the case which has been very adequately made by both Deputies from Donegal. The Minister fully appreciates the situation of the fishermen.  We believe it is essential that the stock position within the Community should be protected, but nevertheless we do not accept that the Irish industry has been the cause of the crisis in the mackerel fishery.  Fishermen from countries which are not even member states are firing the shots in this issue and the crisis is not due to over-exploitation by the Irish industry.  We have behaved in a very responsible way and will continue to do so but our fishermen are in an impossible situation because the quota is totally inadequate. This is causing financial problems for the industry and for the fishermen and there will also be a loss of markets.  There is also a risk to the processing industry. This is a critical situation which demands urgent action by the Minister at Community level.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGinley</NameTxt>
      <P>I am also aware of the importance of the fishing industry, especially in regard to mackerel, to Killybegs because of the number of jobs it creates on a seasonal basis.  I was in touch with a number of industries engaged in <Col N="2106" /> the processing of mackerel in Donegal yesterday and today and, fortunately, I understand that there have been very few redundancies so far.  I am glad that the new quota can be commenced at the beginning of January and any difficulties which may arise within the next few days will certainly be of a temporary nature.</P>
      <P>I should also like to compliment the Minister on the stand he took in Brussels during the week when he said he would defend to the utmost our quota at 80,000. I know that some of our European partners want to have that number reduced but I am confident that the Minister will do his best to maintain the quota and to increase it if he can.  The United Kingdom do not use up all their quota and perhaps there is an opportunity here of swapping with the UK authorities.  Perhaps we could give them a quota of fish which we do not catch ourselves and they could give us their mackerel quota.  I do not know if there is anything in the Treaty to prohibit that but perhaps the Minister will explore that possibility.</P>
      <P>Some Deputies mentioned that United Kingdom boats have landed fish, including mackerel, at Killybegs but, if they are within their quotas, I see nothing against it especially if it creates employment for Killybegs or any other part of the county. It is to be welcomed but I hope that our quota will also be landed in Killybegs and not in foreign ports.  Any difficulties we have are of a temporary nature and they can be sorted out on 1 January.</P>

      <P>There was no announcement by me on Friday and I wish that Deputy Gallagher would stop playing politics with the fishermen of his county and with the EC.  I did not interrupt Deputy Gallagher although at times I was severely provoked as he indulged in <Col N="2107" /> conjecture and unfounded and inaccurate allegations.  He will now hear some facts. We had been informing the fishermen for the past couple of weeks that their quotas were nearly exhausted and last Friday I understand they were told that a closure order was imminent.  That order was signed yesterday.  As we have reached the quota we are obliged by Community law to close the fishery.  I note that Deputy Daly, who understands what goes on in Brussels, did not make unfounded allegations or suggestions which he knows are not feasible in the EC context.</P>

      <P>The Deputy said that the British had left 60,000 tonnes unfished but that is also conjecture.  We have fished our quota of 80,000 and I have exchanged with the British the volume of 6,000 tonnes so, in effect, we have fished 86,000 tonnes.  There is provision to make a bilateral exchange, we have done that and will continue to do so.  The suggestion by Deputy Gallagher that I should seek, through the Council, 30 per cent of the unfished quota of the UK is not on and the Deputy should not be making suggestions like that.  There is no provision for this in the Common Fisheries Policy.</P>

      <P>Do not press me too hard, interrupting will get the Deputy nowhere as he is not prepared to listen to the facts.  He also mentioned the loss of 2,000 jobs.  Only 1,000 jobs are affected and, from information recently received from the industry and the processers, the <Col N="2108" /> Egyptian contract is not jeopardised by the closure of the fishery.  If Deputy Gallagher was in touch with his constituency fishermen they would tell him that they are now processing the final tonnes for the first shipment to Cairo before Christmas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Toole</NameTxt>
      <P>As I said, the Egyptian consignment is going ahead.  Furthermore, on 16 October the fishery was re-opened and at that time 20,000 tonnes of the quota were left.  As it happened, there were 26,000 tonnes because I did an exchange deal with the British.  Of the 26,000 tonnes, the Deputy might be interested to know that 17,867 tonnes were landed outside this country.  Then the Deputy comes crying to me about the loss of jobs and processing opportunities. He should talk to the fishermen.  I know there are good reasons for this but the Deputy should not blame me for it.  I would not expect any fisherman to plough through heavy seas for 36 or 48 hours but the Deputy should admit that.  There are no job losses in Killybegs at present.  The fishery closed because the full quota was fished, plus 6,000 tonnes.  It will be open again on 1 January and, as it would have been closed next week anyway, we are talking about eight days at most.  The fishermen did not know they had 6,000 tonnes extra fishing quota.  As far as they were aware, they had to spin out the 20,000 tonne quota to Christmas.  Even with my thick skin it really hurts to hear allegations that I am not getting the best deal for our fishermen in Brussels.  I reject that accusation and I am glad that Deputy Gallagher towards the end of his speech offered his assistance to me.  Perhaps his tirade, inaccurate and unfounded as much of it was, will help me in Brussels next Monday and Tuesday to try to squeeze a further quota for the coming year.  I hope it will and I would appreciate his help.</P>

      <P>My Department already relieve local authorities of most of the financial burden of providing accommodation for travellers, whether by conventional housing or by serviced sites.  The loan charges arising from the provision of serviced sites are fully subsidised; local authorities are recouped 90 per cent of the salary and associated expenses of social workers employed by them to work <Col N="1916" /> with travellers; and a range of other miscellaneous expenses, such as the provision of caravans for traveller families in poor circumstances, are partly or fully subsidised.  The total cost of these subsidies to local authorities will amount to over £2 million this year and this cost will increase substantially in future years.  The maintenance and management of serviced sites, like the maintenance and management of standard local authority housing estates, is properly a matter for the local authorities themselves.  Accordingly I do not propose to extend the subsidy arrangements to the maintenance costs of serviced sites including the costs of caretaker services.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="LiamKavanagh" hpid="Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh) Liam Kavanagh">
      <NameTxt>Minister for the Environment (Mr. Kavanagh)</NameTxt>
      <P>The policy statement on the Reform of Local Government, which I issued on 30 May 1985, set out the measures which the Government propose to take to develop and strengthen the local government system.  The Local Government (Reorganisation) Act, 1985, is the first stage of the legislation necessary to give effect to the programme, which &mdash; as indicated in the policy statement &mdash; will be implemented, or will be fully on the way to implementation, in the lifetime of this Government.</P>
      <P>The reorganisation of the local government system in Dublin is intended to make that system more accessible and responsive by introducing smaller units at county level and new units at district level.  The target date for the new system in Dublin is 1 January 1987.</P>
      <P>Provision is being made for modification of the <i>ultra vires</i> principle so that local authorities may have greater discretion to promote the social and economic interests of local communities.  This provision will be included in a further Bill to be brought forward in 1986 which will also give effect to a number of other commitments in the policy statement, including provision for new town councils to be established where they are needed and for town boundaries to be brought into line with present day populations.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The policy statement outlines the <Col N="1919" /> objectives in regard to the progressive devolution of functions to local authorities, either directly or on an agency basis. Devolution on the scale envisaged in the statement is a major undertaking.  It will be implemented in stages, following examination of the organisational and procedural requirements and taking account of the need to avoid duplication and ensure that there will be no net addition to the cost of services.  The necessary examinations, involving several Departments, have been going on under the supervision of the Minister for the Public Service as provided for in the policy statement.  I expect that there will be an announcement in the near future on the measures to be taken in the initial phase, including measures relating to aspects of devolution from my own Department.</P>
    <P>Finally, legislation is in preparation to reform and consolidate compulsory purchase legislation.  There will be an easing <Col N="1920" /> of controls over local authorities in important aspects of acquisition and disposal and speedier and more effective provisions will be provided for compulsory acquisition.  I expect this Bill to be ready in the first half of 1986.</P>

      <P>The position, in so far as the application under the 1981 scheme of house improvement grants is concerned, remains as stated in my reply of 23 April 1985 to Parliamentary Question No. 589. While an application has also been received under the 1985 scheme, it cannot be considered because the applicant has indicated that he intends to carry out the work himself.  It is now an absolute condition of eligibility for grants that the tax numbers of the contractors who are undertaking the work are submitted to my Department.</P>

      <P>A £2,000 grant is payable in respect of a house built otherwise than by contract only where the house was not substantially completed by 1 May 1985. In this case, my Department's inspector certified that a £1,000 grant was the appropriate rate of grant and this was paid on 25 November 1985.  The person named has been requested to submit documentation in support of his claim for the increased grant of £2,000.  Due to a misleading site location map supplied by the applicant which resulted in an inspection of another house, the notification issued to the applicant did not relate to his house but to the other one.</P>

      <P>I am aware of the condition of roads generally, including county roads, in Counties Monaghan and Cavan. Primary responsibility for the planning and execution of improvement works on county roads rests with the local authorities. The expenditure involved normally falls to be financed by the local authorities from their own resources which may be supplemented by the block grant for roads paid annually by my Department. The block grant may also be used, in the case of county councils, for the improvement, maintenance and management of non-national main roads, and for the implementation of traffic management measures.  The disposition of the block grant, including the extent, if any, to which it is to be applied to improvement works on county roads, is a matter for each local authority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Since 1981, Monaghan and Cavan County Councils have benefited from funds provided specifically for the improvement of county roads under the EC western package.  The amounts of these grants provided to Monaghan and Cavan County Councils to date total £541,000 and £819,000 respectively.  In accordance with established practice under successive Governments, it is not proposed to make State grants available <Col N="1924" /> for county road maintenance.  Expenditure under this heading will continue to be financed by local authorities from their own resources.</P>

      <P>Under the Defence Forces (Pensions) Schemes soldiers' pensions consist of three elements: 1. Basic pension; 2. A long-service increment for each year of qualifying service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years, and; 3. An additional increment, in respect of each year of qualifying service in excess of 21 years but not exceeding 31 years.</P>
      <P>The basic pension and the long-service increment are paid to the pensioner during his lifetime.  However, in accordance with the principle widely accepted in the public sector of co-ordinating occupational pensions with social welfare benefits, the additional increment terminates when the ex-soldier reaches the age prescribed for a contributory old age pension or becomes otherwise entitled to a retirement pension under the Social Welfare Acts.  The additional increment would, however, continue to be paid if, without his own default, the ex-soldier fails to qualify for a contributory old age pension.  This has been the position for very many years.</P>

      <P>Officials of my Department, on foot of a court order, recently siezed equipment believed to be apparatus for wireless telegraphy which was part of an unlicensed system for rebroadcasting British television signals located on the Galtee Mountains near Mitchelstown. The question of prosecution under the Wireless Telegraphy Acts, 1926 to 1972, is now being considered.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While people who were receiving television signals from the system may feel a sense of grievance, the position is that systems which rebroadcast television signals operate in breach of the Wireless Telegraphy Acts and copyright legislation. As indicated previously in reply, by myself and my predecessor, to questions on this subject and by way of public advertisements in newspapers during the <Col N="1927" /> past year, these systems are liable to be seized and their operators are liable to prosecution at any time.</P>
    <P>Rebroadcasting systems are inefficient and wasteful users of the radio frequency spectrum which is a limited natural and national asset.  They also threaten the viability of legitimate cable systems, capital investment in which is estimated at £15 million, and which currently employ up to 500 people and deliver television broadcasts to over a quarter of a million homes in the country.  They are also a disincentive to the development and expansion of a cable infrastructure which must be regarded as an integral part of the existing and future communications infrastructure of the country.  I cannot allow the efficient management of the frequency spectrum and the orderly development of a cable infrastructure to be prejudiced by the existence of illegal rebroadcasting systems.</P>
    <P>While I have every sympathy and understanding for people in areas not covered by cable systems and who, therefore, have no access to multichannel, it is not within our power in this State to waive the copyright rights of foreign television stations.  We, therefore, cannot legalise rebroadcasting systems even if the clogging of the frequency spectrum which I mentioned earlier could be overcome.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Health if there is any delay in the provision of the extension to Our Lady of Lourdes Maternity Hospital, Drogheda, County Louth; when he will sign the contract; the approximate contract time for the commencement and completion; the cost of building; the method of finance; the square acreage; the number of beds; the projected staff by category; the numbers to be employed; and if he will require the contractor to employ local labour and use Irish materials where possible.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Health (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>No delay is anticipated in the provision of the extension to Our Lady of Lourdes Maternity Hospital, Drogheda.  The Medical Missionaries of Mary are expected to sign the contract towards the middle of 1986.  The approximate contract time is 24 months and the building cost is estimated at £6 million approximately. The building works will be financed from the hospital capital programme, with the Order paying the design team fees.  The area of the building is 6,272 square metres and it will provide 68 beds.  The building is in replacement of existing accommodation and no change in staff numbers or categories is envisaged.  It is estimated that 50 to 60 building operatives will be employed during construction.  The Department of Health encourages the use of local labour and health agencies are instructed to give Irish manufacturers every opportunity to tender when seeking quotations for any commodity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Wallace</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if the qualifying allowance limit for the national fuel scheme has been reduced because many people who previously qualified under the scheme have been informed that they do not qualify this year; and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The conditions for payment of fuel allowances by health boards under the national fuel scheme are prescribed by regulations made on 18 February 1985. Under these regulations a person in receipt of a long term social welfare or analogous payment may be eligible for a fuel allowance provided that he is considered by the board to be unable to provide for his heating needs and is living alone or only with certain excepted persons. <Col N="1935" /> Recipients of short term social welfare payments i.e. unemployment benefit and assistance and disability benefit are, in general, excluded from the scheme.</P>
      <P>The conditions prescribed for receipt of a fuel allowance were essentially similar to those in existence before the regulations were made.  It subsequently transpired, however, that some persons formerly in receipt of allowances would not qualify on a strict interpretation of the regulations.  In order to prevent hardship in such cases further regulations were made on 3 October 1985 which enabled an allowance to be continued, provided circumstances had not changed. It is open to anybody refused an allowance in any circumstances to appeal against the decision by writing to the appeals officer of the appropriate health board.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Social Welfare if, in view of the disclosures on the &ldquo;Today Tonight&rdquo; programme on 3 December, he will reopen investigations into claims that a County Wexford moneylender (details supplied) had taken a children's allowance book as security for a loan, which was raised in Parliamentary Question No. 6 of 2 May 1985, and if he will make a statement on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the light of the Deputy's earlier question the postmistress concerned and the moneylender identified by the Deputy were interviewed by the local social welfare officer.  The postmistress identified the children's allowance claimant and she, too, was interviewed by the social welfare officer.  Both the moneylender and the claimant denied that a children's allowance book had been taken as security for a loan.  There was, therefore, no evidence of commission of an offence under the Social Welfare Acts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The programme in question merely reiterated circumstances which were already investigated with the results indicated <Col N="1936" /> above and, in the circumstances, it is not considered that any useful purpose would be gained by further inquiries in this case.</P>
    <P>The Department are concerned that the law in relation to alienation of pension or allowance books by moneylenders or others is upheld and to that end will prosecute offenders whenever possible. In this case, however, the parties to an alleged offence, as already indicated, denied that any offence was committed.</P>

      <P>Entitlement to unemployment assistance is dependent on an applicant being the holder of a qualification certificate, and to obtain a qualification certificate an applicant must satisfy certain conditions, including an assessment of means.  The person concerned claimed unemployment assistance from 3 October 1985, following the exhaustion of his entitlement to unemployment benefit.  The case was then referred to a social welfare officer for investigation of means.</P>
      <P>These inquiries will be completed as soon as possible, and the entitlement of the person concerned to unemployment assistance will then be determined in the light of the amount of means assessed against him.</P>

      <P>Invalidity pension is payable to insured persons who satisfy the contribution conditions and who are permanently incapable of work.  The person concerned was examined by a medical referee on 17 July 1985 who did not consider him to be permanently incapable of work.  A deciding officer decided that he was not therefore entitled to invalidity pension.  He has appealed against this decision and arrangements have been made to have him examined by a different medical referee.  His entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of the report of that examination.</P>

      <P>It is understood from the Eastern Health Board, which is responsible for the administration of the national fuel scheme in the Dublin area, that the application of the person concerned was refused as he is not in a category of persons with eligibility under the scheme.  The categories of persons covered by the national fuel scheme are recipients of long term social welfare or analogous payments and recipients of basic supplementary welfare allowance who fulfil certain conditions.  The person concerned is in receipt of short term payments from this Department and recipients of short term social welfare payments are generally excluded from the national fuel scheme.</P>

      <P>One of the conditions for receipt of disability benefit requires that the claimant has at least 26 insurance contributions paid or credited in the governing contribution year.</P>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit for the period from 23 April 1982 to 16 June 1982 but was not qualified as according to the records of the Department she did not have the necessary contributions between 6 April 1980 and 5 April 1981, the contribution year governing her claim.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The correspondence dated 17 August 1984 referred to by the Deputy in the note to his question related to the insurability of this person's employment from April 1981 to April 1982 which however had no bearing on her entitlement to <Col N="1941" /> disability benefit in the period April to June 1982.</P>
    <P>She claimed that she had been employed from April 1981 to April 1982 but no contributions had been paid on her behalf for that period.  Inquiries were made by the Department into the insurability of the employment and following a deciding officer's decision that it was insurable the person by whom she was held to be employed appealed against the decision.</P>
    <P>An oral hearing of the appeal was arranged and although the claimant was notified of the arrangements she did not attend the hearing in Naas on 23 August 1985 or submit any reason for her nonattendance. The appeals officer concerned subsequently reversed the decision of the deciding officer and ruled that the employment involved was not insurable.</P>
    <P>An appeals officer's decision is final and conclusive and can only be reviewed in the light of some new facts or fresh evidence brought to his attention.  If the person concerned considers that she has any such facts or evidence which were not available to the appeals officer at the time of the hearing of her case she should submit them to the Department and they will be put before the officer for his consideration.</P>

      <P>He was not entitled to payment of benefit from 5 September 1985 as according to the records of the Department he had less than the required minimum of 26 contributions paid or credited in the 1983-84 contribution year which governed his claim from that date.</P>
      <P>It has now been established that he is entitled to credited contributions for 1983-84 and is requalified for benefit from 5 September 1985.  All arrears of benefit payable to 13 November 1985, the date of the latest medical certificate received, have now been issued to him.</P>

It is not possible at this stage to say when works may be carried out.
