      <P>a copy of which Order in draft was laid before the House on 5th February, 1985.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputies will be aware of recent developments in relation to the Ombudsman which have given the Members of the House a number of opportunities to discuss the role of the Ombudsman during the past few months.  A further opportunity will present itself in the near future when the first annual report of the Ombudsman will be laid before the House.  In the circumstances, I intend to confine my comments on this occasion to outlining the changes proposed in the draft orders which have been laid before the House and the reasons for those <Col N="853" /> changes which will come into effect on 1 April 1985.</P>
    <P>I will deal first with the draft order proposing amendments to the Second Schedule to the Ombudsman Act, 1980 as the most important changes occur here.  The Second Schedule lists bodies which are not subject to investigation by the Ombudsman.  The most important change being made to this schedule is the removal of the local authorities and the health boards from it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>Members of the House will be aware that, following the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Government made an order to extend the Ombudsman's remit from 1 April 1985 to local authorities, health boards, An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  This order, in effect, placed these bodies in Part 1 of the First Schedule to the Act, among the bodies subject to investigation by the Ombudsman.  It is necessary, therefore, to remove the local authorities and the health boards from the Second Schedule in order to avoid a situation where these bodies would be listed in both schedules on 1 April 1985.</P>
      <P>The draft order now being discussed provides for this and clears the way for the extension of the Ombudsman's remit. A number of bodies have come into existence since the Ombudsman Act, 1980 was enacted in July 1980.  I am availing of the opportunity to add these bodies to the schedules.  I will now list the bodies being added to the Second Schedule.  As I have already indicated, these bodies will not be subject to investigation by the Ombudsman.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Central Fisheries Board was established in October 1980 and replaced the Inland Fisheries Trust which is already listed in the Second Schedule.  The Irish <Col N="854" /> Water Safety Association, the Fire Services Council and the Housing Finance Agency are State-sponsored bodies established by the Minister for the Environment.  Four other State-sponsored bodies, the Irish Film Board, the National Concert Hall, the Postgraduate Medical and Dental Board and the Youth Employment Agency Complete the list of bodies being added to the schedule.</P>
    <P>I should at this point explain one point about the drafting of this order.  The Irish Water Safety Association, which is being added to the schedule, was established on 1 August 1980 under the Local Government Service (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971.  Four other bodies, which are already listed in the Second Schedule, were also established under this Act, namely the Fire Prevention Council, the Local Government Computer Services Board, the Local Government Staff Negotiations Board and the National Road Safety Association.  Specific references to the last four bodies are being deleted from the schedule.  All of these bodies, including the Irish Water Safety Association, are now being included in the Second Schedule under the general term &ldquo;Bodies established under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1971&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>The Second Schedule already contains a similar provision in the health area in regard to bodies set up under the Health (Corporate Bodies) Act, 1961.  This is a drafting matter and it does not affect the existing relationship of these bodies with the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I now turn to the draft order proposing changes to the First Schedule.  Five bodies, all of whom have been established since July 1980, are being added to Part II of the First Schedule.  Before going on to comment on these bodies I would first like, by way of background, to explain the structure of the First Schedule to the Act.</P>
    <P>The schedule consists of two parts.  Part I of the schedule lists the bodies which are subject to investigation by the Ombudsman.  It includes all Government Departments, together with associated offices, which have civil servants <Col N="855" /> employed in them.  Part II of the schedule excludes from the Ombudsman's remit two categories of bodies.  In the first category are bodies which might otherwise be considered, for the purposes of the Act, to be part of one or other of the Departments of State listed in Part I of the schedule.  For example, it is specified that the Garda Síochána and the courts are not included under the heading &ldquo;Department of Justice&rdquo;.  The second category includes bodies which, while closely associated, with Departments, do not form part of the Department itself. In many cases they have been set up by Ministers to carry out investigations into certain matters ranging from prices to industrial relations.  Examples of these bodies are the Employment Appeals Tribunal and the National Prices Commission.</P>
    <P>As I have already stated, there are five bodies being added to Part II of the First Schedule.  The Postal Services Users' Council and the Telecommunications Service Users' Council were established on 5 July 1984 and they replaced the non-statutory Post Office Users' Council which is already listed in the schedule. The Commission on Social Welfare was set up in 1983.  The secretariat to the commission is being added to the schedule as the secretariats to other such commissions have been added in the past. The decisions of the Rent Tribunal are primarily judicial in nature and I do not consider that the tribunal's decisions should be subject to investigation by the Ombudsman.  The functions of the Mining Board are similar in many respects to other appellate bodies already listed in the schedule.  It will be readily agreed on all sides of the House and these bodies, by virtue of their functions, are not appropriate cases for investigation by the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>The remarks which I have just made set out the changes which I am proposing. In summary, the net effect of the changes will be twofold.  In the first place, they clear the way for a major extension of the Ombudsman's remit with effect from 1 April 1985.  Secondly, the schedules will <Col N="856" /> be updated to take account of bodies which have been established since July 1980 when the original legislation was passed.  I commend the two draft motions to the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>I support both these motions.  As the Minister said, we have had two debates recently on this Act.  The effect of these motions is to have the schedules ready for 1 April.</P>
      <P>Is everything in order in the Office of the Ombudsman to enable him to undertake the various tasks from 1 April, particularly the workload from Bord Telecom and other areas?  Will we have an opportunity to discuss the report?  I know that is more a matter for the Whips but in the last two debates many of the points made were pure speculation.</P>
      <P>I believe in being critical when there is need for it but I commend the Minister for his speed in this matter.  He updated the legislation promptly.  I have no doubt that some of the recommendations which the Ombudsman may make will require that changes be made, if not now then in the future.  I hope we will have an opportunity to debate those.</P>
      <P>The Housing Finance Agency is one of the authorities which was set up since this Act.  I do not criticise the administrators of that agency but there are many borderline cases in connection with it.  It is far better to assist people who are borderline cases because that saves the State money in the long run.  However, the officials are bound to follow what is in the Act. It is an area where it would be more appropriate to have some flexibility.  Perhaps this is an area where the Ombudsman could intervene.  He and his staff have intervened very successfully in a number of areas which are slightly outside their remit at present.  In many cases it was to the benefit of the public.  I know of cases where a phone call from the Ombudsman has been sufficient to overcome difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards the Housing Finance Agency and other areas where borderline cases cannot be entertained because of regulations, sometimes all that is needed <Col N="857" /> is commonsense on the part of the officials. It appears as if politicians cannot instil commonsense into these people but very often a phone call from the Ombudsman can do so.  Perhaps some flexibility could be allowed to the Office of the Ombudsman to permit them to involve themselves in the Housing Finance Agency and other agencies of that kind. They are engaging in that area anyway, regardless of whether it comes within their remit, and a number of the areas concerned will come within the remit of the Ombudsman from 1 April.</P>
    <P>I support the motions.  Most of the changes are purely technical and involve the addition of other bodies to the Schedules. The Ombudsman and his office enjoy a very high profile both within this House and outside and we must ensure that that high profile is maintained by ensuring that they have adequate staff and the necessary technology to enable them to take on the extra workload.  The amendments to the remit of the Ombudsman are substantial and must not be regarded as being some small extension of the workload.  The additional areas of the health boards, local authorities, Telecom Éireann and An Post are the ones in respect of which there is the greatest number of complaints, whether justified or otherwise.  It is essential for the proper operation of the Act and the spirit in which it was legislated in 1980 that the Ombudsman be given every assistance and support.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the motions before the House but I should like the Minister to clarify what he means by the relationship between the Ombudsman, the Post Office Users' Council and the Telecommunications Service Users' Council.  I raised this matter also at Question Time last week.  My question is whether a member of the public has the right to appeal at any stage against a decision of the users' council.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I take this opportunity of paying tribute to the Ombudsman.  The office was created for the purpose of helping the public cut through the threads of bureaucracy but I am concerned that because of the <Col N="858" /> centralisation of the office &mdash; and this is not intended in any way as a criticism &mdash; the Ombudsman might become a prisoner of bureaucracy.  We presume here on occasion that people have the resources, the ability, the time and the means of communicating their problems to Dublin, but the reality is that a big percentage of our population do not have these facilities and some do not have the ability to put their views in writing to one such as the Ombudsman.  Therefore, I suggest that at an early stage the Minister set up regional offices to which members of the public could go and discuss their problems with representatives of the Ombudsman.  Many problems that come properly within the scope of the Ombudsman are taken to local representatives. We are here primarily to legislate but we must spend a good deal of our time playing the role of social worker and having matters dealt with in Dublin.</P>
    <P>It may be said that I have an obsession regarding the problems experienced by the public with the legal profession.  I am hoping there will be legislation from the Department of Justice in the course of the next six to nine months in relation to this area and I am asking the Minister to liaise with the Minister for Justice in this respect, to consider the setting up within the office of the Ombudsman of an observer of the complaints tribunal of the legal profession.  The public regard the office of Ombudsman as representing and defending them and their interests. Because of the large number of complaints about the legal profession, every effort should be made to introduce machinery to deal with the problems in that regard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to echo something which Deputy Ahern said and to add a question of my own.  I am concerned that this very substantial extension of the functions of the Ombudsman will result in overloading his office.  I say that against the background of the Minister's known commitment, a commitment that I applaud strongly, to try to bring down the numbers of public servants or, in other words, to effect the same <i>quantum</i> of <Col N="859" /> work or value from fewer public servants. The Minister has pursued this objective with considerable success in the past two years but perhaps he will tell the House what additional resources he will find himself obliged to make available to the Ombudsman in order to ensure that his office will not be swamped by the accretion of work which this order proposes to place on him.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us also, though this may be an unfair question, what the opinion of the Ombudsman is on this matter.  Does he think that, with the likely extension the Minister or the Minister for Finance may be able to provide, he will be able to handle this extra burden?  The Ombudsman is not in the position of a civil servant.  This House ensured that he was given a status comparable to that of a judge.  Therefore, it would hardly be appropriate for the Minister to say simply that it is not the job of the Ombudsman to be giving advice about matters that are within the powers of the Oireachtas.  The Ombudsman is an independent official and, should be consider that he is being asked to do too much with resources that are stretched too tightly, the House might be told that.</P>
      <P>The Minister's objective of trying to economise on the numbers in the public service is more important than the objective which he is likely to achieve, and which in general terms I support, of bringing the new range of bodies within the scope of the Ombudsman.  In other words, if I had to choose between extending the functions of the Ombudsman and not having to provide more staff, I would opt for the latter.  Everybody here has been dealing for many years with problems arising from health boards and local authorities as well as from the telephone and postal services and we have been receiving reasonable response in our attempts to deal with constituents' problems. Therefore, I would not consider it a national tragedy that the proposed additional areas be withheld from the sphere of the Ombudsman if the cost of including them were to be a substantial number of extra public servants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="860" /> I should have been glad to hear the Minister say a word or two about some of the bodies he proposes to exclude from the Office of the Ombudsman, bodies that have emerged since October 1980. Though I have not any instance in mind, nor have I heard of one, I can visualise an instance in which the operation of the Irish Film Board would become a matter of grievance for someone, a film maker or some other person, who was claiming entitlement to the same kind of treatment from the board as somebody else had received.  The same goes with even greater force for the National Concert Hall.</P>
    <P>I do not think that the burden of business implied by either of these bodies could be very great.  I am not entirely clear, because the burden would be so small, why the Minister sees fit to exclude the National Concert Hall.  I have heard suggestions or complaints which I know nothing about and so do not want to appear to want to endorse &mdash; I do not want to imply an imputation against anybody &mdash; that the administration of the concert hall in particular in regard to the allocation of dates has caused certain discontent.  I will say no more than that. If that is so and if there is any ground for that discontent, it is a pity that the National Concert Hall, which could not be a big burden of work, should have the shield placed around it which the Minister's order in its present form proposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for the Public Service (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members of the House for the response they have given to the motion.  Several questions were asked about the arrangements which are in train for the extension of the Ombudsman's remit from the beginning of April next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision has been made for the recruitment of additional staff.  An additional 12 investigators and three senior investigators are to be appointed on the basis that one senior investigator and four investigators each would be assigned to <Col N="861" /> the areas respectively of the local authorities, the health boards and the telecommunications and postal bodies.  Before those staff were recruited consultations took place with the Ombudsman and his office as to what would be deemed the appropriate level of investigator staff who might be required.</P>
    <P>With the greatest of respect to my colleague. Deputy Kelly, he displays one of those endearing characteristics of the Irish which he himself has commented upon from time to time, that is, our tendency to be a little ambivalent.  He suggested that rather than have a additional staff assigned to the Ombudsman's office he would be prepared not to see the Ombudsman's remit extended.  He went on to suggest that some of the bodies to which the remit is not being extended ought to be included in the Ombudsman's remit.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMKelly" hpid="Mr. Kelly Mr. Kelly">

      <P>The difficulty is that in Ireland we are very good in general about having aspirations, but when it comes to individual cases we all have our own personal areas of preference or priority. However, I must say that when the establishment of the Ombudsman's office was being debated in the House, Members on all sides made it clear that the first extension of the remit that they would like to see would be into the area of the local authorities and the health boards, and there was a sense of disappointment that the Ombudsman's office as originally established did not include the local authorities and the health boards <i>ab initio.</i> I felt that it would be better to leave the Ombudsman a reasonable period of time to get his office established and to set up its machinery before a major extension such as this might take place. When we came to make the extension we felt, because of the volume of complaints that Members of the House were experiencing, that there was a need to extend the Ombudsman's remit in particular to Bord Telecom Éireann.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="862" /> Deputy Allen asked whether the users council and the Ombudsman will be in conflict or competition, so to speak, when the Ombudsman's remit is extended to the areas of An Post and Bord Telecom Éireann.  I might put it in context for the Deputy if I explain that between 1 January and the middle of October last year the number of complaints made to the Post Office Users Council amounted to 434.  When one compares that with an accepted figure of 150,000 complaints and queries made in relation to the operation of the telephone service over a similar period, it will be seen that the general public have had very little recourse to the users councils.  It was felt that the extension of the Ombudsman's remit to these two areas would provide a vehicle which had already become more widely known about in the minds of the public and that they would be more likely to avail of the services of the Ombudsman. The Deputy seemed to suggest that somebody going to the users council and being unsuccessful with his query might be in a position to lodge a complaint with the Ombudsman not so much about his query as about his unhappiness at the handling of that query by the users council.</P>

      <P>Will the Minister tell me about duplication?  Is there a need for the two?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnBoland" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That will have to be examined in the light of experience.  In theory it is possible that a person who had a complaint dealt with by the users council could, if not satisfied, take the complaint to the Ombudsman.  In practice a pragmatic approach would be adopted by the users council and by the Ombudsman's office to ensure the least possible duplication. In the fullness of time when we have some experience of the operation of the system we can decide which is the best vehicle by which to continue.  It has been suggested in the House previously that the whole question of having to extend the remit of the Ombudsman to BTE arose only because of the volume of complaints, mainly about the lack of civility <Col N="863" /> on the part of BTE in dealing with customers. Those complaints were echoed here by Members of this House and the other House, who made it very clear that they wanted to see some form of redress made available to the general public.  The remedy lies in BTE's own hands.  If they treat their customers in the way in which customers of any commercial concern might expect to be treated then there may be no need for the operation of the Ombudsman into that area to continue indefinitely.</P>
      <P>I am very interested in the idea of regional offices of the Ombudsman, but the office itself has been in operation for only a year.  I have said that I feel that the way to commence this is for the Ombudsman or members of his staff to travel on pre-arranged dates and times to regional centres and set up office there for a day or several days initially to test the market, as it were.  When that has operated for some time we can consider the idea of more permanent offices. Again I express a personal aspiration &mdash; and I am not sure whether this will ever be achievable &mdash; but I would like to think that at some stage in the future we might have regional ombudsmen based permanently in the regions.  However, if that were to come about it would be only because sufficient of what is now central government centrally administered had also been devolved to the regions.  We hear a great deal of talk from time to time about decentralisation, which in the minds of many people means only moving entire blocks of central work from Dublin city to some city or town in the provinces usually, coincidentally, a city or town based in the centre of the constituency of the Deputy who asks the question.  Very often I suspect that the real motive is to suggest the transferring in of the equivalent of a large employer and that has nothing at all to do with decentralisation. Decentralisation is about removing from a centralised area all of the decision making of the State and allowing those decisions to be taken in the regions where they might better be taken.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="864" /> I am a firm believer in real decentralisation. I do not mind mentioning to the House that some work is being carried out in this area by the Minister of State in the Department of the Environment in relation to the modernisation of the local authority structure.  If we are big enough to get to the stage of decentralising and developing many of the powers that are exercised at present in centralised offices in Dublin, there may be a case for the establishment of decentralised and regional offices of the Ombudsman in permanent regional offices.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>The problem with regard to decentralisation is that one has to take account of established structures and established workforces.  However, in this case we are still building the ombudsman service and now is the time at the formative stage to regionalise.  It will be difficult later when staff are appointed and living in a central area.  The opportunity is now available to commence at the formative stage the process of regionalisation and I ask the Minister to accept that point. The problem we had with regard to the Department of Education and An Foras Forbartha was that structures were formed and people were established in certain areas and they were reluctant to move.  In this instance we are taking on 12 people and now is the time to put them into the regions.</P>

      <P>There is quite a lot in what Deputy Ahern has said.  We have to establish the office of the Ombudsman which is a very small office.  The amount of extra work they will take on in April will be considerable.  We will have to allow the Ombudsman and his staff a reasonable length of time, part of which will be experimental, before we can gauge how effectively the work is being done.  I have had discussions with the Ombudsman and his office and I know they are interested in and supportive of the concept of visiting the regions on a regular pre-arranged basis to test the market.  Having done that, we can then better decide where there might be a need for permanent regional offices.</P>
      <P>I wish to emphasise again the provision that exists whereby a person who has a legitimate grievance can have his travelling expenses paid to enable him to travel from any part of Ireland to visit the Ombudsman in his office in Dublin.  I do not think that provision is widely known or is availed of to any extent.</P>
      <P>So far as the legal profession, the Department of Justice, the Minister for Justice and their legislation is concerned, I do not think it would be appropriate for me to make any comment as to the timing and the suitability or otherwise of legislation in that area.  I suggest to Deputy Allen that he might take up that matter specifically with the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The first annual report of the Ombudsman is due some time during next month. I indicated previously to the House that I hoped as soon as it is published to seek time by way of a motion in the House to allow Members to have a full debate on the matter.  That will be a very important contribution in the interesting series of discussions we have had in recent months <Col N="866" /> in regard to the operation of the Office of the Ombudsman.</P>
    <P>I thank the Deputies for their helpful and welcome contributions on this occasion, as they have always been in the past in relation to the operation of the Ombudsman's office.  All sides of the House have been at all times very supportive of the office and very constructive in their comments.

    <Speaker pid="PJSheenan" hpid="Mr. Sheehan Mr. Sheehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Sheehan</NameTxt>
      <P>EC Council Directive 77/504 on pure bred breeding animals provides for the harmonisation of breeding quality standards and for such related matters as the recognition of breeders' organisations and associations, the establishment and recognition of herd books and standards governing the entry of animals into the herd books.  In essence, this EC legislation stipulates that the quality of animals entering the herd books should <Col N="867" /> be of good standard and that quality control should be exercised by the breeding societies concerned.</P>
      <P>However, the directive does not cover the use of non-pure bred bulls.  It shows clearly that under the directive it is not necessary for our Minister to pursue the policy of having only complete pure bred bulls entered in the herd books.  The door is open for the introduction of the three-quarter bred bull of high quality which would be of immense benefit to small farmers on the western seaboard.  The three-quarter bred Hereford or continental would be a very suitable animal, with more crossing particularly of the Charolais and the Friesian and the Friesian and Hereford.  This type of animal is badly needed for the bleak, windswept exposed areas along the western and south western seaboard.  We are all not fortunate enough to live in the lush pastureland of Limerick, north and east Cork, Tipperary or even in the strawberry garden county of Wexford.  In the south western areas we are exposed to severe weather conditions during the winter months.  Along that seaboard there is a growing need for the introduction of the three-quarter bred bull under the new scheme.</P>
      <P>It is all very fine to say that farmers can benefit from the establishment of AI stations.  Many farmers are 100 or 120 miles away from the nearest AI station. Many of them are small part time farmers but they contribute their fair share towards the agricultural economy.  I am speaking on behalf of the man who does a little fishing in the summertime and finds it very difficult to keep a watchful eye on his flock or herd.  The presence of a three-quarter bred bull with that herd would be of great assistance to the farmer.  This scheme is very suitable for the full time farmer who milks 150 to 200 cows and who is with his herd from morning to night, but we must bear in mind that not everyone is fortunate enough to be in that category.  On behalf of those people I ask the Minister to give these people a chance under the new scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="868" /> There are 111,100 farmers with herds of less than 20 cows.  How can these farmers purchase a pure bred bull which will cost between 2,000 and 3,000 guineas, or even more?  Recently a bull sale was held in Cork and, as the Minister knows, the majority of the animals cost 2,000 to 4,000 guineas.  This is beyond the financial capabilities of any small farmer on the western seaboard.  I believe it should not be beyond the bounds of possibility for the Minister to devise a scheme whereby the Department's livestock inspector, with the ACOT adviser, would carry out yearly inspections to license high quality breeding bulls, that is, the three-quarter bred animal, to service the herds along the western seaboard.</P>
    <P>The recommendations in this Bill were made by the cattle advisory committee to the Minister.  There are 15 members on this committee but not one member represents the 111,100 small farmers with herds of under 20 cows.  This is blatant discrimination against small farmers in disadvantaged areas.  Whoever picked the members of this committee did not have the interests of the small farmers at heart.  I dislike the move in this country and in Europe to annihilate the small man.  He is part of our society and he must have a place in the farming community because he is the backbone of our economy.</P>
    <P>We must remember that with a confined acreage, as is the case with small farmers from Malin Head to Mizen Head, it is impossible to make a living from full time farming.  These farmers must have an off-farm occupation to augment their income.  If they do not, they will be on the breadline.  That is why we want included in this Bill a provision under which farmers in disadvantaged areas will have access to cattle breeding facilities with bulls of high quality approved by the Department of Agriculture, having been passed by the livestock inspector in co-operation with the ACOT adviser.</P>
    <P>In my view the three-quarter bred bull is a dual purpose animal.  If we confine the scheme to pure bred animals this will mean that the price of those animals will <Col N="869" /> escalate and the small farmer will be unable to purchase them.  As well, the demand on the AI stations will be so severe that the farmer may not be able to get the breed he needs.  For years the scheme which has been abolished served the country well.  I want to underline that the small farmer today is not a fool as far as cattle production is concerned.  He knows that when he exports his products the calf must be up to quality to gain the top price.  He is also aware that it does not pay dividends to breed inferior animals.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that the wrong recommendations were made to the Department by the board of the cattle advisory committee.  I appeal to the Minister to reconstitute that board and to ensure that the small farmers along the western seaboard are represented on the new board because they are a formidable group in the agricultural community.</P>
    <P>A high percentage of bulls in the New Zealand young progeny testing today are non-pedigree and we can see the important role New Zealand is playing in world beef production.  The New Zealand agricultural authorities would not introduce this type of progeny testing for bulls which are not pure bred were it not that they are very suitable for beef production. I ask the Minister to give recognition to the appeals of the groups representing the small farmers in the west.</P>
    <P>The milk quota problems will give rise to major problems and there will be a switch from milk to beef.  Consequently there will be a very heavy demand for beef breeds on AI stations.  We must remember that it costs £11.50 per AI service.  This fee will be a considerable strain on the income of small farmers in disadvantaged areas.  In my view, when there is a monopoly the charge will not remain at £11.50; it will be nearer £20 in a very short time.  I am afraid this could have a very serious effect on the quality of the animal and on the amount of cattle production in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>I ask the Minister to bear in mind the facts I have outlined and to include a clause in the Bill which would make it <Col N="870" /> possible for the farmers in the disadvantaged areas to retain for breeding purposes in their herd a three-quarter bred animal of the strain I have mentioned. This would be in accord with the regulations as laid down in Directive 77/504.  If it is acceptable under the EC regulations, surely it should be acceptable to our Minister and our Government.  If the Minister cannot yield to the request I have made to him, at least he should reintroduce the AI subsidy for cattle breeders in the disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisGallagher" hpid="Mr. D. Gallagher Mr. D. Gallagher">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Gallagher</NameTxt>
      <P>We on this side of the House accept in principle what is proposed in this Bill.  We all recognise the importance of agriculture and the importance of having a good strain of cattle.  We should concentrate on having the best breeds provided in order to gain the maximum benefit for our economy and for agriculture in general.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that the Bill deals only with the abolition of scrub bulls.  In legislation since the State was founded it was illegal to have scrub bulls.  The Department dealt with that fairly efficiently.  The scheme dealing with Department bulls, as they were known, will now be abolished and the system which operated in the poorer areas will be hit fairly drastically because of the proposals in this Bill. We are all aware of what happened in relation to the provision of Department bulls as they were commonly known. Departmental officials and inspectors went to various shows and selected bulls which were suitable for the backward areas.  That scheme worked very well.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the proposed legislation in future only pure bred animals will be available.  It will be almost impossible for the person who provided the service for the local farming community to avail of pure bred animals, desirable as they may be.  These animals will be very costly. First there will be the initial cost of purchasing the animals and because of the fact that they are pure breds it will cost a great deal more to have them properly maintained and fed.  The system which worked very effectively down through <Col N="871" /> the years will be abolished as a result of this Bill.</P>
    <P>In the more backward areas the farming community are very limited in the type of cattle they can rear on their holdings. In the main they are confined to Herefords, Shorthorns and Aberdeen Angus.  They concentrated on these breeds because they knew they could rear those animals in conditions which would not be suitable for pure bred stock.  I can see tremendous difficulties for small farmers.  I do not know, but it may be possible to have the breeds I mentioned provided in pure bred stock.  I hope it will, but it will be very difficult for small farmers in the west to maintain them.</P>
    <P>We should not lose sight of the fact that the small farmers in the west contribute a great deal towards providing store cattle for the farmers in the midlands.  If we discourage that valuable work which has been done, we will prevent them from providing beef cattle in the areas where the land is suitable for them to put on the necessary weight.  Some of the continental breeds have been crossed fairly successfully with the breeds I mentioned. Charolais-Hereford crosses have produced quite a good animal.  I see problems in the practical operation of this Bill.  I am not sure that it will be as easy to operate it as the legislation suggests.</P>
    <P>I want to impress on the Minister the importance of trying to maintain the <i>status quo</i> in relation to breeding styles which have worked very well for us down through the years.  In general, farmers realise that when they produce an animal at a mart unless it is a quality animal they will not get the price they desire.  They realise that there is no point in having animals which are not of the correct weight to get the best price.</P>
    <P>The milk levy was also mentioned. Unfortunately for some of the small farmers in my part of the world, we were rather slow in getting into milk in comparison with other parts of the country.  This means people find it difficult to take off, and they have to concentrate on rearing beef cattle.  As I said, this work has been done successfully by the Department <Col N="872" /> over the years in the small farming areas. I hope the Minister and the Department will not be too restrictive in the implementation of this Bill.</P>
    <P>The AI services have done a worthwhile job.  The service which had been provided for farmers in the small farm area would be hindered as a result of this Bill.  We hope that a monopoly will not be created and prices for AI services increased to the extent that small farmers will be penalised again.  Will the Minister consider the possibility of trying to maintain the position that exists at the moment in relation to providing the service which the small farmers are accustomed to and make subsidies available for pure bred animals to people who are prepared to continue to provide this service?  Consideration should also be given to the possibility of introducing a maintenance allowance to assist farmers to get this scheme off the ground.  From the practicable point of view a lot of obstacles will have to be faced.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to be flexible in his approach and to try to maintain the service that has worked well over the years.  The Department are to be complimented on their efforts to facilitate small farmers in providing bulls of a suitable calibre up to now.  While it is important to follow EC regulations, I often get the impression that we go overboard in trying to be good Europeans while other countries carry on in their own way.  What has worked well for us should be maintained and we should do nothing in this Bill to curtail the work the Department have been doing in helping the small farmers in the west of Ireland.</P>
    <Speaker pid="IvanYates" hpid="Mr. Yates Mr. Yates">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Yates</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not intend to speak on this Bill because I had thought it would be a formality and that it would pass very quickly.  However, nearly every Deputy who has spoken, except the Minister, has opposed it or expressed reservations.  It is essential that a speaker from the east coast speaks up in relation to the commonsense of this Bill.  I welcome and support this Bill.  We are dealing with the principle of quality control related to genetic merit.  If we were discussing in <Col N="873" /> the form of an industrial debate here, the role of the IIRS in quality control would be of importance and there would be no special feeling for small businesses in that context.  Since October 1982, when the effective working of the 1925 Act was abolished with the abolition of the bull licensing system, there has been an open situation whereby people can use any bulls they like.  That is not acceptable from a quality point of view.  If we look at the strategic and vital importance of the cattle industry to the overall economy we must be resolute in ensuring that we have the highest quality possible.  The latest trends in food production show that quality is at a premium.  We have seen the operation of quotas in relation to the super-levy for milk.  We are likely to see the same in relation to beef and grain.  If we put restrictions on quantity there will always be a premium on quality.  Not only because farmers will be rewarded for it should this be done, but we must remember that it pays to follow pedigree lines and not only because all the data from the beef classification scheme has suggested that there is lower carcase quality with inferior breeding: if we look at the area of conversion feed ratios or the area of dairy yields per cow and compare Irish and European averages, we will see that underlying all of this is the need to breed better to have quality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Bill which controls bulls for breeding purposes based on quality deserves the utmost support of this House.  Whatever about Irish farmers, the most important people are the people who buy our products &mdash; the West German consumers, the Italian consumers and so on.  They have clearly laid down their requirements in relation to lean meat.  It is appropriate that the consumer dictates developments on the farm.  It may seem insignificant that since October 1982 there has not been full enforcement in this area, but breeding by its nature is such that there is always a time lag.  If the Department were to take a very relaxed attitude over a period we would see a deterioration in the quality of the national herd, especially in suckler and beef herds that are so essential for our ultimate quality beef <Col N="874" /> products.  When we consider these minority objections we must realise that we cannot throw the baby out with the bath water and that hard cases make bad law. If the Department were to relent under the pressure of certain people in disadvantaged areas and certain Deputies in this House, it would be to the overall detriment of the breeding policy and of a vital national industry.</P>
    <P>A far more contentious area relates to the question of the AI subsidy.  This used to operate at £5 per insemination per cow and it was subsidised 50 per cent by the Department and 50 per cent by European funding.  That was abolished here this year but it still operates in Northern Ireland at £3 per head and therefore affects our competitiveness.  If we wish to recognise the vital role that AI has played in our agricultural sector in regard to progeny testing &mdash; hard work that often went unpaid &mdash; the subsidy should be maintained at £3 per insemination.  It is unfortunate that this Bill, which tightens up on the quality of breeding, should coincide with the abolition of the AI subsidy. When I was a farmer buying store cattle I would buy only black white head bullocks because they were pure Friesian and pure bred Herefords crossed.  If we do not support AI there is no doubt that we are only giving lip service to quality control.  It is very important that the subsidy be brought back at £3 per head.</P>
    <P>In relation to the Sneem representatives and other Deputies, they mentioned that there are 100,000 dairy and suckler herds where problems will arise because of this Bill.  They have said that the owners of these herds are unable to afford a bull, that they do not have a telephone to contact the AI man, that the heat detection is such that it is not suitable for AI and that they have to have a bull which they cannot afford.  Hard cases make bad law but if there is a problem here there is ample scope within section 3 (1) of this Bill, where it says:</P>
    <P>The Minister may, in prescribed circumstances and on payment of the prescribed fee, grant to a person a permit authorising the person to have in his possession an unregistered bull subject <Col N="875" /> to and in accordance with such conditions as may be specified in the permit.</P>
    <P>Registered bulls must be in the herd book and therefore they must be pure-bred or pedigree.  If they are not I suggest that in the first year of the operation of the Act the Minister should issue permits for one year, on a transitional basis only, to cover disadvantaged cases.  It would be entirely improper to have one rule for disadvantaged areas and another for the national herd.  When issuing permits for unregistered bulls the Minister should take account of a very small minority who might suffer indisputable hardship.</P>
    <P>Many Deputies who spoke early in the debate uttered a lot of nonsense.  For instance, we heard scurrilous criticism of the Cattle Advisory Committee.  That committee represents every section of the industry &mdash; exporters, the IFA, the ICMSA, ACOT, the Pedigree Council which represent 14 breeding societies and the county committees of agriculture. The Cattle Advisory Committee is therefore fully representative and to say otherwise is blatantly untrue and unfair.  If some people had uttered their criticisms through farmers' organisations perhaps this could have been avoided.</P>
    <P>Indeed because the Cattle Advisory Committee is so representative I should have liked to have seen a section in the Bill to give the Minister greater powers, through Ministerial order, to enforce other recommendations put forward by the committee.  That could relate to the beef classification scheme or other matters such as health or new breeds of imported bulls.  The Minister should have power to act expeditiously on recommendations of the committee.  This should be reconsidered on Committee Stage.</P>
    <P>The role of the herd societies has been the subject of the most scurrilous references during the debate.  Deputies have suggested that these societies are seeking to establish a monopoly.  I have heard it suggested outside the House that there might be some manipulation of recording in the herd book.  That is totally improper.  Deputy O'Malley referred to <Col N="876" /> anglophobia in relation to herd societies who are alleged to have connections in high places in relation to the Spring show. When people do not like farmers who are expressing a view for the betterment of agriculture based on quality they call them ranchers.  Herd society members are very dedicated people.  Last month I met a member of the Dorset Horn Sheep Breeding Society.  He had dedicated all his life to the society and had not made any money from it.  He had done it because of respect for and interest in the breed, not from financial consideration.</P>
    <P>It could be construed from some of the debate that the effect of the Act will be to withdraw the Department from the regulation of bulls and replace them by the herd societies, purely for financial reasons.  My understanding is that in 1982, when Fianna Fáil abolished bull licensing, there had been trouble with enforcement.  There may be trouble with enforcement but the Cattle Advisory Committee should give every assistance to herd societies from the point of view of manpower and recording in the vital role they will have to play.</P>
    <P>In 1984 applications for registration totalled 6,461 of which 11 per cent, 729, were rejected.  However, 527 were accepted on re-application.  That is most peculiar because people who had applied first and were refused were accepted with the same animal later.  Therefore, perhaps there is a need for monitoring by the Cattle Advisory Committee, not to override the activities of the herd societies but to assist them, and it far more preferable that they do it rather than the Garda.</P>
    <P>I suggest that criticism of the alleged monopoly depends on the bull sales Deputies have been attending.  Bulls bought off farms are not making much more than what they would make if sold for slaughter purposes.  Anything over and above carcase value that they have made has been related purely to their quality.  There is no doubt that the AI system will keep a balance on any alleged monopoly but it must be remembered that the breeding and herd societies are not looking for a monopoly.  They are <Col N="877" /> trying to ensure that the quality of the national herd will be improved.  What the societies have been trying to do is to explain to farmers, as ACOT and other advisory groups have been trying to do, that if you breed better you will get a better return because you will have a better carcase &mdash; there will be higher quality leaner meat.  There is no doubt that the market is the best communicator to farmers.  What is being spoken of here is quality enforcement.</P>
    <P>I regret that some people have sought to put the needs of a minority before the national interest in this matter.  Far greater issues are at stake, including the national herd.  Our greatest problem in the cattle trade has been the dwindling of the beef herd from 541,000 to 440,000 in 1983.  We have a potential of at least half a million head of cattle.  This is where there is hope for growth in GNP and extra jobs in the added value food sector. Our policy must be to reverse the trend. Many countries, whether third countries or Canada, where we have trade surpluses are only looking for an excuse to get out of those deals, and if we give them an excuse because of inferior carcases or antibiotic residues, they will be only too quick to use that to welch on deals.  If we are to boost our national herd we must look at stocking loans, the rescue package and the whole cow disease eradication scheme.  That is where the real wealth creation argument is.  The time of this House would better be served in dealing with those issues and ensuring that there are proper incentives to expand the national herd rather than dealing with a simple Bill based upon quality control. This bill should have the full support of this House, because it will ultimately ensure production of Irish cattle of the highest quality.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism (Mr. M. Moynihan)</NameTxt>
      <P>At the outset, while I agree in principle that this legislation is necessary to improve the quality of our cattle and advance our export trade in beef and beef products, along with other <Col N="878" /> Deputies from the western seaboard or the severely handicapped areas, I have serious reservations in relation to its application being in the best interest of these communities.</P>
      <P>As the previous Deputy has said, there are in excess of 111,000 farmers with herds of less than 20 cattle.  For a number of them, that would be a very high cattle rating and substantial numbers have ten and less than ten.  There is worry and anxiety among farmers operating in that economic climate.  Many people may not realise that when one is farming at the tip of one of the peninsulas stretching from Donegal to Cork, extending into the Atlantic, telephone services are vital for the implementation of the AI scheme, as there is often a round trip of 100 miles to be covered.  The difficulties that that type of small farmer will be facing with the use of pedigree bulls only must be realised.</P>
      <P>In section 3 of this Bill the Minister has what is necessary to meet the requirements of these disadvantaged areas, that is, the issuing of a permit of approval, subject to inspection, of a non-pedigree animal suitable to the area and the economics of the farmers in those locations. That will be in no way detrimental to the interests of farmers and stockholders generally who will accept, in their own best interests, the conditions laid down in this legislation.</P>
      <P>Having regard to the individual farmers and to the different organisations which have pleaded with the Minister and with committees of agriculture and others in relation to these matters, these people are very genuine, dedicated and committed to the advancement and development of our cattle business in the smaller and severely handicapped areas.  These people are not advocating and never have advocated the use of scrub bulls or such animals as would be detrimental to the development of our cattle trade.  They are genuinely concerned that if the necessary provision is not made, this legislation will have a severe impact on them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We must recognise that within the severely handicapped and disadvantaged areas a high standard of stock has been maintained at tremendous effort and <Col N="879" /> sacrifice, the herds being built up by individuals, families and communities over the years.  I remind the Minister that there is nothing unreasonable or in conflict with the best interests of the cattle trade in these areas in what these people are legitimately seeking.  If the Bill goes through without allowing for a permit for the use of non-pedigree bulls in certain specified areas of the severely handicapped sector this would have a detrimental effect on the total development there.</P>
    <P>These people are making a worthwhile contribution to finding a way to follow the best interests of the cattle trade as a whole, taking account of their severe handicap in the implementation of the cattle and suckler schemes in their area. I urge the Minister, on Committee Stage, to indicate an expansion of section 3 to provide adequately for what these people are seeking.  They ask for the granting of approval under a departmental or ACOT inspector for the use of non-pedigree bulls.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DonalCarey" hpid="Mr. Carey Mr. Carey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Carey</NameTxt>
      <P>I also wish to speak on this Bill.  The heat generated in my constituency by its publication has highlighted the differences between the various farming areas.  On the one hand, those with good, substantial herds welcome this Bill in so far as these farmers have always used pedigree bulls and they see this Bill as an improvement on the current position.  However, as previous speakers have outlined, there are problems in the disadvantaged areas, in particular with regard to the small farmer.  Deputy Yates spoke of these as being a minority in terms of cattle numbers, but in terms of social effect and dependency, they are greater in number.  I should like the Minister to turn his mind to the needs of these people on Committee Stage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As the Minister, Deputy Moynihan, suggested, there is an advantage in giving the small farmer in the disadvantaged areas protection.  These can be designated under the terms of this Bill.  Some accommodation can be reached, whether by way of a transition period or of a pilot <Col N="880" /> scheme for transition into this Bill.  The Bill will be very good for the national herd, but the Minister should take into account that there will be a considerable cycle before the full effects are felt.  There could be a lapse of ten years.  These changes of a fundamental nature are necessary, especially if we are to keep up our export trade which is so vital to our needs.</P>
    <P>I appeal to the Minister to favourably consider the plight of those in the disadvantaged areas.  Every time progressive legislation comes up, the weak position of the small under-capitalised farmers is highlighted.  This additional cost factor, which will follow on the changeover from non-pedigree to pedigree bulls, is of vital interest to their industry.  I support the Minister on this Bill, but appeal to him to consider the small farmer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MadeleineTaylorQuinn" hpid="Mrs. Taylor-Quinn Mrs. Taylor-Quinn">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. Taylor-Quinn</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very important that this Bill should be brought before the House.  In October 1982, when the Minister made an announcement of the discontinuation of the licensing of bulls, I was surprised and disappointed by that move being made at that time.  It could not be anything but detrimental to the quality of our cattle.  I welcome the Bill with a certain amount of reservation. Like Deputy Carey, I come from the mainly disadvantaged area of County Clare.</P>
      <P>A lot can be done to improve the terms of the Bill on Committee Stage.  I am not satisfied that a monopoly should be given over to the various breeding societies.  It is important that there be an input by the Department of Agriculture and that the inspectors who operated in the past be re-employed to work in conjunction with the breeding societies.  In the long term I do not think it would be in our best interests that breeding societies be given a monopoly in the licensing of bulls.  I understand that the Department of Agriculture will establish an advisory council but for the system to be effective we must have inspectors working in conjunction with breeding societies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>One must consider the number of pedigree bulls available at present.  When <Col N="881" /> the Bill is passed the high demand for such animals will result in an inflated price being asked.  There is room for improvement in that regard and the Minister should consider having a transition period of four or five years and introduce the terms of the Bill gradually.  To introduce its provisions immediately would mean that small farmers would face enormous costs.  Many of them would be in severe financial difficulty and would be hindered in their development plans.  The Minister must consider the licensing of half and three-quarter bred bulls which were licensed in the past, particularly for beef breeding herds. There is need for improvement in that area.  The general approach of the Bill in the long term is good but to introduce its provisions in one fell swoop would be unwise, particularly in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>There has been a lot of opposition to the provisions of the Bill in County Clare. The county committee of agriculture have informed me that at their meeting on 11 February they decided unanimously not to support its terms.  It is the view of the committee that the reintroduction of bull licensing will not be in the interest of farmers in the west.  The committee point out that the cost of pedigree bulls is outside the scope of many small farmers.  I agree with the provision in regard to cost.  There are many different strands involved in agriculture and while the provisions of the Bill may be suitable for certain areas they do not suit the disadvantaged areas.  The Minister should consider that on Committee Stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MattBrennan" hpid="Mr. M. Brennan Mr. M. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. M. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Many farmers in my constituency have suckling herds and I have no doubt that because of the super levy many more will have such herds. It will be difficult for such farmers to purchase pure bred bulls when the provisions in the Bill are implemented.  They should be given some aid to enable them to run a bull with their herd.  We must endeavour to breed the best cattle for our markets.  Today I learned that the market is worth £1,500,000.  Many cattle are <Col N="882" /> exported and it is important that they are of top quality.  I suggest to the Minister that he reintroduce a subsidy to enable farmers to purchase bulls.  Under the special term bull scheme which operated some years ago a farmer was given a grant towards the cost of purchasing a bull. When that scheme was in operation farmers were breeding cattle recommended by the Department.  Until we return to that system it will be hard for small farmers who run a bull with suckling cows to keep up to the necessary standard.</P>
      <P>We export cattle to Europe and outside the Community and for that reason we must have the best quality bulls.  I am proud that the AI service in my constituency is such a good one.  However, some farmers who have large suckling herds cannot avail of that service.  The Minister should make a special arrangment for them.  Unfortunately, our beef herd has dwindled in recent times.  It is up to us to ensure that we get the best breeds for our export markets.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AvrilDoyle" hpid="Mrs. A. Doyle Mrs. A. Doyle">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. A. Doyle</NameTxt>
      <P>A national breeding programme for cattle is essential.  It is in the nation's interest that the Bill receive the full support of the House.  Agriculture accounts for 25 per cent of our total exports.  I do not have to remind Members that we are a net exporting country and our cattle exports represent 19 per cent of the total of agricultural exports. It is in our interest to ensure that the quality of the cattle we produce meets the demands of the market and rewards the producer.  The effect of the Bill will be to repeal the Livestock Breeding Act, 1925, under which 7,000 bulls were visually inspected annually.  Over the years the change in demands of the industry was reflected by the change in the type of bull for which licences or permits were issued.  In the seventies there was such a demand for the continental type of bull, such as the Charolais and Simmental, that the number of pedigree bulls did not meet the requirements, with the result that cross-bred quality bulls were licensed. The need to breed specific products for a specific market was recognised.  The continental cattle were producing the <Col N="883" /> leaner type carcases.  At that stage the Hereford had been run down but that has since been redressed.</P>
      <P>Under the 1925 Act two rounds of visual inspection were required annually with two possible appeal rounds.  They were all carried out before a certain date at 400 different centres.  That, together with the annual comb out for unlicensed bulls, was a very expensive system with a net cost to the Exchequer of £160,000 annually.  In 1982 the Government decided to drop the scheme and cease the licensing of bulls.  In my view that was a dastardly mistake from the long term economic standpoint.  It was a false economy measure of the worst type.  With no restrictions from then on in the use of bulls we are now witnessing the results with a rapid decrease in quality.  That can be seen at our marts.</P>
      <P>Bearing in mind that 80 per cent of our beef output is exported, the disastrous economic consequences are obvious.  To be competitive in this market where we have great natural advantages we must use the best genetic material available and continue to select the most superior bulls to breed.  That is what the Bill is all about.</P>
      <P>This Bill will not be without its problems for certain sections of our farming community even though it is in the greater national interest.  It is in the overall good.  I have often said on farming and agricultural issues before that one could draw a line down the Shannon, but that which suits east of the Shannon will not suit west of the Shannon.  We are practically two countries when it comes to agricultural issues and this one before us today is no different.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Heat detection in suckler cows for AI is extremely difficult.  This factor, coupled with a situation in which many suckler cows are impossible to handle &mdash; they roam our mountains wild for the greater part of their existence and are impossible to handle from an AI point of view &mdash; will cause real problems for the small suckler herd owner in particular.  The larger man, perhaps, can more easily justify the economics of a pedigree bull <Col N="884" /> to run with his herd.  At present the small suckler herds have unlicensed bulls ranging in type from the reasonable to good conformation cross-breed to the scrub. These farmers perhaps initially will need help in relation to the purchase of a pedigree bull.  However, these bulls are freely available from £800 to £1,200. Prices quoted are often those reflecting the top price at a show and bear little relationship to the average price.  The bull can then be sold on at the end of each season so that no money is tied up for an undue length of time.  All breeds have bulls in the three figure sums.  If any farmer in any part of the country experiences difficulty in this regard the breed societies have offered to help find a bull at a reasonable cost and of good conformation.  The economics are sound even for the small suckler herd owner and even though initially they may be sceptical.  A good bull with a small suckler herd will increase the profitability and decrease the necessity for subsidy.  It is in everybody's interest to ensure a smooth transition from the present situation to that envisaged in the Bill.  Traditionally the value of a pedigree bull for crossing for commercial cattle was equivalent to the price of three bullocks; now it is equivalent to the price of one bullock.</P>
    <P>With the advent of the super-levy we shall see greater specialisation on dairy farms.  The Holstein has a role to play in herds of 1,200 gallons per cow and upwards only.  Its conformation from a beef point of view is disastrous.  We are unique in this country in that 80 per cent of our beef is produced from our dairy herds &mdash; we have no specialisation.  It is vital to encourage more suckler beef production, ensuring it can be done economically, unlike the situation obtaining. It is proposed now to subsidise to the tune of £70 per suckler cow in disadvantaged areas.  Serious consideration must be given to extending this scheme to the whole country based on the sound theory that an increase in the quality of the product, namely, beef, will give a greater return to the producer which in turn will <Col N="885" /> allow for an overall decrease in subsidisation on account of the independent viability of the operation.  The surplus of liquid milk in the community must be used to increase our beef herd and to maximise the benefits therefrom.  We must also exploit research on twinning and embryo transfers.  The day on which we shall see twin calves from virtually every cow in the country is not too far distant.  The research has been done, the technology is available.  It is a road we must travel and travel fast to ensure we benefit from the situation and from scientific research.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that our national herd numbers are increased.  Our cattle population in 1984 was up marginally on that of 1983 at a figure of 2,069,500.  81,900 herds have beef cows, 70 per cent of those beef cow herds are located in disadvantaged areas.</P>
    <P>The abolition of the AI subsidy is to be regretted.  This, together with the super-levy I have mentioned, will cause a decline in the usage of AI.  Apart altogether from the visual examination and herd book status AI bulls are all progeny tested with the milk board inseminating one-third of the cows in the country.  The option of allowing the usage of quality half-bred or three-quarter bred bulls is not available as regulation is impossible. The breed societies would have no responsibility or function nor would the Department of Agriculture have any regulatory role to play.  In any case we can never justify the suggestion that we should decrease our genetic material any further in view of the vital economic importance of the cattle industry to this country.  If we want to maximise profit from the beef industry for our economy farmers must be rewarded for the production of quality in the future.  They will have to be rewarded for producing a specific product for what is mainly an export market.  Indeed the product must be produced from our meat processing industry.  There is much talk from time to time about the amount of cattle exported on the hoof.  There is tremendous room for improvement in the value-added area in this country for further vacuum packing and beef processing <Col N="886" /> generally and for small products.  Anything we can do to encourage the production of the right product for this industry must be done.  This Bill does just that. Third World countries are valuable clients of this industry, as instanced by the announcement of the last day or two but, to date, they have been less than particular about quality as a result of which standards have declined.</P>
    <P>All the farming organisations support this Bill in its entirety, as it has the greater economic interest of the nation at heart.</P>
    <P>The consequences of the super-levy have not been sufficiently appreciated by all sections of the community.  In Wexford alone 112 dairy farmers have no quota at all and, in theory, can be caught for a levy on every gallon produced. These are progressive farmers who were advised by ACOT over the last few years to get into milk, who have invested heavily in an industry for which this country has a natural advantage.  Is it not the philosophy of the EC that we concentrate industries in areas of greatest natural advantage?  I thought it was; perhaps I was mistaken.  What are the options now open to such farmers?  Suckling must be one of the options if the economics of this operation could justify it.  The surest method of achieving sound economics in a suckling operation is to produce high quality store and beef animals from our cows with the conformation and growth rate which will yield acceptable returns. The ability to make rapid economic growth with a good food conversion rate is an important characteristic of cattle and is hereditable.  This quality will have to be rewarded and reflected in the market price.  It is my view that lack of reward for quality constitutes the greatest drawback to the proper development of this critically important industry which contributes 19 per cent of the nation's total exports and which, in 1984, yielded £800 million to this economy.</P>
    <P>The various cattle improvement schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture and through the county committees of agriculture have twin objectives alongside which this Bill <Col N="887" /> can stand.  These objectives are increasing milk yields and the production of high quality store and fat stock for the home and export trades.  Increased milk yields should be confined now to the efficient farmer optimising his situation.  Other dairy farmers who, through inefficiency, age or whatever, should be encouraged to get out and leave the job to those who can do it best.  The milk cessation scheme has this objective in mind but with the price conferred on milk quotas, with the advent of the super-levy, the economic effectiveness of this scheme in its present form is, at best, questionable.</P>
    <P>The second objective of producing high quality stores and beef forms the basis of this Bill.  That the overall economic good is served by the provisions of this Bill is in no doubt.  However, there will be problems encountered, particularly in the case of the five to ten suckler cow herd man.  I have no doubt that what suits most of the country in relation to this subject will not suit some others, particularly those in our disadvantaged areas.  This can be examined.  I am sure the interim transition problem can be resolved reasonably.</P>
    <P>In general this is a very important Bill which will stand us in good stead for generations to come and I support it. Perhaps it is a case of being saved from ourselves.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelKeating" hpid="Mr. Keating Mr. Keating">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keating</NameTxt>
      <P>This is one of an increasing number of regulatory-type measures which have come before this House during the last couple of years.  Taken in isolation, they may not appear to be very significant but their general effect is to introduce detailed regulations into minute areas of commercial activity and societal behaviour in some cases which, taken together, form a pattern of a very major commitment by the State to ordering the affairs of commerce and society. I wonder if anyone is taking the overall view of what the effect will be when the Government of the day are faced with an enormous array of regulations and legislation, EC and domestic, all of which <Col N="888" /> have to be policed and many of which may be unnecessary.</P>
      <P>In this case, I am struck by the fact that a few weeks ago this House was regulating the right of people to grow and sell potatoes.  We are now talking about bulls for breeding and it does not seem to matter whether the person concerned is a major entrepreneur in that field; these regulations govern everybody.  Regardless of the size of the enterprise, people are expected to conform to a common denominator which is pitched well above the small man in that area.  Concern has been voiced in this regard and there is a feeling that a substantial, vocal, articulate and influential group of breeders have managed somehow to persuade the Department that a Bill needed to be introduced to control this area of activity.</P>

      <P>The perception is there although whether it is true is another matter.  I know that some groups believe that if you are in business in a small way, you must conform or get out.  I am not saying that view is necessarily correct but it exists.  At some stage the hundreds of regulations and all the legislation which is introduced annually, to which people are expected to conform, should be viewed in terms of their impact on economic activity and the nature of government in society.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Department of Agriculture should not be there mainly to serve farmers but should have equal concern for the consumer.  The interests of the consumer in any agricultural debate are very rarely raised.  The outcome of much of the agricultural legislation with which we deal is very seldom evaluated in terms of its effects on the consumer.  The Department of Agriculture does not exist solely for farmers although, listening to some farmers' leaders and various Ministers for Agriculture over the years, one could be forgiven for believing that what was good for farmers was automatically good for the consumer and the country.  I question that because, in 1982, we spent £905 million of public <Col N="889" /> funds on agriculture without insisting, as we would in the industrial area, that every penny of that expenditure was qualified by obliging the recipients to comply with public policy and pursuit of excellence with better breeding, without having to legislate or bludgeon people into that area of excellence.  We should use public resources to ensure that that policy is brought about because the millions of pounds spent on agriculture is raised from the taxpayer and no distinction is made between the PAYE worker and the farmer.  The consumers should have a voice in ensuring that their interests are heard in this discussion.</P>
    <P>In 1983, a sum of £1,121 million was spent on agriculture.  The figure for 1984 was £1,213 million and this year's Estimate is £1,393 million, an enormous sum of money.  I bow to the superior expertise of many Members of the House in this respect but I am far from convinced that we have taken seriously the potential and the opportunity which that expenditure allows in shaping agricultural policy and bringing about improved standards in every sector of agriculture, which need every inducement possible to reach that standard of excellence.  The way to achieve that may not necessarily be the introduction of regulatory Bills, the enforcement of which, if precedent is anything to go by, will be more honoured in the breach than in the observance.  I do not know how it can be enforced and I am not sure if anybody else knows either. We should have concern for that when we increasingly introduce these relatively minor regulatory Bills which do not leave themselves open to easy enforcement.</P>
    <P>I wish to voice one or two specific concerns which have not been put forward so far.  I wish to draw the attention of the Minister of State to a group, the Sneem Development Co-Operative, who put forward a very reasoned view in relation to this legislation.  Among the points they made was that the Bill generally tended towards furthering monopolies and I do not think it should be the business of the Government to do that because of the clear danger that arises <Col N="890" /> from the possibility of the abuse of monopolistic powers in this or any other area. They made the point that a monopoly would have very serious implications for the huge number of farmers with less than 20 cows because their income would not enable them to compete in regard to pedigree bulls.  It is clear that that makes good sense.  If you are a small man, there is a risk of being excluded from access. Perhaps there is an answer and I should be glad to hear it.</P>
    <P>The monopoly which the Bill could encourage for pure bred bulls and very substantial gains for breeders of these animals is something which the House should take seriously.  I hope that the suggestion by this group, who have a reasoned and moderate approach, will be taken up.  They suggest that a clause should be inserted that in disadvantaged areas pedigree and quality non-pedigree bulls could be used.  If that suggestion was adopted it might mean that people could be disabused of the perception that this Bill is about ensuring a monopoly for big breeders.  I recommend that to the Minister for his consideration.</P>
    <P>At some stage, the House must consider the growing impact of State involvement and regulation of an increasingly wide and comprehensive range of commercial activity.  In the last few months, this House has involved itself in regulating commercial air transport, potato growers, breeding bulls and unmentionable items last week.  The total view may very well be in direct contrast with what is happening abroad where deregulation is the norm and where private enterprise is allowed to flourish and is assisted by the State.  Public funds are spent to create an environment in which people can prosper and the State does not feel obliged to control almost every area of human behaviour and commercial activity.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BrendanDaly" hpid="Mr. Daly Mr. Daly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Daly</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to delay the Bill unduly and most of the points relating to this measure have already been adequately discussed here.  I acknowledge the principle behind the legislation, to improve the quality and standard of livestock.  We all support this principle.  I <Col N="891" /> have had representations from the farming organisations, the IFA and the Milk Suppliers Organisation in my constituency who feel that the Bill will present problems for small farmers and herd owners in remote and disadvantaged areas.  Deputy Noonan has already suggested ways in which the legislation could be improved and areas which the Minister might look at to see how problems which farmers may have under the legislation can be minimised.</P>
      <P>I am aware that in the past the Department, through the agricultural committees and local ACOT services; provided a limited facility in certain areas whereby pedigree bulls were made available.  The scheme was very effective and popular. It was widely availed of and it was very successful during the period in which it was in operation.  The Department identified quality bulls in the Spring Show and other shows, purchased them and made them available at a subsidised rate to farmers.  I am not sure if it is desirable to go back to that position but unless some solution is found this legislation will present problems especially for those in the areas I have mentioned.  If the Minister can go part of the way to meet the situation some of the complaints we have had about the effect of the legislation in severely handicapped and disadvantaged areas might be overcome.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have had representations from the farming organisations in Clare.  In Clare we have the shorthorn breed which is a dual purpose breed and is highly successful. Many of the farmers in my constituency are mixed farmers and do not specialise in either milk or beef.  They need a breed which meets their dual requirements.  As the Minister is fully aware, because of the crisis in the dairy industry and because many farmers are seriously worried about the prospect of getting a return for milk, many farmers, especially in my constituency, are considering extending into beef, an area in which they have not been traditionally involved.  The farming organisations are concerned that this legislation will affect our unique position in Clare.  I hope there <Col N="892" /> will be no adverse effects on the Clare shorthorn breed as a result of this legislation and I ask the Minister to see if anything can be done to protect the position of the Clare shorthorn bull.</P>
    <P>We are in favour of the principle of improving the pedigree stock.  However, we must recognise that there will be problems and hardship in some areas for those who can least afford it.  I ask the Minister to look very seriously at the alternative suggestions being put forward and try to find some solution which will sort out this minor difficulty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>It is my pleasure to welcome the Bill and I compliment the Minister for introducing it to the House. Like other speakers I feel very strongly that the regulations which existed prior to October 1982 should not have been interfered with.  Undoubtedly it had a detrimental effect on the quality of cattle. Regulations were introduced in 1985 more or less to protect us against ourselves and to try to ensure that we would breed a better type of animal and improve the quality of our livestock.  Unfortunately those regulations were changed in 1982.</P>
      <P>I welcome the introduction of this Bill. It will mean a major improvement in the quality of our livestock.  However, we must be conscious of the various problems which arose in this industry over the last few years since the change in those regulations.  It is of vital importance to the industry that every effort be made to improve the quality of our livestock.  We enjoy an excellent cattle trade at present but one of our major problems is quality. We have insufficient numbers to meet demand and the quality of our livestock is not suitable for many of our most lucrative markets.  This Bill will, over the next five years, improve the quality of our cattle industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the points I wish to make have been made already.  I noticed when looking at figures from the Department of Agriculture that from 10 per cent to 15 per cent of animals which were presented for examination prior to 1982 were rejected.  What steps will be taken by <Col N="893" /> cattle breeding societies to ensure that only quality animals are registered? Sometimes animals bred into pedigree herds are not always up to the required standard.</P>
    <P>We cannot but be impressed by the amount of money which is being channelled into the Department through the different livestock schemes, whether it is the headage scheme, cow suckler scheme, beef cow scheme or calf premium scheme.  Up to £64 million was spent under those headings in 1984.  The State is entitled to demand quality when it is spending that kind of money.  In the inspections which are carried out in relation to those schemes the sire of the calf should be clearly established to ensure that, as far as possible, all our calves are bred from pure bred stock.</P>
    <P>I welcome the Minister's decision to tighten up the regulations and increase the fines, particularly in relation to scrub bulls which are roaming the countryside. For far too long we have tolerated this type of animal and this has been to the detriment of our livestock industry.  I welcome the increase in fines in that respect but I regret that the regulations were changed because the cost of bull licensing was very worthwhile.  In the context of the overall Vote for Agriculture the amount spent on livestock breeding schemes is very small.</P>
    <P>I am asking the Minister to examine the question of what can be done in the area of new technology, particularly in the area of embryo implantation, a development for which there is a tremendous future but one on which we as an agricultural country have not concentrated sufficiently. Our cattle numbers are low and we must increase them fast if we are to increase our level of exports.  Our agricultural exports comprise approximately 25 per cent of our total exports and cattle represent about 19 per cent of that figure. In other words, the cattle industry is the motor of our economy.  We must do everything possible to increase numbers and to improve quality because otherwise we will not be able to sell on the best markets.</P>
    <P>I, too, have received representations <Col N="894" /> from people expressing concern about the introduction of this scheme and pointing to the additional cost that will accrue to small farmers.  I share that concern, but in the long term I am confident that the Bill will have the effect of bringing about a marked improvement in the quality of our cattle and that is why I support the Bill totally.  While it may cause hardship for some farmers in the first year or two of its operation, we must have regard to the industry as a whole.  We must legislate for what is in the best interest of the economy and of agriculture generally.  Unfortunately, we cannot allow specific instances or the interest of any one area to influence us.  Those of us who attend at livestock marts regularly are aware that much of our stock is of very poor quality.  I compliment the Minister on introducing the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelPKitt" hpid="Mr. Kitt Mr. Kitt">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Kitt</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the principle involved in the Bill.  I agree entirely with the last speaker that we must be concerned about the quality of our cattle but I have received representations from a number of people about some of the implications of the legislation should it be passed without amendment.  The Sneem Co-operative particularly made a very reasonable case.  The Minister should have regard for their point of view.  Many speakers have referred to the systems that have operated in the past.  Without appearing to wish to move backwards in agriculture, I suggest that we have regard to some of those schemes, especially the one whereby the Department were involved in providing farmers with pedigree bulls.  Deputy Noonan has referred to that aspect.  The scheme had much to recommend it.  However, if a return to that scheme is not possible some other arrangement might be made whereby a farmer could be subsidised in respect of a pedigree bull or a bull could be purchased by a farmer by way of easy terms instead of his having to make one large payment.  I trust the Minister will be in a position to indicate the introduction of some such scheme.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are all concerned about the quality <Col N="895" /> of our cattle, as is proper, since agriculture is our main industry.  If we are to retain our place in the market and to increase agricultural exports, we must produce first-class animals.</P>
    <P>The question of numbers is one also of great concern.  I strongly support the type of research being undertaken at Belclare near Tuam.  I have talked to the people involved in research at the institute there. They are concentrating on development in the embryo transfer area.  This is the only method of achieving a high twinning rate in beef cows.  The work being carried out at the institute by Dr. Sheenan and by Mr. Michael Diskin is very important. They have written many papers about management and the use of the twin producing procedure.  This is the type of new technology that Members of the House should be addressing themselves to.  The two gentlemen I have mentioned talk about the impact of induced twins and have stated that from the trials they have undertaken in co-operation with the North-West Cattle Breeding Society in Sligo the impact will be of great benefit to Irish agriculture and to the economy. They have calculated that induced twinning would increase revenue in the dairy herd by 12 per cent and in the beef herd by 60 per cent and I am prepared to take the word of these experts in this matter. The people I have spoken to in this regard have referred to such factors as twinning rates, calving problems and the management of the farm.  While ostensibly these people are on a nine to five day, they are so committed to their work that they remain for many hours after 5 p.m. to work on the area of management of the farm.  Their research has shown that only 50 per cent of the single-calf producing cows calve without assistance compared with 75 per cent of twin-producing cows. This shows clearly the need for proper management in agriculture and in this respect I commend very highly the work being carried on at the institute.  Perhaps at a later stage we will have the opportunity of going into this area of technology in more detail.  This Bill deals more with <Col N="896" /> the quality of the animals we are producing.</P>
    <P>I trust that the Minister will devise some way of helping farmers in the matter of purchasing pedigree bulls.  I am thinking particularly of small farmers in the west.  It is because of the difficulties that are anticipated that we have had representations from such people as those involved in the Sneem Co-operative and people who have small fragmented holdings throughout the west and who perhaps experience difficulty in regard to availing of the facility of AI stations.  I assure the Minister of our support in the principle he is adopting in this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamSkelly" hpid="Mr. Skelly Mr. Skelly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Skelly</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the Bill and I wish to emphasise the positive qualities that accrue as a result of control and discipline in this area.  Fears have been expressed on behalf of small farmers and so on that wrong is being done and monopolies are being catered for.  Generally speaking only pedigree bulls are registered. They must be proven, which means in ordinary terminology that they must be bred to carry and transmit certain characteristics.  For example, a Friesian bull can carry a milk strain which means that he should father high milk producing females and the Friesian beef strain means that he will father good beef producing progeny.  A mixed Friesian can father reasonably good milking heifers or reasonably good beef bullocks and is a popular choice.  In the beef breeds we have Charolais, Hereford, Angus and Simmental.  The Charolais and Simmental are lean, the Herefords fat and the Angus medium.  These breeds give good growth rates, good quality meat and good conformation on shape.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Pedigree bulls are often progeny tested before being put into AI service.  A number of their offspring are performance tested to ensure that the desired characteristics have been transmitted. Thus we know that these bulls can produce calves of the right quality, good stock that produces milk or grows into beef efficiently.  That means that they <Col N="897" /> gain weight and come to slaughter weight in a short time.  At the same time we look for Friesian cows which produce high gallonage of high quality milk annually.  It is only from pedigree bulls that we get that sort of stock.  Three-quarter bred or half bred are not really breeds at all.  They are like mongrels or scrub bulls and that is what these people in the Sneem Co-operative, for example, are referring to.  They are not really breeds, they are just mongrels and they cannot effectively transmit good characteristics.  What is more likely is that they give rise to high mortality at birth due to disproportionate sizes and various other characteristics.  Perhaps their hips or heads are too large.  Many problems arise at birth and they are more prone to disease in the early stages of life.  Then, of course, we must tolerate poor performance and poor production afterwards.</P>
    <P>Small breeders, be they dairy men or beef men &mdash; I refer to the suppliers &mdash; have easy and cheap access to the best bulls available through the AI service. Every AI station provides a very wide range of bulls of every breed.  They can pick what they want and they can even nominate a bull to service their pure bred cows and heifers and to breed from them. This is done cheaply and efficiently because thousands of insemination draws can be obtained per week from every bull, and that is economical.</P>
    <P>We must use pedigree bulls first, to upgrade the quality of our stock and, second, to bring about more efficient production of beef and milk &mdash; and here we are running into problems with the super-levy and so on.  The Danes, the French and the Belgians are getting over 1,000 gallons per cow whereas our average is 700 to 800 gallons per cow.  Good breeding needs more efficient productions &mdash; in other words, getting more product for the amount of food input, and we get that only by improving the breeding.  The third reason is because the survival rate at birth is better and many of these problems associated with scrubs and half breds are eliminated.  Fourth, we must halt the decline in the quality of our national herd which has resulted from using scrub bulls <Col N="898" /> over the years.  Any beef man will tell you that to get good stock is very difficult. All kind of rag bags result from mixed gatherings of cattle.  Fifth, it makes good economic sense to have good quality stock when the cost involved is considered. A one and half year old or two year old heifer will cost about £400 and the cost of keeping her for a year is £100. That year covers heat detection, insemination, pregnancy which lasts for about nine months, and a short post natal period.  Therefore, the total outlay is about £500, but she is not a heifer after she has had the calf and her value is down to probably about £350.  Therefore, you spend about £150 to get your calf.  If the cow is a Friesian then you have a good milk producing animal, but with a beef breed you are left with just a cow.  You can either breed from her again or slaughter her as a cow, but she is not worth much as a heifer for that purpose.  You have a calf worth £150, and after the whole process at those figures and that investment, why should you scrimp on the few pounds to get the AI service out and take top quality?  You will have a better quality calf and better quality produce.</P>
    <P>Dairy men using pedigree bulls will have heifers which when put in calf will give higher yields of milk, and the beef men will have stock which will grow quickly into beef cattle.  We must upgrade the quality and efficiency of our stock by using only pedigree bulls or AI.  Any other approach would seem to be economic madness.  That is the main reason why I am glad to make an intervention into this debate.  We want to see efficiency in the farming, dairying and beef areas as well as in the industrial and other sectors in the State.</P>
    <P>Finally, the implementation of these measures should bring about direct control in disease eradication.  Small farmers who had bulls would often let neighbours avail of the services of the bulls on the quiet when no pre-movement test for TB or brucellosis would be carried out before the stock were removed from their herds to the bull.  This presented a serious risk of the spread of these diseases. <Col N="899" /> Accordingly, I welcome this form of progress and encourage other Members of the House to welcome this Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture (Mr. Hegarty)</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank the Members for their interventions, which, generally speaking, were favourable to the Bill.  We have this recurring difficulty of different speakers talking about specific problems and this matter probably has taken up a great deal of the time of the Animal Advisory Council also.</P>
      <P>To recap on the debate, there is general agreement.  I will go briefly through some of the main points.  One thing that seems to be forgotten in the debate is that a bull licence system applied up to the end of 1982 and it proved to be very expensive to administer.  As I have indicated, the inspection system at current prices costs about £160,000 annually, whereas the receipts by way of licence amount to only about £4,000.  This left a net cost to the service of about £156,000 annually.  On that basis the previous Government in 1982 decided to discontinue it, and indeed we in this Government endorsed that decision.  With regard to other countries, France has no controls.  Those who know the French scene know that breeding there has been taken to the extreme. They have been so successful in breeding their own beef breeds that anything that has been even contemplated here with regard to half-breds or three-quarter breds or whatever you like to call them &mdash; they have a new name today, we were not happy about &ldquo;scrub&rdquo;, we now have &ldquo;mongrel&rdquo; which is even more offensive to the animal&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickHegarty" hpid="Mr. Hegarty Mr. Hegarty">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hegarty</NameTxt>
      <P>In Germany under their livestock breeding Act of 1976 all bulls used for breeding purposes must be licensed by the appropriate authority in each State and non-herd book registered bulls are not eligible for licence and so cannot be used for breeding purposes.  Also, in Italy only pure bred bulls are permitted <Col N="900" /> for breeding purposes.  Each country has its own national policy.</P>
      <P>There are several features unique to our national breeding population, for instance, considerable cross-breeding takes place in our cattle population and as was mentioned here today, this gives a good hybrid animal for beef purposes. In addition, about two-thirds of our national beef output comes from the Friesian cow population.  We are unique in that, and we depend on our dairy herds to provide the raw material for beef production. The cattle sector accounts for about 80 per cent of agricultural exports and 19 per cent of our total exports. About 80 per cent of our beef output and 65 per cent of our milk output is exported and this compels us to operate our own national policy in relation to breeding.  I was glad that Deputies from all sides made the point about quality.  This is what the Bill is about.  As was mentioned already, we are entering into an arena of keen competition.  Somebody said that other countries are only looking for an excuse to get us out of the market, whether on the grounds of poor quality, use of hormones or something else.  I cannot stress strongly enough that it is essential in the national interest to ensure that the quality of output from the national cattle breeding herd is capable of satisfying the demands of the market and remains competitive in the international area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested that the old system of inspection and licensing of herd book registered bulls should continue and that this is necessary to ensure quality. However, emerging EC legislation in the animal breeding area relating to recognition and operation of herd book societies and the entry of animals in herd books seeks to place primary responsibility for quality of herd book animals with the herd book societies rather than with the State.  I agree with that approach.  However, I wish to reassure the House on this point.  The EC does not leave it altogether up to herd book societies.  They have certain rules and regulations that have to be kept and a breed improvement <Col N="901" /> programme must be carried out.  Recognition can be withdrawn from a society that does not meet the criteria laid down and does not have concern for the quality of animals in their herd books.</P>
    <P>With regard to financial aids, the House will appreciate that in the prevailing budgetary situation facing the Government and the many competing demands for available resources it would not be possible to introduce any scheme to grant aid the purchase by farmers of pure bred bulls for breeding.  Neither can my Department contemplate the return to a system of inspection for licences on the lines that operated under the Livestock Breeding Act, 1925.  As many Deputies mentioned, any type of grant or subsidy usually ends up in the wrong pockets.  It is usually added to the price of the bull and it defeats its own purpose.</P>
    <P>The availability of pedigree bulls has been raised by a number of Deputies. The number of natural service bulls as shown by the Central Statistics Office has been in the range of 15,000 to 17,000 during the seventies and the eighties. Under the old Livestock Breeding Act, the number of bulls licensed each year during the same period varied from 5,500 to 7,500.  About half these bulls were Friesian and half specialised beef breeds. There has been a steady build-up in our population of continental breed pedigree cows.  The number of breeding females of our traditional beef breeds has been maintained.  I estimate that we have now about 10,000 pedigree breeding females of the beef breeds and in addition we have a substantial population of pedigree Friesian cattle.  Experience to date leads me to believe that ample supplies of pedigree bulls are available and will be available to meet likely demand.</P>
    <P>The price of pedigree herd book registered bulls was raised by a number of Deputies.  During the period of operation of the old Livestock Breeding Act up to January 1983 the price of herd book registered bulls was always quite reasonable. Of course individual bulls of exceptional quality occasionally make high prices and they receive much publicity. Also, average prices at élite sales of <Col N="902" /> selected bulls organised by breed societies tend to get publicity.  However, these are the exceptions rather than the rule.  I am satisfied that pedigree bulls of good quality can be purchased at reasonable prices and in many cases such prices are little more than the value of the bull for beef.  I do not expect that situation to change much with the introduction of the Bill.</P>
    <P>Doubts were expressed regarding the role of AI in beef suckler cow herds. While I accept that AI usage might be more difficult in some herds than in others, nevertheless it has been very successfully used in many small suckler herds.  With a little effort AI could be used in many more such herds and would be good value for money, offering a choice of breeds of top quality at a reasonable price.</P>

      <P>More than 126,000 farmers availed of the AI service in 1973 which involved a national average of more than ten inseminations per herd. Broken down by AI centres, the average number of inseminations per herdowner ranged from 5.6 to 21.5 inseminations.</P>
      <P>Many speakers referred to the use of the Garda in implementing this legislation. The inclusion of the Garda is standard for this type of measure.  It is not the intention to use the Garda in the normal course of enforcement of the provisions of the Bill.  However, experience has shown that in occasional difficult situations the support of the Garda or other enforcement officers is most desirable and for this purpose they are being given particular authority under the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some speakers referred to the severity of the penalties laid down.  Of course these are maximum amounts and it would <Col N="903" /> be a matter for the courts to fix the penalty in individual cases.

      <P>Well, they will get the grants.  Deputy Walsh referred to our &ldquo;white country&rdquo; status.  Our freedom from foot and mouth disease ensures access for our exports of livestock and livestock products to valuable third country markets in the USA, Canada and Japan, which markets are not open to original member states because of the existence of foot and mouth disease or because those States vaccinate against the disease.  When derogations were last extended in 1983 the Commission inquired of these countries &mdash; the United States, Canada and Japan &mdash; what would their reaction be towards trade with Ireland if our import controls were changed. The Commission reported that so far as live animals were concerned trade with third countries would not be affected if Ireland applied the conditions of the directive on intra-Community trade.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to fresh meat, provided a &ldquo;non-comminglement&rdquo; system was followed &mdash;<Col N="904" /> that is, a system involving the total separation at meat factories of national meat and imported meat &mdash; Ireland's trade with its third country markets would not be affected by the adoption of the conditions of the directive on intra-Community trade in meat.</P>
    <P>I would like to refer briefly to the Cattle Advisory Committee.  There seems to be some confusion about this.  The Cattle Advisory Committee is representative of 14 organisations engaged in all areas of the agricultural industry.  There are 18 representatives representing these 14 organisations.  A lot of play has been made of the fact that none of these 18 people lives in the disadvantaged areas. I think this is irrelevant.  What is important is the organisations they represent &mdash; the IFA, the ICMSA, ACOT, An Foras Talúntais, ICOS, the AI bodies, the AI Veterinary Officers' Association, CBF, the General Council of Committees of Agriculture, the Irish Meat Exporters' Association, the Irish livestock trade, University College Dublin, Faculty of Agriculture, the Pedigree Breeders' Council and the Department of Agriculture. If these bodies are not representative of the Irish cattle industry I do not know who is.  I should add that the people are nominated by the organisations; they are not picked by the Minister for Agriculture, and we have no intention of getting involved in that area.</P>
    <P>This Bill should not be viewed in isolation. It should be seen as one of the elements of the national beef breeding programme which also includes on-farm recording in pedigree herds, central performance testing and progeny testing of AI bulls.  The expenditure by the Exchequer in all these elements is of the order of £1 million annually.  As I said, the emphasis is on quality.  I do not accept the criticism of the breeders society or the advisory committee.  Over the years good breeding has proved to be the only way forward.  When people start talking hybrids they do not know what they are talking about, nor does anybody else.  As many speakers said, we should be looking ahead, not backwards.  The people with whom we are in competition are already <Col N="905" /> using embryo transplants for twinning.  I agree with Deputy Kitt when he mentioned the work being done in Belclare. That is the way ahead.  If we are to stay in that market we have to look forward to better breeding and better cattle so that our vac-pack meat can compete with that produced by the Germans and the British.  This is a very tough market.  We are now talking about meat going into intervention and only quality meat will go into intervention.  The whole scene is changing and we have to be ready to meet that situation.</P>

Dá bhrí sin tá easpa muiníne ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta féin maidir leis an obair a bheas le déanamh ag an Údarás ó tharla go bhfuil sé le tuiscint ón chaoi ina bhfuil an tAire ag pléle cúrsaí nach bhfuil dáiríreacht ná suim ar bith aige san obair atá ar siúl ag an Údarás féin.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance, if he will indicate the implied annual rate of job creation in the private services sector in the period covered by the national plan; and the comparable average figure for that period 1982-84.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes) Alan Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. Dukes)</NameTxt>
      <P>Data on job creation in the private services sector are not available.  Table 1-2 of Chapter 1 of the plan <i>Building on Reality</i> indicates that net employment in private sector services is expected to increase by 22,000 between mid-April 1984 and mid-April 1987 excluding the growth in employment arising under existing special employment schemes and the effect of new schemes.  The implied annual average rate of increase is just over 7,000 a year.  The comparable average increase in the period mid-April 1982 to mid-April 1984, when recessionary <Col N="909" /> conditions prevailed, was about 4,500 a year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister really think that 7,000 new service jobs per annum between now and 1987 is realistic considering the figure he has just given, that the figure achieved in a similar period was 4,500 per annum?  Is it realistic to say that the Government are proposing to double the number of service jobs created in the three years ahead when looking behind us we only produced 4,500 jobs per annum?  Which service areas that were not there in the previous three years does the Minister see giving the extra jobs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures are realistic if we take the annual average increase mid-April to mid-April in private service employment.  For the period 1981 to 1985 the annual average increase was 6,300. For 1982 to 1984, when we had the severe recession conditions, the annual average was 4,500.  We are projecting an annual average increase of 7,300 over the period 1984 to 1987.  We could possibly expect that the increase might be a little larger than that and indeed more optimistic projections have been made.  In <i>The Way Forward</i> published in October 1982 it was projected that employment in this category would increase by 9,750 per annum&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;on average between 1983 and 1987.  On the other hand, another relevant consideration is the fact that in the two years 1983 and 1984, when private services output increased by only 1 per cent, employment rose by 2½ per cent, implying that productivity over that period actually declined.  We have made our forecasts in the expectation that productivity would remain at its present level.  We would come out then with a figure of just over 7,000 per annum.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister say it is realistic, having regard to the impact <Col N="910" /> of the budget and Government policies, to project almost twice as much an increase in employment in the service sector in the years ahead as has been achieved in the last two years?  Is not that flying in the face of the reality on which the Government pretend to build?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  There are one or two factors which might lead one to believe that the growth in employment would actually be slightly larger than what we have projected.  I would also point out that these projections were prepared before this year's budget was put together and brought into this House and the effect of the VAT and other changes in this year's budget would be to improve the prospects.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BrianLenihanSnr" hpid="Mr. Lenihan Mr. Lenihan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lenihan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister agree that an extension of the venture capital incentives in regard to manufacturing industry to the service industry would be a practical way to achieve the targets that the Minister has in mind which cannot be achieved unless some incentive is introduced?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Strictly speaking that is a separate question as it has to do with the reason why the venture capital scheme takes the form it does.  We have improved the situation in relation to certain services over the last two years, particularly computer services, but the projection of the increase of just over 7,000 per annum was drawn up at a time when we had already brought in the venture capital scheme. For reasons which are not directly relevant to this question but which I know we will have an opportunity to discuss when we get on to the Finance Bill, I would not favour an extension of the venture capital scheme to the services area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance, if he will indicate in which specific sectors of industry he expects the forecast 14,000 new jobs envisaged in the national plan to arise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>Table 1-2 of chapter 1 of the plan, <i>Building on Reality</i> indicates that out of a total increase of 14,000 in industrial employment between mid-April 1984 and mid-April 1987, 13,000 are expected to arise in manufacturing industry.  This implies an annual average rate of increase of just under 4,500 a year, which is the mid-point of the range published in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  It is envisaged that this increase will be spread over most branches of manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister reflect on the reply given to me by the Taoiseach a few weeks ago when he told me that employment in the manufacturing sector is about 20 per cent of the available workforce?  The Taoiseach told me that that percentage had risen during the previous two years.  Considering that <Col N="912" /> to be the level of unemployment in manufacturing industry, how serious and realistic is it to be suggesting that 13,000 out of the 14,000 new jobs in the planned period will be in the manufacturing sector where there is an enormously high rate of unemployment which appears to be getting worse?  Companies are closing every day and the figure the Taoiseach gave me represents one person in every five out of work.  Perhaps the Minister could help me to reconcile that with the target, or is it now a hope, of 13,000 new jobs created in the manufacturing industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what Deputy Brennan thinks about this but if Deputy Wilson wants to obstruct the answer I suggest that the two Deputies have a chat about it.  The projection I have given is in respect of the mid-point of the employment estimate set out in the White Paper on Industrial Policy.  The range forecast in the White Paper was between 3,000 and 6,000 jobs a year.  In addition, we projected that output in manufacturing will increase by about 7½ per cent per year during the years 1985 to 1987 which, in view of the experience in the last three years, is a realistic expectation consistent with the White Paper target of doubling output during the ten years.  In addition, the projection is based on the assumption that productivity growth in 1985 to 1987 will be slightly in excess of the long term average rate of about 5 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not agree that every month we are losing jobs in the manufacturing industry?  I am sorry if the Minister will not assist me in reconciling the figures but it would seem to me we are losing jobs in manufacturing.  How then can the Minister tell the House about a target of new jobs of 13,000 in the manufacturing industry?  That is not <Col N="913" /> what is happening, so will the Minister revise that estimate to a more sensible figure?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think the Deputy is referring to the non-quota section of the Regional Fund but that would not apply to projects like this.  In any case, I think the rate of assistance of 50 per cent to 55 per cent would be a better avenue of approach than the non-quota section.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no estimate available of the revenue losses attributable to cross-Border purchases.  However, a number of measures have been taken by the Government to reduce the attractiveness of cross-Border purchases.  The reduction last year in spirits duty largely eliminated the incentive for cross-Border <Col N="917" /> purchases of spirits, which accounted for a substantial amount of these purchases. The excise duty reductions announced in the budget for televisions and motor vehicle parts and the reduction in VAT on a wide range of household items from 35 per cent to 23 per cent will also have a significant impact.</P>

      <P>In my 1983 Budget Statement, I referred to the commitment in the Programme for Government to establish a committee of inquiry on tax arrangements for small businesses, comprising the Revenue Commissioners and representatives of small business.  In the event it was not possible to accommodate all interested representative organisations on the committee and therefore I decided that it would be preferable to establish an inter-departmental working party, to examine this question.  I issued a statement on 26 April 1983 inviting submissions to the working party.

    <Col N="928" />
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister for Finance has minority shareholdings in 32 companies which do not come under the ambit of the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies.  The Minister's shareholdings in 24 of the companies arise under section 44 of the Industrial Development Act, 1969 which provides that the Industrial Development Authority may purchase or take shares in companies meeting certain criteria and that such shares shall be registered in the name of the Minister for Finance.  Of the 24 companies four have been put into receivership and five have been put into liquidation.  The Minister's shareholdings in six further companies arise from the granting of mineral exploration licences. The Minister has a minority shareholding in Dublin Gas Company Ltd. as a result of an agreement in 1983 with the company. He also has a minority shareholding in the National Theatre Society Ltd.</P>
      <P>I am sending a list of the companies to the Deputy.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeamusBrennan" hpid="Mr. S. Brennan Mr. S. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>The purpose of this question is to establish whether there is scope to include under the Joint Committee on Commercial State-Sponsored Bodies other companies in which the State has an interest and with which an all-party committee of this House should be dealing &mdash; for example, minerals, exploration licence companies and, indeed, gas.  Is there not a case for including such companies within the ambit of that committee?  The fact that there is a minority shareholding as opposed to outright State ownership should not make any major difference in that regard; it is still a State investment.  Would the Minister consider including some of those, particularly the mineral ones?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>That is perhaps a matter best left for discussion when the Deputy has seen the list of companies in which shareholdings have been taken.  Without going into detail on the information I shall be sending the Deputy, the shareholdings range from 1 per cent to 49 per cent, so he will see there is a very wide range there.  As I said in my original <Col N="929" /> reply, the shareholdings in a large number of these companies came about as a result of the provisions of the Industrial Development Act.  Others arose as a result of different Acts which had their specific functions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. S. Brennan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>The national debt figure at the end of each of the years mentioned was: 1980, £7.9 billion; 1981, £10.2 billion; 1982, £12.8 billion; 1983, £15.7 billion; 1984, £18.5 billion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister not concerned that since he came into Government the national debt has increased from £12.8 billion to £18.5 billion, an increase of almost 50 per cent? Is he not concerned that the rate of increase in the national debt in the two years since he came into Government is far in excess of the rate of increase in the national debt in the two years before he came into Government?  Finally, is he not concerned that the largest single element in the increase in the national debt in the two years since he came into Government is the increase in the foreign debt, which has gone up in the order of over £3,000 million in the last two years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I might point out to the Deputy, in case he has not had time to do the figures as yet, that the increase in the national debt, according to the figures I have given, from the end of 1980 to 1982 was £5.1 billion.</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry, £4.9 billion, and from 1982 to 1984 it was £5.7 billion. The increase is composed of a number of factors, the principal one being, first, quite clearly the annual Exchequer borrowing requirement and, second, an adjustment of the figure for debt in foreign currencies to reflect the depreciation of the Irish punt against various currencies on the date of calculation.  I might point out that this second component is an arithmetical calculation, that no loss occurs until the redemption date is reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelOKennedy" hpid="Mr. O'Kennedy Mr. O'Kennedy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Kennedy</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the pattern of the increase over the last two years in particular and of the Government's disastrous borrowing policy in dollars, would the Minister be prepared to acknowledge that at the end of this year <Col N="932" /> the figure will certainly exceed £21,000 million?  Is the Minister suggesting that these are just paper figures but are not ones that some Government at some time will have to face?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The notional figure for the exchange loss is one that may arise on the maturity date only.  The Deputy has also mentioned what he claims to be a substantial shift in policy in relation to the balance between dollars and other currencies.  The main reason for the increase in the proportion of our debt expressed in dollars over, let us say, the years 1983 and 1984 has been the strengthening of the dollar against the punt.  If no net foreign borrowing had occurred in 1983 and 1984, for example, the effect of exchange rate changes up to the end of 1984 would have been to increase the dollar proportion of our foreign debt, when expressed in punt terms, from 32 per cent to 38 per cent.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>

      <P>The Minister has chosen to say that it is not because we borrowed extra dollars, rather is it because of the appreciation of the dollar. Would the Minister not acknowledge that that, in itself, underlines the disastrous consequences of the Government's decision to borrow to the extent that they did <Col N="933" /> in dollars as distinct from EMS currencies because of the risk of appreciation?</P>

      <P>I answered a question for the Deputy on 21 February and I said in that reply that the proportion of dollars in the Exchequer foreign debt had increased from 32 per cent in 1982 to 38 per cent in 1984 while the proportion of Deutsche Marks had declined from 45 per cent to 29 per cent over the same period. As I have just indicated, a part of the influence that the change in the dollar exchange rate has had in that period has been that if no new foreign borrowing had occurred in that period there would still have been an increase in the proportion of the debt denominated in dollars, for the reason I have given, which does not produce a loss until such time as maturity comes about.  In addition to that, as I told the Deputy here, I think last May&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;in fact we borrow a greater proportion of our foreign borrowing in EMS currencies than do most of the other EMS countries.  I would invite the Deputy to reflect that when one goes borrowing one borrows in currencies that are available.  For example, there would be no point in my going out and saying that the exchange risk we will run this year will be less against the escudo than anything else if nobody was willing to lend escudos.  The Deputy has failed consistently to pay any attention to that part of the problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>The Commission, on foot of aproaches made to it following the British Government's withdrawal from the Northern Ireland gas pipeline project, has recently forwarded a proposal to the Council which, if accepted, would involve the granting, over a five-year period, commencing in 1985, of about IR£23 million in aid from the non-quota section of the European Regional Development Fund towards the supply and use of natural gas in Counties Louth, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo.</P>
      <P>This will be effected by an amendment of the regulation governing the present special Border areas programme which is due to end on 15 December 1985.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it intended to apply for money from the non-quota section of the European Fund for a special Border <Col N="936" /> fund similar to that which was available from 1981-85, inclusive?  Is the Minister satisfied that the full allocation in the present Border fund will be taken up before the end of this year?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am satisfied that the full allocation in the present fund will be taken up by the end of this year.  The measure to which I referred in my reply is the extension being negotiated for the special Border areas fund.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoryOHanlon" hpid="Dr. O'Hanlon Dr. O'Hanlon">
      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is now referring to an extension of the gas pipeline which will not affect most of the Border counties.  Would he not consider, even at this stage, applying for a similar scheme to that which has been in operation since 1981, covering the tourist industry, infrastructure, roads, transport, craft industries and aid for small and medium sized industries?  In view of the situation in the Border areas as a result of the Government's policies, does he not consider it important that this scheme should continue for another five years?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dukes</NameTxt>
      <P>I expect that the extension of a gas pipeline for the supply and use of natural gas in Counties Louth, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo will be potentially a very significant benefit to those counties.  In the circumstances, this is an appropriate way of securing an extension of special Community aid for those areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnPWilson" hpid="Mr. Wilson Mr. Wilson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Wilson</NameTxt>

      <P>We originally negotiated the first special Border areas programme under the non-quota section and it was negotiated, agreed, signed, sealed and delivered as a measure which would end in December 1985.

      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister must not have his ear to the ground because obtaining bridging loans is one of the greatest problems facing house buyers at present and many sales have collapsed as a result.  As the Government are allocating additional funds for the purchase of new houses, does the Minister agree that there should be some system whereby people would be covered during the transition period?</P>

    <Speaker pid="AlanMDukes" hpid="Mr. Dukes Mr. Dukes">

      <P>It would not be appropriate to cover this in the form of a grant. During 1984 the growth of overall private sector credit did not reach the Central Bank's guidelines and, therefore, there was no evidence of a substantial shortfall of credit availability as against demand.</P>

      <P>Roimh am lóin bhí mé ag cur síos ar na Meastacháin mar a bhain siad le Roinn na Gaeltachta agus na deontais atá dá bhfáil ag Roinn na Gaeltachta.  Is cúis bhróin agus díomá do mhuintir na Gaeltachta go bhfuil na deontais a bhí le fáil acu le fada an lá, deontais do bhóithre áise, imithe i mbliana agus nach bhfuil aon fhigiúr sna Meastacháin ach £5,020 leis na bóithre atá dá ndeisiú a chríochnú</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Mar atá a fhios ag an saol mór tá fadhbanna ag na Gaeltachtaí uilig maidir le cúrsaí bóthair, cúrsaí taistil, agus rinne na scéimeanna seo go leor maitheasa do chaidhreamh agus do shaol mhuintir na Gaeltachta i gcoitinne.  Is é an trua é nach <Col N="984" /> raibh an tAire in ann a chur ina luí ar an Rialtas agus ar an Aire Airgeadais go raibh tábhacht mhór ag baint leis na bóithre seo agus go mba cheart go leanfaí ar aghaidh leis an deontas fial a bhíodh le fáil sna blianta atá caite.  Ní amháin i gcúrsaí eacnamaíochta ach i gcúrsaí cultúrtha chomh maith tá cosúlacht ann nach bhfuil aon tsuim ag an Rialtas seo sna cúrsaí a bhaineann len ár gcultúr agus len ár gcultúr a chosaint.  Tá sé sin fíor, go mór mhór maidir leis na Meastacháin agus na figiúirí atá le fáil ag Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann.</P>
    <P>Tá ceist an chomhaltais faoi chaibidil go minic agus is ait an rud é go bhfeicimid cúrsaí sa chaoi go bhfuil an comhaltas i gCiarraí ag iarraidh aitheantas a fháil don obair iontach atá ar siúl acu ar mhaithe len ár gcultúr a chosaint agus a chaomhnú.  Níl dabht ar bith agam ach go mbeadh an ceol agus an cultúr imithe ar fad mura mbeadh an ghluaiseacht a cuireadh ar bun agus ar chuir an comhaltas tús leis le ceol Gaelach agus le cultúr Gaelach a chosaint agus a chur chun cinn.  Ní amháin go bhfuil tábhacht leis an gceol féin agus leis an gcultúr ach tugann sé aitheantas ar leith dúinn féin mar náisiún.  Má thagann turasóirí anseo ón Eoraip, ó Mheiriceá agus áiteacha eile, tá sé le feiceáil acu go bhfuil ár gcultúr féin againn agus gur náisiún dá gcuid féin muid agus go dtig linn bheith bródúil as na traidisiúin atá againn agus a bunaíodh na céadta bliana ó shin.  Ní ceart go mbeadh gá don chomhaltas brú a chur orainn mar Theachtaí Dála agus bheith ag iarraidh go dtabharfadh an Rialtas cabhair dóibh san obair atá ar siúl acu.</P>
    <P>Rud a bhain turasóirí an-taitneamh astu ná na seisiúin a bhí ar siúl ag an gcomhaltas ar fud na tíre gach samhradh. Na daoine a bhios ag togáil páirt sna seisiúin seo, ní daoine iad a bhfuil an obair seo mar shlí bheatha acu. Faigheann siad aitheantas beag ó na tithe ósta ach is beag é.  Tá siad ag déanamh na hoibre seo toisc go bhfuil meas acu ar na traidisiúin go bhfuil siad ag plé leo.  Nuair a thagann na turasóirí go dtí na tithe ósta bíonn siad ag súil leis an ceol seo agus baineann siad an-sásamh as.  An bhliain seo chugainn agus i mbliana ní bheidh an <Col N="985" /> deontas a bhí le fáil ag an gcomhaltas le fáil feasta acu.  Is mór an náire go dtarlódh a leithéid agus ní thuigim cén fáth go bhfuil gearradh siar mar seo á dhéanamh ar an gcomhaltas.  Ní amháin go bhfuil siad ag plé le cúrsaí ceoil ach tá siad ag plé le cúrsaí teangan.  Tá ranganna Gaeilge ar siúl acu i ngach áit ar fud na tíre agus buntáiste agus tairbhe iontach á bhaint as na ranganna sin ag na daoine atá ag iarraidh an teanga a fhoghlaim.  Ní thuigim cén fath nach bhfuil aitheantas ceart á thabhairt dóibh i ngeall ar na himeachtaí atá ar siúl acu.</P>
    <P>San chlár atá leagtha amach ag an gcomhaltas i gcóir na bliana seo agus na bliana seo caite tá cur síos ar na himeachtaí ar fad a bhíonn ar siúl acu, agus sílim gur cheart dúinn anseo mar Bhaill den Dáil, mar dhaoine go mba cheart treoir a bheith á tabhairt do na cúrsaí seo, lántacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh.  Níl mise sásta go bhfuil an t-aitheantas sin á thabhairt ag an Dáil.  Beimid ag déanamh agóide anseo ag iarraidh a chur ina luí ar an Rialtas gur cheart dóibh níos mó tacaíochta a thabhairt sna Meastacháin feasta do na himeachtaí seo ar fad.  Tá argóint ann go bhfuair siad suim mhaith airgid le feabhas a chur ar an áras atá acu anseo i mBaile Átha Claith.  Tá sé sin fíor agus táimid sásta leis sin, ach tá mise ag caint ar chostais reatha, na costais a bhíonn acu le rúdaí a choinneáil ar siúl ó lá go lá.  Is náireach an rud é go bhfuil an stiúrthóir gan phá le tamall maith agus nach bhfuil tacaíocht airgid le fáil aige leis an obair iontach atá faoin a chúram a chur ar aghaidh.  Ba cheart go dtuigfeadh an Rialtas agus daoine eile é sin. Ní ceart go dtarlódh a leithéid.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh saol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta, bhí obair an-mhaith á déanamh ag na comharchumainn, ach arís tá gearradh siar ar dheontais dóibh.  Tá gearradh siar ar a gcuid oibre sa Ghaeltacht agus sin de bharr polasaíthe an Rialtais arís.  Chuir mise ceist anseo ar an Aire tamall ó shin faoi na comharchumainn a bhí ag fáil deontas ó Roinn na Gaeltachta agus bhí iontas orm a laghad comharchumann atá anois ag obair sna Gaeltachtaí.  Duine ar bith a bhfuil eolas aige ar shaol na Gaeltachta agus an dul chun cinn atá <Col N="986" /> déanta acu le scór bliana anuas, sílim go gcaithfidh siad a rá go ndearna na comharchumainn níos mó ná a gcion féin le muinín muintir na tíre a chothú agus go mór mhór muintir na Gaeltachta a chothú, agus thug sé misneach dóibh dul i mbun oibre ar mhaithe leo féin agus ar mhaithe le saol eacnamaíochta na Gaeltachta a fheabhsú.</P>
    <P>Tá aiféala orm arís nach bhfuil an tacaíocht atá tuillte acu a fháil ag Bord na Gaeilge.  Níl airgead le fáil acu sna Meastacháin leis an chuid eile den phlean atá leagtha amach acu maidir le dul chun cinn na Gaeilge a láidriú.  Cé go ndeireann Aire na Gaeltachta agus an Rialtas go bhfuil siad i bhfabhar na hoibre atá á déanamh ag an mBord, is beag i bhfad na briathra: mar a deir an seanfhocal, ní chothaíonn na briathra na bráithre.  Is beag dul chun cinn atá in ann don bhord féin mura bhfaighidh siad lán tacaíocht ón Aire agus ón Rialtas ins an obair atá leagtha amach acu.</P>
    <P>Ó thaobh an pháipéir úir atá tagtha amach anois agus atá á dháileadh ar fud na Gaeltachta, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil dáileadh maith ar an bpáipéar, i bhfad i bhfad níos fearr ná mar a bhí ar an bháipéar a thainig roimhe, <i>Inniu.</i> Tá sé á dhíol mar nuachtán agus iarracht an-mhaith á dhéanamh ach sílim go bhfuil easpaí ábhar liteartha ins an pháipéar, rud a bhí san iris <i>Inniu</i> agus rud a chuidigh go mór le scoláirí agus le lucht léinn.  Ba mhaith liom go ndíreodh an páipéar aghaidh ar na cúrsaí sin, agus aris, má tá gá le breis airgid le cuidiú leis na daoine atá i mbun <i>Anois</i> go mbeadh an t-airgead sin le fáil ón Rialtas.</P>
    <P>Chualamar caint chomh maith le tamall anuas ar thelefís Gaeltachta agus cé go bhfuil daoine ag rá go bhfuil an Rialtas báúil go gcuirfí a leithéid ar bun, ní fheicimid go bhfuil aon airgead le fáil sna Meastacháin leis an eagraíocht a chur ar bun.  Arís nuair a fheicimid an dul chun chinn iontach a rinne Radio na Gaeltachta agus an buntáiste atá ann don Ghaeltacht agus le muintir na Gaeltachta a thabhairt le chéile, sílim ón méid atá feicthe againn, dá mbeadh teilifís Gaeltachta ann go bhféadfadh sé leanúint ar aghaidh leis an méid atá cothaithe ag <Col N="987" /> Raidio na Gaeltachta ar mhaithe le muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>Anois nuair a bunaíodh RTE 2 thuig daoine ag an am go mbeadh seirbhísí breise le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta ó thaobh cláracha a bhain leis an Ghaeltacht agus ó thaobh na Gaeltachta ar fad agus go mbeadh deis i bhfad níos mó ag muintir na Gaeltachta cláracha a bhain leo féin a fheiceáil.  Faraor, níor tharla sé sin agus níl cosúlacht ar bith go dtarlóidh sé. Ní fheicimse leigheas ar bith ar an scéal ach go gcuirfí teilifís Ghaeltachta ar bun chomh luath agus is féidir é.  Tá sé ráite ag teicneoirí de chuid RTE nach mbeadh se ró-chostasach an tseirbhís sin a chur ar fáil.  Ba mhaith liom iarraidh ar an Aire go n-iarrfadh sé ar an Rialtas airgead a sholáthar lé seirbhís teilifís don Ghaeltachta a chur ar bun chomh luath agus is féidir é.</P>
    <P>Níl tada eile le rá agam ó thaobh na Meastachán don Ghaeltacht ach amháin go bhfuilimid an mhíshásta agus go bhfuil dearmad á dhéanamh ar phrionsabal a bhí bunaithe le fada an la ó thaobh deontas do na Gaeltachtaí, agus tá mise ar cur an lochta ar an Aire mar gheall ar na cúrsaí sin.  Tuigim go rí-mhaith mar iar-Aire mé féin nuaír a bhíonn na Meastacháin á bplé agus airgead ag teastáil go gcaithfidh an tAire dul isteach agus a chion féin a throid le buntáistí a fháil don Roinn a bhfuil sé ina cheann uirthi.  Tá faitíos orm nach bhfuil an tAire seo ag déanamh a chion féin maidir le seasamh leis an phrionsabal atá bunaithe le fada an lá, is é sin go dtabharfaí aitheantas faoi leith don Ghaeltacht agus do na seirbhísí a bheadh le fáil ag muintir na Gaeltachta.</P>
    <P>On the question of the budget in general, we must accept that at the time of its introduction, the publicity campaign which was conducted very effectively by the Government gave the impression that the budget would be worthwhile for the nation as a whole but when the first items were teased out we found this was not the case.  The recent debate in the House on another matter was introduced for the purpose of directing publicity away from the facts of the budget, facts that were <Col N="988" /> being highlighted and which were gradually nullifying the great publicity the Government had given to the budget. For instance, in the area of agriculture we find that schemes, such as the farm modernisation scheme, the western drainage package, the lime subsidy scheme and AI subsidies have been ignored. The result of this is that in the areas in which there are predominantly small farmers and in the disadvantaged areas the structures that were being provided were removed and this in turn has led to a gradual talking away from the standard of living that has been achieved by our people since our accession to the EC.</P>
    <P>For a number of years ACOT advisers have been advising small farmers to engage in milk production on the basis that this was an area in which a steady income could be provided for small farmers. Many of the western counties were slow in making progress in this area by comparison with, say, Kerry or other western areas.  Many were merely at the point of embarking on this development when the milk levy was imposed and they are now in the position of not knowing what the future holds for them in terms of agriculture.  They had incurred considerable expense in developing their farms, in the purchase of milking machines and so on.  The confidence trick played on the farmers by way of the abandonment of the farm modernisation scheme has created many problems.  The people concerned were caught doubly, so to speak.  They were informed first that the scheme was being suspended but because the word &ldquo;suspended&rdquo; was used, they were under the impression that they were free to go ahead with their development work and that after a period the grants would become available again. However, they now find that the schemes are not being continued.  We must always appreciate that agriculture is one of our main industries, an industry which helps to keep families together on the land.  As a result of the policies of the Government in the matter of all these agricultural grants we find an uncertainty which we have not experienced since the fifties in relation to these people.  Unfortunately, <Col N="989" /> we are back to a stage where with the way social welfare is being assessed many of these people see no way out at the moment but to emigrate.</P>
    <P>It is well to explain exactly what happened in relation to the small farmer's dole, as it is called, or the social welfare payments which were being made to small farmers since 1965.  As a result of representations at that time the Minister of the day decided that a farmer would be assessed on his land valuation.  That meant that no other means were calculated against a farmer except the farmer who might have money on deposit in a bank.  A farmer was free to produce without being hindered in any way.  As a result of going back to the position we now have, if two farmers are side by side and one decides to produce and get the most out of his land he will be penalised because the social welfare officer will say to him &ldquo;You have X cows, therefore your social welfare payments will be cut&rdquo;.  His neighbour who decides to sit back and do nothing will get the maximum benefit in social welfare payments.</P>
    <P>People like Father McDyer in the late fifties and early sixties campaigned for the introduction of the small farmer's dole using the basis that was in operation until the present Minister for Social Welfare decided to abolish it in the 1983 budget.  I am sure many Deputies from the western area will agree with me entirely when I say that small farmers are being harassed out of existence at present by the Department of Social Welfare and are finding it extremely difficult to live because their social welfare payments are being cut.  The people who are really penalised are those who tried to do something for themselves, who tried to improve their land, who availed of the western drainage package and the lime subsidy, who tried to get a few extra acres and a few extra cows, who increased their production.  A number of these people are beginning to ask themselves &ldquo;Why should I be a fool?  I will do as my neighbour does who is doing nothing; I will draw social welfare&rdquo;.</P>
    <P>Let us consider a person on a small farm of 15 or 16 acres who was in receipt <Col N="990" /> of, say, £40 per week and the social welfare officer tells him that he will not get it any more.  He has that small income every week.  Many people never regarded it as a social welfare payment.  It was regarded as a small farm supplement to help the small farmer stay on his land. Such a farmer may have a young family of four or five children.  He sends them out to school on the school bus.  He must clothe them and they need pocket money.  In some instances the medical card has been taken away along with the social welfare payments which mean that he must pay bus fares.  He must pay examination fees.</P>
    <P>As an example, recently a widow came to see me.  She has three children doing the public examinations this year and she must pay £70 for these examinations. That is a terrible penalty on a widow.  I have a letter here from the Minister for Education relating to the representations that I made for that woman and I will read a paragraph or two of it:</P>
    <P>The Minister is aware that payment of fees can cause hardship for some families and for this reason she recently announced a scheme whereby half of the fees must be paid by 1 December with the remainder being paid by 15 February.  Up to now all of the fees had to be paid by 1 December.</P>
    <P>That is a great consolation for that poor widow.  She still has to pay her £70.  The Minister's letter continues:</P>
    <P>The Minister has also decided that the scheme which she introduced last year whereby concessions could be made in cases of hardship, subject to a maximum total amount in the case of each school or vocational education committee, will apply again this year. Under this scheme an necessitous pupil is defined as a child from a home where genuine hardship exists because of unemployment, long illness of a parent, a large family with inadequate means, a one-parent family or other circumstances of domestic or financial hardship.</P>
    <P>That is fine.  That reads beautifully, but <Col N="991" /> who is the person who must arbitrate in this?  It is the principal of the school.  Here again is a most unfair situation.  He is in an impossible position when he makes a case for a parent and another parent says to him, &ldquo;You did it for so and so.  Why is my child not getting that concession?&rdquo; The whole thing is ludicrous and is creating terrible problems for parents, for pupils and for the principals of schools. It all adds up to what I said earlier, that with all of these, the cutbacks, the various impositions that have been introduced since this Government took office, the security that people felt, particularly on small holdings in the west, and which they had since 1965 is gone by the wayside. Parents are very worried at present.</P>
    <P>In my part of the country we were well accustomed to emigration in the past but it had stopped completely and the only people emigrating were a few who were maybe over 60 years of age and wanted to fill in the last few years in order to get their pensions at 65.  No young people were going away.  Now the people who have to go away have nowhere to go when they reach England.  Twenty years ago they could go to any town in England, Manchester, Birmingham, Nottingham, London, and everywhere they went they could find an Irish community and people accepted them with open arms.  That does not apply now.  Irish people who have lived in England over the period and reared their families there are integrated into British society and they do not want to see people coming from Ireland.  The recognised lodging and boarding houses that were there up to 1965 are no longer there, and because of recent events in England people coming fresh from Ireland are not welcome.  The people who go away from here have no recognised call, so to speak, as they had in the past. They have nowhere to go where they feel really safe and confident, and the people who are already there have no welcome for them.</P>
    <P>I meant to say something about some developments in education about which I am not entirely happy, but I will dispense with that because I am sure Deputy <Col N="992" /> O'Rourke will deal adequately with that matter.</P>
    <P>There is a big question mark over the issue of land development and the future of small farmers because of the abolition of the Land Commission.  It is rather a pity no money has been provided for them at least to do some of the work they have sought to do during the years.  I receive many representations regarding turbary rights.  It is sad to think that where families live in the midst of acres of bogland that they do not have the right to divide that bog and to cut turf for themselves. When representations are made to the Land Commission they say they no longer have money to do this kind of work.  The re-arrangement of holdings and the provision of relief for congests has gone by the board.  The Land Commission had a special role in relation to protecting small farmers from the businessmen and the people who could buy land easily.  However, that protection no longer exists and it is a further worry for small farmers when the occasional holding of land becomes available.</P>
    <P>It is obvious there is no liaison whatever between the various Departments with regard to land development and the provision of turbary rights.  In my constituency thousands of acres of bogland are being bought by the forestry division of the Department.  While that in itself is good and there is some work provided in respect of forestry development, the other side of the story is that a group of village people cannot get the turbary rights they are seeking.  There is no way they will get such rights in the future because of the schemes now being followed.</P>
    <P>In view of the skills of small farmers and the knowledge regarding deep ploughing and so on, I sometimes wonder if it would be better economics to have some of the land drained, seeded and limed and extra acreage provided for the small farmers rather than planting trees. I do not know the answer.  I should like to see a cost-benefit analysis carried out in relation to this matter to decide which course would be the best advantage of an <Col N="993" /> area where there is bogland.  My opinion is that the interests of the community in such an area would be better served by using the knowledge we have and the machinery that can be used and make more land available for small farmers rather than the blanket planting of trees. On that point I question the work of the forestry division when they are planting trees in that they do a blanket planting rather than following the tradition on the Continent.  There trees are planted in belts and in between the belts there is an area that can be grazed.  The fallen leaves fertilise the land and there is also shelter for the animals grazing the land.  I wonder if we are following the right policy in that connection.  With the benefits to be gained from the EC, some pilot schemes could be introduced to help in this kind of work.  At the moment we seem to be carrying on in the old humdrum way, without using our imagination, to deal with developments of this kind.</P>
    <P>We talk a lot about importing vegetables but that is all we do, both here and outside the House.  We never get down to doing anything worthwhile and we do nothing to initiate programmes to encourage the farming community.  The budget has not provided any money to help in this matter.  We do not do anything worthwhile to stimulate interest in the growing of vegetables and the same applies to the presentation of our products. We just talk and talk about it, but do nothing.  Questions are put to the Minister and we are given the usual reply setting out the value of potato imports and so on, but we do nothing to redress the situation and this at a time when we could provide extra jobs.</P>
    <P>During a by-election in west Galway I visited an area where there were many small farmers, with farms of 35 acres or 40 acres.  In that area, Abbeyknockmoy, I noticed that every farmer seemed to have a vegetable garden, something which was not part of the country scene. If ACOT were to introduce a scheme encouraging some farmers in that area to grow vegetables, even students, a co-operative could handle the vegetables, have them washed, cleaned and properly <Col N="994" /> presented and the towns of Tuam and Galway could be serviced.  We have to think along those lines.  We must do something positive rather than just talking about the problem in the Dáil.</P>
    <P>Last summer a young man in my constituency grew vegetables and sold them to the local shops.  He earned about £600. He was a better young man for having done that.  Had he gone to England or America to earn a few pounds his efforts would have been lauded.  In my view, he should be encouraged for the example he set.  We must encourage our young people to do things like that.</P>
    <P>Various AnCO schemes are being run by the Department of Labour.  It is great to see young people engaged in something worthwhile, but the problem I see with many of the AnCO schemes is that they do not lead to anything.  A young man does one of these courses for six months, but what is there for him at the end of the day?  A great deal of money is spent on these schemes.  Various community halls have been built under the AnCO training schemes and I commend AnCO for that, but we should broaden our horizons and ensure that the courses will lead to something worthwhile.  I am not sure that is being done at the moment and I am not sure that the money provided from the social fund is being spent to the best advantage.</P>
    <P>One hears a great many complaints about the link training programmes. Young people who apply for these programmes must have been signing for unemployment assistance for six months before they are eligible.  Young people complain when they see married women on these courses because these women are there merely to collect the £70 a week for five or six months.  Young people cannot understand why they cannot go on these courses.  I hope the Minister will look at this problem and see if something could be done to change the present position because people are going on these courses without anything worthwhile coming out from them.  Some of these people are friends and supporters of mine but we have to be honest because these <Col N="995" /> programmes are not of any great advantage to the young people, and they are the people we should be looking after.</P>
    <P>Fisheries and fishery development are subjects I could discuss for a long time. The fishing industry has been a hit or miss operation down the years.  Even though we had Bord Iascaigh Mhara their brief was too limited.  They are nothing more than a lending agency who select suitable fishermen for loans to purchase boats.  If a new harbour is to be provided BIM have no say in it.  They were not involved in the training of young fishermen until a few years ago.  I should like BIM's brief to be broadened so that they could coordinate the various strands of the fishing industry.  We should try to run this industry successfully.</P>
    <P>Each year the situation is getting more difficult for our fishermen.  It is well known that the only people making money are those with 120 foot and bigger boats.  They can fish anywhere.  Some fishermen have been fishing north of Scotland recently and some are facing terrible problems at the moment.  They are not able to make their repayments on their boats which cost a tremendous amount of money.  The investment by the State has been substantial and it has been unfortunate that we have arrived at this situation.</P>
    <P>One area we have neglected down the years is fisheries research.  We never provided worthwhile sums for research, and this budget has not provided any money for this area either.  Compare us with Iceland.  They have 200 people employed full time on research.  When the cod war with England broke out they had stacks of evidence which would stand up in any international court of law to prove they were right.  We are talking about the Spaniards and the Portuguese fishing in our waters but we do not have one shred of scientific evidence to put on the table and say this is the position in relation to stocks of herring, cod and other species. We just go to Brussels to talk.</P>
    <P>Not alone should we ensure that our stocks of fish are protected but we should direct our fishermen to use the fish stocks <Col N="996" /> available to the best advantage.  At a time when job creation is so important this natural resource should be tackled in an imaginative rather than a slipshod way. We see fishermen who started with small boats now have larger boats, they are prepared to spend millions to get into fishing in a big way.  That should be an eye opener for everyone, particularly the State.  There should be a co-ordinated effort in the provision of boats and the development of harbours and processing. This would ensure continuity of supply and would create many more jobs on land.</P>
    <P>We do not think anything of the money we give to the IDA when they introduce a large company into this country.  That is the accepted thing but here is a natural resource where we could spend many more millions of pounds to the advantage of the country, expanding our fisheries, providing more jobs and so on.  We are not geared to gain the greatest advantage from Europe.  Being classed as one of the poorer countries of the EC we could use the Regional Fund and the various agricultural funds to better effect.</P>

As regards the Social Fund, the Regional Fund and the various agricultural funds, we should have a reappraisal of the position and ask ourselves if we are gaining the greatest advantage for the country from these grants.  I do not think we are.</P>
      <P>In relation to tourism a great deal of noise has been made about the reduction of VAT on bedrooms.  I wonder will it make hotel bedrooms cheaper?  I doubt it.  Any advantage that is to be gained will be offset by the increase in the cost of food, petrol and all the other increases that have come as a result of this budget.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. Barnes</NameTxt>
      <P>Some beginnings were <Col N="997" /> made in this budget.  We asked for imagination and creativity.  In doing that we realised that there were paramaters beyond which our imagination and our creativity could not go.  We are in a stranglehold in that we are held back by the repayments on our debts.  The latest mad ascent of the American dollar is not doing us much good and we hope that situation will be settled pretty fast.  It shows how incredibly open we are to the buffetings of the stronger economies.  This makes it all the more important to use our resources to the best of our ability.  Being smaller we have to try harder.  This budget made an honest attempt at doing that within the boundaries.</P>
      <P>All our planning must concentrate on job creation.  I am not the first to say this nor will I be the last.  The tax reforms that will continue over the next year or two will hopefully go a long way towards giving incentives to both employers and employees.  I would ask the Minister to concentrate on making sure that there are tax incentives to encourage people not just to cream off the profits but to reinvest.  We have a highly trained intelligent and generous workforce when it has the motivation to be so.  Given the right encouragement we have a workforce second to none.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a few areas of taxation which could be singled out for more generous treatment perhaps next year.  For instance, we could do something with the area of tax allowances to give mortgage relief for single parent families.  We have a far higher number of single parent families than we have had heretofore and the old traditional way of seeing families as two parents and so many children inside four walls in idyllic bliss is not the norm any longer.  We have many different variations in family units.  Single parent families, particularly those buying their own houses, need every bit of encouragement and need as many tax allowances as couples. Single parent families do not want to be seen as victims, as people looking for handouts.  They are hardworking contributors to society and all they want is the recognition that they need tax allowances so that they will not have over <Col N="998" /> one-third of their salary swallowed up in a mortgage.  To date we have not looked at the idea of bringing in legislation to regulate the renting of accommodation. We have the traditional idea of people owning their own homes.  People are forced into only seeing security within a mortgage for most of their lives, within a crushing mortgage for the early years when the salary is at its lowest.  We should plan towards far greater security and status in the renting of accommodation, and even tax allowances against rent.  We are forcing people to high risk, high mortgage situations when the answer for many family units would be a statutory recognition in relation to renting accommodation. Because there is no tax allowance for rent there is a tremendous disincentive to consider renting.</P>
    <P>I welcome the rationalisation of the tax bands.  I am glad that the lower bands have been widened to the extent that people, particularly single people are not immediately rushed into the high tax bands although they are on comparatively low incomes having regard to the cost of living today.  By and large the tax system has been a disincentive to work harder to produce more and to work longer hours.  However, more seriously some of our highest qualified people are emigrating.  We need all our highly qualified and technically skilled people.  We cannot afford that kind of brain drain and our tax system will have to take that into consideration.</P>
    <P>We should also look seriously at giving a tax allowance against the employment of household help.  This would be an area of job creation and it would help couples who particularly in their earlier years wish and need to work.  There is great pressure on such people to try to safeguard their homes and to look after the upbringing of their children, but no practical recognition has been given for doing that.</P>
    <P>Many single people, particularly women, probably midway through their careers, either have to get out of their work altogether or sacrifice promotion or training to look after elderly relatives.  If they were allowed to continue with their <Col N="999" /> careers and got relatives' tax allowance they could engage somebody else to help in the house, allowing them to continue with their careers.  Such an allowance would begin to recognise the status of the housekeeper.  This work has been done in a voluntary way by women for many years but it has not been unacknowledged from an economic point of view.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction of VAT on newspapers.  Particularly because of the type of newspaper we import from Britain it is important that we maintain and support our traditional Irish newspapers. Our newspapers have been struggling and this should not be so because we should be fighting for freedom of print as well as freedom of speech.  Therefore, I suggest that we might go even further to reduce VAT on newspapers.</P>
    <P>Many thousands now depend on social welfare benefits.  They are people who cannot go in and ask their employers for increased wages or for better pension rights.  They are dependent nearly entirely on the political will of the Government of the day to get incomes that will allow them to live, and not in ghettos or lower levels of survival.  Knowing the low standard of living of the social welfare classes I am glad we kept social welfare benefits in line with inflation this year.  Perhaps, through buoyancy in the economy and a job creation programme which will send many young people to work, we will be able to revise our social welfare payments.  Many people now on social welfare benefits are on the breadline or below it.  They have no choice and cannot enjoy luxuries.  Theirs is an incredibly grinding kind of life to live, particularly if their unemployment is long term.  They are locked into a system and cannot operate outside it.</P>
    <P>I welcome the family income supplement. However, I would add a <i>caveat,</i> that employers would not use the family income supplement to allow them to get away with paying low wages &mdash; in other words, ripping off their employees and making the State subsidise them.  That is now how the family income supplement should work.  We all welcome the <Col N="1000" /> arrangements being made to channel many social benefits, which are now being wastefully implemented in a hit and miss fashion, into a system to be centrally administered.  It will mean that the benefits will be payable directly to the parents in the home.  Heretofore we have taken the rearing of children for granted, never having given it the importance it should have been given.  There has even been a lack of self-esteem shown by those engaged in child rearing.  The new arrangement will be recognition of the work of child raising and it will redistribute more efficiently and less wastefully the resources available to the lower income groups.  I hope we can build on that initiative.</P>
    <P>We must ensure that we will not become fossilised in our system of social welfare payments.  They must be seen as something to which people are entitled; and I welcome very much the reforms being introduced by the Minister for the Public Service regarding the training of officers who man our offices involved in the payment of social welfare benefits.  In this way recipients will not be humiliated or made to feel they are spongers living off the State.  They must be made to feel part of the community and that they are getting only their rights.</P>
    <P>I cannot leave the subject of social welfare without referring to the dental and optical benefits for women in the home.  Last week when speaking here Deputy O'Malley referred to the mother and child scheme of 30 years ago.  Home treatment, particularly for pregnant women, was one of the provisions in that scheme, but it has taken us all this time to begin to give this treatment.  I hope this will be one of the main items in the 1986 budget of Deputy Dukes.  Dental and optical benefits should be made available to all women in their homes from the insurance of their husbands.  We all know it is not only when she is pregnant that a woman needs dental treatment. We all know that a vulnerable time for women is when they have had three or four children and have to bear the expense of dental and optical treatment, with middle age catching up on them <Col N="1001" /> and a consequent failure of eyesight and weakening of teeth.  This is when they need the back-up of free dental and optical treatment.  If we value and recognise their work, rather than just giving it lip service, we must introduce this and introduce it fully.</P>
    <P>I should like to see a concentration on those who act as a back-up in the community, affording housekeeping facilities.  We should also recognise those who look after our elderly in their community. At the moment there are very many women looking after the elderly in the community, but the social welfare payment is not paid directly to them but to the eligible relative.</P>
    <P>If we are serious about cutting out the waste &mdash; and there is huge waste with regard to hospitalising people rather than treating them as fully as possible within the community &mdash; we must start a very positive programme.  Not only will that save a great deal on our health budget, but it will take away a great amount of pressure from those who are not in any way supported in the community.  I was at a recent women's group meeting where this matter came up for discussion.  One woman said that because her mother needs continuous care and has been living with her for some years, they have never been able to take a holiday as a family. It is not that anybody cares less for the mother or grandmother, as the case may be, but naturally the circumstances lead to tensions and conflicts within the household. Some kind of back-up service should be available to enable those looking after people in full-time care, day after day, night after night, to have a holiday rest.  In Britain, for instance, there is a six weeks in and six weeks out scheme, meaning that people are hospitalised for six weeks and then, if their health permits, taken out into the community for the next six weeks and so on.  This gives flexibility and efficiency. We are looking into this idea, but it has not yet been translated into action.</P>
    <P>One of the positive results from this budget &mdash; and I am very glad that the Opposition spokesperson for Education is present &mdash; about which all of us can <Col N="1002" /> feel good is that we can speak about potential without hypocrisy.  Particularly because of the research and monitoring done by the Youth Employment Agency, it has been discovered that there is quite a connection between education and employment.  This should alert us to quite a few things.  We can be quite proud of the level of education being attained by our young people, leading to a potential in the workforce.  We should also be warned that for those who leave school at primary level, at least half are jobless a year later.  For those who leave at intermediate certificate or group certificate level the proportion is about one-third, for those who carry on to complete their secondary studies, it is one-fifth and over nine out of ten of those with higher education get jobs within a year of completing their studies.  In all our future budgets we must constantly be aware of the privilege and opportunity tied in with the different levels of education.  Our budgets must always take into consideration cases where there is lack of opportunity at the lower levels of education.</P>
    <P>We must recognise that looking at education as being finished at 18 or 23 years of age is totally outdated.  Education must proceed and be supported as a lifelong continuing process.  Not alone does this apply to our students of today but very much more to those who probably felt that they had finished with school and education but then found themselves redundant or unemployed.  They know that in their forties and fifties they will not have an oportunity of returning to the traditional jobs of their teens and twenties.  I welcome the news that AnCO are setting up a series of training courses called alternance.  This will not alone look at the retraining of people into new areas but also at the psychological damage, fears, anxieties and lack of confidence being built up in people left redundant and unemployed.  Never before have we been so aware of the effect of this, particularly on men whose whole concept of themselves and their self-esteem is tied to their jobs.  They must not be allowed to feel that their life is over and their individual and personal importance <Col N="1003" /> finished just because their job is finished. All the planning of the future must take this into consideration because we are moving into new concepts of work, our structures are changing and continuing to change.</P>
    <P>I am sorry that Deputy Gallagher is not present, but I should like to reply to his viewpoint of seeing it as an unsatisfactory arrangement, to say the least, that married women are getting a chance to come back on training courses and programmes after having reared their children and given up voluntarily their own independence, spending perhaps up to 20 years looking after other people.  We cannot any longer, under the Employment Equality Act of 1977 deny equality of opportunity to women, but I should like the spirit of that law also to be recognised, at least in this House.  It really disappoints me that eight years after the passing of this legislation people speak as if it were some perk or privilege to allow married women the same opportunities in training or availability of jobs as others.  They have given of themselves to society, have performed what was considered a most important task without which the common good cannot be achieved and so forth.  Yet, having performed that task well, when they ask for an opportunity to come back into the workforce and contribute of their talents and experience, which are important to remember, it is felt that they should not be allowed to do so until all our young people are employed.  We must give the lie to that.  Within this House we must strive to create a society and resources which will give everybody a job, without making scapegoats of one section in order to employ the other.</P>
    <P>I would enter another <i>caveat</i> on behalf of women.  At European level the new concepts of work are taken very seriously with regard to household income.  Instead of having one breadwinner working continually and perhaps placing the entire family unit at risk if his job collapses, there would be a change by which both partners within the home would work, part of the time outside and part inside, <Col N="1004" /> giving them a household income at least comparable with one regular salary but giving both the leisure and opportunity to carry out their domestic responsibilities equally and also share in the very rewarding task of child rearing.  This was the whole concept of job sharing as I gathered it to be and as it was drawn up in Europe.  However, it is worrying that in this country, while we have within the public service and in the semi-State companies a job sharing concept, it has been turned into a handy little way of getting two or three women to share one job. There is no equality of opportunity for women if the men continue to work full-time, taking all kinds of opportunities with regard to training and promotion, and we channel women into the part-time jobs without giving them the same training and promotion opportunities.  If it is only the women who will leave the workforce and the men stay on full-time there will not be any opportunity for women to further their career.  It will still leave the traditional attitude that the domestic and child rearing responsibilities lie totally with the wife and mother.</P>
    <P>Time will overtake us if we do not take this matter seriously and ensure that the concept works.  It is my belief that the pressures on women will be such that they may think seriously about having children at all.  That may sound very radical and threatening, particularly to men, but in other countries where women were penalised in the domestic area and in the responsibility of child rearing they chose not to have children.  Those countries now find themselves in grave difficulty with regard to low birth rates.  I never talk about economic planning without demanding that it be accompanied by social planning.  All our budgetary attacks and job sharing concepts must include the concept of equal participation of women outside as well as inside the home.</P>
    <P>I do not think we have realised the great potential we have here.  I welcome the incentives to people to lease land, especially land that is not productive or is being held by elderly people who do not have the energy or incentive to work it.  In a country with agriculture as its first <Col N="1005" /> resource we cannot allow one-third of our land not to be used productively. That does not make sense economically or any other way.  We must concentrate on ensuring that the land passes on to energetic and skilled young people with a proper reward for those who pass it on.</P>
    <P>Another area we have overlooked is the question of afforestation.  I do not agree with Deputy Gallagher who was worried about large phalanxes of trees and forests throughout the country. Although our land is very suitable for afforestation the area planted is the lowest in Europe.  I understand that more than one million acres of our land is suitable for afforestation.  In this regard we should bear in mind that we can get 85 per cent funding from the EC and that banks and financial institutions have a great interest in such medium and long term investment.  We hear a lot of talk about a lack of finance for projects but there is no problem in regard to obtaining finance for afforestation.  We can also feel good about the growth prospects here. We must take into consideration the fact that in the EC there is a scarcity of timber.  We have every opportunity to export.  Our land can grow trees very quickly and we should not allow any more time to pass without making a massive investment in afforestation.  The downstream industries from afforestation are predominantly labour intensive.  Less capital is required to create jobs in that industry than in most other.  A heady export market is available for that product.</P>
    <P>I welcome the reduction in taxes to help the tourism industry but no matter how we reduce our taxes if we do not give good service and value to people there is little point in our talking about a tourism industry.  We have a great opportunity to boost tourism because of our God given gift of a beautiful country which up to now, thankfully, has been unspoilt to a great extent.  However, I have heard some hair-raising stories from local people who holidayed in different parts of the country.  Some have said that a visitor takes his life in his hands if he stays in a hotel in winter.  I have heard of <Col N="1006" /> people having to wear their overcoats in bed because the beds were so damp and the rooms so cold.  That occurred in hotels classified as Grade B and high class.  We are all aware of the lack of hygiene, and we must do something about it, but there is an incredible lack of inflexibility in regard to our service to tourists.  If one goes to almost any hotel between 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. one cannot get a pot of tea. There appears to be a lack of realisation that hotels are for people and not to be opened for certain hours by the people who run them.  A tax reduction will not do much to help that industry until a proper service is provided.  If tourists get proper service and the flexibility I am talking about their visit will be a most memorable experience.  I have no doubt that they will return time and time again.</P>
    <P>I should like to ask Bord Fáilte to refuse to give concessions to hotels and tourist centres if is it found that their standards embarrass us.  We must remember that a dissatisfied tourist will tell his friends when he returns to his home country and that will have the effect of discouraging other people from visiting here.  We have the resources and the potential but we need the motivation and the discipline to get our act together.  The budget was a start in that direction and I hope next year's budget will go a long way down the road to complete that.</P>

      <P>I enjoyed the contribution of the last speaker.  I wish all of us were as forthcoming in debates.  As I came into the House today I asked myself: What is it all about?  This day four weeks the budget was introduced in the House.  When I entered this House two years ago the first debate in that January was one on Dáil reform when we all expressed pious aspiriations on how we would wish to see procedures in the House changed.  Essentially a budget debate is one about the state of the nation financially and socially, as people perceive us and how we contribute to the national scene.  Over the last two years we have not made the strides in Dáil reform we had set out for ourselves.  If <Col N="1007" /> somebody from another country were to sit in the Public Gallery and look down into the Chamber, seeing three or four Deputies all very interested in their subject matters, well able to put over their point of view, one wonders what they would think.  One wonders what impact such a debate will have on matters in 1985 or 1986, or do we all each year &mdash; and here I point the finger at myself as well &mdash; get a type of vicarious pleasure out of hearing our point of view expressed without it having any relevance to what goes on in the world outside?</P>
      <P>One day the week before last in the course of the budget debate I had a party of senior pupils in from a second level school, aged 16, 17 and two of voting age. We went to the restaurant afterwards when I asked them what they really thought of the proceedings.  They were polite, they were nice about it &mdash; after all I was their hostess for the afternoon &mdash; but they did not really think very much of what had been going on.  They did not see its relevance to their daily lives, to the lives of their mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers.  They spoke of things like crime &mdash; in fact two or three of them spoke very feelingly on that subject &mdash; they spoke about education, about social affairs, matters like that but professed that they could still not see the relevance of what they had heard in the course of that budget debate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I question the prolongation of budget debates, and here I stress I am not pointing the finger at everybody else.  I question the relevance of Deputy after Deputy riding his or her hobby horse, feeling pleased that he or she had contributed well.  Deputies go away and there is nothing whatever done about their suggestions, nothing appearing to have any input into any additional policy formation or whatever.  The budget debate, as it has evolved over the years, has assumed a massive irrelevance to real life.  This led me to think of the Dáil reform programme outlined two years ago to the House by the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism when he enthusiastically outlined what he hoped <Col N="1008" /> to do in that direction.  Sadly, two years later, it has not happened.  I hope I am not being irrelevant because this would come within the ambit of the Minister for the Public Service and moneys apportioned by him to the Dáil committee which would have an input here.</P>
    <P>At that time two years ago there were established 12 Joint Committees composed of Deputies and Senators representing all major parties in both Houses.  The idea was they would meet at regular intervals, would invite experts in various fields to talk to them on, say, financial matters, social matters, crime, lawlessness and vandalism, small businesses or whatever. It was hoped a consensus would be reached on various matters of importance, that their reports would be introduced in the House when action would be taken on what would be regarded as their most salient points.  That has not happened.  I question today the pace and momentum of that Dáil reform.  I fear it has faltered very much.  I am sad because when I became a Deputy this was something about which I was enthusiastic, and I was appointed to the committee&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Perhaps the Minister would make a definitive statement now, two years later, on what has been happening such reports, are they to pile up gathering dust, with the members of those committees never seeing any of the fruits of their work?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly more money should be channelled in that direction. I question also the commitment to the broadcasting of the Dáil proceedings as, I understand, a direct financial contribution has not been allocated.  We were given an estimated figure of £100,000 to do so and it was questioned whether it would be worthwhile.  That is another matter altogether but it was contained within the commitment to Dáil reform, that procedures would be broadcast and two years later that has not happened.</P>
      <P>I question also the relevance of this House to the job, crime situation, social conditions, to housing and to education. Not sufficient time is given to debating these important issues.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to read a <Col N="1011" /> short paragraph from Standing Orders for Deputy O'Rourke's benefit: &ldquo;While the debate is on the broadest lines, matters of administration and details appropriate to be raised on Estimates are not relevant.&rdquo;  I know, Deputy, that you will clearly follow that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MaryORourke" hpid="Mrs. O'Rourke Mrs. O'Rourke">
      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the case, then the matters on which Deputies have spoken for the last few weeks are highly irrelevant.  The Members to whom I listened have been speaking on their respective hobby horses, which is usually an item of Government expenditure or the responsibility of a particular Minister. I am not allowed to talk about the Minister for the Public Service, the Minister for Industry, Trade, Commerce and Tourism or the workings of their Departments. I now wish to talk about the financial allocation to the Department of Labour to carry out their social employment scheme and I do not know if you are going to pull me up on that.  I note that a sum of £57 million, spread over three years, was allocated.  It has taken four weeks for the details of this scheme to be announced and it is appropriate that the Minister of State, Deputy Pattison, is here now as we had a shindig with him last December because the details of this scheme had not been announced.</P>
      <P>The details of this scheme are very paltry, especially when we had been led to believe that there would be a great job creation programme.  It has been announced that a sum of £70 will be paid for a two and a half day working week.  I welcomed this when I first heard about it because I thought it would provide a measure of employment for the long term unemployed who found themselves trapped in a cycle of not working.  However, the scheme falls very short of our expectations.  I await the further elaboration of the scheme and hope it will fulfil some of its promises.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another matter to which I wish to refer, with your permission, is education. Other speakers were given full rein and I am particularly interested in the formation of a national parents' council which <Col N="1012" /> is part of the Minister's commitment to education.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. O'Rourke</NameTxt>
      <P>Thank you.  When the Minister for Education announced her plan and <i>Building on Reality</i> stated that there would be a parents' council at primary and secondary level which would provide an umbrella organisation for parents to come together to discuss matters of mutual interest in regard to their children's education, I welcomed these proposals.  Moves for the formation of this council are already afoot at primary level and, to date, local elections have been held.  Most of the regions have held elections and, next Wednesday week, the national election will be held for an umbrella body of 15 elected parents on a national parents' council for primary education.  I am deeply committed to the concept of parents' involvement in the workings of children's education and I could never understand why some teachers had an inbuilt aversion to this and regarded interested parents as meddling in education.  I always felt that, if you had a problem with a child, a meeting with parents very often gave a deeper insight into the child and what was causing the problem.  At any rate, I do not believe there are problem children although their environment often makes them baulky and difficult.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Parents from outside Dublin have pointed out to me that while there will be 15 elected parents on the national council, there is no inbuilt distinction which will give it a regional character. There are 56 inspectorate areas at primary school level; local elections were grouped in inspectorate areas and then <Col N="1013" /> they went on to regional and national elections.  Within the Dublin area, there are 25 inspectorate areas and, therefore, a little less than half of the votes at the final election will come from the Dublin areas.  With respect to Dublin Deputies, although one-third of the population lives within the Dublin area, the character and flavour of the national parents' council should embrace the country as a whole so that aspirations and viewpoints could be discussed.  Of course, we do not want a bias towards any sector but regions should have a voice.</P>
    <P>I should like to discuss this matter with the Minister within the next few days.  At present there is only a council for parents at national school level but the secondary school council is now under way and the vocational, comprehensive and community councils are reaching their local stages of election and will soon reach the final stages.  I hope all these councils will have representative voices.  I knew all along that parents are interested in education and they are doing all this on a voluntary basis.  Something in the region of 109 parents will be gathering in Dublin next Wednesday week to have their final elections. I hope, by then, that some system will have been worked out whereby the voices of the regions will be heard as well as those from urban areas.</P>
    <P>Parents will be asked to advise on and make an input into the curriculum.  I spoke about the irrelevance of much of what happens in the Dáil to the outside world but much of what happens in classrooms is also irrelevant.  I am not suggesting that we throw out everything. We all need reading, writing and arithmetic and the various strands of history and culture which go to make up a broad education.  However, we must be open to new technology, new subjects, different ways of teaching and to a more relaxed way of imparting knowledge, perhaps through open contact with experts, making visits to places where people will be able to expand on different areas of education and so on.</P>
    <P>The importance of agriculture in education has been overlooked.  The previous speaker said that one-third of our land <Col N="1014" /> was not cultivated.  Only a tiny number of students take agriculture as a subject at second level.  That cannot be right in a country which is dependent on agriculture. It would benefit both rural and city students if they had a knowledge of agriculture. I do not mean that they should open a book and learn how to sow crops but to have a practical knowledge of it.</P>
    <P>I become annoyed when parents say they would not know anything about the curriculum and would not be in a position to make any changes in it.  They say the teachers are there for that.  That is true but no one knows as much about education as someone who has reared a child. He or she has brought that child through the various stages of real education, which is life.  I hope the parents' council will have worked out, before election day, an equitable system of regional representation on the board.  It is an important step in education and is to be welcomed.  We must get the formula right and not find that we are lumbered with an unrepresentative body.</P>
    <P>I hope the Whips will be able to arrange shortly a full scale debate on the developments within the interim curriculum board which ends its deliberations at the end of this year and which will have a statutory board basis in January 1986.</P>
    <P>There was no provision in the budget for extra money to employ teachers to teach continental languages.  The cutbacks two years ago meant that if a teacher died, changed job or retired the vacancy could not be filled.  That did not have any repercussions in the first year but now, because of natural wastage and so on, it is begining to have an effect on schools.  French is taught in most schools but the other continental languages are assuming less importance.  I was at a dinner recently where I heard the head of the CII make this aspect of education the major thrust of his speech.  He questioned our commitment to Europe in view of the fact that second level students have no more than a nodding acquaintance with one continental language.  The figures he cited for the teaching of German were particularly low.  Young people who seek experience and work in <Col N="1015" /> Europe find themselves at a disadvantage because they cannot speak German.  Germany is the major trading country in Europe.  I ask the Minister to look at this aspect of education in a commercial way. Perhaps extra funds could be made available to enable teachers of continental languages to be employed.</P>
    <P>I thank the Chair for putting me on the right path.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelBell" hpid="Mr. Bell Mr. Bell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bell</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in some of the remarks made by Deputy O'Rourke in relation to Dáil reform.  We could spend some money on improving things in the Chamber, for example, we could ask the Minister to provide money to improve the acoustics.  At times I find it very difficult to hear contributions made by speakers, basically because of the very bad amplification we have.  In the general area of Dáil reform a number of the proposals that will be made will cost money.  In that connection I suggest that Deputy Bruton has made a bigger impact than any previous Minister.  It would be wrong to leave any criticism of him on the record in that regard.  I am sure Deputy O'Rourke did not mean that.  As members of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, the Chair and I are well aware of the contribution made by the Minister in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to the debate following the introduction of the budget.  Unfortunately it coincided with the closure of Clarks in Dundalk.  My colleagues on the far side of the House who are present will be interested in this subject.  The impression was given that the application of VAT on footwear was in some way responsible for the closure of Clarks and the problems of the footwear industry. Anyone who suggests that does not know anything about the footwear industry. Footwear was an item which was zero-rated for a number of years and this is the first time any form of VAT was imposed on it.  That will not have any bearing on what is left of the Irish footwear industry.  It was not responsible for the closure of Clarks in any way.  Clarks used to be the major employer not only in the <Col N="1016" /> town of Dundalk but in the Country of Louth.  At one stage the company employed over 1,000 workers.  The closure now pending will mean a loss of 270 jobs but since I came to the Dáil over 800 jobs have been lost.  At one stage in County Louth there were over 2,000 people employed in this industry and that does not include those in allied industries or services such as the leather industry.</P>
    <P>The downfall of the footwear industry started long before this budget.  It started with the Anglo-Irish trade agreement. The then Irish Shoe Leather Workers Union, of which I was general secretary, warned the Government of the problems that would be created.  We warned them and opposed EC entry on the basis that the agreement did not provide sufficient protection for the industry.  That was over 12 years ago.  As general secretary I organised a one day work stoppage which was supported by employers as well.  They came and demonstrated in Dublin.  We demonstrated because we foresaw that the policies of successive Governments would cause the closure of the footwear industry.  We put a black coffin into the Liffey during that parade 12 years ago.  We said then that that was a symbol of the footwear industry going down the river and we have been proved right.  People who speak here about the footwear industry do not seem to realise that 90 per cent or nine of every ten shoes worn by Irish people are imported.  When one considers that more than 80 per cent of the Members of the House are wearing imported shoes, it is ludicrous for them to talk about the level of shoe imports.  It is not possible to buy Irish made shoes in many shops.  Indeed, we are fast reaching the stage when we will not be able to find an Irish made garment in the shops because the textile industry has suffered the same fate as the footwear industry &mdash; it has virtually disappeared.</P>
    <P>There is no justification for blaming Members of the Labour Party for the problems in the country.  Fianna Fáil were in power when the country joined the EC and they were supported in the referendum campaign in that regard by Fine Gael but opposed by Labour and the <Col N="1017" /> ICTU.  Unfortunately for our people, all the warnings that were issued by the trade unions in relation to native industry have been found to be justified.  It would be grossly wrong for any Members of the Opposition to allege that in the past two years the Government have been in any way responsible for the state of the footwear industry.  We have argued with successive Ministers for Industry and Commerce and at the European Parliament that unless protection was given to native industry in global European terms so as to allow member countries to retain a percentage of their home markets, such industries could not survive.  However, Governments of the member states did not act collectively to ensure the necessary safeguards for these industries.  That is an accepted fact now in Brussels among the employer organisations, the trade unions and the politicians.  It was a case of closing the stable door after the horse had bolted.  History will show that politicians collectively are responsible for that situation.  My trade union colleagues, who fought so hard in Brussels and elsewhere on this issue, will confirm what I am saying.</P>
    <P>It is a disgrace that Clarks Shoes should have treated their workers so badly.  The company secured a very good deal in this country.  In the past ten to 15 years they secured a tax free concession on more than one million pairs of shoes exported to Street in Somerset.  Then they were allowed to import more than one million pairs of shoes, again tax free.  In other words, if a retailer in Dundalk, Drogheda or Kilkenny, wishes to order Clarks shoes, he submitted an order to the company. The shoes were transported from Dundalk to Somerset via Rosslare and were then transported back to Rosslare and distributed to the retailers.  That point has not been made publicly, but the concession was continued by successive Ministers.  It was made in the interest of retaining employment in Dundalk, Kilkenny and Clonmel.</P>
    <P>The company have &ldquo;ratted&rdquo; on all the concessions they have been given.  They have &ldquo;ratted&rdquo; on the many thousands of <Col N="1018" /> workers who have given such loyal service to the company.  Clarks have left a void in Dundalk that will be impossible to fill; but they are to be allowed continue to import more than one million pairs of shoes without payment of any tax, without any wages being involved and, consequently, in the absence of any return to the Exchequer.  This is being done on the back of Irish workers.  It is sad for me personally as former general secretary of the Irish Shoe and Leather Workers' Union and also as national group secretary of the Irish Transport Union with responsibility for that industry to see what is happening.  Surely we should be considering ways and means of dealing with that type of company.</P>
    <P>Last week I tabled a question in relation to an aspect of this company's affairs but for whatever reason it was ruled out of order by the Ceann Comhairle.  However, I assume I am entitled to raise the matter now.  My question relates to the manner in which the affairs of the company were conducted.  This is an area that should be investigated by the Revenue and by other sections of that department.</P>
    <P>There are a number of points I wish to make in respect of the direct provisions in the budget.  Before the budget we had heard a good deal about public service pay.  Together with colleagues in the Parliamentary Labour Party, I said that we would not support any proposal which would involve our fellow workers in the public service receiving the level of increases that were being proposed.  I made it clear that if the proposal should be implemented I would have no hesitation in setting about organising a campaign with my colleagues in the Labour Party even if that meant the defeat of the Government.  It was my opinion that it would be better to defeat the Government on what was a bread and butter issue than to defeat them on, for example, the Family Planning Bill, which will not put bread into anyone's mouth nor resolve the problems of the working class. I am pleased that, together with my colleagues in the party, I played at least a small part in the Government's change of heart and that the public service will <Col N="1019" /> secure at least the same level of increases, small though they may be, as any other sector.  I do not consider the public sector pay increase to be anything to write home about.</P>
    <P>In the past two weeks I have had occasion to meet with a number of corporation and other local authority workers and I noted the details on their wage slips.  One workers who had a wife and one child had a net take home pay of £84.45 out of which he paid back to the local authority about £10 rent.  That left him with £74.45.  People talk to me, they talk publicly and in the media about how well off the public service are, the TDs with their £16,000, the secretaries with their £26,000 and whatever, but they forget about the fellow who is working for the local authority who is also a public servant, who goes around on Monday or Friday and collects their refuse, deals with sewerage when they are asleep, sees that they get water through the taps, sweeps the streets or looks after the libraries and carries on very menial but important tasks in the public service area. These people are paid between £85 and £95 per week net take-home pay.  If I were to give my wife that total sum &mdash; we have five children &mdash; I would be told where to go.</P>
    <P>In relation to the public service I would like to refer to the consistent sniping about the salaries and conditions of TDs. I have said here as a trade union official that I do not think that by any stretch of the imagination TDs are overpaid.  The corporation worker is underpaid and I would have no objection if he were to get £16,000 per year, because he probably earns that.  However, very often the people who write the stories about TDs and add to the constant criticism are better paid than our TDs.  It is grossly unfair.  I heard some national commentators making nasty comments about TDs' pay.  TDs are part of the public service who give a public service, who represent the public and who in many cases work seven days per week for very long hours and at very high expenses, and all that will happen from now on is that TDs and <Col N="1020" /> Senators will get the same increase as will their fellow workers in the public service. I see nothing wrong with that.  We should not have to justify it and and the matter should be put away.  If I were working outside the Dáil I would receive quite an amount more than I get for working inside.  I want that to go on the record.  I say as a trade union official that many trade union officials who have criticised Members of the Dáil are much better off than are the Members of the Dáil.  For the service that TDs and Senators provide, the work they do and the hours they work, they earn every penny they get, and more.</P>
    <P>In the context of employment I want to talk about the Border area.  Like Deputy Leonard, I represent a Border constituency. The Ceann Comhairle will remember that when I came in here one thing that annoyed me in the first budget, and particularly the second budget, was what those budgets would do to the Border areas.  The Ceann Comhairle, as a Deputy from a Border area, must agree that it was as a result of those financial policies that the Border area on the Southern side has become an industrial wilderness.  It took two and a half years for the Cabinet and the Minister for Finance to understand that.  I appreciated what was happening and came to the conclusion that really Ministers do not know what is going on in the country in the sense that they listen far too much to their own senior advisers and civil servants.</P>
    <P>A blind man could have seen what was going to happen in Counties Louth, Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal.  We got up here in debate after debate and question after question and told the Cabinet what was happening.  It was not until the media took up the matter and the stories were printed and RTE programmes were coming across that people began to say that these fellows were not just talking nonsense, they were right, and to ask what we were going to do about it.  Then it was decided to reduce duty on spirits. Of course, that was a welcome development and we appreciated it, but I could not understand why duty on spirits could <Col N="1021" /> be reduced thereby making that commodity more competitive while the price of beer was left unchanged.</P>
    <P>A number of things indicated why people would go North to purchase and clearly and collectively we indentified them.  That was the only time since I came into the Dáil when Opposition and Government spokesmen, particularly backbenchers, agreed unanimously on what the items should be.  They were very simple &mdash; beer, spirits, petrol and electrical goods.  People did not go up to buy food in the North.  They may have bought certain items of food there, but the prices of the items I have mentioned were the main reason why they went, and I am sure Deputy Leonard will agree on that.  They came back with bags full of groceries and so on because women went up to get their petrol, beer and spirits and while they were there, naturally they did the other part of their shopping and bought food.  The fact that there is no VAT on food, low VAT rating on clothing and no VAT rating on footwear meant that the vast bulk of those people did not buy those items there, they concentrated on the other items I have referred to.  This also gave rise to wholesale smuggling.  People have made millions on the Border in the smuggling game.  People talk about a united Ireland. I hazard a guess that if there were to be a referendum tomorrow morning on a united Ireland many people in the Border area would not vote for it because it would cost them a great deal of money.</P>
    <P>The saga continues.  We still have a substantial differential in petrol and beer prices and in other areas, but mainly in those.  If that gap could be closed I hazard a guess that it would at least equalise commercial activity.  We do not want the North to be an industrial wasteland.  We are prepared to share with our Northern brethern all that is going and good in Ireland, but we cannot do so at the expense of jobs in the south.  Therefore, commercial activity along the Border should have at least an equal chance of survival.  If the Cabinet want to make a contribution to employment &mdash; or unemployment as the case might be &mdash; there <Col N="1022" /> lies priority No. 1 for Counties Louth, Monaghan, Cavan and Donegal.</P>
    <P>Collectively we have been in agreement in regard to the national gas pipeline. With a great fanfare of trumpets statements were made about what the extension of the gas pipeline to Belfast would do to Anglo-Irish relations.  Everything was ready, then suddenly the British got cold feet or had second thoughts and they pulled out &mdash; for tactical reasons, I assume.</P>
    <P>We will have to reassess the situation with regard to the gas pipeline.  We will have to get consultants to go to Louth and Monaghan and carry out a survey. All of these matters were done when the agreement was due to be signed in Belfast.  We are not in a position to govern Northern Ireland at the moment. We cannot even govern the Twenty-six Counties never mind the Thirty-two Counties.  We are responsible first and foremost for employment for people in the Twenty-six Counties and after that whatever help we can give to our northern brethern we should give freely and with goodwill.  As Members of this House we have been elected to represent the workers in our constituencies.  The gas pipeline would make a big difference to Louth, Meath, Monaghan and Donegal. As I said before, the Premier Periclase company in Drogheda could use more natural gas than the whole of Dublin city. That is a fact but still we hear An Bord Gáis and departmental spokesmen talking about whether it would be an economic proposition.  How can they justify such a comment when one company in Drogheda could use more gas than the whole of Dublin city?  The company in question deals 100 per cent with the export market.  It uses sea water extensively and it sends its finished products to the United States and elsewhere.  It is earning dollars, marks and francs but all we get are excuses from the authorities with regard to the provision of the gas pipeline.</P>
    <P>The Minister of State who is present represents the constituency of Kilkenny. That town and also Dundalk are faced with the prospect that their gas supplies <Col N="1023" /> may close down.  In such an event I do not know who will supply gas for all the people of those towns.  The companies concerned have been negotiating with an Bord Gáis for a long time but they have been put on the long finger and I would not be surprised if the companies responsible for the supply of gas to consumers in Kilkenny and Dundalk are forced to close.</P>
    <P>Those of us in the trade union movement, in conjunction with our colleagues in the printing and newspaper industry, warned successive Ministers for Finance that if they continued to increase VAT on the printing and publishing industry there would be major job losses and that is what happened.  After a company such as the <i>Drogheda Independent</i> group who are the backbone of the newspaper industry in the area had almost closed we succeeded finally in getting a reduction in VAT.  It was almost too late and it was after many provincial newspapers had been forced to the wall.  Others have had to shed up to 50 per cent of their employees.  The same situation applied to the printing industry.  Thousands of workers have been made redundant because of competition from outside but, at the same time, we are allowing foreign journals and newspapers to come in tax free.  The position should be reversed. The print industry should be strengthened and any VAT that is imposed should be placed on imported newspapers and journals.  The jobs of our people in the industries concerned should be safeguarded.</P>
    <P>It will not be long before local newspapers will have to complete with local radio.  I support in the broad sense the concept of local radio based on it being operated and controlled on an overall community basis, with RTE having a sufficient input, with proper control being exercised, with people being paid the appropriate wages and with the right conditions of employment but we cannot ignore the fact that local newspapers will have to compete with local radio.  We must be satisfied they are competing on a fair basis, which has not been the case <Col N="1024" /> up to now.  I welcome the reduction in VAT.  It is part of the policy of the Labour Party and we are pleased our colleagues were able to make some impact in that connection.</P>
    <P>I said before and I will repeat that so far as the Labour Party are concerned the most important thing we can achieve after employment and taxation reform is to get pensions for industrial workers.  At the moment our ministerial colleague, Deputy Barry Desmond, is the man in the hot seat.  I have disagreed with the Minister on a number of occasions and I voted against the Bill dealing with social welfare but I would be very happy and pleased if we finished this Dáil with a national pension scheme for all workers. If we succeeded in putting that on the Statute Book, I could look back with some pride and joy on our involvement in government.  However, if we do not succeed in that objective, quite frankly I will feel we have succeeded in doing nothing.  The Minister of State knows my views on this matter.  If we want to make an impact on poverty that is the best way to do it.  However, I accept it may not be possible to do it in the short term. Recently I met a man who worked for 45 years in the furniture industry but he had not one penny of a pension other than his old age pension.  That was it after 45 years.  If that man had not succeeded in saving a few pounds to help him in his old age he would be destitute on an old age pension.</P>
    <P>There are many thousands of similar workers who have worked all their lives and have got nothing at the end.  In my constituency I know of a case where a man who had property worth more than £1 million and who transferred it with all his investments to his son.  He did this for a period of six months.  I am sure the Minister is aware that under his Department's regulations it is possible for that man to get a full non-contributory pension while, at the same time, the people who had worked all their lives for him and who had paid for their pensions succeeded in getting only a few pounds more.  It is no wonder the working classes and people on the factory and shop floor <Col N="1025" /> get angry with what is happening.  I suggest to the Minister of State that with our Labour Party colleagues we will have to ensure before this Dáil finishes, and before we have another charade like the Family Planning Bill and the amendment debate, that we introduce a social welfare measure that will give every worker a proper pension on retirement.</P>
    <P>The Minister and the Minister of State might reconsider a suggestion I made a number of years ago and which was responded to in a positive way by the Minister.  I suggested that there be decentralisation of the social welfare system. At the moment there are delays in payment and when certificates go astray people have to wait four or five weeks before payment.  In some instances Dáil questions have to be tabled before they are paid.  There are probably more questions tabled dealing with social welfare than on any other subject matter, and the reason for this is that the major problems occur in that Department.</P>
    <P>The Minister has made a number of changes in the Department which have helped to give a better service to Members of this House and to our constituents who have to face this situation. Some people who are working get paid on the basis that they submit a social welfare certificate, in other words, they are paid the difference between their social welfare benefit and their wages. The majority of workers do not have that luxury.  They have to depend on their weekly social welfare cheques.  If they do not get these cheques they have to go cap in hand to the community welfare officer. If they are in receipt of £80 or £90 social welfare disability benefit the community welfare officer may give them £40 or £50, and that money may not be paid for four or five weeks.  They get this money because without it they would not be able to feed their families.  Let me tell the House that £40 or £50 will not go very far these days.</P>
    <P>The Minister committed himself to a pilot scheme of decentralisation of social welfare disability payments.  Would the Minister look at this again because I am <Col N="1026" /> convinced that it would be a much more efficient and effective service if the payments were from local offices.  The records in the Department will show that some people have been working and drawing social welfare disability benefit. If we want decentralisation, which is Labour Party policy, that is one way of going about it.</P>
    <P>There is the possibility of streamlining social welfare contributions and the payment of social welfare benefits.  If a husband and wife are working I do not see why both should have to pay social welfare contributions.  In my view only the working man should pay the contribution, but the wife should be covered for the same benefits, and a single person should pay half the married contribution. In this way we would have a two tier contribution system.  When a married woman goes back to work she should not have to pay any social welfare contribution because her husband should be paying it.  That would substantially reduce the administration in the Department and help to simplify what is becoming a more complicated system of payment.</P>
    <P>I would like to talk about taxation. Let us take a working husband and wife earning £400 per week.  That woman comes home at night.  She may have children. She has to do the cooking, ironing, washing, clean the house and all the other menial tasks she would have to do if she were at home all day.  Both of these people are paying tax probably in excess of £100 per week.  I do not see why they should not be given an allowance so that they could employ somebody full time and they should be allowed to claim this wage in full.  This would mean that instead of paying £100 tax, most of it going into the non-productive areas, another person could be employed to do the housework, the gardening and all the work normally done in the home and garden by a husband and wife.  This means that three people would have an income instead of two.</P>
    <P>In a very short period this would create many jobs.  This type of idea could spread because it is not too far removed from the <Col N="1027" /> social employment scheme introduced by my colleague, the Minister for Labour. This scheme is a winner as far as I am concerned not because I think people should be working two and a half days a week &mdash; I believe people should be working five days a week &mdash; but because it is a step in the right direction.  For example, residents associations can apply for secretarial help, and part-time administrators only paid under the scheme. There can be support staff in schools which at present do not employ ground and general maintenance staff.  The scheme can be used to enhance the services to pupils and it can be used in artistic endeavours.  There are a number of areas where this scheme can be used, apart from the people who can be employed on local authority and community care projects.  People can also be employed in sports and youth activities and the scheme can make a major impact on the environmental work of local authorities. As I said, this is a step in the right direction. I give every encouragement to the scheme and I congratulate the Minister not only for introducing it but for the way he is consulting with local authorities and local communities to maximise the effects of the scheme.</P>
    <P>What can the Government do about unemployment?  There are many things which can be done.  There are advance factories lying idle all over the country. Some time ago we were shouting for more advance factories to be built, but now there are many advance factories lying idle because international companies are not interested in coming here for a variety of reasons.  We must encourage our nationals.  What is wrong in giving those advance factories free to Irish people who want to start up an industry? Would it not be better for the IDA, with Government approval, to give an advance factory in, say, County Louth, Monaghan or Cavan to an Irish national rather than have it lying idle?  This would create jobs.  Deputy Leonard will know of many factories which have closed since I was working in that area.  If people were taken off the labour and given jobs in <Col N="1028" /> these factories they could make their contribution to the Exchequer and those factories would soon pay for themselves a hundred times over.  But we are waiting, with empty factories paying for security and maintenance, for multi-national companies that will never come.</P>
    <P>ESB and fuel charges are the highest in Europe.  If we are talking about giving encouragement to industry and at the same time we are applying charges to discourage them from creating jobs, I do not see how we can claim to be sincere. Let us hope for the next two years, now that we have overcome many of the things that have bogged us down here in the Dáil, that we can get down to debating the jobs situation and perhaps all four parliamentary parties will spend more time debating unemployment.  If we could resolve the unemployment problem we would resolve the taxation problems, the social welfare problems and a lot of the crime and vandalism which has taken place.  Only Dáil Éireann can resolve the jobs crisis.  We, as Members of the Government party, will be responsible to future generations if we do not resolve this major social evil.  This is the third time I have spoken on the budget, but the jobs crisis is the most important topic.  This is the problem on which we should concentrate in order to resolve it for the sake of the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>It is difficult to speak on this budget because seldom has a budget had so many side effects.  Our spokesman on Finance suggested that another budget should be brought in as an attempt to simplify some of the provisions of this budget.  The Government in this budget are true to their form, but not to their promises.  The Government made promises but at the end of the day we have nothing to show for it.  One gets the feeling that the Minister would act as Mrs. Thatcher acts if he had the courage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Government have failed under all the headings in their joint Programme for Government.  This is a political budget. It is like a bag of assorted sweets &mdash; there is something in it for everyone.  The budget's greatest failure is that it fails to <Col N="1029" /> address itself to unemployment, which is the biggest problem facing the country. Over the last few years most elected representatives have been meeting on a daily basis constituents with unemployment problems.  This is a depressing situation. Recently I met a lady from Deputy Bell's constituency and she told me that in her small council house her husband and three teenagers were unemployed.  This creates a lot of frustration and strife, especially in the winter when people are largely confined to the house.  Two of her teenagers were not receiving any benefit because they did not qualify, being under the age of 18.</P>
    <P>This problem will not just go.  The Government have a defeatist attitude towards the creation of employment.  In their document <i>Building on Reality</i> they are anticipating an increase in unemployment rather than trying to resolve it.  It has always been recognised that the quickest way to stimulate the economy is to stimulate the building and construction industry.  Instead of doing that the Minister has doubled VAT and this is having a serious effect on the construction industry.</P>
    <P>Having by his earlier actions created a massive outflow of cash to shops across the Border the Minister now makes a small adjustment.  It is just like a supermarket increasing its prices around Christmas time and reducing them for the January sales.  The 1983 budget had a very serious effect on our economy when excise duties on petrol and VAT rates were substantially increased, especially for electrical goods.  Following that action there were continuous deputations to the Minister.  These deputations showed returns from the various trading centres in the area.  In June 1983 we had a Private Members motion here and we pointed out how the Minister's actions were damaging businesses and the serious long term effects they would have on trading structures in the filling stations, the garages and the shops.  Prior to Christmas this year a trader in a town in Monaghan asked me if they could get a meeting with somebody to see if this problem could be resolved because he <Col N="1030" /> had bought in large supplies of goods for the Christmas trade and they were not selling as their customers were going past in their cars to the North.  As Deputy Bell said, none of us would deny the North their moment of joy, but when it goes on for years it is too much.  During the debate on this budget I was annoyed to hear Government backbenchers suggesting areas in which the situation could be improved.  Seemingly these areas had not been recognised by the Government or the Minister.</P>
    <P>When Fianna Fáil suggested that the economy needed mild and controlled inflation the Minister did not take heed. The Minister had one simple answer, which was that the medicine for all our ills was to reduce borrowing.  If we look at how we stand as far as borrowing is concerned we find we are borrowing more than ever and at the same time we have an all-time high on the unemployment register.  I put down a question recently in relation to my constituency, which is not one of the worst constituencies because it was never an industrial constituency and we had not as many closures of large industries but still we have an alarming rate of increase in the numbers on the unemployment register.</P>
    <P>Another plank in the Coalition platform was a promise to ease the tax load on the PAYE sector.  They said this would be their objective in and out of office. Now that they are in office the Minister has not taken any real corrective action except the juggling of the tax bands.  I compliment him, though, on his simplification of the VAT code.  I particularly welcome the reduction in the rate on newspapers.  It will benefit the provincial rather than the national press.  The provincial newspapers were feeling the pinch very badly.</P>
    <P>After this budget many people are depressed and frightened about the future, and this lack of confidence and feeling of fear will continue if unemployment continues to increase.  The Government seem to have an obsession with tax, on getting the books right at all costs; but with a quarter of a million people unemployed there will have to be a <Col N="1031" /> change of policy and attitude.  We still have very low productivity, probably only half that of our EC partners.  There is a very high dependency here because we have so many people older than 66 years and younger than 14.  Too many of our work force are in unproductive occupations in the public sector.  After many years and many management courses we still have poor management in many areas and undercapitalisation.</P>
    <P>As I have said, we have got to bring down our exceptionally high tax level. Government expenditure must be cut and we must have increased productivity. Particularly we must make better use of our natural resources, because it is there we can get productive employment.  The Department of Labour have done admirable work but they must concentrate on decentralisation, in tandem with local authorities and private groups and organisations. In that way more jobs can be created in the country outside the cities. There are many job opportunities in agricultural production and processing, in fishing and in tourism.  All need developing.</P>
    <P>In the Border region in the past two years the serious difficulties merchants and industrialists are encountering because of lack of equality of trading terms with Northern Ireland have become obvious.  There have been many requests for an amelioration of this but traders on this side of the Border are still suffering gravely because of cross-Border trading.  Some traders had hoped to have their rates reduced but nothing has been done.  Deputy Cooney, Minister for Defence, went to that region last week to speak on the budget.  He was queried in Cootehill about possible relief for local traders.  <i>The Northern Standard</i> had a report as follows:</P>
    <P>The Minister for Defence, Mr. Paddy Cooney TD, told <i>The Northern Standard</i> that he thought it would be &ldquo;unconstitutional&rdquo; to introduce any form of rescue plan for traders affected by the adverse business climate south of the Border, along the lines recently <Col N="1032" /> proposed by Monaghan's Urban and County Councils and other local authorities in the region.</P>
    <P>The Minister agreed cross-Border trading was a major problem and reduced rates would leave Border traders in a more comfortable position, but added: &ldquo;The difficulty is that it would be probably unconstitutional to favour one section of the country in this way over people in another part of the country, and the proposal would not be feasible for that reason alone.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It was the imposition of taxes and duties at the Border which caused the collapse of trading in that region.</P>
    <P>Frequently at Question Time we discussed the importation of concrete products like Readymix, and we admitted it is not easy to resolve the problem. It was expected there would be keen competition from the North because there has been a falling off in the building industry there due to the recession and manufacturers have been looking for markets for their products.  We have spoken about the price and the quality of imported cement.  Recently I met one of the producers who told me that six:one Readymix per cubic metre would command £37 in Cork, Limerick and Galway but would be sold on the Border at £32.  Recent quotations from Northern firms have been for £28.  He just cannot compete with this.  He is in competition with firms which are grant-aided with regard to equipment, plant and trucks.  Many of these firms renew their plant and equipment after a few years because of the attractive grant aids.  There is no such grant aid from the IDA for concrete products.  The thinking behind this is that there is adequate plant in the area to provide these products, but there is adequate plant because in excess of 50 per cent of the products are coming from Northern Ireland.  The IDA should take a really hard look at improving the position of those employed in this trade in the Border areas.</P>
    <P>There is another fairly serious situation developing which was not the case <Col N="1033" /> before.  The industrial development authority in the North were never as effective or active as were the IDA here.  Down the years there was no problem here as far as attracting new industry.  The incentives given here were equal to and in most cases in excess of those offered in the North.  Also, the area west of the Bann was very little industrialised in the Border region.  The industry was kept for the more populous areas around north Derry and Belfast.  In recent times, however, the development organisation in the North have become very active.  They appear to have a fair amount of money at their disposal and they are using it to fairly good effect.</P>
    <P>The town of Clones was rated and accepted by the Social and Economic Committee of the EC as being the most depressed area in a disadvantaged region. It was the black spot.  Denim Trading closed down despite much consultation with the IDA who made a genuine effort to get other takers for the factory.  A liquidator moved in and when that happens there is a problem in getting a taker for the factory.  The owner who went into liquidation has set up a factory six miles to the north, in Fermanagh.  He now intends to utilise his previous workforce, using a minibus for their transportation, and to continue to produce the same material as before.  This is happening in a town where we have been fighting for ten years for support.  There are three factories lying idle because the IDA did not consider it worth while surfacing the road as there was so little expectation of finding occupants for the factories.</P>
    <P>The Government will have to look at this area because if industries are siphoned off because of more attractive terms elsewhere, we will be in a very serious position.  There are 10 IDA factories idle, three of three cluster units in Castleblayney, Monaghan town and Clones and a large 24,000 square foot factory lying idle in Monaghan for five or six years.  I would agree with Deputy Bell's suggestion that the IDA should give those factories free to young entrepreneurs who are trying to make a go of it, for a three, four or five year period. <Col N="1034" /> They have been idle and look as if they will continue to be idle.  If there were enterprising groups, ideally co-operatives, to start up some businesses, they would have available a vast list of goods which are at present imported and for which substitutes could be found.  Those factories will have to be used.</P>
    <P>Nothing has given us more concern in that region over the last few months than the action of the Government as related to arterial drainage and the Minister of State is present.  Cavan County Council wrote to the Taoiseach asking him to expedite the drainage of the river Erne which would be of terrific benefit to Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Fermanagh. The counties which would have most to gain would be Cavan and Fermanagh. Practically all those counties would be part of the Erne catchment system, with the outfall into Ballyshannon.  Monaghan and Leitrim then, to a lesser extent, would benefit.  I quote from the <i>Anglo Celt</i> of 18 January:</P>
    <P>An Taoiseach, Dr. G. FitzGerald, T.D. is aware of the importance which is attached to the Erne Drainage Scheme and that the Erne Catchment Study recommended that a scheme should be devised by the Office of Public Works, Cavan Co. Council were informed by a letter from his Department in reply to a letter from the council in September.</P>
    <P>The letter continued to state that in fact a drainage scheme was prepared in the 1970's but was not proceeded with as it was considered to be of poor economic merit.</P>
    <P>A review of the arterial drainage policy, is currently under consideration in the Department of Finance, according to the letter, and prior to the submissions of the proposals to the Government, they had directed that in the interim all planning of arterial drainage projects be suspended.</P>
    <P>Furthermore the Taoiseach understands that the resources of the Office of Public Works are so heavily committed to other projects that they have no immediate plans to renew activity in <Col N="1035" /> this area.  For those reasons he regretted that he could not at this stage give a more favourable reply to the council's letter.  However, provided that the outcome of the review was favourable and the required resources were available, it was the intention of the Commissioners to undertake a reassessment.</P>
    <P>That Erne catchment area has been included in the 1945 Arterial Drainage Act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>I will have to take this up in another way.  We are talking about Government policy and it is my contention that the Budget debate is the time to discuss Government finances and their policies.  We should be permitted to discuss the policy directions of all Departments. There is not another appropriate time to debate the overall policy of Departments.  The Departments seem to build their own empires.  There is no co-operation or co-ordination between them.  That is noticeable when one is working on development organisations in the Border areas.</P>
      <P>At Question Time today we discussed the quota and non-quota sections of the Regional Fund.  The Minister for Finance was asked how that fund was spent in Border areas over a five year period which expires at the end of this year. Portion of the fund was administered by the Department of the Environment for the provision of access roads to lakes.  In all, I understand that six Departments were involved in administering that fund but they did not know what other Departments were doing.  The administration policy in regard to that fund relates closely to what I have said about the Erne catchment development.  The report of the economic and social committee and the joint report of the British and Irish Governments, financed jointly by them and the EC, all identify arterial drainage as a project requiring immediate attention. These reports pointed out that arterial drainage related to agricultural production and tourism.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1037" /> I do not intend to be at loggerheads with the Chair over this but Departments are not co-operating in examining such schemes.  If that is not done we will not get the proper benefit from the EC.  The extension of the natural gas pipeline to Border areas has been mentioned by many Members.  I welcome the recommendation which, if accepted by the Council, will mean a grant of £23 million being paid towards the supply and use of natural gas to counties Louth, Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim and Sligo.  The last speaker was concerned that the failure of the cross-Border deal on natural gas would mean that the pipeline would not be extended to Border areas.  I agree with him that it would not be difficult to extend the pipeline to Louth and the other counties I have mentioned.  Natural gas could be used to good advantage in those counties. Co-ops and food processing units could avail of it.  There are plans in north Dublin and down to Louth to develop the glasshouse industry and similar schemes could be carried out in Cavan, Monaghan and Leitrim.</P>
    <P>The mushroom industry in those counties has been an outstanding success. Hundreds of people in Monaghan and Cavan work full time in the compost yards and processing plants.  Many housewives are employed on a part-time daily basis pulling mushrooms.  A few years ago the market was worth £2½ million. Now it is worth £15 million and provides 500 jobs.  That progress has taken place over a four year period.  I was pleased to have assisted those who started that industry.  In our area a teacher who got the idea to start a mushroom industry contacted the IDA and received great assistance.  We may criticise Government agencies from time to time but in regard to this industry they seize the opportunity to get involved.</P>
    <P>The creation of jobs must be our first priority.  I accept that a Government cannot create jobs but they can create the environment for industrialists to provide jobs.  They can instil confidence in our people.  In the <i>IDA News</i> No. 2, 1984 the decision to devolve responsibility to the IDA for small industries is dealt with. <Col N="1038" /> That publication points out that it was decided to develop in five regions, the south-east, Donegal, the east, and Cork and Kerry.  I think it was 38 officials who were employed on the small industries programme.  The IDA continue to say that they propose to extend their operations into other regions, probably including the north-eastern region.  Bearing in mind the workforce and factories in our small towns and villages, our region is ideally suited to this type of operation.  It was on this we had built our economy in recent years.  It is regrettable that the IDA pick five out of eight regions and say that by and by they will get to the others.  Such an attitude is particularly regrettable at a time of high unemployment.</P>
    <P>A recent EC publication aptly demonstrated the increase in our jobless last year to be 9.1 per cent as against 3.7 per cent in England and a decrease in Denmark.  In December last we were top of the league in the EC when we had 17 per cent as against the next highest, 14.7 per cent in Belgium and 12.2 per cent in the United Kingdom.  Our percentage of jobless is practically double that of the Federal Republic of Germany and half as high again as that of Denmark.</P>
    <P>I do not believe we are making sufficient effort to produce more jobs, particularly in the dairying and meat industry and their downstream added-value products in co-operatives and meat factories. The 1984 CBF annual review shows the percentage of vacuum packed and processed meat, cooked and uncooked, and the supposed efforts made to develop downstream products.  With regard to uncooked meat we have almost doubled our exports, whereas in cooked meats the 1984 volume was about the same as that for 1977.  Vacuum packed exports are up from approximately 8,000 tonnes to 21,000 and vacuum processed exports up from 13,000 tonnes to 31,000 tonnes, showing the total exports in processed meats up from 5.2 per cent to 12.4 per cent.  Yet it constitutes only the tip of the iceberg in comparison with what could be done in that area.</P>
    <P>The dairying industry is now subjected <Col N="1039" /> to a quota and cannot improve.  It is also to be borne in mind that in 1974 our livestock numbered 7.2 million but had dropped in 1984 to 6.7 million.  Despite all the incentives and moneys made available for disease eradication, headage payments, subsidies for housing and so on, we now have 500,000 cattle fewer in our national herd than there were then. It should be said also that a recent study in the meat area highlighted the necessity to improve the quality of our stock, all of which will have to be graded more rigidly.</P>
    <P>A serious situation has developed in the poultry industry because of massive imports from the North.  Producers claiming unfair competition in many areas say it is tantamount to dumping.</P>
    <P>With regard to the TB eradication programme only 50 per cent of herds were tested last year and 3 per cent were found to be infected.  In recent years there were found to be approximately 25,000 reactor cattle per annum.  Despite the expenditure of £1 billion in recent years that eradication programme has not been satisfactory because in counties like Longford, Carlow and Kilkenny there have been very serious outbreaks of the disease.  Indeed there has been an outbreak in an area adjacent to me.  I know the frustration farmers feel, some of them losing practically half their herd.  I hope the Minister will be successful in improving our performance in that regard.  It would appear we are unable to get away from this 3 per cent infected level and that we must continuously spend additional moneys on this eradication.</P>
    <P>We now have fewer people working on the land than in any other EC country. In the first five years of our membership the flight from the land was of the order of 22 per cent.  It has been claimed that if the remainder of our farmers could be upgraded to the level of the top 25 per cent we could double production and create tens of thousands of jobs, an area in which we should be concentrating all of our efforts.  One of our greatest industries is left completely under-capitalised, under-utilised, and on this I must take issue with the Government.  Practically <Col N="1040" /> the first thing they did in 1983 was to abolish the farm modernisation scheme grants and in so doing blocked development completely.  This was at a time when statistics showed that half of our cattle were outwintered&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasJFitzpatrick" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Thomas J. (Cavan) Fitzpatrick">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesLeonard" hpid="Mr. J. Leonard Mr. J. Leonard">
      <NameTxt>Mr. J. Leonard</NameTxt>
      <P>The Government withdrew the farm modernisation scheme grants in 1983 and restored them in 1984. They withdrew them yet again at the end of December 1984, this time the excuse being advanced that the EC directive on development farmers had expired and that they had to renegotiate its continuance with the EC.  If any of us here conducted a contract for the supply of any product in any area, surely before its expiry we would renegotiate its extension. But in regard to arterial drainage and the farm modernisation scheme grants, we stopped the clock.  It should be remembered that sometimes it is very difficult to get that clock started again.  I believe it to be deliberate policy.</P>
      <P>I should also like to mention job creation and the difficulties caused by massive importation of fruit and vegetables.  A committee was set up of Ministers of State of various Departments to examine how import substitution could be dealt with.  The list of imported goods which could be substituted by home products is very long and if the deliberations of the committee were discussed here it would be time well spent.  It would be interesting to hear their proposals in regard to fruit and vegetables or, indeed, any other articles which are imported.</P>

    <Title>Private Members' Business. - Health Boards Funding: Motion (Resumed).</Title>
    <P>The following motion was moved by Deputy O'Hanlon on 26 February 1985:</P>
    <P>That Dáil Éireann calls on the <Col N="1041" /> Government to provide the necessary funds for each health board to make good the shortfall in their 1985 budgets so that they will be in a position to provide an adequate and satisfactory level of health care for the people in their respective areas.</P>
    <P>Debate resumed on amendment No. 1:</P>
    <P>To delete all words after &ldquo;Dáil Éireann&rdquo; and substitute the following:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;notes that the Government has provided in the 1985 allocations to health boards sufficient funds to enable each health board to provide an adequate and satisfactory level of health care for the people in their respective areas&rdquo;.</P>
    <P Just="Right">&mdash;(Minister for Health).</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamAylward" hpid="Mr. Aylward Mr. Aylward">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aylward</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  I agree that an adequate and satisfactory service is not being provided at present when one considers the cutbacks and reductions that have been carried out by health boards in their finances and services over the past few years.  I must admit that some years ago there was a case for cutting back on expenditure in the health service.  However, these cutbacks have been implemented and many long and agonising hours have been spent by members of health boards in trying to achieve these reductions.  In 1983 and 1984 huge savings were made by health boards, but there is a limit to how far cutbacks can go and that limit has certainly been reached.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to speak about the South Eastern Health Board of which I am a member.  The allocation to the South Eastern Health Board in 1984 represented a reduction of £3.5 million.  Additional factors in 1984 called for a further reduction of £0.8 million.  We all know that this included the removal of food subsidies, which cost the health boards a very substantial amount of money.  When the Minister was making his allocations he did not anticipate that food subsidies were going to be cut and he made no <Col N="1042" /> compensation to the health boards.  This resulted in a required overall reduction in expenditure of £4.3 million.  The reduction actually achieved in 1984 amounted to £3.2 million, resulting in an estimated over-expenditure at the end of 1984 of £1.1 million, which had a twofold effect on 1985 figures.  It represented a first charge on the 1985 allocation and it represented the extent to which expenditure remains to be reduced in 1985 arising from the 1984 allocation.</P>
    <P>The residual effect of the 1984 allocation, together with the reduction in the 1985 allocation, resulted in an overall reduction in 1985 requirements of £3.9 million, made up as follows.  There is a deficit of £1.1 million carried forward from 1984.  There is an amount required in 1985 to reduce expenditure to the authorised 1984 level of £1.1 million and there is a further amount required to reduce expenditure to the authorised 1985 level of £1.76 million, making a total of £3.96 million.</P>
    <P>The South Eastern Health Board held two meetings at which the financial position for 1985 was considered.  At their first meeting they considered and approved reductions in expenditure of £1.727 million, and this was not easily arrived at. It included cutbacks in energy, staffing, transport, maintenance, reductions in overtime, medical appliances, equipment and the number of <i>locums.</i></P>
    <P>There is one matter to which I should like to refer, not with the intention to scare, but out of concern.  The Minister has not taken into consideration the fire risk factor which exists in the buildings in the South Eastern Health Board area. They are all two and three storeys high. Patients are located upstairs in these buildings but nothing can be done to bring them down to ground level because there is no finance available.  There are also reductions in staff and overtime curbs and there are not sufficient numbers of nurses on duty at night to cope should a disaster occur.  The Minister should take particular note of this.</P>
    <P>At their second meeting the South Eastern Health Board considered a list of recommendations from the programme <Col N="1043" /> committee as to possible further reductions. However, in considering these further reductions the board were very conscious of the extent to which services were underprovided.  They had a list of these underprovided services which amounted to £3.5 million approximately. Such underprovisions may be attributed to the underfunding in recent years.  For example, since 1980 the South Eastern Health Board allocation has been cut by a cumulative amount of £11.092 million. If the 1980 allocations were updated, having regard to the value of the punt since then, the board's allocation for 1985 would be £100.66 million instead of £83.5 million which they received this year, a difference of approximately £17 million.</P>
    <P>Another example is the underprovision of funds to the board compared to other health boards.  We are all aware that the health boards are undergoing very serious financial difficulties but I want to make a comparison showing that the South Eastern Health Board are worse off than the others.  A recent survey of comparisons shows that the allocation in 1984 per head of population is £275.4 compared with the national figure of £301.  If you multiply that by a figure of 394,000, the number which the South Eastern Health Board are catering for, it amounts to a gross figure of £9.7 million.</P>
    <P>The allocation for 1985 has not only failed to redress the low allocation per head in the South Eastern Health Board region compared to others, but it has failed even to provide the same average percentage increase given to other regions for 1985.  I will give further examples of the differences in this region as against the national average.  In acute beds there are 3.1 per 1,000 head of population and the national average is 4.3 per 1,000 head.  The average cost per bed in county hospitals is £646 and the national average is £674.  A geriatric bed costs £59 and the national average is £159.  The average cost in a welfare home in the south east region is £73 and the national average is £85.  In regional hospitals in the south east area, the cost is £747 and the national average is £842.  There are <Col N="1044" /> 20 consultants per 100,000 head of population and the national average is 33 per 100,000 head of population.  I could go on and on.  In the general medical service it costs £56 per patient in the South Eastern Health Board area and the national average is £66 per patient.  These figures speak for themselves and indicate that the South Eastern Health Board are getting a particularly raw deal from the Minister.  Instead of giving credit for good housekeeping, he has penalised the South Eastern Health Board.</P>
    <P>I also wish to refer to the many completed units which are lying idle all over the country because the Minister will not approve the provision of staff and equipment. The geriatric unit in Ardkeen, County Waterford, was completed in 1984 and it lies unopened.  We have the scandalous situation of the maternity unit in St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny, which was completed in 1983 at a cost of £240,000 and has been lying idle since. The Minister said we must provide staff and equipment from our own resources although it must now be obvious, even to him, that that is not remotely possible.  I visited St. Luke's Hospital last Monday and I was shocked to see the number of beds in the corridors, end to end, with medical appliances, drips, etc., especially when one considers that there is a brand new unit lying idle.</P>
    <P>These are some of the hardships being imposed on patients by the Minister.</P>
    <P>This is not being said by Members on this side of the House only but also by members of the Minister's party, health board officials and concerned individuals. I appeal to the Minister to take note of what was said in this motion and to show his concern by meeting the genuine and sincere demands of the health board, particularly to protect the weaker sections of the community which his party claim to represent.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardBruton" hpid="Mr. R. Bruton Mr. R. Bruton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Bruton</NameTxt>
      <P>One thing that strikes me about the growth of public spending is that when we have a prolonged period of growth we do not seem to get great results but when there is talk of cutbacks in spending the proposals put forward are <Col N="1045" /> of an extraordinary nature.  Nowhere is this more vivid than in the case of the health services.  We have had dramatic growth in spending in that area over the last ten years but now that there are small restrictions on the budget proposed, proposals are put forward which involve shutting down expensive equipment, the non-use of units in which there was expensive investment and the threat of the loss of life.</P>
      <P>There has been a doubling of real resources absorbed by the health services in the last ten years and the suggestions about the effects of the cutbacks must be looked at in that context.  Can we seriously entertain the suggestion that loss of life or huge waiting lists are realistic outcomes of small reductions in the allocations?  The reality is that these betray poor allocation of resources within the health boards.  They are unwilling to face up to decisions about priority, where money is best spent and what equipment is best used.</P>
      <P>There are unique features about the health services.  There are limitless medical possibilities of spending resources to prolong life and the decisions about the use of medical resources are not made by patients but by doctors.  These have enormous implications regarding the need for health boards to have systems to channel resources to the areas where need is greatest.  Health boards have failed to face up to this.  There are plenty of grounds to suggest that resources are not going to areas of greatest need.  I will cite some examples from documents published in the last 12 months.  The NESC Report, No. 73, reveals that we have 50 per cent more acute beds than in England and Wales.  That is evidence of a very high degree of concentration on the hospital resource.  That is strengthened by the discovery that one in six consultations with a family doctor leads to a referral to hospital or to a consultant. That is twice the rate of the UK.  These are features which are pushing our health services towards the unusually expensive resource of hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In hospitals there are many problems of resource use.  For example, a recent <Col N="1046" /> study of the GMS service revealed that 40 per cent of short stay admissions to hospital could have been dealt with elsewhere at a lower cost.  It also revealed that there is substantial evidence of excessive use of expensive diagnostic procedures by junior hospital doctors.  Very many attenders at out-patient services could have been dealt with by their general practitioner.  What is happening is that we have an undue emphasis on the hospital resource.</P>
    <P>The cost of a week in hospital to the taxpayer is £1,200.  That is taking into account not only the running cost but the capital cost of being in hospital.  That kind of evidence shows we are using resources in a profligate fashion.  By deciding where our priorities lay we could get a better health service and save resources.</P>
    <P>As I have said, one in six persons are admitted to acute hospitals every year. Typically their stay is longer than need be and there is no proper control of the resources used in their treatment.  We need to redress that problem and ensure that the resources used are used effectively and are not squandered on people who do not need them, thus denying them to people who may need them.  We have tended to build up a false faith in the power of hospital to cure ills instead of realising that facing up to the problems of ill health requires a response from the community and the individual.</P>
    <P>Instead of whining about the budgetary restraints imposed on the health boards we should be addressing the serious problems of how to get the best quality health services in a climate where the nation cannot afford to increase resources at the dramatic rate at which they were being absorbed by the health services.  I am convinced that health boards can make do with less and provide the same quality of service if they face up to fundamental issues.  One of the fundamental issues is that if there are beds they will be filled. The national planning board made that point fairly clear in its document.  Experience in the last ten years shows that despite the fact that we were able to reduce the length of stay in hospitals we <Col N="1047" /> did not succeed in making hospital beds redundant.  There were always people to fill the beds which supposedly were being saved by shorter hospital stays.  We must ask if all our hospitals are effective and should continue to operate.  They are a very expensive resource.</P>
    <P>The Department must begin to look at the more fundamental issues of the management of medical resources.  They have manfully tried to improve management practices relating to stores, the use of energy, transport and pricing policies but these, while important, are dwarfed by the real decisions which absorb resources and they are the medical decisions. We must ensure that there is ability to look at medical decisions in a management framework.  Resources used wastefully on one person are resources denied to another in greater need.</P>
    <P>There are three sectors in the health service, the primary sector, the out-patient sector and the in-patient sector. Half the population have to pay for primary care, the sector which is cheapest. The sectors which are much more expensive in the way that they absorb resources &mdash; in-patient and out-patient services &mdash; are free to the vast majority of the population. I am not saying that we should charge people for these services but there is a contradiction in saying to people that they should pay for primary care but have the more expensive resources free of charge.  We must face up to that perverse incentive.  It is hardly surprising that out-patient facilities are filled with people who could be treated effectively by their own doctor.  As a result of the financial incentive we present to them we are telling them to go to the out-patients where they will be treated free of charge as against going to their local doctor which could cost them £7 or £8.  These problems are accentuated by the effect of VHI on our health service.</P>
    <P>Another issue we must confront if we are to come to grips with the better use of resources is that the community care organisation of health boards has failed to come up with a structured support mechanism for people who seek to be <Col N="1048" /> treated in the community.  There are problems of non-co-operation between sections of community care.  There is also the problem that community care has not a proper allocation of resources within health board budgets to make it an effective option to hospitalisation.  We must address that point seriously if we are to achieve better results from the resources which, inevitably, over the next five years will be straitened.</P>
    <P>There is no admission policy effectively operating in many hospitals.  Over half the admissions to hospitals come through the out-patient clinics.  Patients are not coming into hospital on a planned basis. They come in on spec to out-patient clinics and are admitted to hospital.  That is not a proper way to conduct an admission policy.  We need to have proper criteria to decide who gets into hospital.  There must be greater screening of out-patient clinics to prevent people being admitted to hospital who could be treated elsewhere and also to prevent return calls to out-patient clinics which may be clinically unnecessary.</P>
    <P>There is a great deal to be done by the hospitals in developing alternatives to long stays in hospitals.  In the US, for example, there has developed the idea of same day surgery whereby a person can be admitted, treated and discharged on the day.  However, if we are to adopt that option we must have a sensible community care programme by which we can provide a back-up service outside hospital.</P>
    <P>We must address the issue of the lack of knowledge on our part about the treatment costs being incurred by different consultants and in different hospitals. There is ample evidence that the length of stay varies enormously from one hospital to another in respect of the same sort of treatment.  That is a question we must come to grips with but we must first have systematic information about the position. I would sound a note of warning that when we are providing computer facilities we are not doing so purely for the benefit of the administrative side, in the interest of efficient transport schemes or of stores.  We must provide computer facilities also for the purpose of enabling <Col N="1049" /> us to monitor the cost of specialist treatment. It is only when that knowledge is available to consultants that they can learn from the practice of their fellows and develop a more cost effective service. It rests with our doctors in the hospitals to develop cost effective management. They must not be tempted to hide behind professional rituals or merely to say that it has been their professional practice always to operate in such a way.  We cannot afford to hide behind defences of that kind.  If we do not manage our resources effectively we will be denying services to those in greatest need.</P>
    <P>It is disappointing that the present debate about our health services has been conducted at such a politically charged level.  It is no accident that that has been the case.  Serious problems within the health board structure have been highlighted during the debate.  One of these problems relates to the health boards not having responsibility for funding nor for decisions in relation to the use of resources. This has a very damaging effect because they devote more attention to defending budgets and to perhaps using the health boards for political purposes than to the question of coming to grips with providing a cost effective service, or of using the resources available to them in the best interests of the community.</P>
    <P>We need also to clarify the relationship between the health boards and the Minister. It seems that the whole relationship, both in terms of finance and on policy issues is extremely murky.  Publicly there are debates on the question of what precisely is over-spending or what are the shortfalls in budgets.  It seems as if the Minister and the boards are poles apart, that they are not part of the same team trying to secure better results for the community. The type of <i>ad hoc</i> allocation of funds that has occurred between the Minister and the boards, in the absence of proper co-operation or of a proper addressing of the fundamental issues in the health services, must be ended.</P>
    <P>I am convinced that the problems in the health services are not problems of scarcity of resources but of arranging our resources so as to put them to the best <Col N="1050" /> use possible.  With better planning on the part of the health boards the phenomena discribed by Opposition spokesmen, whether real or threatened, such as expensive equipment being left idle, the danger of loss of life and long waiting lists, need not occur.</P>
    <P>The motion before the House portrays a continued unwillingness on the part of the main Opposition to face up to the nature of our current economic difficulties. Government spending is 80 per cent of income.  Our working population bear savage tax burdens.  On another day and in another debate spokesmen for the Opposition would bring tears to one's eyes talking about the need to reduce the burden on the hard pressed taxpayer but if we are to reduce the burden we must face up to the need to reduce the dramatic absorption of resources within the health services and we must do so in a way that will not damage the health services.  The Opposition must be prepared to face up to the real issues and to the way in which those are dealt with.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BernardAllen" hpid="Mr. Allen Mr. Allen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I support some of the points made by Deputy Bruton.  I submit that the reason for the VHI contribution increases announced last evening can be traced back to the escalation in the cost of the hospital services.  Last evening I heard some Opposition speakers criticise the cutbacks in the health services.  They criticised the Minister's attempt to achieve savings in the system.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In November last I spoke on our policy document, <i>Building on Reality</i> and I criticised the level of efficiency of hospitals within the health system.  I advocated that the Minister set up an agency that would have responsibility for running the hospitals, that the major hospitals be removed from the health board system and that local boards of management be set up and be responsible to the national agency.  The Minister has not accepted those suggestions but he must take action immediately to deal with the problem of escalating costs.  His attempts to achieve savings, especially in the southern health board area, have been made a political football.  In the Cork-Kerry region we <Col N="1051" /> were subjected to a lot of criticism by our political opponents both within and outside the health services because of the Minister's attempts to achieve savings.</P>
    <P>One area in which the Minister could achieve savings would be by removing some of the health care services from the hospital system.  He should concentrate on ways of achieving savings in the health scheme.  I wonder if those who criticise the Minister have read the report of the working party who reported last year on the general medical services and of how to achieve savings in the system.  This report must be considered seriously because it deals comprehensively with the family doctor service and emphasises the importance of developing the educational and preventive role of future GPs. More attention must be given to training programmes for family doctors and we must emphasise the importance of training tomorrow's GPs to be better able to deal with the number of problems which at present are being admitted to hospitals. The current problem of over-prescribing drugs which is so prevalent in the medical profession must also be examined. However, it is not good enough to reduce the number of people in hospital because that would take people from the hospitals who would end up in the community, and present structures and resources are inadequate to cater for people in the community.</P>
    <P>I have said previously in the House that the greatest consumers of the Department of Health finances are the hospitals.  We are spending vast amounts of money on specialist services there, and we are giving scant attention to the development of structure and care within the community. Therefore, the vocational training schemes being operated for GPs in Ireland are not getting the necessary recognition they justify and deserve.  Any finance invested in this type of training will give a thousandfold return.  To date the help and recognition given by the Department of Health in this area is insufficient and inadequate.  However, I am aware that the Minister recognises the need for a full and comprehensive GP <Col N="1052" /> training programme by means of finance and back-up service which have been inadequate to date.</P>
    <P>Unfortunately, at present unless the public get consultant attention they feel they are being short changed.  Routine tests are being referred to consultants at enormous cost within the hospital service, even though they could be done by the GP outside the hospital sphere.  What is required is the instilling in the public of confidence in the GP service within the community which can be brought about only by the proper training of the GP which in turn can come about only by proper financial backing from the Department of Health for the vocational programmes.  The attitude of the community to health care must be to keep the patient out of hospital if at all possible, and this can be done only by developing the confidence of the community in the GP by ensuring that he can give the level of service that the public have come to expect.  However, in most situations the GP is being bypassed in favour of very expensive specialist hospital services at enormous cost to the Exchequer. This trend must be reversed as soon as possible.  We must attack the escalation of hospital costs at once, otherwise the service will consume the full health budget.</P>
    <P>I turn to local matters.  I have referred to the position in the Southern Health Board and the political footballing that has been carried out recently concerning the £9.5 million deficit in which that health board allegedly find themselves. We advocated at the time that the Department of Health would take a more than keen interest in the affairs of that board, and I was delighted to learn that the board find now as a result of a departmental investigation that they are not in a £9.5 million deficit but far less than half of what was alleged in October and November.</P>

We have all made our views known to the Minister and his officials privately and it should be left at that for the present.  Ongoing discussions are taking place between the medical staff in the North Infirmary and the Mercy Hospital on the rationalisation of services between these two hospitals, and it is irresponsible and a disservice to the North Infirmary to give the impression to the public that all is not well with the quality of service in that hospital.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Naughten</NameTxt>
      <P>I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak for even a few minutes in this debate.  I endorse the sentiments expressed by the previous speaker.  The Minister is in an extremely difficult situation in having to provide gigantic sums of money that the health service needs at present.  The Minister pointed out in the House the massive increase in health expenditure in the last ten years, from £143 million in 1973-74 to £1,100 million in this financial year.  Of course, we would all like to see additional finance available for the health service and every other service, but this finance can be got only by additional taxation.  I find it very difficult to meet anybody today who is prepared to pay additional taxation for the services being provided.  I have no doubt that the amounts of money provided by the Minister this year will be sufficient to provide an adequate standard of service.  Listening to the Opposition crying about the massive reduction in the amounts of money available to the health boards etc., one could not but remember that they were the first people to put the pressure on health boards in 1982.  I remember the then Government speakers who are now in Opposition welcoming the cuts introduced by Deputy Woods then.</P>
      <P>We have one of the best health services in the civilised world, and I have no doubt that with an all-out effort at co-operation between the health boards and the Minister the standard of service and the money provided will be adequate.  I regret that these cuts seem to become a political football.  In the health board in my area the one reason the budget has not been discussed is politics.  That is a sad reflection on the board.  I have no doubt that the £110 million plus that the Minister has provided, which in effect is £370 for every person living in Mayo, Galway and Roscommon will be totally adequate to provide the services we need there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is important to remember the gigantic increase in the numbers of staff employed in the health service since 1973-74.  At that time they had 40,000 employed whereas today they have 60,000 employed.  We must face up to the <Col N="1055" /> difficult situation that the Government face in providing the type of service that people seem to demand.  All the publicity in the national papers regarding the closing of certain institutions, particularly geriatric institutions in the Western Health Board, was just political propaganda and there is no danger whatsoever to those institutions.  Each day we hear the Opposition using the opportunity of the reductions in the health service to seek more money, but in the last few months the Opposition have sought additional moneys for a whole range of things. I challenge them here tonight to say precisely where they are to get this money. They are looking for an additional £200 million to refloat Irish Shipping Limited. They were going to wipe away local authority charges which were costing another £30 million.  They were going to give an additional £350 million for public service pay.  They sought another £40 million for Verolme Cork Dockyard.  They were going to inject £200 million into the economy for infrastructure.</P>
    <P>This is the type of irresponsible opposition that we have not alone here in the Dáil but at health board level.  If there is all-out co-operation between the health boards and the Minister we can live within our budget.  I tell the Minister tonight that if this co-operation is not forthcoming he should consider seriously reverting the control of health services to the local authorities where it lay prior to 1972.  I consider that very many local authorities gave a standard of health service as good as we have today. Money will not save lives.  What we need is co-ordinated co-operation from everyone involved in the health services.  If we have that lives will not be lost.</P>
    <Speaker pid="Bertie" hpid="Mr. B. Ahern Mr. B. Ahern">
      <NameTxt>Mr. B. Ahern</NameTxt>
      <P>As our time is limited I will confine my remarks mainly to the Eastern Health Board.  I do not believe this side of the House have made this matter a political football.  I am a member of the Eastern Health Board and I know that that board have been most constructive in their actions and have tried extremely hard to work in co-operation <Col N="1056" /> with the officials of the Department of Health.  The members have not been political when dealing with matters of interest to the people of the greater Dublin area, of Wicklow and of Kildare.  We have tried to provide as good a service as possible with the money available.  Perhaps the situation is slightly different in my area because the board are directly involved in the provision of community, psychiatric and geriatric care, and with services for the mentally handicapped for some 400,000 people.</P>
      <P>We all know that, for whatever reason, there have been cutbacks.  When the Minister was in Opposition he frequently made the point that our health services were excellent and were far more advanced than those available in other countries.  He often told us he did not want to undermine those services.  In his contribution in the House during a vote of confidence in November 1982 he said prior to the election that was held on 24 November 1982 that a major commitment of the Labour Party was that they would not accept cutting the deficit over five or six years.  The main reason according to him was that it would break the structure of the health services that had been built up by successive Governments.  However, because of Cabinet pressures &mdash; I can understand them &mdash; he has lost many of the battles at the Cabinet table and he has had to implement severe cuts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I admit that like many other services the health services had some room to manoeuvre and they had a certain amount of fat that could have been eliminated. However, that could not continue indefinitely.  It is not possible to continue on a low base to cut back without running the risk of eliminating certain services and the Minister, his officials, the CEOs of the health boards and all Members of this House know that.  There is not much point arguing about political footballs. The figures provide for cutbacks of the order of £37 million but I have no doubt that the gap that exists between what is available and what is required can be bridged.  There is always something that can be done: it is the way Estimates are <Col N="1057" /> prepared.  If the Minister is to be fair and honest and if he is to follow the line he has consistently pursued he must accept that there have been considerable cutbacks, whether for economic or other reasons.</P>
    <P>In the Eastern Health Board we have tried on an all-party basis to cope with the inevitable reduction in services caused by the lack of resources in the past few years. We decided we should maintain services for those most at risk, that we should move the delivery of health care services from institutions to the community where this is possible and practicable and that we should maintain basic staff employment to the greatest extent possible.  That is the position we have taken.</P>
    <P>There are major difficulties in the Eastern Health Board to a greater extent than in other areas.  The population in this area is growing at a more rapid rate than elsewhere throughout the nation and is far higher than European levels.  There is a continuing and significant increase in the dependent population in the greater Dublin area &mdash; by that I mean children, those people who are at risk and the elderly.  We have told the Minister that in times of difficulty those most at risk tend to come to the city for protection to obtain services and all that has put great demands on the Eastern Health Board. We have argued that we merit more assistance than others.  Most of the acute hospitals in the city do not come within the ambit of the Eastern Health Board. However, the hospitals at Naas and St. Columcille's, Loughlinstown, are at a stage of development where there is a marked increase in activity and consequently their costs are increasing.  It is not possible to talk about cutbacks for areas like Tallaght and Blanchardstown which are growing areas.</P>
    <P>I am sure the Minister will acknowledge that the Eastern Health Board have tried extremely hard to cope for many years but it is not possible to expect them to take cutbacks of £5 million without substantially reducing services that are far from adequate.  Waiting lists are increasing, there is a lack of community services and the services in a number <Col N="1058" /> of areas that were quite good are now declining.  A visit to any of the health centres in the city will show what I mean. Most of the buildings of the Eastern Health Board in the city are old and they require substantial repairs.  In respect of mental care, the board are trying hard to renovate their premises and to update the facilities.  This applies to St. Brendan's and to St. Ita's, Portrane.  That cannot be done if they have not the money.  On the non-capital side there will be costs in respect of heating and maintenance of these buildings.</P>
    <P>I plead with the Minister to try to give us the extra resources.  It is not our job to say where the money should come from.  I know the Minister has difficulties at the Cabinet table but that is his function. He must realise that in the past three or four years the health services have suffered more than many other areas.  For instance, education has seemed not to have suffered to the same extent from the cutbacks.  In this motion we ask the Minister to go back to the Cabinet and to argue for those who cannot argue for themselves.  Many of those people are incapacitated or are in mental homes and many need community services.  They cannot march to this House like other lobbies and they cannot come here as do other pressure groups. It is our obligation as an Opposition to fight for them and it is the obligation of the Minister to act as he has always said he would, namely, not to allow essential services to be eliminated for those who cannot pay for them.</P>
    <P>There are many areas in which this Government have spent money and where economies could be made.  Cutbacks should not be made by asking people to delay going to hospital, by allowing waiting lists to increase and by closing wards.  We should not try to turn the health service into a five day week as though people did not get sick on a Saturday or a Sunday.</P>
    <P>The situation may not be as bad as it is portrayed but it is serious.  It is not good enough to say the matter is being treated as a political football.  We have to fight for those who cannot fight for <Col N="1059" /> themselves and that is what the Minister did during his political life.  He should go back to the Government and argue for as much of that £37 million as is needed to maintain these services at a proper level.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PadraidFlynn" hpid="Mr. Flynn Mr. Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Flynn</NameTxt>
      <P>Our position could be summarised in the following way.  We believe that in a time of deep recession and falling living standards, where household budgets are being attacked every day by increased costs and prices, it is not appropriate for a Minister for Health to seek to reduce the level of services he provides to the community.  The reductions and cutbacks the Minister proposes will result in very significant reductions in the quality and quantity of services people have become accustomed to.  There is no doubt but that there is at present under the Minister's direction a dismantling of the fabric of the health services.  These are not the words of the Opposition Party trying to score political points off the Minister.  These are the words being uttered by the executive offices operating under the health boards.  These people, the front line administrators and executives, are saying that there is an inevitability in what he is proposing by direction to them, that there has to be a reduction in the quantity and quality of the services being provided.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a credibility gap with the Minister which has to be bridged this evening and it stems from his directions at the Newbridge meeting to the chief executive officers.  He made it clear in very explicit terms that there would be no additional funding this year to help bridge the gap.  He also said he expected that they would comply with the guidelines laid down under the national plan. He said that these guidelines would have to be met and there was no alternative as far as he was concerned.  This is a strange stand for a Minister to take in the present circumstances.  He will have to accept that his public statements do not stand up when he refers to the extent and the level of the services being provided by his Department.  He maintains there is no lessening of the standard, quantity or <Col N="1060" /> quality of the services available and no hardship is being endured by people at this time.  The Minister will not acknowledge that there is curtailment of services in the health sector.  He does not appreciate the staff situation in health boards and hospitals at this time.  He will have to admit that, whatever he might think about the level of services the Department provide, people's expectations have not lessened over the past few years despite the fact that he would like it if there was a lessening in demand for the services.  The statistics are there.  They are not being brought forward by the Opposition party, but by the executives who man the health services on his behalf.</P>
    <P>The Minister fails to appreciate the population growth over the past number of years.  If there had been a decrease in population over the past ten years one might be expected to say that if fewer people are demanding the services then some cutbacks or savings might be made. But there has been a population increase and, worse still, the level of demand on the health services has increased because of the number of people who are unemployed and unable to provide the health services they require from their own resources.  We have seen a further extension of that in the recent past so far as Voluntary Health Insurance costs are concerned.  The effect of the increased VHI premia means that more people will not be able to meet the demands to get the necessary health services.  Consequently there will be a throw-back on to the services the Minister is already reducing.  There will be an increased demand from those who will not be able to fund their own requirement under the VHI scheme.  This will mean that the VHI will be an exclusive club for those in the higher income bracket only.  This must put increased pressure on the existing services run by the health boards. How can they meet that demand if it is agreed by the executives and by all those who provide these services that there has been a diminution in the services and that there has been a lessening in the quantity and quality of those services?</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1061" /> This can be backed up so far as the Western Health Board are concerned by one simple fact.  This is not the first year the Minister issued a directive on cutbacks. This is an ongoing demand.  Last year in the health board area dealing with Mayo, Galway and Roscommon there was a cutback of £4½ million.  The board managed to get within £500,000 of that figure.  One would expect that in ministerial generosity, having effected a saving of £4 million, the Minister might have made available from supplementary money at least that £500,000 shortfall so that it would not be carried on as a first charge against the services of the board this year.  What was the result of the board making that exceptional effort? They were the only board out of the eight which had such a good performance, but what is their reward?  They end up with a 4.79 per cent increase on the 1984 Estimate, the lowest increase granted to any health board in the country, despite the fact that the population structure in the Western Health Board area is completely at variance with the situation which exists in other health board areas &mdash; they have many people of advanced years living in unaccessible areas, living long distances from institutions and who need transport because they often live hundreds of miles from their nearest health institution.</P>
    <P>That is the health board the Minister is threatening with dissolution.  Because they made such a fine effort last year, they are condemned this year to the lowest percentage increase on their estimates.</P>
    <P>People's expectations have not lessened. The Minister has been asked, if people's expectations are not decreasing and if there is a bigger demand on these services, what does he propose doing.  He says there should be bigger involvement in community care services.  May I put it to him that the budgets attached to the community care services are statutory allowances under the disabled person's maintenance allowance scheme.  What he has done is to draw money from the acute care services but he has not transferred that money into providing increased allocations for community care.  In other <Col N="1062" /> words, he is taking money from the acute services but he is not giving the community care operation a satisfactory chance to bring about a situation where there will be a lesser demand on acute services. That is the situation in the Western Health Board area.  There has been an enormous cutback in the past year.</P>
    <P>Last year medical and surgical appliances, drugs, medicines, maintenance, X-ray expenses and grants to voluntary organisations were withdrawn.  We have to put it on record that the adult dental and ophthalmic schemes were suspended totally in September last.  Medical wards were closed for three months.  A surgical ward was closed for two months.  Two gynaecological wards were closed for three months.  Five units were closed for a total of seven months and an orthopaedic theatre was closed for two months; and as well as these cutbacks we have to do more this year.  That is the demand the Minister is making.  How can he in all honesty say that he is not dismantling the health services?</P>
    <Speaker pid="LiamHyland" hpid="Mr. Hyland Mr. Hyland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hyland</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no area of public administration where the social conscience of the Government is more effectively demonstrated than in the delivery of health care and in the implementation of the social welfare code.  Government policy in this area should endeavour to reflect the expectations and values of the society in which it operates.  Irish values and attitudes in this very important area have been to care for the sick, for the old and for the underprivileged.  That unique quality in the character of the people has been reflected throughout the world in the dedication of our nurses, nuns and the medical profession generally.  These expectations and values like so many of our other values have become submerged in the jungle of confusion of the so-called monetarist policies being pursued by this Government.  The House will agree that this Government's attitude to our health services is in very sharp contrast to the reasoned, concerned and well informed view put forward by our spokesman on health.  Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, in his opening contribution to this debate.  This <Col N="1063" /> House would do well to listen to him. The Minister should be guided by his expertise and his great knowledge in this area.  I would urge the Minister to desist from any action which will further undermine the health services.  The Minister should recognise that the cutbacks of the past three years have put the health services in jeopardy and many health boards fear that in 1985 they will not be able to discharge their statutory responsibilities.</P>
      <P>We support the Minister in his efforts to achieve efficiency.  I admit that some wasteful expenditure was eliminated in the first years of the cutbacks introduced by the Minister and great credit is due to the hospital staff and administrators who assisted in this important exercise.  Those committed people are now totally disillusioned as they watch the service deteriorate to the extent that hospital wards are closing, staffing levels are reduced to an extremely dangerous level in many hospitals and, indeed, in some instances essential operations have been deferred due to inadequate resources.  It is wrong that people who have worked all their lives and who cannot afford to pay for operations should have to wait indefinitely for orthopaedic surgery.  It is wrong for a country with such a proud record in nurse training to have understaffed hospitals and it is wrong that young students have to emigrate to get employment.  The Minister has had repeated requests from health boards and hospitals to bring the staffing levels up to a standard which will at least provide reasonable services in hospitals.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the general hospital in Portlaoise at night there is only one nurse on duty in the male ward and one nurse on duty in the female ward and if there is an emergency during the night these nurses have to deal with it.  Even the Minister would agree that this is unsatisfactory.  I am disappointed that the Minister in his efforts to rationalise the hospital services did not recognise the importance of the psychiatric services and the need to make sufficient resources available to keep abreast of developments and research in <Col N="1064" /> general hospital training which is of growing importance to many people.</P>
    <P>It should not be necessary to remind the Minister that the level of service to medical card holders has seriously declined under his administration and that many families who are marginally outside the qualifying limit for medical cards are unable to provide for the medical needs of their families because of mortgage commitments, unemployment and so on.  The Minister would be well advised to take a serious look at the position of those people.  To the extent that medical cards are now the criteria for qualifying for school transport many parents now have to provide for school transport as well as for all their other commitments.  We are talking about a new poor.  These people are under pressure. They are proud people who never looked to the State for assistance in the past but due to the severe economic pressures on them they are now in difficulties. The Minister and the Government should take a special look at their position.</P>
    <P>The greatest hardship of all for which the Minister and his Department are responsible is the delay in dealing with social welfare claims.  I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will advise me that this is slightly&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <P>The Midland Health Board were faced <Col N="1065" /> in 1985 with a £2 million cutback.  I compliment the CEO and members of the health board on their responsible attitude in facing up to these cutbacks and in putting to the Minister for his consideration a new development programme for the Midland Health Board area.  I understand that their proposal has been accepted by the Minister.  I appeal to the Minister to leave no stone unturned to make the necessary resources available to the board for the implementation of this new rationalisation programme which hopefully will lead to a general overall improvement of service in the Midland Health Board area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mrs. E. Desmond</NameTxt>
      <P>This motion put down for discussion by the Opposition has its genesis in the outcries that have been skilfully orchestrated by their local representatives in health boards throughout the country, particularly in the Southern and Western Health Boards.  I am most familiar with the Southern Health Board and we have had nothing but uproar and outcry since the board were given an allocation of £138 million for 1985.  That sum represented an increase of £10 million on the previous year's allocation, but that was not adverted to at all.  Instead, perhaps capriciously, a figure of £9.5 million was represented as the shortfall on what was required to run the services.  That figure was conjured out of the air.  That £9.5 million was referred to as if it was an established fact.  It was anything but that.  The impossibility, we were told, for the health board being able to manage with such a shortfall has become part of the local and national lore.  We have read daily about threats of wholesale job losses, of hospital closures and bed shortages, of cutbacks in services, of decisions to cut maternity leave and to interfere with student nurses' wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>All these horrific solutions to the shortfall were trotted out.  It would have been bad enough to present the frightening solutions if the problem had really existed <Col N="1066" /> to the extent that it was represented to exist.  How much worse was it to present the problem when the shortfall was not an established fact at all?  These comments were the result of a political shot in the dark.  I understand that the shortfall in the Southern Health Board will be less than half the figure claimed.  I believe it will be about £4 million or even less.  If what I have been told is true I have very serious doubts in my mind about why such a furore was raised in the first place or what the purpose of it was.  Was it an exercise to exacerbate things for the Government in an area which has suffered more than its share of job losses? As somebody not involved in a health board, I have had information only from the press and from friends who are members of the health board.  It is unforgivable to use as a political football the health services on which the sick, the handicapped and the deprived depend.</P>
    <Speaker pid="DenisFoley" hpid="Mr. Foley Mr. Foley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Foley</NameTxt>
      <P>I fully support the motion calling on the Government to provide the essential funds to the health boards to make good the shortfall in their 1985 budgets.  The health boards this year will be short of about £40 million.  I had occasion to visit Cappagh last October. I was amazed to be informed by the medical staff that they were being forced to abandon or curtail their programme for hip and knee replacements due to lack of finance.  This was a big disappointment to people on the waiting list, many of whom had hoped they would have had their operations by Christmas.  We have been told that Ireland provides the second lowest amount <i>per capita</i> for health services of all EC countries. I appeal to the Minister for Health to reconsider cuts in health service expenditure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I wish to plead with the Minister to reconsider the provision of a kidney unit in the new general hospital in Tralee.  In Kerry, patients from different parts of the county suffering from chronic kidney disease, must travel to Cork three days weekly to spend five hours on a kidney machine.  They have to rise as early as 4 a.m. and travel by bus to reach Cork <Col N="1067" /> by 8 a.m.  Regardless of sickness or the prevailing weather conditions they must reach Cork for life saving treatment, travelling over some of the worst roads in Ireland from such places as Dingle, Annascaul and south Kerry.  That puts a great strain on both patients and families. The patients accept their illness with remarkable courage and the long, tiring journey to Cork is the most difficult part to accept.  A kidney unit nearer home, in the Tralee General Hospital, would alleviate much of the strain and inconvenience attached to their treatment.</P>
    <P>The Irish Kidney Association recently completed a feasibility study on the need for a unit in Kerry and are satisfied that such a unit would be in the best interests of the patients and would have the support of the medical profession.  The initial cost of establishing the unit would be about £100,000.  The Irish Kidney Association have established a number of sub-committees in Kerry to raise the money.  Having done so, they will approach the Minister for Health to staff and maintain the unit.  I hope the Minister will respond to this magnificent effort by the people of Kerry in providing £100,000 for this worthy cause.  The Tralee General Hospital, which opened early last year with about 50 per cent occupancy only, was given a commitment that it would be fully operational by October 1984.  It is still not fully operational, and with the financial constraints in the Southern Health Board, there is a danger that 80 beds will have to be closed which will create a number of redundancies.  I hope the Minister will not allow this to happen.</P>
    <P>Health boards can no longer provide accommodation for geriatric patients. I suggest to the Minister that a subsidy scheme should be established to help patients who have to depend on the private sector to accommodate them.  In most cases their old age pensions will not cover the accommodation costs.  Community care calls for a special capital allocation.</P>
    <P>I should like to congratulate the CEO, staff and members of the Southern <Col N="1068" /> Health Board on the service they are providing in such severe financial circumstances. I hope the Minister will note the appeals made here tonight in regard to the shortfall of the Southern Health Board.</P>

      <P>The contribution by Deputy Eileen Desmond highlights the difference between the Government and the Opposition.  The Government are obsessed with money and its spending but we are concerned about the care of patients, of the ill, the elderly and the handicapped who are unable to look after their needs.  That is what the debate is about.  Deputy Eileen Desmond suggested that it was orchestrated for political reasons, particularly in the Southern Health Board area, an exercise to exacerbate things for the Government.  We do not need to exacerbate things for the Government through a health debate because that has already happened through their economic policy.  This debate is about the care of people who are ill and that is our concern.  Last night the Minister told us that in 1982 the percentage of GNP devoted to health care was 8 per cent.</P>

    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>Last night early in his speech the Minister told us that 8 per cent of GNP was spent on health in 1982. What is the percentage now?  Even when he gave us the figure for 1982 he did not tell us that the percentage should have been corrected to 7 per cent to bring it into line with other OECD countries. We have got a very large social service element in our health expenditure.  The Minister told us about improvements in facilities for the mentally handicapped but not that there are 14 units lying idle throughout the country because the Minister will not provide the money to staff them.  He did not tell us about negotiations in relation to the European Social Fund which might mean a reduction of more than 50 per cent in allocations to some health boards.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1069" /> The Minister told us that he would be opening units built by himself.  Is this one of the reasons why there is a delay in opening Beaumont Hospital?  He told us some time ago that he would start building a nurses' home in the autumn of 1984, but recently he told us that he would not do so because it is not his policy to build nurses' homes.  At the same time I am told that he is going to build a nurses' home in Tallaght.  He told us that he was heartened that three health boards had agreed their proposals for 1985.  My own health board is one of these but they sent the following resolution to the Minister when they did agree the proposals:</P>
    <P>Having maintained our health services with a reduced allocation for a number of years, we are concerned that there will be an intolerable reduction in the level and quality of service in the current year in this health board area.</P>
    <P>I am surprised that the Minister was heartened by the decision of our health board. Fair enough, they passed the estimate, but they sent a resolution which is an extremely serious one.</P>

      <P>I blame the Government for all these decisions.  Deputy Naughten went off on a tangent putting the emphasis on money and not on care of the patients.  He told us that politics were responsible for the fact the the Western Health Board has not adopted their estimate for this year.  He did not tell us that a councillor of his own party, Councillor Burke, on a radio programme was probably more critical than anybody else about the fact that they had insufficient money to carry out their obligations in 1985.  The chairman of his own party, Senator Michael D. Higgins, voted against the adoption of the estimate for 1985.  I do not know how anybody can come into this House and say that it is politics on the part of Fianna Fáil that is causing the Western Health Board not to pass their estimate.  What would Deputy Naughten say if Roscommon hospital were closed as a result of the Minister's decision?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What about the three year waiting list for hip replacements in the Western <Col N="1072" /> Health Board?  Is that acceptable to Deputy Naughten?  Is that an adequate and satisfactory service as portrayed in the Minister's amendment?  I thought that Deputy Bruton made a very constructive contribution.  The only point I would make there is that when one looks at the cost of hospital care, one must look at the length of stay in hospitals which has been reduced to half over the last number of years.  The number of admissions has increased so that it would be dangerous to get caught in the trap of thinking that we were spending too much on hospitals.  We must look at the level of efficiency and the numbers being treated. I would agree with the Deputy that we should look for more efficiency and that the medical profession have a role to play in ensuring greater efficiency.</P>
    <P>Deputy Eileen Desmond said she was pleased that the Southern Health Board had received £10 million extra.  However, in answer to a parliamentary question from me on Tuesday, 19 February 1985, the Minister quoted the figures since he came to office.  We will just take the Southern Health Board.  The percentage change in allocation in real terms was -1.1 per cent in 1983 over 1982, -2 per cent in 1984 over 1983 and +1.8 per cent in 1985 over 1984.  There is a plus there but it is minus everywhere else.  That is because Tralee hospital has been opened and the allocation is needed for that. There is no word of the £10 million or a 10 per cent increase for the Southern Health Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Mr. B. Desmond Mr. B. Desmond">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Hanlon</NameTxt>
      <P>We in Fianna Fáil are not opposed to reviewing the health service and its whole administration.  There should be greater efficiency, but what this motion is about is the provision of sufficient money to ensure an adequate and satisfactory service.  The Minister's amendment states that he is satisfied that there is an adequate service.  But is he satisfied in the light of the cost of drugs scheme, and the fact that the sight testing <Col N="1073" /> scheme has been abolished in the Southern, the North Eastern and the Mid-Western Health Boards and the choice of dental scheme has been abolished in the Southern, Western and North Eastern Health Boards that an adequate and satisfactory service can be made available to unfortunate people who cannot provide their own service?</P>
      <P>Stocks are run down.  For example, are disposable sheets available in every community care area at present?  Transport services have been run down.  One of my patients, an old age pensioner on a medical card, told me he had paid £28 for a taxi to attend the hospital out-patients' service.  The number of fuel vouchers has been reduced each year since the Minister came into office.  At a time of recession, when there is a tremendous poverty and a massive increase in the number unemployed, the services are being reduced.  With regard to hospital services, wards and operating theatres are being closed down, local cover and week-end cover being reduced.  Two-thirds of vacancies are to be left unfilled. Still the Minister told us last night that nobody has lost a job as a result of a cutback.  It is true that nobody has lost a job, but there will be a tremendous number of vacancies unfilled which will have a most undesirable effect on the health services during the coming year. No account has been taken of the increase in population, particularly in the Eastern Health Board area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I asked the Minister what are his priorities? He told us on a number of occasions that the health services were costing £23 million per week and we accept that.  We are concerned to ensure that people who are unable, by their own means, to provide a service for themselves will have an <Col N="1074" /> adequate and satisfactory level of care. The Minister states in his amendment that he has provided sufficient money for that.  However, if he goes around any health board area he will find that that is not the case.  If he asks the people outside, they will tell him that that is not the case.  It is certainly not any health board in this country that sent a resolution to the Minister that they had sufficient money to provide an adequate and satisfactory level of care, because they have not yet got that.  Rather than go on radio and also tell us here that he is satisfied with the service, he should go on radio and television and tell the people that he has not given the boards sufficient money for the necessary level of health care.</P>
    <P>I said last night that lives would be at risk, and I still believe that, directly as a result of the Government's policy in reducing the amount of money available for the health services.  I appeal to Members opposite to consider the resolution seriously and to bear in mind that in 1982 when the Government were defeated on a Private Members' Motion it did not bring about the downfall of the Government. A defeat tonight will not bring about the downfall of the Government but it will alert them to the tremendous need to ensure that adequate funds are provided for health boards.  Government Members who are concerned about this matter should cross the floor of the House and vote with Fianna Fáil, thereby ensuring that the Government are alerted to a serious position that is of their making but can be rectified before it is too late.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RayBurke" hpid="Mr. R. Burke Mr. R. Burke">
      <NameTxt>Mr. R. Burke</NameTxt>
      <P>I thank you, a Cheann Comhairle, for providing me with an opportunity to highlight for the House the crisis &mdash; and I use the word advisedly &mdash; in regard to the lack of post primary places for the children of Swords and surrounding areas in the coming years. The situation in Swords is so bad that parents of the children anxious to gain places in St. Finian's College in September next recently took part in an all night vigil in sub-zero temperatures to ensure that their children would get places in the school.  Even after that vigil up to 70 children had to be put on a waiting list as there were insufficient places.  A statement from the Minister's Department said that places would be available in Swords for the next year, giving no indication whatsoever as to how and where such places were to be found.  This merely rubbed salt into the wounds of those parents who had queued in those sub-zero temperatures, and that is the parents' view of it.</P>
      <P>The situation in the Christian Brothers school in Swords is equally bad as that at St. Finian's College.  The Loreto Order, who are about to build a convent school in Swords, are at present trying to accommodate Swords children in North Great George's Street.  Therefore, they are in the same situation.</P>
      <P>To give the House an indication of the scale of the problem I should like to quote some figures.  In the primary schools in Swords in 1985 there will be 288 children leaving school; in 1986, 331; in 1987, 311; in 1988, 305; and in 1989, 336.  The post primary schools in Swords do not just cater for the town of Swords.  They cater also for the catchment area of quite a list of primary schools and villages and towns surrounding Swords.  For example, the national schools in St. Margaret's, Corduff, Donabate, Lusk, Garristown, Ballyboghil, Rolestown, Kilcosken, Hedgestown, Oldtown and Rivermeade are the other schools servicing the post primary schools in Swords.  The total in those schools &mdash; that is Swords and those other primary schools &mdash; is 554.  There will be 554 children seeking post primary places in 1985, 537 in 1986, 509 in 1987, 525 in 1988 and 661 in 1989.  To meet that demand this year there are only 306 places available to meet 554 children seeking post primary places.  For example, St. Finian's can take only 165 children, the CBS can take approximately 90 and Loreto Convent 51.</P>
      <P>Swords is an expanding town which at present has a population of approximately 15,000.  It is estimated that the population will rise to about 22,000 by 1991.  There was a study done by the eastern regional organisation and, if the rumours regarding its outcome are to be believed, the town's population will grow to approximately 100,000 before the turn of the century.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The figures which I have given to the House have been available to the Minister and yet she has made no effort to provide places for the children of Swords. As far back as 1981, my colleague, the then Minister for Education, Deputy Wilson, following representations from me, recognised the need for a new school in Swords.  However, no positive action <Col N="1079" /> was taken in that regard and the problem has now reached crisis proportions.</P>
    <P>We had a similar situation in Portmarnock recently but apparently the Minister responds only to crises.  I know that a meeting will take place tomorrow in the Department between the various interested parties, but the parents will not be represented and I wish to state their case. They want a new school in Swords, providing proper education with a full range of subjects.  The Department's suggestion to extend St. Finian's by 200 pupils, the CBS by 150 pupils and a convent, not yet built, by 250 pupils, is just not on.  If those proposals were adopted it would mean that there would be 1,000 teenagers on the campus of St. Finian's which would be bad educationally and socially.  There are insufficient specialist rooms &mdash; for example, there are 400 children seeking 20 places available in the home economics class.</P>
    <P>The CBS is a school of temporary buildings and the Loreto convent is not yet built.  The Minister is not taking this matter seriously.  I call on her now to provide a new school for Swords, to set up a task force immediately of architects, planners and educationalists to ensure that a school will be provided within two years so that pupils will not have to depend on temporary accommodation. In the meantime I ask the Minister to meet the needs of Swords by providing proper quality temporary accommodation pending the construction of the new school.  I also ask the Minister to proceed with the construction of the physical education hall for St. Finian's College as a whole generation have left that school without physical education being provided.</P>

      <P>There are two post primary schools in Swords at present &mdash; the Christian Brothers secondary school and a community college, St. Finian's community college, run by County Dublin Vocational Education Committee.  The Christian Brothers school has accommodation for 400 boys. The community college is co-educational <Col N="1080" /> and has accommodation for 800 pupils. The Department have been active in responding to the increased demand for post primary school places in Swords. The community college is a new school building which opened a few years ago and has a much greater pupil capacity than the old vocational eduation school building it replaced.  A third post primary school for Swords is in course of planning.  It will be a voluntary secondary school for girls and will have accommodation for at least 550 pupils managed by the Loreto nuns who at present run the school in North Great George's Street. It was intended to have this new school ready for occupation in September 1985 but, because of a delay in the acquisition of a site by the private school authorities, it will not now be ready until 1986 or 1987.  If this delay had not occurred the present difficulties would not have arisen.</P>

      <P>The County Dublin Vocational Education Committee told my Department that on 11 and 12 February their school in Swords took the names of pupils applying for places next September and that there were 234 applicants. To date, 164 have been accepted.  It was most unusual to place such a notice in the school as the usual procedure is to communicate with the Department.  I consider the action in placing that notice and causing distress to parents to have been alarmist and unnecessary.</P>

      <P>The objectives of the western package electrification scheme were included in a programme approved by the EC Commission in March 1981.  While the programme approved by the Commission allows for connection of farm dwellings <Col N="940" /> to supply, it is clearly stated that assistance for this purpose applies only to farms which do not have an existing electricity supply.  Strict adherence to the programme in this regard must be enforced in accordance with the recommendations of the EC Court of Auditors.  The person referred to by the Deputy applied for the extension of electricity supply to a new dwelling on a farm which is, as indicated in his application, already supplied with electricity, and, consequently, he could not be offered grant assistance under the scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Kelly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Foreign Affairs whether it is intended that before the end of this year Ireland will ratify those United Nations human rights covenants which we have not yet ratified; and if not, the reason.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PeterBarry" hpid="Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry) Peter Barry">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>The principal United Nations human rights instruments which Ireland has not yet ratified are (a) the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; (b) the International Covenant on Economic, Cultural and Social Rights; (c) the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and (d) the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.</P>
      <P>As I explained to the House last month in reply to a similar question there exist certain obstacles in our domestic legislation which have prevented the ratification of a number of international human rights covenants and conventions.  Accordingly, an interdepartmental committee under the chairmanship of the Attorney General was established in July 1983 to examine the problems involved and in December 1984 the committee produced its first report on the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights including the optional Protocol to the Covenant.  The report identifies the various obstacles in Irish law to Ireland's ratifying these two Covenants and details the changes in legislation that may be required to enable Ireland to comply fully with all the obligations of the Covenants.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="942" /> It is my intention to present a memorandum to the Government shortly seeking approval for the necessary steps to remove these obstacles and for work to commence on the preparation of necessary legislation, with a view to ratifying these Conventions as soon as possible.</P>
    <P>Regarding the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Racial Discrimination, it had been intended that the interdepartmental committee would also consider it in its first report.  However, as the necessary detailed examination of the Convention would have delayed the report, the committee decided to concentrate on the two Covenants. I believe, however, that the committee will commence soon its consideration of the Convention and will report on the requirements necessary for Ireland to comply with its obligations under this Convention.</P>
    <P>In December 1984 the United Nations General Assembly adopted a new Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  The Convention was opened for signature in New York on 4 February 1985.  It is my hope that once the necessary detailed examination has been completed to ensure that our legislation is in conformity with the provisions of the Convention, Ireland will be in a position to sign and ratify it without delay.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. P. Barry)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Deputy is aware the conference on Confidence and Security Building Measures and Disarmament <Col N="943" /> (CDE) takes place outside military alliances. Nonetheless it is assumed that the recent proposals to which the Deputy refers are contained in the group of working papers tabled by 16 countries during the current session of the CDE in Stockholm which commenced on 29 January 1985.  These documents consist of a further elaboration of measures outlined in an earlier proposal by these countries which was laid before the conference during its first session in 1984.  The proposal involves six concrete measures to bring about openness in the military area, including mandatory exchanges of military information, mandatory notification and observation of specified military activities and compliance and verification measures.</P>
      <P>In the course of the regular consultation and co-ordination among the ten member states of the European Community on all the issues pertaining to the conference, Ireland and our partners in the Ten take account of these as well as of all the other proposals before the conference.  Similarly, Ireland has discussed the content of all the conference proposals in her regular contacts with the neutral and non-aligned participant countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards Ireland's position on the proposals that are the subject of the Deputy's question, we are currently engaged in a detailed examination of all the proposals and explanatory documents tabled at the conference with a view to taking a position on them.  This examination will be informed by our general approach to the conference which was outlined by me during my address to the opening session of the conference.  In our view the conference should seek agreement on a balanced package of measures involving both those aimed at bringing about greater openness and predictability in the military area and measures to constrain military activities.  We do not regard confidence and security building measures as a substitute for arms control and disarmament, but we do consider that the negotiation at the CDE of an ambitious series of such measures could <Col N="944" /> help to diminish the danger of military confrontation in Europe with its attendant risks of escalation to nuclear war.</P>

      <P>Initial capital allocations in respect of sanitary services are determined by reference to the details contained in returns sent in by local authorities at the beginning of each year.  The data necessary for the 1985 allocations have been received and are now being processed in respect of all authorities.  Local authorities including Kilkenny County Council will be notified in the near future of their initial allocations in respect of sanitary services work in progress or already fully approved.  In the meantime, of course, requests for capital in respect of expenditure on approved works by all local authorities are being met in the normal way as they arise.</P>

      <P>I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the taxpayer has income from a number of sources, including deposit interest and a widow's contributory pension from the Department of Social Welfare.  As this income is paid in full without deduction of tax, the tax attributable to it is collected by restricting <Col N="965" /> the taxpayer's tax-free allowances under PAYE.  However, this restriction was incapable of producing under PAYE the full tax attributable to the income in question and, as a consequence, it was necessary to make direct assessments on the taxpayer to enable the balance of the tax due to be collected.</P>
      <P>Following receipt of details of the taxpayer's income for all relevant years from the agents acting in the case, assessments were raised on the taxpayer in March, May, June and July, 1984 to collect the underpayments of tax which had arisen for the years 1980-81 to 1983-84 and also the tax due for the current year, 1984-85. As the tax due for these years has not yet been paid, statutory interest charges have arisen in respect of the periods from the dates on which the assessments were made.  The agents have been in communication with the Collector-General regarding the question of securing an instalment arrangement for payment of the tax outstanding.  The Collector-General sent a letter to the agents on 14 December 1984, inviting their proposals as to the arrangement sought but a reply to that letter has not yet been received. The Collector-General will now issue a reminder directly to the agents in the matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="BarryDesmond" hpid="Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond) Barry Desmond">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Social Welfare (Mr. B. Desmond)</NameTxt>
      <P>The person concerned claimed disability benefit from 15 October 1984 but she was not qualified for payment as according to the records of the Department she has less than the required minimum of 26 paid or credited contributions in 1982-83, the contribution year governing her claim.  She also claimed disability benefit from 3 January 1985 to 12 January 1985.  Payment was not authorised initially as her claim was also governed by the 1982-83 contribution year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>From 7 January 1985 the contribution year changed to the 1983-84 contribution year.  The person concerned has 52 A1 contributions paid in this period and she therefore qualified for payment of disability benefit from 7 January 1985 to 12 January 1985 when she was certified fit to resume work.  However, she also claimed supplementary welfare allowance of £40 from the health board for this period. Her disability benefit payment of £32.75 <Col N="972" /> has been withheld therefore and refunded to the health board.</P>

Arrangements are being made to have him examined by a medical referee on 28 February 1985.  His entitlement to invalidity pension will be reviewed in the light of the report of this examination.</P>

He was issued with a claim form to complete in respect of adult and child dependants if applicable and in the meantime payment was issued at the rate appropriate to a single man.  The completed claim form was not received in the Department and the person concerned has now been issued with a new claim form.
