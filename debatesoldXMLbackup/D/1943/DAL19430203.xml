      <NameTxt>Mr. Bartley</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that a considerable amount of damage was done by an abnormally high tide in certain places in County Galway in December last, consisting mainly of the destruction of or damage to quays, sea walls, roads, dwellinghouses, pits <Col N="334" /> of potatoes and stacks of turf; and that, in particular, the following places are affected: Aran Islands, the islands of Mynish, Inishlacken, and Inishbofin, and the districts of Callow, Doohulla, Ballyconneely and Ailbrack; and whether it is his intention to have this damage repaired in the near future, more especially that part of it which interferes with the gathering and saving of seaweed.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>My attention has been called to the fact that damage to property at the places mentioned has occurred as a result of recent storms. With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, I cannot accept the suggestion that it is the function of the State to repair damages of the kind.  So far as private property is concerned, the repair of damage occasioned by storm is primarily a matter for the owner of the property; and as regards public works, the carrying out of repairs is a matter for the responsible local bodies.  Arrangements are, however, being made to ascertain to what extent a measure of assistance on farms affected can be afforded under the Farm Improvements Scheme administered by the Department of Agriculture, and as to the possibility of carrying out works of repair on accommodation roads, etc., which have been constructed out of Employment Schemes grants.  Where important public works have been extensively damaged, I would be prepared to consider the grant of some measure of financial assistance by way of a contribution towards the cost of repairs carried out by local authorities in cases in which the Minister for Local Government and Public Health recommended that such assistance should be given.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that, as a result of the arrangement whereby cycle tyres are reserved for members of the L.D.F. and L.S.F., many people engaged on essential work of food production, who have to travel considerable distances to and from their work, are unable to procure tyres; and if, in order to ensure regular attendance by people engaged on work of this kind, he will arrange that they get some share of the supply available.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The scarcity of cycle tyres has been caused by the shortage in rubber supplies and there is no foundation for the suggestion in the question that the position has been materially affected by the arrangement to reserve a small part of the available supply of tyres for members of the L.D.F. and L.S.F. I have given careful consideration on many occasions to the possibility of restricting the sale of cycle tyres to persons engaged on essential work, but have found that it would be quite impracticable to attempt to differentiate between the many and varied classes of persons who could justly claim that they require their bicycles for such work.  The available supplies of tyres are being distributed to traders on the basis of purchases in the year 1940, and I have been assured by the cycle trade that they are doing their best to ensure that as far as possible tyres will be supplied only to those persons most urgently and immediately in need of them.  Arrangements have been made, however, which will result in the quantity <Col N="336" /> of cycle tyres available for general distribution this year being somewhat greater than the quantity available last year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that many <Col N="337" /> people in Cork City complain that they have been supplied with water-logged turf for which they are called upon to pay the maximum price; and if he will state what arrangements he will make to ensure good turf is supplied, or alternatively, to reduce the price of turf whose weight at the time of sale must inevitably be considerably reduced by drying before it can be used as fuel.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state to whom persons residing in Cork City may address complaints concerning supplies of water-logged turf, or requests to have such turf officially inspected and replaced.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take questions Nos. 5 and 6 together.  I am not aware that water-logged turf is being offered for sale in Cork City. On the contrary, a report of an official inspection by the Turf Development Board showed that the turf in Cork City is of a uniformly good quality.  So far as my Department is concerned, not a single complaint from a householder has reached it that water-logged turf, or indeed inferior quality turf, has been supplied in Cork City this winter.</P>
      <P>Throughout the whole non-turf area there is a system of inspection of turf supplied through Fuel Importers (Éire), Limited, so that a reasonably high standard of turf only shall be made available to the public, and I am informed that, on the whole, this system is now working satisfactorily.  Moreover, the merchants are at liberty to reject turf which they consider unsuitable for immediate sale.  I assume the Deputy has specific instances in his possession of persons who have been supplied with water-logged turf, and if he will let me have particulars I will have inquiries made.</P>
      <P>Any customer of a merchant who has been supplied with water-logged turf should address his complaint in the first instance to the merchant with whom he is registered, and if the latter refuses to replace such turf free of charge, the matter will be dealt with in my Department.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Browne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that a considerable portion of the December ration of paraffin oil was not made available to householders in North Mayo; and if he will now make an Order to ensure that any undelivered portion of the December paraffin ration will be made available to consumers at the December price.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that due to the non-arrival of expected supplies and transport difficulties, some portion <Col N="339" /> of the December ration of kerosene was not available during that month to householders throughout the country generally and this presumably applied to certain areas in North Mayo.</P>
      <P>From information at my disposal I understand that supplies of kerosene sufficient for the full December ration were made available in all districts at the earliest possible moment and I am not satisfied that any appreciable quantity of the December ration for the North Mayo area remained in the hands of traders until a date after 1st January, 1943, or 21st January, 1943, the dates upon which prices were increased.</P>
      <P>It is not practicable, in fixing prices, to differentiate as between the general body of traders and isolated cases of traders who might be carrying stocks at the time of a price rise nor, in my opinion, is such differentiation necessary, particularly in the cases of commodities in short supply, such as paraffin oil.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware of the grave hardships imposed on the people of the Slieveardagh coal-mining area in County Tipperary through being deprived of coal and culm for fuel in their homes; and, if so, if he will consider making this a non-turf area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The prohibition imposed on the purchase of coal or culm for ordinary domestic use applies generally throughout the whole State both in areas scheduled as non-turf as well as in turf areas.  The making of Slieveardagh a non-turf area would not, therefore, result in coal and culm being available for domestic use there.</P>
      <P>I am aware that the non-availability of coal for domestic use causes hardship to householders, but as the available supplies of coal are insufficient to meet essential industrial requirements, I am unable to hold out any prospect of an improvement in this respect.</P>

Although this place is close to the bog, the people know less about turf than if it were a hundred miles away, because they have always been accustomed to the culm.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether representations have been made to him in connection with the strike in Castlecomer mine and if his Department has been asked to intervene; if his Department has intervened if he will say what action, if any, he proposes to take in connection with the strike; if he is aware that the local Press has published articles dealing with the cause of the dispute; if he will state if there is any discrepancy in the price allowed to be charged for coal from Castlecomer mine and that which is permitted to be charged for coal from Wolfhill and Modubagh mines; whether he is aware that the proprietors of the Wolfhill mine are in a position to pay a higher wage; whether he is aware that it is stated that over 100 men left Castlecomer mine for Modubagh or Wolfhill and that the figures which have been published regarding the wages paid in Castlecomer mine are disputed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand that the purpose of the strike now proceeding at the Castlecomer mine is to compel the Government to alter the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order, by excluding coal-mine workers from its scope.  While the Government is, and always has been, prepared to consider representations made to it concerning this and other Government Orders and has, in fact, amended Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order on more than one occasion on representations by the Irish Trade Union Congress and by workers in special categories, the Government will not permit itself to be forced into such action by a strike or threat of strike, for reasons which the Dáil will readily understand.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="344" /> The strike now proceeding at Castlecomer and other coal mines, under the terms of the Order I have referred to, is not protected under the Trades Disputes Act.  The Government cannot afford any recognition to a strike of this character, or initiate or participate in any negotiations or discussions relating to it.  I think it is desirable in the interests of the workers concerned that this fact should be clearly stated.</P>
    <P>Castlecomer collieries have received, prior to the recent strike, possible increases in their average earnings, since the beginning of the emergency, amounting in all to 24/6 per week. Their piece rates were increased by 6d. per ton in November, 1939, and increased by a further 1/- per ton early in 1940.  Subsequently I caused a committee of inquiry to be set up to investigate the conditions of the industry. The recommendations of this committee were implemented in full by the Sixth Amendment of Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, which permitted a further increase of 10 per cent. in wages coupled with an attendance bonus of 1/- per day for work on six consecutive days.</P>
    <P>A submission has been made jointly by the Castlecomer company and the workers concerned for a bonus order in accordance with the terms of Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order.  This submission was referred to a tribunal which met on Friday, January 22nd. But for the strike, it may be assumed that the application would have resulted in the making of a bonus order.</P>
    <P>It will be appreciated from the facts I have given that the increases in their remuneration secured during the emergency by coal-mine workers, coupled with the further increase which it is possible for them to secure under Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order, compare more than favourably with those secured by, or available to, any other class of workers.</P>
    <P>I understand that amongst the grievances voiced by the Castlecomer miners is the fact that their tonnage rates are lower than those operating at other collieries.  It will, however, be easily understood that in an old-established and well-organised mine, <Col N="345" /> uniform tonnage rates will yield much higher average earnings than in the case of recently-opened mines, not yet fully developed, and with comparatively small outputs.  For some time past, however, I have been endeavouring, for the purpose of removing any financial inducement to coal-mine workers to leave their present employment for employment at other mines, to secure by agreement a general revision of tonnage rates in the area of the Leinster coalfield so as to produce uniform, average earnings.  I appreciate the difficulty of effecting an arrangement on those lines which will secure general agreement, but I am not without hope that a satisfactory basis may be found.  Examination of the matter, however, has had to be suspended in consequence of the strike.</P>
    <P>With regard to the statement in the question that 100 workers have left Castlecomer for other coal mines, the numbers employed at the colliery do not bear this out.  Prior to the opening of the colliery at The Swan, the number employed underground at Castlecomer on 24/2/41 was 410; the number so employed 20/11/42 was 401. The output of coal at Castlecomer in 1940 was 72,998 tons, compared with 115,000 tons for 1942.</P>
    <P>With regard to the matter of the prices permitted to be charged for coal produced at Castlecomer, the principle applied is to permit of a reasonable profit on the undertaking. Part of the trouble at Castlecomer has been a claim by the company&mdash; apparently supported by the men in their desire to have their earnings increased as the price of coal increased&mdash; that the same price should be fixed for coal produced at Castlecomer as for coal produced at other smaller collieries on the Leinster coalfield.  It will be appreciated that the costs of coal production vary from colliery to colliery and are normally much lower in an old-established colliery than in one in the early stages of development. The present price permitted for Castlecomer coal allows a very reasonable profit to the proprietors, but if, instead of fixing prices on the <Col N="346" /> basis of costs at each mine, the principle were to be adopted of fixing a uniform price, which would have to cover production costs at the least efficient unit, the profits resulting to the Castlecomer enterprise would be altogether excessive.</P>
    <P>At the present time the prices charged at pit-head for coal produced at other collieries are being reexamined, and any modification of these prices will be made on the basis of applying the same principles as have been applied to the Castlecomer colliery, but the result will not necessarily be uniformity of prices.</P>
    <P>With regard to the final part of the question, I have seen it stated in the Press on behalf of the workers, that the earnings of a miner on an average shift were 10/3.  It was stated in evidence before the Committee of Inquiry that the average earnings of a collier in 1939 were 9/-, which rose to 11/- after April, 1940, and were later increased, as a result of the special Order under Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order, by 10 per cent. plus an attendance bonus of 1/- per shift if a man worked six shifts.  Even allowing for absenteeism, the average earnings per shift of a collier were quoted by the Castlecomer company at 12/5 per day.  Over 60 per cent. of the colliers, who received the attendance bonus, would have got on the average something over 13/- per shift.</P>

This is not a normal dispute, as the Minister will appreciate.  There is a shortage of fuel, and, apart altogether from the dispute, the Minister's desire would be to get more fuel.  These men cannot go back as matters stand.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he is aware that a large number of quay workers, dockers and ship workers are not now benefiting by the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939; and if he will see that the provisions of the Act will be extended to these classes of workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The difficulty of bringing casual workers who have recurring periods of unemployment, within the scope of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939, is obvious.  This difficulty is accentuated in the case of casual dockers who are not infrequently employed by different employers on different days in the same week.  In September of last year, by arrangement with the trade unions concerned, a test case was brought to the court in respect of dockers and the court held that casual dockers are not covered by the Act.</P>
      <P>As the difficulty created by the discontinuity of employment amongst such workers has not been reduced by the circumstances caused by the present emergency, I do not at present consider it practicable to attempt the amendment of the Holidays Act.</P>

      <P>The Minister will remember that when the Bill was passing through this House he was told of the difficulties with regard to dockers in that respect.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>In preparing the Act, we went a long way towards trying to meet the difficulty by the provision of cesser pay where a certain period of continuous work had taken place.  It is obviously very difficult to apply provisions, which are designed to deal with the circumstances of workers in regular employment, to casual workers of this kind, who are frequently employed by different employers and whose greatest difficulty is an excess of holidays without pay.</P>

The question of shortening the period of investigation is continuously under review, but it has not been possible to make any notable progress inasmuch as delays very often arise from failure of claimants to complete claim forms properly, thereby necessitating re-issue, or the failure of the insured person to look after his insured position when in employment, thereby involving an examination of insurability when the claim to a <Col N="354" /> widow's pension is under consideration; or the failure or inability of claimants to submit particulars of membership of the National Health Insurance Society.  Many of the investigations which are made are carried out in the interest of claimants. If the facts given on claim forms were accepted without investigation in all cases, the result would often be adverse to claimants.</P>

The information in my Department would indicate that only one of them had been employed on the farm for over 20 years.  There did not appear to be any need or justification for the continuance of the high outlay involved in the working of the farm by the employment of 15 agricultural labourers.  It was necessary to place the working of the farm on a more economic basis, and the joint committee of management decided to reduce the number of labourers by four.</P>

      <P>In January, 1942, the British Ministry of Food intimated that they were about to suspend the system under which salmon had been imported from this country by commercial firms in Great Britain and announced that thenceforth the Ministry would be the sole purchaser of such fish.  To consider the position, a meeting of those known to be engaged in the export of salmon was convened, and it was decided at that meeting to appoint a committee of six to act for the entire body of exporters, in case the need for further consultation with me or my Department should arise. Such consultation has, in fact, been necessary on one occasion only.  If the salmon netsmen throughout the country wish to appoint a central committee to represent them and their interests, there seems no reason why they should not do so.</P>
      <P>I understand that some of the licensed exporters received a bonus of 3d. per lb., within the period June-September, 1942, in respect of such consignments of salmon as were in specially good condition on reaching market and that on some other consignments not even the standard price, apart from any question of bonus, was realised.  I have no information as to who did, or did not, receive the bonus in question or on what consignments it was paid.  The arrangements between the netsmen, as prime producers, and the prospective exporters who buy their fish are for settlement between the parties, just as they were before the system of export under licence was introduced.</P>

The matter has been under consideration, but arrangements for the provision of turbary are difficult and tedious, and it is not possible to say whether the tenants can be provided with bogs this year at Dooletter or Knockboy or elsewhere.  The operations of the Land Commission are hampered by lack of staff due to emergency conditions.  As regards the rearrangement of the holdings in question, it has not yet been found possible to acquire suitable lands with which the rearrangement might be carried out.

      <P>The road referred to which joins the county roads in the townlands of Lispopple and Surgalstown North was constructed by the Land Commission over three years ago, at a cost of £1,000.  The damage to the road is stated to have been caused by the transport of road material by heavy lorries for the Dublin County Council from their quarry at Donabate. The Land Commission decided to spend a sum of £62 on repairs provided the county council agreed to take over and maintain the road.  The county council stated that it would cost £1,000 to put it in a proper state of repair, and they refused to take it over unless the Land Commission contributed at least half of this amount. The Land Commission were not prepared to make this large contribution, but decided to proceed with their original intention of repairing the road provided the allottees agreed to sign a maintenance undertaking in respect of it.</P>
      <P>The general rule is that the allottees, not the Land Commission, are responsible for the maintenance of accommodation roads made for their benefit.</P>

      <P>As regards the lands of Longorchard, proceedings for acquisition by the Land Commission have been delayed in consequence of objections lodged by some of the owners, and it has not been feasible for the Land Commission to reach a decision on these objections pending the obtaining of further information as to how the lands, if acquired, might be advantageously disposed of.  The Land Commission are having a draft scheme of division of the whole lands prepared in order to envisage the position as a whole. There will be no avoidable delay in the matter, but the Land Commission's operations are hampered in present circumstances by diversion of many of their staff for special emergency duties.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>A Chinn Chomhairle, on the eve of its reassembly, an unexpected blow fell upon this House by <Col N="375" /> the death of two Deputies&mdash;Deputy Hugo Flinn, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and Deputy Hurley. The uncertainty of life is brought home to all of us when we remember that the Parliamentary Secretary was addressing this House when the adjournment was moved, that Deputy Hurley sat on the benches yonder and that the Parliamentary Secretary was due to resume his unfinished speech to-day. Go ndéanaidh Dia trócaire ar anamnacha na beirte aca.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hurley represented SouthEast Cork since 1937.  He had been a member of the Irish Volunteers, faithful to his duty during the period of the national effort for independence.  He was a teacher by profession and for many years was closely connected with the trade union movement.  Both the Trade Union Congress and the Irish National Teachers' Organisation honoured him in turn, each electing him president.  As a member of the Cork County Council and Cork Corporation, he was associated with the administration of the affairs of his native county and of Cork City, where he resided.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hurley's participation in debate here was mainly on matters relating to labour and to education. His views were always advanced with calmness of spirit, with sincerity and unfailing courtesy.  We shall be at a loss for his earnest insistence in discussion and we shall miss his quiet presence from amongst us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Flinn represented Cork City for an unbroken period of 15 years. Whenever he spoke, whether from these or from the opposite benches, there was impressed on everything he said the forcefulness and directness of a vigorous personality.  For close on 11 years Deputy Flinn was responsible, as Parliamentary Secretary, for the administration of the Office of Public Works and, in particular, for the organisation and supervision of the employment schemes.  With characteristic thoroughness, immediately on his appointment he surveyed and reorganised the whole field of the <Col N="376" /> activities of the Department placed under his charge and ever since he proved himself a most capable director and administrator.</P>
    <P>On the occasions on which he was called upon to give to the Dáil an account of his stewardship, he displayed a knowledge and grasp of detail which could have been secured only by painstaking diligence and tireless industry.  So successful had been his administration of the Office of Public Works that two years ago, when the fuel position called for a man of proved administrative ability and driving force, he was immediately appointed to take charge.  The trust bestowed upon him was not misplaced. Into his new duties he put all his boundless energy and firm, clear-sighted purpose.  In complete sacrifice of self, with moral courage of the highest order and the loftiest ideals of public duty, he bent himself to the extremely difficult task of substituting home-won turf for the coal which could no longer be imported.  That he succeeded to a remarkable extent considering the almost insurmountable difficulties with which he was confronted, will not be denied.</P>
    <P>For a considerable time past his doctors had warned him of the risks he ran.  His colleagues appealed to him to take some rest, but duty was paramount with him, and the warnings and appeals were set aside.  I have little doubt that his únswerving loyalty to what he considered to be his duty hastened his end.  By his death we have lost a man of outstanding ability who served his country with indomitable courage and disinterested devotion during the whole period of his public life.</P>
    <P>I ask you, a Chinn Chomhairle, to convey to the widows and families of the deceased Deputies an expression of our sincere sympathy with them in their bereavement.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Defence (Mr. Traynor)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £10, be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1943, for the Army and the Army Reserve (including certain Grants-in-Aid) under the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts, <Col N="379" /> and for certain administrative Expenses in connection therewith; for the Expenses of the Office of the Minister for the co-ordination of Defensive Measures; for Expenses in connection with the trial and detention of certain persons (No. 28 of 1939, No. 1 of 1940, No. 16 of 1940, etc.); for certain Expenses under the Offences against the State Acts, 1939 and 1940 (No. 13 of 1939, and No. 2 of 1940) and the Air-Raid Precautions Act, 1939 (No. 21 of 1939); for Reserve Medical Supplies for Civilian Hospitals; for certain Expenses of the Local Defence Force (including Grants-in-Aid) (No. 28 of 1939); for certain Expenses in connection with the special Commemoration of the 1916 Rising; for certain Expenses in connection with the National Blood Transfusion Council, and for a Grant to the Irish Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>The object of the present Supplementary Estimate for the token sum of £10 is to seek the Dáil's approval (a) for the establishment of the National Blood Transfusion Council, and to regularise certain expenditure which has been incurred in connection with the activities of the council, and (b) for a grant to the Irish Red Cross Society to defray the cost of transferring from the United States of America to Eire certain medical stores and equipment supplied by the American Red Cross Society.</P>
    <P>It is a matter of common knowledge that the use of blood and blood derivatives forms to-day an integral part and essential function in the medical treatment of certain diseases, but it is not equally well known that the methods adopted in their application are not uniform.  When this fact was brought to the notice of the Government, they decided to set up a National Blood Transfusion Council for the following purposes: (1) To co-ordinate all information regarding blood transfusion, its methods, and its application.  (2) To advise the Government, Departments of State, and all organising bodies on all matters relating to blood transfusion. (3) To direct the work of all organising bodies so as to ensure that <Col N="380" /> progress is made on proper and uniform lines.</P>
    <P>The council is an independent body and not directly associated with any Government Department.  Its functions are purely advisory and it is composed of a chairman nominated by the Government with representatives from the Department of Defence, from the Department of Local Government and Public Health, from the National and Dublin Blood Transfusion Services, from each of the universities and the College of Science, from the Hospitals Commission and from the Medical Association of Eire.  One additional member, an expert in all matters relating to blood transfusion, has at the unanimous request of the council been appointed to act on the committee.</P>
    <P>The council has not as yet any statutory existence, but it may be necessary at a later stage to provide by statute for it.  Meanwhile, accommodation for the council is provided by the Department of Defence, and any secretarial work necessary to its activities is also performed by the Department.</P>
    <P>In connection with the general work of blood transfusion, and not necessarily connected with the activities of the Blood Transfusion Council, it may be of interest to note that the Army Medical Service is actively engaged on this work, and that the material prepared is not only for the Army but for general distribution in case of an emergency. Batches of about 25 soldier donors attend several mornings each week at St. Bricin's Hospital and from them is taken the serum, which when filtered is stored in a refrigerating plant.</P>
    <P>The present Estimate is intended to cover all expenses, estimated at approximately £200, incurred in connection both with the National Blood Transfusion Council and with the soldier donors.  In the case of the council it mainly covers the travelling expenses of a certain member not resident in Dublin, and in that of the soldier donors any travelling or other expenses incurred in connection with their attendance for transfusion at St. Bricin's Hospital.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="381" /> The second object of this Supplementary Estimate is to defray 75 per cent. of the cost of bringing from the United States of America to this country certain medical supplies and equipment donated by the American Red Cross Society.  The value of the stores agreed to be transferred is about 750,000 dollars.  They will be in the custody and control of the Irish Red Cross Society and are intended for use in case this country is involved in war, or an emergency arises here as a result of the present war.  Permission may, however, be given from time to time by the American society to use any of the goods sent or to turn over any stores liable to deterioration.  In view of the fact that the goods remain the property of the American society and that their control alone is vested in the Irish society, the Government has agreed to defray 75 per cent. of the cost of transference to this country, the remaining 25 per cent. being borne by the Irish society.  It is estimated that the cost in freight will be about £10,000, and it has been agreed that the maximum State contribution will be £7,500, of which about £1,000 will fall for payment during the present financial year.</P>
    <P>The sum of £200 required during the present financial year in connection with blood transfusion, and that of £1,000 to defray the transatlantic freight on supplies donated by the American Red Cross Society will this year be met out of savings on the Army Vote, so that only the token sum of £10 is required to regularise the expenditure.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £102,400, be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1943, for Wound and Disability Pensions, Further Pensions and Married Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 26 of 1923, No. 12 of 1927, No. 24 of 1932, No. 15 of 1937, and No. 2 of 1941), <Col N="382" /> Military Service Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 48 of 1924, No. 26 of 1932, No. 43 of 1934, and No. 33 of 1938), Pensions, Allowances and Gratuities (No. 37 of 1936), and for sundry Contributions and Expenses in respect thereof, etc.</P>
    <P>The main cause of this Supplementary Estimate for the Army Pensions Vote 1942/43 is that the Department under-estimated the number of awards which would fall for payment during the year. In making this under-estimation, the Department was influenced by the fact that in recent financial years it had in framing its Estimates relied mainly on the output of awards as computed by the different statutory bodies concerned, and that this Estimate had been found by experience to be inaccurate, and had caused large Exchequer surrenders which were the cause of some comment.  Thus in 1937/38 the surrender was £58,755; in 1938/39, £45,920; in 1939/40, £45,877; in 1940/41, £85,548; and in 1941/42, £68,195.  To avoid such large surrenders, the Department in 1942/43 cut the figures furnished by the statutory bodies, and, by doing so, has now found that the money necessary to finance the awards made under the different Acts has been under-estimated to the extent of about £102,400.</P>
    <P>How this sum is made up will be clear from the amounts set out under the different sub-heads of the Vote. Thus, under sub-head E, an additional sum of £450 is required to meet the salaries, wages and allowances of the referee and advisory committee.  In introducing the annual Estimate for the Army Pensions Vote for the financial year 1942/43, it was stated:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The Estimate proceeds on the basis that the referee and interviewing officers will practically cease to function on the 31st March, 1942, and that the advisory committee will be required for only four months and the administrative staff for only eight of the new financial year.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>At the time it was distinctly stated that &ldquo;these time limits were only provisional,&rdquo; and in point of fact the actual course of events has shown that <Col N="383" /> our expectations were not realised.  The interviewing officers were released from their duty with the committee at the end of March, 1942, and it was found possible to effect a reduction in the administrative staff of the committee, but it was found necessary to retain the services of the advisory committee itself and of portion of the staff during the whole of the financial year, so that we shall require a net sum of £450 more than originally anticipated to pay the salaries, wages and allowances of the committee for the financial year.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head G, a further sum of £1,000 is required, because we have more applications than we anticipated would succeed for wound and disability pensions and gratuities under the Acts of 1927, 1932 and 1941.  As regards the additional sum of £500 required under sub-head H for allowances and gratuities to dependents, that excess is mainly due to the fact that during the year we were able to clear off with the Department of Finance a number of applications for gratuities under the 1932 Act, which had been outstanding over a number of years in the past.</P>
    <P>Hospital Treatment&mdash;sub-head J&mdash;is dependent entirely on the number of cases which the Army Pensions Board is able to handle, and they have dealt with more cases and their investigations have in some cases taken a longer time than we expected.  Here the amount required will be an additional £250.</P>
    <P>Compared with the additional amount of £98,000 required under sub-head K in respect of military service pensions, the sums needed under the other sub-heads are relatively small, and, consequently, the chief cause of the Supplementary Estimate lies in this particular sub-head.  The under-estimation here is due entirely to the fact that more awards than we thought probable when the annual Estimate was framed in December, 1941, were actually made during the financial year 1942/43.  When the Estimate for 1942/43 was framed, there were under payment in respect of the 1924 and 1934 Acts no less than 10,730 pensions, <Col N="384" /> and the Department prepared its budget on the basis that about 1,130 fresh awards, mainly under the 1934 Act, would be made between December, 1941, and March, 1943, especially in view of the large surpluses which had accrued in previous years in respect of this particular sub-head. This would give 11,860 pensions by the end of the financial year 1942/43.  The forecast, however, proved to be inaccurate, because at the end of December there were 12,918 awards actually under payment, and, in addition, we had received from the referee 912 additional favourable reports.</P>
    <P>For one reason or another not all of these reports will fall for payment before the end of March.  Some of the grantees are abroad and may not be able to complete all the necessary formalities before the end of the year, and even in the case of grantees living at home, we find that delays occur in acknowledging the receipt of certificates and in completing the formalities necessary to payment.  Taking the various factors of delay into consideration, we consider that of the 912 awards mentioned, only about 612 will fall as a charge to the Vote during the year, so that this Supplementary Estimate proceeds on the assumption that on the 31st March, 1943, there will be 13,530 awards in course of payment. In this connection, it must be remembered that each new award carries with it arrears of pension back to the 1st October, 1934</P>
    <P>Depending as it does on the retirement of officers and the discharge of other ranks from the Army, it is not easy in the absence or suspension of regulations dealing with ages of retirement, to estimate with accuracy requirements under sub-head L of the Vote which carries the cost of pensions and gratuities under the Defence Forces pensions schemes granted in respect of service to personnel of the forces.  The annual Estimate for 1942/43 provided for about 110 pensions and that Estimate proved accurate for at the end of December, 1942, there were 102 under pay and there have been several other <Col N="385" /> cases in which pensions will be payable since that date.  In the matter of gratuities, however, our forecast was inaccurate because against a provision of £3,450 we have already spent £3,700, and in addition we have already on hands other cases which will cost about £850.</P>
    <P>Finally, sub-head M deals with the expenses of applicants and of witnesses attending for examination before the statutory bodies administering the different Acts, and it is, therefore, closely connected with the work of these bodies.  The amount now required under this sub-head is nearly double the original estimate of £3,000, and is mainly due to the increased activities already described of the referee and advisory committee.  On 31st December, 1942, the charge under this sub-head was already £5,083, due to the fact that efforts were being made to dispose of all applications under the 1934 Act, and that, in consequence, it was necessary to have more frequent conferences with verifying officers than had been originally anticipated.</P>

      <P>There are a considerable number, although I cannot give the actual figure.  I think the referee has to deal with only something like 300 cases, but there are a large number of appeals.  We cannot say how many appeals will be pressed, but at present the appeals number 15,000 or 20,000.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>When does the Minister think the work of the board will be <Col N="386" /> concluded?  He mentioned that it was calculated that the advisory committee would only have been required for a portion of this financial year, that they would have finished their work by 31st December.  What is the new estimate as to when the work will be finished? I should also like to ask if the work could have been expedited in any way if the referee had remained whole-time on the job.  I am not finding any fault with anything he has done.  I think he has done his work as well as could be expected.  But, if the referee had continued at the work, instead of resuming his ordinary work, would it have expedited matters?  I think it is desirable that these cases should be dealt with as expeditiously as possible. It is nearly nine years now since the Act was passed, and it is a fairly long time to have persons waiting, who eventually prove to be entitled to something under this Act, for a decision in their cases.  I think it would expedite the matter if the referee were asked to take on the work whole-time and drop his work in the Circuit Court.</P>
      <P>There is another point which may not be strictly relevant to this Estimate. There is some suggestion that there is to be a new Bill to amend the law relating to Army pensions so as to bring in those persons who joined the Army and the Defence Forces generally in emergency services since 1st September, 1939.  I should like to know when the Minister expects to be able to introduce the Bill dealing with that matter, or if it is a fact that such a Bill is contemplated.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy and Deputy Lynch and the Minister have an intimate knowledge of the events during the period from 1917 on to 1924. Do they believe that during that time 15,000 men bore arms on active service in this country against the British or in the civil war?</P>

      <P>I have often read the statements of leading participants in <Col N="387" /> that period of activity who said that at no time was there more than a microscopic handful of men bearing arms, and it was often commented on with admiration that they were able to keep at bay the very large forces massed against them.  But it now appears through the medium of this pension legislation that there was a large standing army in this country of 15,000 men on active service, with an additional body of 20,000 men who thought they were on active service.</P>

I must say that I heard with amazement that the Minister is satisfied that there was actually a standing army of 15,000 men bearing arms&mdash;that is really 15 battalions of soldiers&mdash; that these were actually bearing arms, and that there were a further 20,000 who thought they were bearing arms. Of course, I was not in sympathy with the movement, and therefore was not in a position to know what was going on.  But I knew a great many men who were in it, and none of them ever suggested to me at any time that they thought there was a number of young men approximating to 15,000, or that there were 15 battalions in the field.  I doubt if any Deputy interested at any time thought that he could muster 1,000 men to march behind him.  I doubt if Deputy Mulcahy at any time during his activities in Dublin, or in any other part of the country, thought he could muster 1,000 of an army.</P>

      <P>I was never aware that there were 15,000 men in the field prior to the evacuation of this country by the British.  It is a matter worthy of comment that it now emerges that there were 15,000 men bearing arms and active in the field arrayed against the British and 20,000 who thought they were.  I do not think that that is known to anybody but the referee and the applicants for pensions. Historians must revise the story of that dramatic period in our history. They must revise the tale which has so often been told of a small band of men who conducted this extraordinary guerilla campaign against the forces of the British Empire.  It was not a small guerilla band, but a very fine standing Army of between 15,000 and 20,000, who acted in such a way as to enable them to speak of active service in a sense which entitles them to receive a life pension hereafter from the State. That is a remarkable incident, and I trust that no historian writing the story of this country will overlook it when the history of Ireland comes to be written.  It is very remarkable that we raised a standing Army of 20,000 men. To conceal this great Army and to conceal the immense armament of this Army seems to have been remarkable. That makes this Estimate of peculiar importance not only for our own time but for posterity to note.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="389" /> Apart from that, I should like to ask for information analogous to that sought by Deputy Lynch.  Does the Minister intend to introduce an amending Bill to the military pensions code and, if so, in that Bill is it his intention to make provision for the exceptional circumstances of the widowed mother of the officer who was killed in the disaster at Glenmalure?  I think there was a proposal at one time to give her the same concession, broadly speaking, as would be enjoyed by the widow of a deceased officer who died in the tragic circumstances attending on the death of the officer concerned. If that course were pursued, it would be a reasonable one and I believe would have the support of every Deputy.  It would be a comfort to the lady in question and to her family and friends if the Minister felt free to say that it was his intention to deal with that matter in the new legislation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether he has received complaints from units of the Dublin Brigade with regard to applicants who have been rejected as persons to whom the Act does not apply, without these people having had the opportunity of appearing before the board?  I, personally know of a number of such cases, where people from the same units filled in the same kind of forms in exactly the same way, and where some people were admitted before the board and the claims of others were refused.  I should like to know from the Minister whether, before the board finishes its activities, the claims of such men as I have mentioned would be readmitted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to join with Deputy McCann in regard to the case he has made, because I already made a similar case with regard to men who had exactly the same evidence as to their activities, and some of these claims were admitted while others were not.  I should like to emphasise that, because that kind of thing does not make for harmony or peace in the country.  A lot of trouble is caused in the case of men, coming from the same unit and, presumably, with the same record of service, when one person is awarded a pension or gratuity and the <Col N="390" /> other is not.  I think that it is a very serious matter.</P>
      <P>Apart from that, however, I was particularly interested in Deputy Lynch's suggestion, in connection with an alteration in the existing law, so far as concerns men serving in the present Army&mdash;men, perhaps, who had been on the Reserve and who, possibly, as a result of the present emergency were called up, and who died while in the Army, leaving their widows and children without any compensation.</P>
      <P>I would suggest that if the Minister is thinking of bringing in amending legislation, he should bear such cases in mind, and I am sure that, if he were to do so, every Party in the House would support him.  I have in mind at the moment, for instance, the case of a Captain in the Army who had been serving since 1922.  He was on the reserve of officers, and came up each year for training.  He died suddenly in the Curragh, leaving a wife and six children, but the reply of the Department of Defence to communications that have been sent is that no gratuity or pension can be paid in his case.  I think that that is a thing we should not stand over, and if the Minister is proposing to bring in legislation dealing with such cases, I am sure that everybody in the House would back him.  If he does bring in such legislation, I trust that it will be made retrospective, so that the widows and children of such people as those to whom I have referred will be provided for. I hope that the proposed legislation will be brought in speedily, and I am sure that the Minister would have the backing of the whole House.</P>

      <P>Before the Minister concludes, I wish to say that it has always been a marvel and a puzzle to me to know how this board works. Just like other Deputies who have spoken on this matter, I have known men from the same unit and the same district, with the same record of service, who have been treated in different ways.  For instance, men have shown me a summons to attend in Dublin before the board on a particular day, while other men, belonging to the same units and districts and with the <Col N="391" /> same record of service, were not sent for.  With regard to the other point that was made by Deputy Keyes&mdash; referring to widows or dependents of men who died while on service in the Army&mdash;I put a question down here last November with regard to a Mrs. Quinn, whose husband died while on service, and I got a reply to the effect that provision was being made for her; but I got a letter this morning from Mrs. Quinn which was to the effect that she had filled up all the necessary forms and papers last November, but had received no reply from the Department since then.  This is the month of February, but nothing has been done for this unfortunate woman and her children since last November.  I suggest that that is certainly a very poor recompense for such people.</P>

The person concerned is quite all right now and willing to rejoin the Army, but they do not want to allow him back.</P>

      <P>Yes, Sir, but there was the question here of the disagreement between doctors, and I suggest that if the Minister or his Department cannot decide to take this man back into the Army, the question would arise as to whether he would be entitled to a pension or compensation of some kind.</P>

This man is <Col N="392" /> willing to rejoin the Army, and I would ask the Minister to give very careful consideration to the matter because, if he is not fit to rejoin, then the question of compensation will come up.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood the Minister to say that he was going to introduce a Bill dealing with cases of illness or wounds contracted by soldiers during their period of service, and I think he should go further than that. During the Black-and-Tan War, men contracted very severe illness as a result of wettings that they got, and so on, and I would ask the Minister to consider that angle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>In reply to various queries that have been made with regard to the amendment of the Army Pensions Acts, which many Deputies are anxious about, and which I, also, am anxious about, a White Paper has now been prepared, and I shall have it ready for next week, and expect to be able to introduce the Bill the following week.  It applies to wounds or illness due to service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="393" /> I do not want Deputies to get the idea that this is going to be the cure-all of all the queries that are put from time to time.  I think it is a reasonably good Act, that it will meet very many of the requirements which should have been met before this, and it will be retrospective to the beginning of the emergency.  What Deputy Corish has in mind is a totally different thing and that is being dealt with at the present time through the Army Disability Pensions Act.  Any member of the forces, in accordance with the Act, who can prove that he is suffering from a disease or from wounds received during either the Black and Tan War or the Civil War, or from disease attributable to service during these periods is entitled to go before that particular pensions board, and if he can satisfy the board that his disease is attributable to service, he is granted a pension.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

      <P>An ordinary medical certificate will not prove it to the satisfaction of the board.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It will be included. The cases of all the men in the Glen of Imaal disaster will be included also. For Deputy Dillon's information, there were 72,000 applicants for pension certificates.  I have no doubt that, while 72,000 applicants could not prove the type of active service the referee demands, there were, at some time or another, passing through the Volunteer movement 72,000 people who were prepared, if given the opportunity, to fight but that opportunity, naturally, did not fall to a large number.  As I mentioned, there are already over 13,000 people in receipt of pensions and that number will be added to, not perhaps very considerably, but possibly by 100 or more, and it will leave out a large number of men who are very dissatisfied and about whom Deputies in this House are continuously making representations and who are regarded by the board as border-line cases.  The board has had to set up a standard.  The standard is interpreted by the board and by the referee.  He is the final judge in all this thing and if he is not satisfied that the type of service which the applicant has given is the type of service which he demands then, unfortunately for the applicant, he is turned down.  I cannot do anything about that and no other Deputy can do anything about it.  There is only one way in which he can have his case reopened after his 21 days' appeal has been dealt with and that is by the submission of additional evidence which was not available at the time of the first hearing and which could not have been made available.  In no other circumstances that I know of can the case be reopened.  As far as I <Col N="395" /> know, the wording of the Act rules out the referee himself from reopening the case.  The wording of the Act, I think, is that the decision of the referee shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons and tribunals whatsoever.  I believe that that includes even the referee.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>On that point, may I ask the Minister, when the evidence of the verifying officers from a particular brigade or area is identical in two cases and the awards are different, can additional evidence be given?  The evidence is the same in both cases but in one case a pension is awarded and in the other case the applicant is disqualified although there was the same certification from the officers in the area.  What is the alternative machinery in a case of that kind?  I have two cases in mind at the moment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Dozens of cases of that type have been brought to my attention. I have had them brought to the notice of the secretary to the referee and in practically every case he has satisfied me that the suggestion that the two types of service were identical is not correct.  The files are confidential to the referee.  I cannot see the files and I have to accept the word of the secretary&mdash;and I do accept it&mdash; when he tells me that what the Deputy has been informed is not correct.  It seems to me to be a pretty general complaint that two men have been in the movement side by side, whose services appear to have been identical but whose awards are different.  In the cases I have gone into, I must certainly admit, from what I have been told by the secretary to the referee, that such is not the case and that the verifying officers when they go before the board and are giving evidence on oath must necessarily give statements of fact and the statements of fact show a large degree of differentiation.</P>

      <P>If additional evidence is furnished, and if names of additional witnesses are given in support of fairly strong cases&mdash;such as I have seen on paper, at any rate&mdash;why is it that the additional witnesses are not brought before the board or the referee?</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>As far as I know, the referee is very anxious to hear everybody who will add anything to the case and who will help him to come to a just decision.  When the referee arrives at a decision, he does not inform the applicant; he informs the Brigade Committee.  I think he gives the Brigade Committee something like 28 days to come to a decision to make any further representations that they may desire to make on behalf of the applicant whom he is turning down. At the end of 28 days, if the referee does not hear from this committee, he makes his decision, and he then gives 21 days' notice to the applicant.  He informs him that he is not a person to whom the Act applies, and he gives him 21 days in which he may appeal. In appealing he must produce evidence &mdash;it is commonsense&mdash;in addition to the evidence he has already submitted to the referee, because if he does not produce additional evidence it does not alter the referee's decision.  The evidence which he may then submit to the referee may not be sufficient to convince the referee that he is a person to whom the Act should apply by reason of the fact that the definition of active service is not met.  After that decision has been notified to the applicant, the applicant can still appeal to the Minister provided he can produce evidence of a type which will satisfy the Minister that he is entitled to service, and that the type of evidence is not such as he was able to produce at the time of the first hearing.  It must be additional evidence which was not available on the occasion of the first hearing.</P>

The referee would then have granted all possible facilities to those people to give whatever evidence they possess.

      <P>Deputies must remember that it is the referee who must be the judge of what is additional evidence, because, as I have already mentioned, the files are confidential to him. He must compare what is sent into him, what is regarded by the applicant as additional evidence, with the file which he has, and upon which his decision was made.  As far as I can see, <Col N="398" /> the referee has been fairly generous in reopening cases.  In fact, hundreds of such cases have been reopened, but the referee must be satisfied beyond yea or may that this is, in fact, additional evidence before he notifies me of the fact that, in his opinion, it is additional evidence.  If he notifies me of the fact, then I instruct him, by an endorsement on the file, to reopen and review the case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>That means that the referee is the final arbiter: that before the Minister has had an opportunity of considering the additional evidence, the referee decides whether or not he will admit it.  If he decides that it is not additional evidence, then the Minister is not allowed to examine it.  In that case the Minister is, so to speak, completely obliterated.  We want to know in what way the Minister can be approached directly in regard to this matter of additional evidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>What is regarded as additional evidence must be submitted to the Minister.  I read what is forwarded to me and, generally, I can make a fairly accurate surmise as to whether it is, in fact, additional evidence or not, because the applicant usually sends a copy of the form which he had already forwarded.  I send that to the referee, and the secretary to the referee makes a comparison.  There is no question whatever of their honesty.  I have already said that hundreds of such cases have been reopened within the last couple of years.  There is no question whatever but that if the evidence sent forward can, in any sense, be regarded as additional evidence, the case is reopened.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that the standard set by the <Col N="399" /> board for active service is more drastic now than it was up to 1938?  In other words, a man, in order to qualify, must have taken part in at least two major engagements.  Up to 1938, one major engagement was regarded as general service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That statement is not correct.  That is a fiction.  The interpretation given to active service by the present referee is the same as the interpretation given to it by his predecessor. The question of major engagements does not arise here.  The referee and the board decide what, in their opinion, was the amount of active service given by an applicant.  If they are satisfied that it comes within the interpretation which they have settled for themselves, a service certificate is awarded, and there the matter ends.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. John Flynn Mr. John Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. John Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnFlynn" hpid="Mr. John Flynn Mr. John Flynn">
      <NameTxt>Mr. John Flynn</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not correct. Deputies will have to realise that, in the beginning, the position was something like this.  The various brigade committees were asked to send forward initially the best possible types of cases that were available. It stands to reason that, in the beginning, there were what were described by the men themselves as &ldquo;stone-wall&rdquo; cases, so that the question for the board to decide was, not whether those men were entitled to service, but what amount of service they were entitled to.  Now the situation is different because the board have come to the type of case&mdash;the &ldquo;borderline&rdquo; case&mdash;that I mentioned a moment ago.  The board have great difficulty in deciding whether the type of service that this &ldquo;borderline&rdquo; case has to its credit is, in fact, the type that will qualify for active service.  The difficulty that exists in the minds of Deputies is, I think, due to this: that, <Col N="400" /> in the early stages when dealing with this examination, the board had before them the type of case usually described as a &ldquo;stone-wall&rdquo; case.  In such cases it was, presumably, easy for the board to come to a decision.</P>
      <P>They knew from the beginning of their examination that the man was, in fact, the type of person to whom the Act applied.  All they had to decide was the amount of the award they would make him.  The suggestion that a new standard has been set is quite wrong; it is a figment of someone's imagination; it does not exist.  The board is still carrying out its functions on the original standard.  What has changed is the type of men who are coming before the board; the type of service possessed by people now coming before the board is not of the same standard as in the earlier days.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I have in mind certain cases, and I know the men were on active service for a number of years. The reason they are not getting pensions is because they were not engaged in any major affair.  I know of cases where men were fully armed, and were within 200 or 300 yards, or perhaps less, of where a major engagement was in progress.  They were as much in the engagement, one might say, as the men who actually took part in it, but yet they were disqualified because they were not regarded as taking part in the major affair.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>At any rate, they have failed to convince the referee that they were engaged in the type of active service considered necessary to qualify. That is the only answer I can give in that connection.  There were cases of men who were operating in outposts, or something of that nature, and on the same operation there were men who went into physical action against the enemy.  These men have no difficulty in proving their cases, but the man who is on the outside acting merely <Col N="401" /> as a sort of outpost, has so far failed to convince the referee that he is the type of person to whom the Act applies.</P>

The appeal court is, of course, a more difficult thing to make any forecast in respect of, because there is a very large number of appeals and I do not quite know, and I am sure the board does not quite know, how many of these people will be prepared to press their claims to a final issue.</P>

Three of the men blinded there are now being well looked after at St. Dunstan's, in England, thanks to the good offices of the National Council of the Blind in Ireland, the goodness of our British neighbours, and the cooperation of the Minister.  At the time of the explosion it was a scandalous thing when certain rates of pension were offered to those men.  I think the offer was 26/- for a corporal and 30/- for a sergeant.  Were it not for the good offices of the National Council of the Blind in Ireland and the goodness of our British neighbours, these men might still be living at home, blind and helpless.</P>

      <P>If that had been done 20 years ago, what position would the men be in now?  Will the Minister give some consideration to cases such as have been mentioned in questions to-day, cases of men who died because of some disorder contracted since they joined the Army and of others who had to be retired by reason of illness? Will he consider bringing in a special Vote to allow an <i>ex gratia</i> payment without prejudice to the validity of any claim?  I am aware that in certain cases hardships have arisen by reason of the soldier or the members of his family having limited means.  One can realise that in any firm where a man who has been employed for some years dies, they brush aside all those special considerations that would be borne in mind at another time.  The State, which ought to be the best employer, by reason of regulations and enactments to which it has to pay attention is not in a position to make such a grant.  The sum would not be considerable and in these cases where hardship has arisen a great deal of discomfort and unhappiness would be avoided if it were possible to give £10 in the case of a death or £10 in the case of illness pending the introduction of legislation.</P>

The Deputy will appreciate the way in which a Department like mine is bound up by regulations and so on, which make it very difficult to handle a suggestion of that kind.  We are making what we consider reasonably fair provision for these individuals, and any man who develops a disease or illness attributable to service of a type which removes him from the service will be entitled to a pension in accordance with the Act to be brought in.  I think that is as far as we can go.  It is very doubtful whether the Deputy's suggestion, that there should be a sum available from which a gratuity could easily be paid to an individual, would be workable.</P>

If the Minister wished, the sum so paid could be deducted from any future pension. There was a special Vote&mdash;I am speaking from my recollection of nearly 20 years ago&mdash;of something like £150,000 out of which gratuities were given to officers who were demobilised.  I had a good deal to do with the administration of that sum.  Special cases of hardship arose in that connection, and if there is a sum of money such as that available, it is possible to deal with these cases rapidly.  It is not a very considerable amount, and I am quite sure that a private individual would make the provision.</P>

    <P>There are a number of sub-heads concerned in this Supplementary Estimate. The first is sub-head M (10), which deals with temporary schemes in connection with farm improvements, for which we want an additional £8,000.  Originally, a sum of £250,000 was made available from the Special Emergency Schemes Vote for the financing of the scheme, and a certain staff was provided to deal with that amount, but the number of applications which came in was far above what could be satisfied by that £250,000.  It was decided to provide another <Col N="406" /> £95,000, which would meet nearly all the applications which came in.  That meant an enlargement of staff, which accounts for this additional sum of £8,000.</P>

      <P>They were not paid for their services.  There is a sum of £2,920 in connection with sub-head O (5) which relates to the Agricultural Products (Cereals) Act.  A token sum of £5 was provided in the Estimates for this year and this further sum is now required.  The object of the scheme was to provide some inducement so as to ensure that an adequate supply of seed wheat of spring varieties would be available.  The spring seed-wheat business is a very uncertain sort of business because, if there is a favourable winter for winter sowing, the amount sown in the spring is likely to be less and the Department was very anxious that sufficient seed <Col N="407" /> wheat of spring varieties would be carried over in case we had a very bad winter.  An agreement was made with certain seed merchants for the 1941-42 season that if they agreed to assemble a certain amount of spring seed, they would get 50/- per barrel&mdash;Deputies will remember that the then fixed price for wheat was 40/- per barrel&mdash;for not more than 25 per cent. of that assembly or for half what they had left over after the season whichever was the lesser.  We succeeded in getting 110,000 barrels assembled under the scheme. There were, of course, others outside the scheme who did not avail of it because it carried certain conditions like inspection and so on.  We had to pay on 11,000 barrels&mdash;the maximum we would have to pay under our agreement was 25,000 barrels&mdash;and the amount paid out was £2,920.  This wheat was dried and stored, and was worth 46/8, under the price fixed for the year, as milling wheat.  The difference between that and 50/- was what was paid out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next item is in connection with the staffs employed in the inspection of canned meat.  Certain firms are licensed to deal in canned meat, the licence being issued under the Slaughter of Cattle and Sheep Act.  I think there are ten firms in all at the moment.  They deal principally with export, and, up to June, 1941, they were dealing with many varieties of canned meat, such as corned beef, stewed beef, beef hash, stewed steak and vegetables, ox-tongues, rabbit, Irish stew, and so on.  The British Ministry of Food, however, took over, in June, 1941, the import of all these canned products into the United Kingdom and they cut down the varieties to two.  Recently the number has been further cut to one, that is stewed steak.  In November, 1941, the Ministry of Food went further and said they would require a definite certificate on each can of meat to the effect that it had been inspected and passed by the Department of Agriculture.  This meant the provision of inspection staff in the factories for which this sum is necessary.  The amount, however, is recouped by a small levy, amounting to <Col N="408" /> one-twelfth of 1d. per 1b. on the meat going out, which is sufficient to cover the costs of inspection when collected.</P>
    <P>The next sub-head is O (12), which deals with the tillage Order, in connection with which a sum of £8,550 is required for the provision of staff. There are employed by the Department for this purpose 54 inspectors and 51 assistant inspectors, or tillage supervisors, as they are called.  With the exception of two, all the inspectors are borrowed from the Land Commission. The tillage supervisors are in a different category and are recruited temporarily for this purpose.  The remuneration of these temporary tillage supervisors is at the rate of £5 a week.  The only other item is the Appropriations-in-Aid, which, I think, are fully explained in the paper circulated and do not require further comment from me.  There are sufficient savings on the Vote for the Department from other sub-heads to cover the various items set out and the result is that this is only a token Estimate for £10.</P>

      <P>Nobody can question the wisdom of the money spent under sub-head M (10).  As a matter of fact, this Vote in the past was considerably more, and it is unfortunate that the amount expended under this heading was not maintained, because it is undoubtedly work of an improvement character that will eventually result in greater production from land in this country.  There are considerable areas of water-logged land which is deteriorating rapidly as a result of the failure to get the water away, and to open up channels for the conveyance of that water off the land, which is reasonably good grazing land.  It is certainly very useful work, which would be productive of good results.  It is unfortunate that we allowed a great many of our people to seek work across the Channel while that type of work was waiting to be done.  There is agreement in every quarter that this type of work is very useful, and very essential, and that more money should be spent on it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sub-head N (1), last year in a Vote under this heading for <Col N="409" /> the defraying of expenses in connection with foot-and-mouth disease, I asked the Minister to investigate, and the Minister undertook to investigate cases that occurred towards the end of the outbreak where people had to restock when the market was open and when the price of restocking was considerably higher than that assessed by the valuer for their stock which had to be slaughtered.  I feel that had the valuer known at the time he was fixing the valuation that it was approaching the end of the outbreak, his valuation would have been higher, particularly for dairying stock, because the moment the ports were opened the price of dairying stock jumped up.  I drew the Minister's attention to that at the time, and the Minister undertook to review a number of cases that occurred in the last two or three weeks of the epidemic.  I am aware that a considerable number of applications were sent in, and I am sure they were reviewed, but unfortunately nothing resulted. I am afraid that the Minister and the Department were influenced by the consideration that if any extra compensation were paid in any case it might result in a large number of applications for compensation.  To guard against that possibility the Minister probably decided on turning down all the applicants.  I think that was very unfortunate and most unjust, because from a number of cases I investigated I was convinced that a good case was made for additional compensation.</P>
    <P>There was one case in particular to which the leader of this Party drew the Minister's attention on more than one occasion, and nothing as yet has been done about it.  That is the case of the late Mr. Flood, of Newhall, who pleaded at the time in court that his state of health did not permit him to give personal attention to his stock, and that he relied on his steward to look after his stock.  The responsibility for failure to do so could hardly be charged against a man who was sick in bed, and who has since died.  His widow has suffered financial loss as a result of the Minister's action, and I think the Minister even still might reconsider cases of that sort.  Where there <Col N="410" /> is any possibility of an injustice being done to an individual, I think it is the Minister's responsibility to ensure that no injustice is done, because the loss of £300 or £500, or even £200 to some of these people means a very considerable hardship.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head O (5) the Minister told us about the guarantee that was given to people who assembled spring wheat.  That sum amounts to £2,691. I do not know that there is any justification for that guarantee.  There is a very considerable margin fixed for people assembling seeds, a margin of approximately 15/- per barrel.  That is a very tidy profit.  I agree that a certain amount of grain must be taken out and a certain amount of work must be done if they are to produce a decent sample.  I agree that the margin should not be too narrow, because that might result in an inferior sample, that it is good policy to leave a fair margin; but I think the margin left would certainly cover any risk of this sort. After all, during the present season any premium paid to farmers, over and above the fixed price, for grain suitable for seed purposes was not in any case more than 2/-, so that the loss incurred would be only approximately 2/- per barrel if there was a surplus left in the hands of any individual. From what I know of the attitude of people generally in the seed trade I think they would be satisfied to take any risk in that respect.  I think the margin that has been left of 15/- per barrel profit for people in the seed trade is quite sufficient without any further guarantee.</P>
    <P>Under sub-head O (7) the Minister told us about the number of firms now licensed to export canned meat: I hope the Minister is satisfying himself that the condition and quality of that meat is good.  We know what occurred a year or two ago in the case of cooked meat and I am anxious to ensure that the good name of Irish products is preserved and that there is no danger of canned meat of an inferior quality being exported, possibly under a good name and a guarantee.  There is a peculiar anomaly about the situation, namely, that old cows in this <Col N="411" /> country are worth more than similar cows in Great Britain, that they are commanding a better price here for canning purposes than old cows on the other side.  That suggests to me that there may be an admixture of inferior meat in this canned meat which may not be justified in the circumstances, and that people on the other side are under the impression that they are buying first quality canned meat which they are not getting.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that, in face of the experience we have had in the case of cooked meat a couple of years ago, when the export of cooked meat was prohibited altogether by British action, the Minister ought to ensure that this job is properly done.  He has a staff of inspectors on the job and let us hope they are doing their work.</P>
    <P>With regard to sub-head O (12)&mdash; Emergency Powers (Tillage) Orders&mdash; the Minister has told us that he has 54 permanent inspectors, and that he now proposes to put on 51 temporary inspectors.  I hope that these proposed temporary inspectors will be men of sufficient experience to know whether or not a particular piece of land is suitable for tillage purposes, because I am very doubtful as to the experience of such people.  I consider that it might lead to a serious national loss if land that is not fit for the purposes of tillage should be tilled, merely on the statement of an inspector.  It might mean that the nation would suffer a serious loss from the point of view of live-stock production.  I hold that it is very important that these inspectors would be men of experience who would know the difference between arable land and non-arable land. I understood the Minister to say that more attention was going to be paid to the actual amount of arable land in this country.  I should like him to say, definitely, whether that is so or not, because if we are to have a number of inspectors assessing the amount of land that is available for tillage, for the purposes of the present emergency, I suggest that it would be a good opportunity for getting statistical information as to the actual amount of land in this country that is suitable <Col N="412" /> for tillage.  I think the Minister should avail of the opportunity.  It would not mean very much extra work, if the thing is being properly done by competent people.</P>
    <P>Under the present Compulsory Tillage Order, the Minister takes power to compel an individual farmer to till any portion of his land that the Minister desires to have tilled.  I think that that is a very dangerous power to place in the hands of any individual. I agree, of course, that some people have tried to evade the tillage Orders by tilling land that was inferior or unsuitable for tillage, but the Minister should remember that when he delegates to a temporary inspector to designate what particular field or portion of a field a farmer must till, the farmer concerned may be antagonised the moment that inspector enters his farm. Possibly, he may resent altogether the entrance of the inspector on his premises, and a lot of bad feeling may be created at the very outset.  The inspector may then use his power and authority to bend that farmer to his will, and I think that the individual should be protected against anything of that sort occurring.</P>
    <P>The Minister should realise that different conditions exist on different holdings.  For instance, a man might want to keep a certain piece of land for grass.  It might be that the field in question would give an early bite of grass and would be good for fattening purposes and, from a national point of view, it might be a very good thing to keep that particular piece of land for that purpose, but the temporary inspector may not be the right person to judge as to that, and yet he will have the power to compel the farmer concerned to break up that piece of land.  I suggest that in such a case the farmer should be entitled to appeal to some tribunal, such as the chairman or secretary of the county committee of agriculture, or somebody nominated by the chairman of the county committee of agriculture.  I think it is only right that there should be an appeal provided for in such cases.  A temporary inspector may be sent down to the country from Dublin, <Col N="413" /> who is entirely out of sympathy with the particular problems in the country, and I think that the Minister should keep in mind the fact that the rights and privileges of individuals ought to be preserved and their interests safeguarded. Severe penalties have been inflicted during the last few months on people who failed to comply with the Compulsory Tillage Order.</P>
    <P>I have referred to that matter already, but I should like to say, in that connection, that the Minister made no attempt to provide the necessary equipment to enable these people to till.  Some counties were completely lacking in the necessary equipment.  If the Minister felt that it was his duty to make Compulsory Tillage Orders&mdash; and I agree that the present emergency demanded it&mdash;I submit that it was also his duty to provide farmers with the required equipment, particularly in view of the work that is being done by our neighbours across the water in connection with the tremendous advance in tillage there.  In Great Britain, farmers were provided with all the equipment that was necessary to provide food for the people of Great Britain, and I think it was unfair of the Government in this country to kick people into doing work when they had not the necessary equipment with which to do it.  They could not buy it at the time, and some effort should have been made to provide tractors, ploughs, and so on, through the county committees of agriculture or through some other means, to enable the people to carry out the tillage Order.  The administering of the Order should have been given to the local committees, and in areas where there was not sufficient equipment it could have been supplied through the local committees.  No attempt, however, was made to meet that situation, with the result that unfortunate individuals have been sent to prison because they failed to comply with the Order.  No matter how willing these people were to comply with the Order, they could not do so because they had not the necessary equipment. I really think that the Minister and his Department were at fault in not making some provision to deal with a situation of that kind.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="414" /> With regard to the Appropriations-in-Aid, I notice that provision was made in connection with the matter of licences to deal in wheat and barley. As I pointed out to the Minister's Department last summer, the effect of that was to reduce considerably the number of traders who had been dealing in wheat and barley, and that numbers of people who had been engaged in that trade for many years were denied a licence.  I think that, in the interest of the community generally, there should be the minimum amount of interference with the trade.  Instead of that, however, there has been the maximum amount of interference, as a result of which a number of old and well-established traders have been put out of business.  I suggest that, as a result of that, there has been a very serious loss to the community in general.</P>
    <P>The farmers who were unable to buy seeds had to look to these people for credit.  When you reduce the number of people seeking credit facilities, and when you create monopolies, the result is a tightening up of credit.  It is a short-sighted policy on the part of the Minister to put out of this business a number of people who have made their living out of it, and who have employed people to handle the grain, simply because it was more convenient for his Department to control a lesser number of people who were in the grain trade.  Without hesitation, a number of reputable firms, that have always done their business honestly and well, are pushed out of business without regard to the reaction that that will have on their financial position or the future position of these firms or of their employees, or the reaction it will have on credit facilities for agriculture all over the country.</P>
    <P>I think it was a stupid and shortsighted policy to take measures of that sort.  I do not think people who are conversant with the real problems were consulted in the matter.  That is the type of legislation by Government Order that our people are experiencing during this emergency.  The sooner the Minister makes up his mind to consult men with practical experience in these matters, the better.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="415" /> There are other aspects of the tillage Order&mdash;prices, and that sort of thing&mdash;that, I suppose, are outside the scope of this debate, but I would like to refer to beet prices.  I may say in passing that I think the Minister and the Government are unfortunate in making a cheese-paring decision with regard to beet prices this year.  From contacts I have had personally with the Sugar Beet Board, I feel satisfied that a higher price was recommended by these people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I am just making that comment in passing.  I think if a price of £4 per ton is insisted on, it will create an unfortunate position in regard to sugar next year.  I hope the Minister will consider the points I have raised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am afraid I cannot agree with my colleague, Deputy Hughes, with regard to the question of spring seed, and I do not think he was altogether correct in describing the difference of 15/- as profit. The seed situation, particularly with regard to wheat, is a very difficult one. Unless some inducement is given to seed assemblers, the country may find itself in a very serious position indeed. As a matter of fact, whether there will be enough spring seed for the coming year or not depends altogether on whether this month is wet or fine.  If we get a month of fine weather in February, plenty of winter wheat can be sown, and there will be enough spring wheat to go round, but if this month is as wet as last month was&mdash;as it very well could be&mdash;I think Deputy Hughes will agree with me that the quantity of winter wheat sown will be very small compared with last year.  I think I am right in saying that the quantity of winter seed sown up to date is very much less than the amount that was in the ground this time 12 months. I do not want to make any case whatever for the seed assemblers.  I am not one myself&mdash;I suppose I would hardly get a licence from the Minister if I <Col N="416" /> wanted one&mdash;but I do not think it is quite accurate&mdash;and I am sure Deputy Hughes would not want to be unfair&mdash; to say that the margin of 15/- is profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I qualified that.  I said certain small grain would be taken out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMorrissey" hpid="Mr. D. Morrissey Mr. D. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows as well as I do that where you have kiln-dried seed, particularly in a season like last harvest, the reduction from drying, screening and so on, would be 10 per cent.  The handling and transport charges are pretty stiff.  However, I do not want to go into all that question. I am not in a position to know whether the margin of profit allowed is sufficient or not, but certainly I would be very nervous if any action were to be taken by this House or by the Minister which would bring about a position that seed assemblers would not feel it was worth their while to take the risk, because there is a very definite risk in it.  If they have a surplus and it has to be resold it entails a far bigger loss to them than the 2/- Deputy Hughes mentioned.</P>
      <P>There is another very important aspect of this seed question that I want to take up with the Minister.  I want to call the Minister's particular attention to the testing of samples of seed sent to the Department.  I know there has been an enormous increase in the number of samples sent to the Department for test and I daresay the staff are pretty heavily taxed on that account, but surely there is no reason in the world why a month, six weeks and, in some cases, two months, should elapse before the test is made by the Department.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Tests can be made locally in every county.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking about what happened last year.  While local tests may be all right, I am prepared to wait to see whether they are or not. It may not be very technical, but the point I am making to the Minister is that, last year, a month, six weeks and, in some cases, two months elapsed before the test was returned.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While on this matter, I would like <Col N="417" /> to hear from the Minister what machinery he has set up to see that the 85 per cent. germination that he has provided for will be carried out.  I think Deputies who live in what I may call grain-growing areas are satisfied that a great deal of grain was sold as seed last year that was not fit for seed. In some cases germination was as low as 50 per cent., which is a dead loss. Under the Emergency Powers (Tillage) Order, the Minister has, I understand, a total of 105 inspectors, including permanent staff and 51 temporary staff.  If possible, I would like the Minister to tell us, when he is replying, how those inspectors are allocated over the various counties.  It seems to me that inspectors are very active in districts and counties where there is a very good tillage tradition and in some of which the tillage would be up to 50 and, in some cases, 60 per cent. of the total arable land while it would appear that in certain other areas no inspectors are available.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister for Agriculture to have a word with the Taoiseach. It will, I think, be admitted that generally speaking, farmers have responded in a magnificent way to the call made upon them.  They have responded, notwithstanding the fact that they know, because of the absence of fertilisers, that they are, so to speak, taking the very heart out of the best fields on their farms.  In view of that it is, to say the least of it, irritating to be told by the head of the State in a speech made under the Grow More Food campaign that scientists have told him that wheat, far from taking more out of the soil, takes less out of it than many other crops.  No farmer who is growing wheat believes that. If every member of the Dáil, with the Taoiseach, were to tell him so, he would not believe it, because practical experience has taught him that it is not so.  It does not matter what the scientists may say, the facts are there. People were faced with the position this year of having to put a second or a third crop of wheat into the same ground.  They were forced to do that, even though they knew they were faced with dwindling yields.  In the <Col N="418" /> same speech we were told that there was no reason in the world why we should not have plenty of sugar since we have the seed, the land and the factories, but the fourth essential was not mentioned at all.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Morrissey Mr. Morrissey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Morrissey</NameTxt>
      <P>It does, as a matter of fact.  I just mention beet to make the point that what was said is having an irritating effect on farmers who are genuinely trying to do their best.  On that occasion, if the Taoiseach suggested that fertilisers were not just as essential as the seed, the land or the factory then, of course, his statement was not correct.  The Minister for Agriculture knows far better than I do that you cannot produce beet without manures.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of other points I could make on this Estimate but it is not my intention to detain the House.  I want to say, in regard to my colleague's statement about the severe penalties that have been inflicted, that while undoubtedly there are cases where men have endeavoured, to the best of their ability, to comply with the tillage Order, there are, as we all know, others who have made no effort, or at least very little effort, to comply with the tillage Order.  In the circumstances in which we find ourselves, faced with the risk of our people going hungry, I think that the man who deliberately evades his duty, the man who has the way of producing food and fails to do so, should be penalised in a severe way.  I know, as Deputy Hughes says, that if you take the man in a non-tillage area who has a considerable amount of arable land, it may not be possible for him, even though he has the best will in the world, owing to the lack of equipment and the necessary amount of skilled labour, to provide his full quota of tillage.  The courts, I suppose, cannot take that into consideration, and a penalty has <Col N="419" /> to be inflicted.  There are numbers of people who are genuinely trying to do their duty in regard to tillage and have failed through no fault of their own. While I say that, I am afraid that there are far more who have not made a genuine effort to do so and who, apparently, even now do not realise that there is a national duty imposed on them to provide at least the quota laid down by law so as to help to feed the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>There are two points that I want to bring to the Minister's notice.  The first refers to the issue of licences to seed merchants.  This concerns a man who had stored some hundreds of barrels of wheat suitable for seed and who was compelled to sell it at the normal price for milling.  His case is that the wheat had cost him more, and was worth more, than the price he received for it, and that it was lost for seed purposes.  When a citizen loses money it is natural that he should feel very resentful about it, particularly when that comes about through the administration of a Department of State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>My second point has to do with the penalties inflicted for non-compliance with a tillage Order.  On the first occasion that I saw that a man had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment for such an offence, it struck me that it is not a good thing to send a man away from his farm during a period of crisis.  While some people may feel that a sentence of that sort might be deserved, it is quite possible that it would bring the law into contempt locally because when the severity of a penalty is very marked there is usually a reaction from it.  In any case, it ought not to be the policy during a period of the emergency to take people away from their farms. Even if the Minister were to insist on a penalty of that sort being imposed, it might be considered whether the imprisonment might not take place until the emergency had passed.  There may be circumstances connected with some of those cases, cases such as Deputy Morrissey mentioned, which would warrant a mitigation of a penalty of that sort.  Generally speaking, there <Col N="420" /> has been a remarkable response all over the country to get an extension of tillage during the present period.  It is just possible that persuasion might do more good than a severe penalty.</P>
    <P>Another point put to me from certain quarters was this: that some apprehension is felt by having inspectors to select the particular fields which farmers are to be compelled to till.  I understand there is some case for that, that in certain instances fields were tilled which were utterly unsuitable for the purpose.  In cases of the kind it would be well if some announcement were made to the effect that it was not intended to interfere with any person who tilled suitable land: in other words, that a discretion in selecting fields for tillage would be left exclusively to farmers.  However perfect the Minister's inspectors may be, people with practical experience in agriculture would, I think, have more confidence in the judgement of the farmer himself as to the fields on his farm that he considered most suitable for tillage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to sub-head M (10) it does seem extraordinary that although the allocation under it shows a reduction, the amount that is being provided for salaries, wages and allowances shows an increase of £8,000.  An increase in administration costs seems to be infectious so far as this Government is concerned.  This particular allocation for an improvement in connection with farms is certainly a step in the right direction.  I think everybody in the country appreciates the efforts that are being made in that respect.  The only criticism is that enough is not being allocated, and that enough is not being done.  In connection with this, there is one particular matter which has arisen very acutely at the present time.  Owing to the new administration under the county managerial system you have a tightening up in connection with the maintenance of by-roads.  It has been pointed out to me that a good many of those by-roads which, in the ordinary way were done by the county councils, are not now being done at all.  These are roads which are used exclusively by, possibly, 10 or 12 farmers for the <Col N="421" /> production of farm produce.  The Minister may reply that money is not available now.  Even if money were available, I think that, should the Minister inquire into the matter, he will find that there are difficulties in administration which have not been overcome.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  I am endeavouring to point out that the farm improvements scheme does apply to those roads, and that that particular aspect ought to receive more attention.  Any tightening-up might tend to deprive those roads of the maintenance which they would otherwise receive.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I know it does not, but I am aware that county councils were turning the &ldquo;blind eye&rdquo; to certain utility roads, or roads that were not statutorily declared to be roads of utility, and if they were to do these roads now they might not be able to do so many of them.  I was given to understand that the Local Government Department was considering that a grave hardship was going to arise and that a move was to be made in the Minister's Department with a view to having an extension of the farm improvements scheme.  I hope the Minister will favour that, because it is a matter of very great importance to farmers who have no other way of getting to their lands.  The scheme does apply to them but these difficulties are there. The administration of the scheme is always a difficulty and unless it is administered either through a public works inspector or a county surveyor I do not think there will be satisfaction. I should like the Minister seriously to consider that side and, if money can be made available in that way, it will help to make these roads, which will be of very great assistance to large sections of the community.  The whole scheme, I must say, has been of very considerable benefit, even though it is a small one, comparatively speaking.  Much very good work has been done under <Col N="422" /> it, and I do not think the Minister could do better than extend it.</P>
      <P>With regard to the assembly of stocks of spring seed wheat, Deputy Hughes, Deputy Morrissey and other Deputies drew attention to that matter in different ways.  Speaking for my part of the country, I do not think there is now any necessity for giving a guarantee to the assemblers of seed wheat.  Possibly last year or the year before, when there was not so much spring seed wheat being sown and people were not so well acquainted with the growing of it, there might have been some necessity, but that period has passed and I am convinced, like Deputy Hughes, that the competition between the buyers is in itself quite sufficient to induce seed merchants to lay in the necessary amount of seed.</P>
      <P>It is very questionable whether the seed merchants are in every case paying attention to the cleaning of the seed and the taking away of the small wheat, as contemplated by the Minister. I would like to see it done, and I would not like to see anyone at a loss doing it, but it is questionable if it is being done as rigidly as we would like. After all, the buyer must take what is presented to him and he cannot do very much more.  I think it is a mistake to try to show that if that is being done pretty rigidly it means a great loss to the seed merchants.  What the merchant takes off is generally sold at the milling price and therefore it is not a loss.  It is sold under the seed price, but if it is sold at the milling price there is no loss.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sub-head O (7), I observe there the employment of ten temporary lay inspectors for the purpose of the dead meat trade.  I should like to know from the Minister what are the qualifications of those lay inspectors.  I do not think the Minister could be too strict, too particular, or too careful with regard to these inspections. There was an old saying used by a previous member of this House that we required to be consistently good rather than occasionally very good.  That is just what we want and, as far as the dead meat trade is concerned, every inspection necessary to <Col N="423" /> keep matters right and to see that there are no complaints from the other side&mdash;from the importers&mdash;is carefully carried out.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were paid through the inspectors it would be a very bad system.  In sub-head O (12) I observe there are 51 temporary tillage supervisors. What are the qualifications of these people?  What is the difference between an inspector and a supervisor? Have they different functions&mdash; are they doing different work?  If the work of a supervisor is to see that tillage is carried out in a proper fashion, then I should like to know his qualifications. I was somewhat worried over the right of the Minister or his inspector to go into a man's land and declare that a certain field or fields should be tilled.  A good case can be made for that, and I agree that the Minister must have that right&mdash;I do not want to take it from him&mdash;but I should like that there would be some method of appeal.  I agree that some people were engaged in a type of tillage in which they ought not to engage, and they were trying to get away with it.  The country requires food and if the fields that were tilled were not able to give us the type of food required, then the people owning those fields ought to be compelled to produce the proper food.  That is the law on the other side of the Channel, and it is very effective.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see that the farmer <Col N="424" /> who objects to till a particular field that may be pointed out to him will have the right of appeal against the inspector.  It would be manifestly unfair if an inspector were to come to me and say: &ldquo;You must till that field.&rdquo; I may want that field for a particular purpose, in order to graze my cattle, for example, and possibly it might be a field that I cannot afford to till because, through lack of water elsewhere, I may have to put stock on that field in the summer.  There may be many reasons why I should not till a particular field, and, if the inspector and myself disagree, I should like to have some right of appeal to some person.  I do not mind if it is the senior inspector of the county, provided there is more than one mind brought to bear on the matter, but if I have to subject my will to what may be the whim of an inspector, I consider that is wrong.  I maintain the Minister ought to have the right that he now possesses so that food may be produced, but at the same time the owner ought to have a right of appeal.</P>
    <P>The Minister might also inform us with regard to (23) in the Appropriations-in-Aid&mdash;receipts from fees in respect of allocations by the Cereals Distribution Committee.  Higher up we have receipts from licences to deal in wheat and barley, and now we have this reference to the Cereals Distribution Committee.  I should like the Minister to put us wise as to what those two things are.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It astonishes me to hear the Opposition announcing that they are in favour of granting the Minister's inspectors the right to go into any man's holding and to order him: &ldquo;Till a particular field.&rdquo;  Why not take over the land of the country altogether and declare that the farmers are an unscrupulous gang of lunatics?  How many farmers who are required to till 25 per cent of their land will deliberately go out and till the least suitable part of their land?  I do not deny that there may be a couple of lunatics in every county who will do that kind of thing, but, in order to control two lunatics, are you going to take from every free citizen the right to run his own farm in <Col N="425" /> accordance with the husbandry he has learned from his father or wherever he happened to pick up his information? Every bureaucracy in the world is prepared to find some exceptional case, and, using this excuse, claim the right to strip us all of our liberty and dignity as human beings.</P>
      <P>Why should any man come into my land and tell me: &ldquo;You must till this field and you must not till that field&rdquo;? I am a much better judge of what field I should till than the Minister, and an infinitely better judge than most of the casual inspectors he has going around the country at present.  I do not deny that there are men in the Department whose advice on that problem I should be very glad to have, but these are not the men going around the country.  The men going around the country as inspectors are emergency employees.  They are excellent men, I have no doubt, and dutiful men, and I do not desire to asperse them in any way, but why should we invest them with the right to tell men who have been born and bred on the land what part of their land they are to cultivate and what part they are not to cultivate?  Is it on the ground that there are two lunatics in the whole of County Roscommon?</P>

Is there no means except that of publishing to the whole world that the farmers of this country are so incompetent, or so unserupulous, that it has become necessary not only to ordain compulsory tillage but to go in and force them to till a particular field?  The remedy is out of all proportion to the evil. Deputies may have heard of odd individuals <Col N="426" /> who have behaved in that way.  Is there one individual in Deputy Brennan's parish who has behaved in that way?</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot think of one in mine.  I know many people who, for one reason or another, resented the obligation to cultivate 25 per cent. of their land&mdash;wrongly resented it, in my opinion, in the circumstances in which we find ourselves at present&mdash;but having made up their minds that they were constrained to obey the law, they tilled it like rational men.  There have even been individuals who were foolish enough to refuse to till, but I have yet to meet any man who, undertaking to till, went out deliberately and tilled the wrong field.</P>
      <P>I do not deny that such lunatics may exist, but they are few and far between, and that such power should be handed over to the horde of inspectors prancing around the country at present seems to me to be the wildest supererogation and an extremely dangerous precedent to establish, even in a time of emergency like this. Powers of that kind are extremely easy to confer but desperately difficult to withdraw, and the last 10 years of Fianna Fáil agricultural policy do not give me any confidence in investing them or their nominees with the right to come in and tell me how to run my land.  If they had had that power for the last 10 years&mdash;and they would have loved to have it&mdash;80 per cent. of the farmers would be bankrupt, instead of the 40 per cent. they have succeeded in destroying.  By persuasion, they wrecked 40 per cent. of the best farmers, but if they had had compulsory powers, they would have destroyed the vast majority.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Although they are powers which I do not think they ought to have, I think it is reasonable that any Government in a time of emergency of this kind should be entitled to go to the agricultural community and say: &ldquo;We require from your land a certain percentage of cultivated crops,&rdquo; and then let the farmer apply his special knowledge to his own holding, using his stipulated area of land to be tilled to <Col N="427" /> its best advantage, but I would expect, in a situation of that kind, if the Government really wanted tillage that they would resort not only to compulsion and publicity but to the persuasion of economic prices as well.</P>
    <P>This discussion has so far proceeded on the ground that the Government has done everything that reasonable men could do in order to induce persons, compelled or exhorted to till their land, to till not only their quota but rather more.  What inducement is there to till land&mdash;I distinguish between &ldquo;inducement&rdquo; and &ldquo;compulsion&rdquo;&mdash;and to grow barley which you are bound to sell to the brewer at 35/- per barrel when the man in England is getting 70/- from the same brewer for the same barley?  What is the use of putting up posters in green and red all over the country telling us to grow more food if the barley we grow is sold to the brewer at 35/- per barrel, with the brewer buying the same barley in Great Britain for 70/-, and glad to pay it?</P>
    <P>What sense or meaning is there in putting up posters all over the country, and announcing a price of 25/8 per barrel for feeding oats, and then bringing oats from Canada, risking Irish lives and Irish ships to import oats into Ireland from Canada?  Suppose that in Great Britain they fixed a price of 6½d. per ton for coal and then began importing coal into Newcastle from South Africa, would not the people say that the British Government had gone mad?  Is coal any more abundant in Newcastle than oats ought to be in this country?  But we have managed to manipulate things in such a way here that we are actually importing oats from Canada across the submarine-infested waters of the Northern Atlantic, and the members of the Opposition congratulate the Minister on his activities and say that he ought to have further and better compulsory powers&mdash;apparently labouring under the illusion that everything in the garden is lovely.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am complaining bitterly against the general assumption that seems to obtain in this House that it is justifiable to strengthen the compulsory powers of the Minister to constrain farmers to do this and to do that, when, at the same time, the Minister is doing all those things best calculated to prevent the farmer of goodwill from collaborating with the Government in their desire to get more food produced from the land.</P>
      <P>I say, and I have said it again and again in this House, that compulsory powers of this character would not be necessary at all if the Minister had said, or would now say, that a certain percentage of every farm over 40 acres should be laid down to wheat, and that oats and barley should be sold on the public market for whatever they would fetch.  I declare that, if that is done, an adequate supply of wheat can be secured from the land of this country and that we will get not only sufficiency but a surplus of oats and barley as well.  I protest most emphatically against the Minister's giving powers to his temporary inspectors to go around and tell farmers which field they are to till and how to run their own holdings. I forecast that if that is done, far from increasing the efficiency of the agricultural effort of this country, it will raise issues and quarrels and ill-will well calculated most seriously to interfere with the output of cereal and other cultivated crops in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no reason to proceed on the <Col N="429" /> assumption that our farmers are all irresponsible lunatics, they are not. They have done their job extremely well for generations.  It has never been necessary to send out a flock of Fianna Fáil canvassers in order to persuade them to do their job.  They were well able to do it long before Fianna Fáil was ever heard of.  In the last war they produced not only enough for ourselves, but an immense surplus which was exported abroad and the earnings of which enabled our people to carry through the economic war started by the Taoiseach and his colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Government. Is it not true that in the last war we produced not only enough food for our own people, but that we exported vast quantities to Great Britain?</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that the highest acreage of wheat grown here in the last war was 180,000 acres; now it is 575,000 acres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It means simply that a different scheme was elaborated during the last war for getting certain supplies.  We produced other crops during the last war and exported them.  Now we have chosen another course, namely, to produce wheat.  I am not going to argue now as to the wisdom or unwisdom of that.  It has been settled.  My advice to my friends in the country has been: &ldquo;Once a fight is over on a question of policy <Col N="430" /> of that kind, then you have to do your best to make the policy adopted a success, whether you approve of it or not.&rdquo;  My advice to them now is to grow their due quota of wheat and more if they are able.  But what I am trying to get out of the land of this country is not only a starvation diet for our own people, but a sufficient diet for our own people and the wherewithal to earn the wealth and prosperity that our people need now and for post-war years.  There is no need for this famine mind.  If the situation were properly handled, the land of this country could produce an abundance of food for our own people and a very considerable exportable surplus.  It is this crazy approach to the problem, the assumption that all the farmers are malignant lunatics trying to sabotage the effort to produce food for our own people, that has got us into the mess in which we are.  If the approach had been that the farmers knew their business better than the Fianna Fáil Government, if they had been asked in a rational way to produce what was required, we would have got not only what was required, but a surplus.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is there any Deputy who will deny that if there was a free market in oats and barley it would not be necessary to fill ships in Canada with oats for Ireland?  Is there any Deputy who will deny that if the price of pigs had not been beaten down at a most crucial moment all the food stuffs necessary to raise pigs would be produced and we would have enough bacon at present and a surplus to export?  Is it not because these things were mishandled that we find ourselves in the desperate position of trying to produce sufficient to support our own people without exporting at all?  I say that the solution of that is there for the taking.  If the requisite acreage of wheat is made compulsory and every farmer over a certain acreage is required to sow so many acres of wheat and then told to go ahead and make as much as he can out of his land, instead of having a famine in eggs, a famine in butter, a famine in bacon, a famine in oats and oatmeal, and a famine in barley, I say with confidence we would have a surplus <Col N="431" /> of oats, a surplus of barley, a surplus of eggs, a surplus of butter, and a surplus of bacon.</P>
    <P>What makes me mad is that, in face of that evidence of incompetence on the part of the Government, the Opposition is now saying: &ldquo;What is wrong is that you have not enough compulsory powers; get a stronger screw and squeeze the farmers tighter.&rdquo; Every screw they put on the farmer has made the situation worse.  Every compulsion they have placed on him has been the wrong compulsion and has produced an undesirable result.  The proposal now is to strengthen the capacity of the Government to drive the farmers of this country, instead of saying to the Government: &ldquo;Wake up to your own folly and avail yourselves of the immense assets you have in the skill, wisdom and accumulated experience of the farmers, instead of paralysing them.&rdquo;  Is there anybody in this House who would join with me in protesting against the use of Irish ships and Irish seamen for importing oats from Canada into Ireland?  Is there any Deputy who shares my shame at that transaction?  Is there any Deputy who shares my humiliation that we have been held up before the world as a nation unable, at our time of life, on our own land, to produce enough oats to feed ourselves?  Is there a Deputy who ever dreamt he would see that day dawn?  The first bag of oats taken off that ship from Canada ought to be welded with cement into a monument and erected outside the town house of Dr. James Ryan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

We established a group of gentlemen, <Col N="434" /> called seed-wheat rehandlers, and these were men who, in the ordinary way, would deal with the distribution of seed wheat, but these gentlemen had the bare-faced effrontery to go to the Government and say, in effect: &ldquo;We will not engage in the handling of seed wheat unless you guarantee us against any possible loss.&rdquo;  Just imagine what would happen in the case of, say, Guinness's Brewery if Messrs.  Guinness were to come to the Government and say: &ldquo;We will not brew any more stout unless you, the Government, guarantee us against any possible loss; and if you do not guarantee us against the possibility of loss, we shall close down the brewery.&rdquo; That would mean the closing down of the brewery and public houses all over the country, and when the seed merchants made such a demand, the proper answer to be made to them was: &ldquo;If you are not willing to do this without a guarantee against loss, we will get other people to do it; we will get other people to handle seed barley, seed oats or seed wheat; and instead of trying to hold us up to ransom, you ought to be grateful for the extra business we are putting in your way.&rdquo; Instead of that, these people were actually bribed by the State to take a profit on every acre of seed wheat that was sown, and, not content with that, the next stage was that they were given a fixed price, which the Minister admits leaves no margin of profit for the retail trader.  Queen Wilhelmina wheat, for instance, is sold at Ballaghadereen at the price of 3/3 a stone, as fixed by the Minister's Department, but no provision is made for the cost of transport from the railway station or distribution by the retailer, whereas the gentlemen to whom I am referring have their profits guaranteed by the State.  There is not enough margin of profit left to pay for the cartage from the railway station to the shop, but since the price has been fixed by the Minister or his Department, the answer from these gentlemen is that they are not interested in whether any profit is left for the retailer or not. They say: &ldquo;That is our price; the Minister has fixed it.&rdquo;  The result is that it is impossible for any retailer to distribute the seed and make even <Col N="435" /> the smallest profit.  When the Minister is asked about that, his answer is that he is aware of it, but that he cannot do anything about it.  When the retailers ask: &ldquo;What are we going to do about this thing?&rdquo; all the Minister says is: &ldquo;There is nothing that I can do about it.&rdquo;  The result is that the retailers in the country cannot distribute the seed, which means a corresponding expense and trouble on the small farmers who cannot get it except through these retailers.</P>
      <P>Would you not think that the Government, having sustained this ring of seed handlers for the last ten years, and having guaranteed them against loss during that period, would say to them: &ldquo;You have got to charge a reasonable price for the seed so as to enable the small farmers and the retailers to get their requirements. You could save them the cost, at least, of having to break up the bulk of their requirements into five-stone parcels.&rdquo;  The Minister's answer to that, however, is that he cannot do anything about it, so let things roll as they are.  That is what seems to me to indicate a grim and contemptible incompetence, and that is what annoys me.  The fact that any Minister, sitting in the headquarters of this country, can say: &ldquo;There is nothing that I can do about it, so let things roll&rdquo;, is the thing that particularly annoys me.  I could understand the Minister saying that he and his Department would fix a price for the rehandlers and also for the retailers, and then wash his hands of the whole business, but the futility, helplessness and absurdity of a man sitting in his office and saying that there is nothing that he can do about the situation, astonishes me&mdash;and this, seemingly, because he cannot compel persons, whom he has subsidised for the past ten years, to collaborate with him in a scheme for the national welfare.</P>
      <P>I should like the Minister to tell us before this debate ends, what is going to be the cost of the oats that he is bringing in from Canada.  Why does he believe that it is more expedient to bring oats into this country than wheat?  If there was vacant tonnage wherein to bring oats&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I note those two points. I repeat to the Minister why cannot you get enough oats grown in this country; what is the price of the oats going to be that you brought from Canada?  If the price of oats imported from Canada f.o.q. Dublin is dearer than 25/8 a barrel, would it not be a very much sounder business to allow the farmers of this country to get the Canadian price for oats that they grow in this country and forbear from carting those oats across the Atlantic ocean?  Would not you have a much better prospect of getting a greater amount of them by paying the Canadian price, or a part of it, to the farmers of this country for producing oats, instead of carting them across the <Col N="438" /> Atlantic ocean?  Does not exactly the same consideration apply to barley?  If you got a sufficiency of barley produced from the land of this country and a sufficiency of oats produced from the land of this country, what insuperable difficulty would confront you in feeding our people?  I suggest to the Minister that no such insuperable difficulty would confront him but that if his heart were set&mdash;as it may legitimately be set&mdash;on providing 100 per cent. wheat supply from our own land, what conceivable objection could he have to securing the production of that by compelling every farmer in this country with over a certain acreage, every farmer with more than 20 or 30 acres of land, to sow a certain percentage of his land in wheat?  If he thinks now that it is requisite and practical for him to take powers not only to compel a farmer to sow a certain percentage of his land but to sow a particular field of his land, if that is administratively possible, what administrative difficulty would prevent him from requiring every farmer in this country to sow a certain percentage of wheat in his land?  If Deputy Brennan thinks that it is administratively possible to give a right of appeal to every farmer from a decision that such and such a field must be cultivated, what conceivable objection could there be to an overriding law applying to every farmer with more than 30 acres of land in this country, requiring him to sow a certain percentage of his land in wheat and leaving him a right of appeal to get his land exonerated from the obligation to grow wheat if he could prove beyond doubt that his land was unsuitable for the cultivation of that crop?  What irreparable loss would he suffer even if in one season he was required to sow wheat on unsuitable land while his appeal against the order was under consideration?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What percentage of the total number of farmers affected would be seriously injured by an Order of that kind?  I do not believe a half of 1 per cent.  In that way you could get all the wheat we require.  We could get a surplus of oats, a surplus of barley and a surplus <Col N="439" /> of all those agricultural products founded on these particular crops, instead of being confronted with the famine conditions we have at the present time.  I warn this House that if you are trying to get yourselves out of the hopeless famine supply position in which you now are by further compulsion, by running amuck like a mad bull, driving in to every farmer's gate and upsetting the whole community, far from improving the situation, you will- greatly disimprove it.  Whereas if you could reorientate your whole mind in approaching the agricultural community in this country and allow people to make some profit on the work they are doing and tell them clearly and precisely what is essential to be done and, outside that restricted sphere, leave them the widest discretion to use their land to the best advantage, you will get an ever increasing production and an ever increasing easement of the strain under which the community is at present living.  How any rational Opposition could solemnly get up here and advocate that that Minister with his record should be given further and greater compulsory powers to harry the agricultural community in this country surpasses me to understand. So far as I am concerned, I protest against it most emphatically.  I think they are thoroughly undesirable from the broad point of view, and I think they are well calculated to bring disaster on the whole agricultural production of this country if pursued for any considerable time.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to sub-head M (10), I am glad to see that the Minister is taking steps to hasten inspection in cases where persons have applied for grants so that the work can go ahead. I would like to urge on the Minister that his inspectors should be a little less rigid in their decisions.  In my opinion this is one of the best schemes that has been brought in as far as the agricultural community are concerned. It gives a good deal of extra employment and it helps farmers to get improvements carried out.  Cases have been brought to my attention where there seems to be a rigid amount above which the inspector cannot go, particularly <Col N="440" /> in connection with drainage schemes.  Where the digging of a drain costs over a certain amount a perch the inspector apparently cannot go beyond that, and I have four or five cases where a scheme fell through on that account.  Inspectors informed persons concerned that they could not be given 50 per cent. of the amount.  I would ask the Minister to look into that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to see that extra inspectors are now being appointed, and that there will be no further hold up in the scheme.  Another matter is that inspectors are too rigid in regard to the qualifications of the farmer.  To my mind, any farmer who is prepared to employ extra labour and to improve his land should be entitled to the grant and there should be none of this quibbling about valuations or that he is not making his money mainly by farming.  What we want in this country is employment and employment in the rural areas as far as possible.  This is a scheme for employment without the usual corps of supervisors, inspectors and all the rest of it, where work will be supervised by men capable of supervising it.  In this particular scheme I think the Minister could be a little more free with the grants and thereby create employment. In regard to the Cereals Acts I agree with the Minister.  In the constituency that I represent 50 per cent. of the land is under tillage.  I think I could nearly claim the same percentage for the whole county.  The statements that we had from Deputy Dillon were the most ridiculous that I have heard for a long time.  He made a comparison between the present time and the conditions that obtained during the last war.  At that time we had plenty of artificial manure coming into the country, more than we could use.  Plenty of imported feeding stuffs were to be obtained at a price.  Now we can obtain neither.  We have to work from what we can produce here.  I know what has happened. I know farmers who never tilled their land before, men who, if you like, had a prejudice against tillage. They have got the idea that <Col N="441" /> oats will take less out of the land than wheat.  They have sown oats on land that would grow a good crop of wheat. They had such heavy crops of oats that they got bent to the ground and could not be cut.  People travelling by rail from Cork to Dublin can see plenty of examples of that on each side of the railway track.  In my opinion, it was absolutely sound to appoint inspectors to compel such people to sow wheat on their land.  In my view, if the tillage Order was properly enforced we would have no shortage of grain for anything.  I have seen no improvement whatever over an area of land that I have spoken about here for two years in succession, the area stretching from Limerick Junction to Charleville.  There is not even 10 per cent. of it under tillage, not to speak of 25 per cent.  I have pointed it out to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle hundreds of times.  You may see three or four acres, or perhaps only half an acre, in one of those fields ploughed.</P>
    <P>The people in Cork County are doing their duty under the tillage scheme in the production of grain for the people. It is my duty, as one of their representatives, to insist that the Minister will enforce his tillage Order in other counties because it is unfair and unjust to see some of our finest land untilled while people are hungry for bread. That is definitely wrong.  Deputy Dillon spoke about having plenty of butter, and eggs and pigs.  Where is he going to get them in this emergency? I am not going to deal with his past actions, but I want to remind him of this, that in 1938 we had about 550,000 tons of maize, cotton cake and other feeding stuffs, as well as 250,000 tons of bran and pollard being brought into the country.  Last year, to replace that, we grew 276,000 extra acres of oats and barley.  If you want to fatten a pig you must do so on grain of some description.  The position was that you had 276,000 tons of grain to replace the 750,000 tons that you bought in prewar. On that basis how could you expect to have enough feeding stuffs for animals?  We must not only increase our tillage but we must have what the Minister is looking for, a rigid enforcement <Col N="442" /> of the tillage Order right through the country.  We must see that nobody gets away with it.  We are not, as Deputy Dillon has said, making accusations against the farmers.  If one, two, or at the utmost 5 per cent. of the farmers are not doing their duty in this crisis, we say that they have either got to do it or get out.  If they will not do their duty they will not be any loss to the country if they have to get out.  By their present attitude they are casting a slur on the farmers who are doing their duty, and I do not believe that the latter are prepared to allow those gentlemen to hide behind their backs.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon's cure would be to compel every farmer to put a certain percentage of his land under wheat.  I would like to see him go down to Connemara and say to the farmers there that they should put a certain percentage of their arable land under wheat.  During the last election this Party got a lot of votes down there largely because of the lunatic speeches made by the Deputy.  There are certain areas in this country that are suitable for wheat growing and that will give a good wheat crop, but these, to a large extent, have been put under oats.  The owners of such land thought that the oat crop would pay them better until the crop lodged.</P>
    <P>I agree with the Minister's policy in seeing that those people grow wheat on their land.  We have poor land in other parts of the country that is more suitable for the growing of oats and barley.  Every farmer, I suppose, does what suits him, but in this crisis we must all till.  We are doing that in my constituency.  We have actually gone so far as to encroach on the provision of essential milk supplies for Cork City.  We decided to till a sufficient amount of our land in order to keep the country going.  We are proud of that, even though by so doing we endangered the milk supply to Cork City. We have done our duty as regards tillage and have a proud record in that respect.  There is no need to have inspectors hanging around our part of the country.  We have done our job.  I hope the Minister will not get up to tell me that the farmers in that part of <Col N="443" /> the country to which I have alluded here on at least three occasions have done their duty as regards tillage. I will ask him to consult the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in that respect.  I have called him to the railway carriage window and shown him on many occasions the area of land running from Limerick Junction down to Charleville, and I have pointed out the amount of land tilled.  A quarter of an acre in the corner of a 40-acre field might be ploughed up, and the inspectors are either blind or lacking in their duty.  They are not doing their job, and I have an objection to voting extra money for any man who is not doing his job.  I have been carefully watching that particular stretch of country every week this winter in order to see if it would be ploughed for winter or spring wheat.  It has not been ploughed yet, and this is the month of February.  If the Minister will send one of his inspectors by rail, he will be able to see the area of land under tillage. I am sure there is not 10 per cent. of that land under tillage.  I object to having one part of the country over-doing their duty as regards tillage while other areas get scot free. That is unfair and unjust.  This is a matter of vital importance and I am anxious to see justice done to everyone.</P>
    <P>I will say that the scheme in connection with farm improvements is the best scheme that has been brought in yet, so far as the ordinary working farmers are concerned.  I should like to see it extended.  I do not want to have any man coming to my door, as has been the case during the last six months, to tell me that his scheme has been turned down because there was no inspector to make inquiries.  I am glad to see that that is being remedied here.  I do not want to see any man who is prepared to carry out improvements on his farm, and who is anxious to give employment, turned down because it is suggested that he is not deriving his living mainly from farming. If any man is anxious to give employment on the land, to employ men who would otherwise have to go to England, then in God's name give him the money, because it will be better <Col N="444" /> expended than the &ldquo;dole.&rdquo;  Let there be no red tape in this matter.</P>
    <P>I have in mind one man who has expended between £700 and £800 on his holding within the last 12 months. He has carried out many improvements. In the ordinary course he should be entitled to some consideration, but now he is told that he cannot be assisted as he is not deriving his living mainly from farming.  He has given employment to men who otherwise would be a burden on the country. He has been doing a meritorious thing and the Government should recognise that and help him out.  But there is too much red tape hanging around the Department, too much officialdom, and it should be brought to an end.</P>
    <P>As regards the other issue, I hope that within the next week the Minister will send his inspectors to that area and they can see for themselves the amount of tillage that is being done. If the people in that area are not satisfied to carry out their obligations, their land should be taken over and used as the Government think fit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>We are wasting more time in argument on this point than I would require to state my case.  The Minister said in Wexford that in consequence of a scarcity of margarine and fats more butter was being used&mdash;that the people were consuming more butter.  Three or four days after the Minister was in Wexford&mdash;Friday and Saturday last&mdash;it was absolutely impossible to get butter there.  The poorer people, old age pensioners and persons in receipt of widows' and orphans' pensions, were unable to procure butter in return for the vouchers they received from the employment exchange and the Department of Local Government.  That is a very bad state of affairs.  If the butter is there, it must be in the creameries, because it is certainly not procurable in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know that very little butter came to Wexford last week.  The traders visited the railway station on Friday and Saturday, but no butter arrived. The same thing applied to other towns in the Wexford constituency&mdash;the Minister's constituency.  It applied to Enniscorthy and Gorey&mdash;I did not hear anything about New Ross.  At any rate, the position is extremely bad, and I want the Minister to make a statement on the butter situation.  If the butter is there, and if it is being consumed by people in a position to pay a high price, to the detriment of the <Col N="446" /> poor, then I think it is time that butter should be rationed in other parts of the country as well as Dublin, so that the poor will be able to get their quota.  I am speaking about the Minister's constituency, and he can easily ascertain if what I am saying is correct.  The people who had vouchers were unable to procure butter on Friday and Saturday last in Wexford.</P>
    <P>As regards the reference to fees in respect of butter exported, I am wondering what butter is included under that.  We have been assured by the Minister that no butter has been exported, and I would like him to make that definite, because the position seems to be rather confused.  The Minister should let us know definitely what the butter position in the country is, and he should endeavour to secure that the butter is properly rationed so that the poorer people will be able to get their share.</P>

      <P>I should like to draw attention to the arbitrary power given to inspectors in regard to tillage farms &mdash;the right to point out the particular field a farmer ought to till.  I think such powers are altogether unnecessary and, indeed, they may be very dangerous. I cannot conceive any farmer tilling certain land.  It has been said that a farmer might till a wet portion of his land in order to save the good land for other purposes.  I cannot conceive of any farmer doing such a thing. It may have happened, but I cannot see anybody but a fool doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I rather think that any effect the Minister will get from the application of these compulsory powers will not be in the direction he intends.  I cannot see them increasing the tillage acreage. If I seek to evade the Minister's regulations in respect of tilling my percentage of land, I certainly will not go out of my way to till untillable land and thereby add to my proportion of tillable land.  Any farmer who deliberately tills a portion of his land which is not really arable is adding directly to his amount of arable land and thereby increasing the percentage which he must till.  I cannot see any other reason for it.  The Minister's object possibly is to interfere with the <Col N="447" /> farmer's husbandry and to tell him that he must grow one crop in one field and another crop in another field. I cannot see the Minister acting in that way, and, from what I know of him, I do not think he intends to put inspectors all over the country to tell individual farmers what they are to put in particular fields.</P>
    <P>The only reason that I can see for giving these powers to the inspectors is to prevent people putting crops in land in which crops will not grow. Nobody but a person out of a lunatic asylum would engage in such an operation. It would be lunacy because, in the first place, a farmer would not get a decent crop and, in the second place, he would be tilling a portion of his land which nobody could consider arable and would be merely making the case against himself worse, if he did not intend to till his prescribed quota, by increasing his acreage as a result of tilling unarable land.  If any of us wanted to get out of our liabilities in regard to tilling, that would not be the course we would pursue.  We would try to explain to the inspector that such and such a portion of our land was not arable and should not be tilled.  The man who wants to avoid tilling his percentage will say to the inspector that a particular field cannot be tilled, that it is wet, rocky or, for some other reason, untillable, and he will try to get the smallest possible proportion of his land accepted as arable land.  He would not in any conceivable circumstances try to make arable the unarable portions of his land.</P>
    <P>That is what the Minister in effect is trying to compel farmers to do&mdash;to lessen the acreage of arable land, unless his deliberate policy is the policy I have suggested, which I cannot conceive, of saying to the farmer: &ldquo;We shall not alone have compulsion as to the amount you will till, but we will give powers to inspectors to tell you how to till your land, what crop you are to put in a particular portion of your land, how you are to sow it and where you are to sow it.&rdquo;  It is inconceivable to me that any Minister <Col N="448" /> would operate in that way.  If the Minister does that, he will not get good results.  I do not believe that any of the inspectors the Minister appoints knows the farmers' business better than the farmers themselves know it, and I believe that 99¾ per cent.&mdash;I may say 100 per cent.&mdash;of the farmers will not waste their time, energy and money in putting crops into land from which they do not expect to get some return.</P>
    <P>I protest as strongly as I can against these powers being put in the hands of any inspector, no matter how good or how bad.  They are unnecessary, because I cannot believe they will produce any effect, and they are dangerous because, in the hands of an unscrupulous man, they might have results of which the Minister does not at the moment think.  It might happen that an inspector had antipathy against a particular farmer.  Imagine the penalty which such an inspector could put on that farmer.  If, despite all that has been said against the giving of these powers, the Minister still thinks they are necessary and proposes to keep them, the least we can ask for is some appeal from the decision of an inspector who might act in a manner directly opposed to the interests of the country.  No conceivable good can result from giving these arbitrary powers, and I hope the Minister will give consideration to what has been said against their being given.</P>
    <P>There are several matters on which I should have liked to speak, but I realise that this is a Supplementary Estimate and that many of the matters spoken of by other Deputies can be dealt with on another occasion.  If I might be excused for being out of order for a few moments, I should like to refer to one matter, solely for the reason that it would have no effect if I raised it on a later occasion.  It is a matter on which the Minister and I reached agreement on a previous occasion&mdash;the bushelling of wheat. Last year, there were several farmers against whom the provision of 60 lbs. to the bushel operated, and the Minister very kindly met us by reducing it to 57 lbs.  I asked the Minister on that occasion to make that general.  I asked him, in other words, to drop the <Col N="449" /> bushelling system altogether and to set out that any wheat accepted by the millers for milling into flour should be paid for at whatever rate was fixed, which was 50/- last year.  Nobody expects the Minister or anybody else to pay 50/- for wheat which cannot be milled, but for any wheat which the millers accept as millable, they should be compelled to pay 50/-.  The bushelling provision may have arisen when offals were lower in price than flour, but no such condition obtains now. Farmers have been victimised.</P>
    <P>I warned the Minister of that before and when he reduced it to 57 lbs., he made the margin of victimisation smaller, but it is still there and I quite realise that if to-morrow the Minister reduced it to 52 lbs., the millers would find some way of knocking another bit off it.  It is done in my county, and, as I said to the Taoiseach when he addressed a meeting in Limerick recently, the millers found a way out, because last year, when it was 60 lbs. to the bushel, they said the wheat bushelled 56 lbs.  This year, when it is 57 lbs., they have gone down the scale and if the Minister makes it 54 lbs., they will go down to 53, and will pay on that basis, and the farmers will always be &ldquo;diddled&rdquo; by this combination of millers.  The Minister having gone so far, I appeal to him to abandon this bushelling system altogether, and provide that the fixed price per barrel promised to the farmers for growing wheat will be given to them if the wheat is acceptable for milling, or in other words, that the millers will be compelled to pay that fixed price for any wheat they accept for milling into flour.</P>

      <P>I disagree entirely with the remarks of the previous speaker in reference to the powers given to inspectors in connection with the tilling of certain fields.  I think that such powers should have been taken long ago, and that, in view of the crisis we are facing in the matter of food, it was time such steps were taken.  It was certainly no encouragement to farmers to see the fields that were tilled on their way up to or down from the city, to see a farm of a couple of <Col N="450" /> hundred acres with two or three portions tilled in wayside places which were not capable of producing food. At this particular time when we have to face a scarcity of artificial manures, etc., I think if the good lands of the country are not tilled and if the people who have the good lands are not compelled to till them and try to shirk the tillage Order in any way, it is only right and just to see that the lands that are capable of growing and producing food are the lands that must be tilled.</P>
      <P>I agree with Deputy Corry's view. He said that he sincerely hoped that the Minister would take the necessary steps to see that the Compulsory Tillage Order was complied with. There are, unfortunately, a number of people who are still trying to evade the Compulsory Tillage Order and who are putting up the claim that their land is not the type of land that is fit to be tilled, that it is not arable land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Sometime last year, I think on a previous Estimate, I expressed the view that the best Compulsory Tillage Order we could have would be if the Minister would arrange between his Department and the Land Commission to have all these lands that were not being worked for the benefit of the people by way of food production earmarked and taken over and distributed amongst people who are prepared to till them.  I urge again that that is the only way in which we will have the tillage done.  I also had other views in my mind.  I thought that the time had now arrived when perhaps those people should be compelled to employ one man per 30 acres, which would not be too much.  A number of them have not done the required tillage, and the reason they have given is that they cannot find labour.  They never made an attempt to find labour or they could get it, or else they are not prepared to pay the wages paid down for the workers.  I know poor farmers who are finding it very hard to eke out an existence and who are tilling about 50 per cent. of their land. They keep men all the year round and they have no &ldquo;grouse&rdquo; about finding labour.  If you treat men properly, you will get a man any time you want <Col N="451" /> him.  If you do not treat men properly, everybody knows what the result will be&mdash;no man will work for you then.  I was glad to see recently that other steps had been taken in connection with these good lands that had not been tilled; that steps had been taken to bring people into court because of bad husbandry.  That was a step in the right direction and I hope the Minister will go much further with it.</P>
    <P>I also want to express my opinion with regard to the farm improvements scheme.  I think it is an admirable scheme and that the Minister should continue on these lines.  He has increased the grant this year slightly, and I sincerely hope that it will be increased even further in the coming year.  There is another matter in connection with this tillage that I want to refer to, so far as the West of Ireland is concerned.  Small farmers in the West of Ireland have been tilling over 50 per cent. of their lands year in and year out.  Those lands are not now very well able to produce crops because of the lack of artificial manures.  The Galway County Committee of Agriculture have put up a proposal to the Minister that these farmers should get special consideration in the distribution of manures; that we should get some extra manures in the West of Ireland over the areas where there is better land than in the West and where the land is not so worn out as our land is from being tilled year in and year out.  People in the West have not sufficient land to be able to break up a few acres of lea land this year and another few acres next year.  If they are able to break up a few acres every six or seven years, it is as much as they can do.  If any additional quantity of manures can be spared.  I hope the Minister will see that the West will get special consideration in that respect.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I intend to oppose this Supplementary Estimate.  We spent a very considerable time last year passing a number of Estimates, all of which, as is the habit of Estimates, have been increasing year by year.  Since the original Estimates were passed, we have already passed six Supplementary <Col N="452" /> Estimates, and to-day we are presented with a list of 14 Supplementary Estimates. I am not concerned with what the Supplementary Estimates are for, because in every one of the fresh Estimates presented 90 per cent. of the money required is for salaries, wages and expenses.  Under-estimation at the start of the year was bad business.  I could understand a Minister looking for extra money in a case where an increase in the cost-of-living bonus, or a readjustment of wages to meet present-day conditions, would mean that extra money was required.  Even though this particular Vote is only a token Vote for £10, owing to the savings, every item of increase is for salaries, wages, expenses and allowances. If Deputies look through the other Estimates circulated, they will find exactly the same thing.  I think that only in very exceptional circumstances should a Minister be entitled to bring in a Supplementary Estimate. There is nothing exceptional about this Estimate that would justify its being passed by the House.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry, in his usual manner, made a speech in which he kept a leg on each side of the fence.  He praised the Minister for his farm improvements scheme and said it was the best scheme ever introduced.  In the next sentence, however, he objected to spending any more money on red tape and on inspectors and civil servants.  He cannot have it both ways.  If he votes for the extra money for the improvements scheme, none of it will go to the farmers or the people working for them.  Every item of the £8,300 is for extra inspectors, salaries, wages, allowances and travelling expenses. The actual cash required under this Estimate would be very much higher were it not for the large Appropriations-in-Aid, and the Appropriations-in-Aid would be very much higher, and this Estimate would not be required at all, were it not for the fact that there is a glaring example of how the Minister's policy has reacted on this country when you view the deficiencies in the Appropriations-in-Aid.  The first deficiency is due to a reduction in the receipts from licences for the export of pigs and bacon.  That is trade No. 1 gone.  The second one is a reduction <Col N="453" /> in respect of eggs.  That is trade No. 2 gone.  The next one deals with the export of butter.  That is trade No. 3 gone.  You have five items in which the Minister expects to get less fees from licences for exporting because the produce is not there, and what cannot be exported has not to be paid for.</P>
    <P>As I say, in my opinion it is only in very exceptional circumstances that a Minister should be entitled to introduce a Supplementary Estimate; it is only when some occasion arises where it is absolutely necessary to provide extra money.  Neither this Estimate nor the other Estimates with which we have been presented to-day meet that set of circumstances.  So far as I am concerned, in view of the Estimates we passed last year, the taxation which is being raised, and the fact that I agree with Deputy Corry that some time or other we will have to stop voting money for extra salaries, wages and allowances and cut them down instead of increasing them, I will not vote for any Supplementary Estimate.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>So far as I am concerned, I am prepared to give every possible assistance to the Minister for Agriculture, just as every member of this Party at all times has been willing to do so, for the purpose of ensuring that the maximum acreage of arable land will be tilled in my constituency and everywhere else where it is necessary to enforce the Compulsory Tillage Order.  I have come across a number of peculiar cases in my own constituency on which I should like to have the opinion of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some of these cases have been submitted for the Minister's consideration&mdash;cases where large landowners, in addition to owning a large acreage of land, have taken land on the eleven-months' system.  All I want to know is, what is the legal position with regard to such people.  In cases where large land-owners&mdash;graziers, in other words&mdash;take over additional land under the eleven-months' system, I think it is wrong for the Minister to allow the total acreage to be merged in both cases.  I think that such a person should be compelled to till, not alone 25 per cent. of the land he <Col N="454" /> owns himself, but 25 per cent. of the land he has taken under the eleven-months' system.  I should like to know whether it is possible, under the terms of the Order, to compel such a person to till 25 per cent. of the land he has taken under the eleven-months' system as well as the 25 per cent. of the land that he has in his complete ownership.  There are some cases where the land that is taken over under the eleven-months' system is good arable land and convenient to towns and villages, and I think it would be better for the Minister to take possession of such land and give it to the landless men in the vicinity, who would till it and use the produce of the land for the needs of their families.  I only want to know what is the legal position with regard to this matter, because I think that some of these people have been getting away with it under false pretences.</P>
    <P>I was very interested in the remarks of Deputy Killilea, but I was wondering if he reads the figures that are given in the <i>Trade Journal</i>, which is given to Deputies every three months, with regard to the acreage of land under tillage in every county throughout the country.  According to the figures in the <i>Trade Journal</i>, the two counties in my constituency&mdash;Leix and Offaly&mdash;are very high up on the list, in the Leinster Counties at least, with regard to the acreage under beet and wheat.  That has been the case, at any rate, since the first beet factory, in Carlow, was established in this State. I have done some travelling, however, in the West of Ireland, through Galway and Clare, and so on, and although I do not pretend to be a good judge of land, I have often wondered, looking at the lands in Galway and Clare, whether they were being tilled as they should be.  I have often wondered whether an honest effort was being made to till these lands.  In this connection, the Taoiseach, at a recent meeting, confessed that it might be necessary to close down the Tuam beet factory if the people concerned&mdash; that is, the farmers in the immediate vicinity&mdash;did not &ldquo;come up to scratch&rdquo; and provide the necessary acreage. Now, if there was any justification for the establishment of the beet factory <Col N="455" /> in Tuam, it was because there was a large acreage of arable land within a reasonable distance of Tuam.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, whether large or small farmers, I think they should be all compelled to put the necessary amount of land under tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MarkKillileaSnr" hpid="Mr. Killilea Mr. Killilea">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Killilea</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that the small farmers are doing 50 per cent. of the work, while the large farmers are not doing their share.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, as I have said, I am no judge of land, but travelling in a motor car along the roadside through counties like Clare and Galway, it seemed to me that the land there, whether owned by large farmers or small farmers, was good land, and I should think that if there was any justification for the establishment of that factory, it was on the ground that there was a sufficient amount of arable land available in the vicinity to grow the necessary amount of beet with which to supply the factory.  I do not know whether or not I am right in that, but, as, I think, the Taoiseach said, there must be something radically wrong in the position with regard to the Tuam factory.  The Tuam beet factory is the property of the nation, and I do not see why it should have to be closed down because farmers, whether large or small, in the adjoining district, will not do their job.  I would advise Deputy Killilea to study closely the figures that are given in the <i>Trade Journal</i> and relate them, in view of his own practical knowledge, to his own district, and tell the people there that they are not doing their duty.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one other thing to which I would like to refer.  Is the Minister satisfied that the necessary acreage of arable land, which is owned by various Departments of State, is being tilled? There is a large amount of land in the possession of the Land Commission, the Board of Works, and the Department of Defence, and I have some doubt as to whether a sufficient amount of that land is being tilled.  If <Col N="456" /> the Minister feels that it is necessary to compel everybody to till 25 per cent. of the arable land in their possession, then I think that a good example should be given, in the first instance, by the State, and that lands held by State Departments, such as the Department of Defence, the Office of Public Works, and the Land Commission should be tilled also.</P>
    <P>There is another aspect of this tillage question, which I think I mentioned before&mdash;I certainly brought it to the attention of the Minister for Local Government and Public Health&mdash;and that is in connection with cottages that are to be provided by local authorities, or the Local Government Department, under various housing schemes, throughout the country.  A number of these housing schemes has been sanctioned in various counties, but the work has been suspended as a result of the emergency&mdash;either because the cost of building materials is too high or because the necessary material is not available.  My suggestion would be that if the building of these cottages cannot be proceeded with during the emergency, at least the cottage plots should be taken over from the original owners and given to the prospective cottage tenants or applicants for these cottages, even if it were only on a temporary basis; because if that were done, I can assure the Minister that all those plots would be tilled for the purpose of providing food for the prospective tenants.  I think that the local authorities concerned should be compelled to take over these cottage plots from the present owners and allow the prospective tenants to use them, and if that were done, it would add very considerably to the acreage of land under cultivation during the coming period.</P>
    <P>I would like to have an assurance from the Minister on another matter. The Minister has, I dare say, appointed as tillage inspectors the best men he could get out of the large number of candidates.  Could I have an assurance from the Minister that these tillage inspectors will not be allowed to operate in the counties where they were born and reared?  I think it is in the interests of the impartial administration <Col N="457" /> of this Compulsory Tillage Order that inspectors should operate in an area other than the area that they, perhaps, know too well because of the fact that they were born and reared there.  I would like the Minister to deal with these points in his reply, particularly the question as to whether or not he has the legal power to compel large landowners who have land taken on the 11 months' system to till 25 per cent. of that land as well as 25 per cent. of the land in their own possession. I am very keen on that.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to know from the Minister whether the repair of laneways and roads leading into farms could be included in the scheme for the improvement of lands.  Many farmers are unable to get into their farms owing to the bad condition of the roads and laneways and children are hampered going to school.  I think this scheme might very well be extended to meet that case.  As regards inspectors, I think Deputy Hughes raised the question about an inspector disagreeing with a farmer.  I think there should be an appeal against an inspector in such a case.  I have never heard of such a case, but where it does occur there should be an appeal to the Minister, who might send out another person.</P>
      <P>I think it would be a good thing if the people in the country knew the inspector's address.  A farmer is very often in doubt as to whether a certain field or piece of land would be considered arable or not.  If he knew the inspector's address it would be quite easy to make application to the inspector to come and see the land and decide whether it was arable or not. I do not know whether I would be in order in raising a matter about which I have put down a question for to-morrow, that is, whether the Minister has made any arrangements for artificial manures.  If he has not, there is not much danger of farmers continuing to labour in the one field because, as we all know, it would not give a crop.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I quite agree with what Deputy Dillon said, that it is unreasonable for an inspector to say that a farmer must till a certain field.  I think it <Col N="458" /> creates antagonism and ill-feeling between the Department and the farmer.  The farmer knows better than any inspector who may come along whether a certain field will yield a crop, or not.  I have a field in mind at the present time which, if ploughed up, would be useless although it appears to be a good field.  A stranger seeing it would probably believe that it would yield an excellent crop.  If that field were ploughed, horses could not walk in it; they would sink.  An inspector might very well say that that field was very suitable for tillage and might insist on its being done.  I do not think inspectors should have that power.  I am sure we would all be very glad to see inspectors coming along and telling us what they consider the proper thing to do, giving us their advice, but I think it should end there.  We should not by any means be compelled to do just as they would say. We are all anxious to carry out the tillage Order as far as possible but there are certain impediments.  One impediment is that we cannot get shoeing iron at the present time.  I do not know whether the Minister would be able to do anything about that or not.  I think he should.  It is also impossible to get ordinary plough fittings.  I know one forge around which perches of land are covered with ploughs.  The forge cannot get on with the work, because they cannot get suitable iron.  In some places where they have iron, they cannot get coal.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>I submit to your ruling, Sir.  At the same time, we cannot get on with the work unless we have the machinery to do it.  We may be told to do it but it is impossible to do it if the blacksmith has not the iron and coal.  I think that is a matter that the Minister might view sympathetically.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another matter that is bothering farmers at the present time &mdash;again I may be ruled out of order, <Col N="459" /> but I take the risk&mdash;it is the question of horses going out of the country.  It is probable that kerosene may be difficult to obtain in the near future and, consequently, the Department have decided that horses are not to leave the country.  Just as in the economic war, the man who is deriving the benefit from horses being sent out of the country is not the farmer who has reared and fed the horses, but the man who is taking the risk of sending them out.  There is no doubt that horses are being taken out of the country, notwithstanding all the care that is being taken and I do not think there is any doubt about the care that customs officers and Guards are taking.  Nevertheless, horses are going out and it is the man who is willing to take the risk of spending a month in jail who is getting all the profit.  If there were some arrangement about letting some of the aged horses out and keeping the younger ones, we might feel content, but at the present time the farmer is getting less for his horse than is being obtained on the other side.  I think the Minister should look into that question and see if something could be done.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>A number of points was raised but I think some of the bigger ones that I would like to deal with would come under the following headings. A number of Deputies found fault with certain powers I have taken, or that the Government have given me, under the tillage Order, first of all, to compel an individual farmer to grow wheat where he did not wish to do so and, secondly, to compel an individual farmer to till a specified portion of his land.  I do not think Deputies need be very apprehensive about how these Orders are going to be used.  Deputies, I think, generally will agree that there are farmers in the country who had a decided objection to the growing of wheat, men who had very good land, big farmers very often, <Col N="460" /> but who would not grow wheat, though they did carry out their tillage obligations. If every farmer had behaved like that, we would be in a very bad way here&mdash;we would have no bread&mdash; and I think it is altogether wrong that these particular individuals should be allowed to escape and should be allowed to go on in that selfish and prejudiced way.  Hence the power was taken that an inspector could compel a farmer of that kind to grow an acreage of wheat.  The second case is where we have taken power to compel a farmer to till a specified portion of his holding.</P>
      <P>It will not be necessary, I believe, to apply that in very many cases, but it will be necessary to apply it in some cases.  There are farmers who dislike carrying out tillage obligations and who have tilled a certain portion of the land, but not by any means the best part of it.  What is worse than that, they have gone on growing a cereal crop every year since the war commenced on the same piece of land, and I think they had intended doing that until the war was over.  I think that somebody should have the power to go to such a farmer and tell him that he could not continue to do that.  He may be carrying out the tillage Order in the letter, but he is certainly not carrying it out in the spirit in which it should be carried out.  Therefore, we should have the power to compel him to till another portion of his land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is held by some Deputies that that is a dangerous power to give to an individual like an inspector.  I must say that I thought over that myself before the Order was made.  I do not think it would be practicable, in fact I am afraid it would vitiate the whole thing, if there was to be any sort of an appeal.  These appeals cause delay, and by the time one was disposed of, even if it were decided in favour of the Minister, it would be too late to do anything since it is obvious that these Orders will be served on a farmer when it becomes clear to an inspector that he is not inclined to carry out his tillage properly.  There would not be very much time for an appeal in such a case.  I can assure the Dáil that in practice the matter will not be left <Col N="461" /> entirely to the discretion of an individual inspector.  Deputies are probably aware that when big decisions of any kind have to be taken an individual, whether he is an inspector or an administrative officer, is seldom permitted to take them.  The matter has to go before someone in the Department three or four steps higher up before final approval is given.  That is what will happen here, so that the final decision will not depend, as some Deputy said, on the whim or prejudice of any individual inspector.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hughes said that we were a bit harsh on people dealing in grain and had deprived a number of them from dealing in it any longer.  The Deputy drew a rather distressing picture of those who are employed by such people.  Really, there is not very much in the point.  Last year, when we applied this rule for the grain that was grown in 1941, we ruled out everybody who had not in the previous two or three years purchased more than 200 tons of grain in any of those years. That was a very lenient test to apply. On appeal we allowed in a lot whom we had ruled out in that way.  This year, having given them as it were a second chance, we applied the rule very stringently and did not allow anybody in who had not purchased at least 200 tons of grain over last year or during the last three or four years. There is not much point really in talking about the employment given by those people, because the gross profit that a man could have on 200 tons of grain, under the fixed price, would be about £250.  If a merchant gets that gross profit of £250 the amount of employment he can give or will be inclined to give out of it is not very much.  Therefore, I do not think we have deprived anybody of a livelihood by enforcing that rule.</P>
    <P>I do not want it to be inferred, from any of the regulations that we have made under the tillage Order or otherwise, that there is any opinion held by any Minister that the farmers have not done very well in this tillage campaign.  We all know that the great majority of the farmers have done their job very well, indeed.  After all, the fact that we make an Order and <Col N="462" /> provide penalties for those who do not obey it, is not to be taken as saying that we are condemning the whole farming population.  It might as well be said, when we make a law that a man must go to jail if he steals money, that that is proof that everybody in the country is a rogue.  It is by no means a proof.  In my journeys around the country, in my talks principally to groups of farmers, when I explained the regulations to them with regard to severe penalties and so on, I think I can truthfully say that I have never been asked by them to make these penalties lighter, or to make it easier for the delinquents to escape.  Instead I have been asked by farmers at those meetings to make the penalties more severe.  The complaints that I met with at those meetings, at which there was no one present but farmers, were to the effect that we are not nearly severe enough on those who were not doing their duty.</P>
    <P>While we are on this tillage point, perhaps I had better deal with a question which was asked by Deputy Davin regarding the farmer who has land of his own and who takes land on the 11 months' system.  The Deputy wanted to know if, in computing that farmer's tillage requirements we deal with the two lots of land together, or take them separately.  I have always assumed that I have a discretion so far as that is concerned.  The way in which that discretion has been exercised is this: that where we find a farmer who for years past had taken a certain piece of land from year to year, we have allowed him to bulk his own holding and that particular &ldquo;take&rdquo; together for the purpose of the tillage regulations.  On the other hand, where a farmer went out last year or the year before or this year and took conacre or land for grazing for the first time, we say to him that we are dealing with his own holding only.  We say to him that he must till the required percentage of his own holding, and that as regards the land taken on the 11 months' system, land that belongs to the holding on which it stands, the tillage regulations will be applied to it apart from what belongs to him.  That is the way it is being done in practice.</P>

      <P>This is a very important matter and I would like to have the position made clear.  We have had the Minister's statement, but so far as I know the majority of farmers understand that the obligation to carry out the tillage regulations is on the rated occupier of the land.  In other words, if I have a farm I am responsible for tilling 25 per cent. of the arable land on it, and if I have been taking land on the 11 months' system from another farmer over a number of years, that that does not relieve him from his obligation in regard to tillage.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is true.  Let us take a simple example.  Suppose a man has a 50 acre farm of his own and has been taking over the last ten years another farm of 50 acres on the 11 months' system.  We say to him that, in practice, he has 100 acres, and that his obligations extend over the 100 acres. We do not mind very much if he says that in tilling his 25 per cent. of arable land he will do 10 per cent. of it on his own holding and 15 per cent. on the other farm so long as he does enough to meet his total requirements under the Order.  The case becomes more complicated if a man has a 50 acre farm of his own and takes five acres from another farmer who has a 50 acre farm.  He may say: &ldquo;I would like to do all my tillage on my own land, but for years and years I have taken this land and by right I should do my share of these five acres. Instead, however, of doing it on that five acres, I will make up for it on my own land,&rdquo; and we say: &ldquo;That is all right; we will permit that.&rdquo;  The second man, who lets the land on the 11 months' system, still has the 45 acres left, and he must make up for the tillage on that remaining part.</P>

In these cases we do make sure that the requisite amount is tilled, whether it is on one holding or another.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan raised a point with regard to farm improvements schemes.  The Deputy was told that there was a proposal to extend these schemes so as to cover what might be called accommodation roads.  That is true.  There have been some discussions between various Departments with regard to these roads which seemed not to come under any scheme and it is a matter for consideration whether they can be appropriately dealt with under the farm improvements schemes.  We do at the moment go to a certain distance.  Where two or three farmers have a common entrance, and they agree between themselves to do the work under the farm improvements scheme, a grant can be given.  The proposal put up now is to go even further and extend the scheme to deal with what might be regarded as roads rather than avenues or laneways.  It is a matter that has complications, and I cannot say that there is any decision on it.</P>

      <P>I quite admit that, generally speaking, 95 per cent. of the farmers will not believe that, but it is possible the farmers are a little bit mistaken about wheat being a very exhausting crop.  If these experiments that have been carried out scientifically go to prove that there is not so much in that contention, it is well the farmers should know it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Corish asked about butter. The situation in that respect is that there is a certain amount of butter which will last until the new season's butter comes in&mdash;that is, it will last under the present system of distribution. I think the system of distribution is the best that can be devised under all the circumstances.  I can say that it is a fair system.  I do not think that a complete system of rationing would be fair, because the agricultural community who are producing a certain amount of butter would get, in addition to that, their ration of creamery butter, and they would have much more than other members of the community.  In these circumstances the present system is the best.</P>

      <P>I agree that where you have a creamery it might not be so hard to do the job, but you must remember that half the country <Col N="466" /> possesses no creameries.  In the south-eastern and western counties there are no creameries, but the farmers there produce a little bit of butter and perhaps they might like to purchase a little more.  But at least they have a little, and if, in addition, they were getting the same ration as a person working in the town, the ordinary working man, they would be getting a certain advantage. The position being as it is, I think the present system is the fairest system we could devise, and that is to ask the retailers to be as fair as possible with their customers.</P>

There was only one case reported in the paper, and apparently the gentleman concerned agrees with Deputy Cosgrave that it is a bad thing to go to prison, because he has appealed.  I do not think that deferring the prison sentence until after the emergency would have an effect on anybody.  Deputy Cosgrave and others of us know too much about these threats of imprisonment to take them very seriously.

    <P>That a supplementary sum, not exceeding £10, be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st March, 1943, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of Public Works (1 and 2 Will. 4, c. 33, secs. 5 and 6; 5 and 6 Vict., c. 89, secs. <Col N="468" /> 1 and 2; 9 and 10 Vict., c. 86, secs. 2, 7 and 9, etc.).</P>
    <P>The purpose of this Supplementary Estimate is to meet extra expenditure under sub-head A in respect of salaries, wages and allowances, and, under sub-head D in respect of the cost of the telephone service.  The Government decided to grant, as from 1st June, 1942, certain emergency bonus increases to civil servants and other persons employed in the public service.  These increases involved, for the period from 1st June, 1942, to 31st December, 1942, an extra expenditure of £700 beyond the amount originally estimated for sub-head A, for 1942-43. The Government later decided to grant, as from 1st January, 1943, additional emergency bonus increases.  The additional increases will entail a further expenditure of £1,050 beyond the original Estimate.  The total extra expenditure on sub-head A, 1942-43, will, therefore, be £1,750.</P>
    <P>Owing to difficulties arising from the curtailment of transport services and the shortage of supplies, it is being found necessary to have recourse to the use of the telephone more often than would be the case under normal conditions.  It has been considered desirable, also, to have some additional lines and extensions installed. The result is that an excess expenditure of approximately £800 is anticipated on the original Estimate for sub-head D.</P>

    <P>The original provision for sub-head I&mdash; Paper&mdash;was £58,000.

Additional necessary purchases from home sources and increases in the purchase price of paper, amounting to about £12,000, bring the excess on the sub-head up to £47,000.</P>
    <P>This expenditure is offset by savings on other sub-heads amounting to £8,300, due mainly to considerable economies effected in general departmental requirements.  Increased receipts from Appropriations-in-Aid will, it is anticipated, be available as a further offset to the additional expenditure on paper.

With the cessation of tourist traffic, the demand for small-scale maps fell much <Col N="470" /> below normal, and sales of the larger scales have been adversely affected by falling off in building operations, road construction, etc.  There is also a restriction on the purchase of small-scale maps, which can only be obtained under licence.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>This is a very unusual matter to bring before the Dáil.  In so far as the dispute itself is concerned, I do not propose to enter into its merits, nor do I think the Dáil is the proper place for resolving industrial disputes or questions in respect of which feeling runs high outside.  The Department of Industry and Commerce is charged with the responsibility of dealing with those matters, and they are usually best left to the officers who have that responsibility rather than that they should be ventilated here in the Dáil.  The Minister, in the course of his reply to-day, said he understood that the purpose of the strike now proceeding at the Castlecomer mine is to compel the Government to alter the provisions of Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order by excluding coalmine workers from its scope.  That is not my interpretation of the issue which is at present disturbing industrial conditions down in Castlecomer.</P>
      <P>There were two phases in the course of this dispute, one of which is happily ended.  Outside of the persons immediately concerned, I think that everybody who had the interests of the miners and of the district at heart was well pleased when the stay-in strike came to an end.  In so far as any contribution from the men is concerned, I take it, having regard to the determination which was shown in the step they took on that occasion, that they have made an advance towards a settlement by ceasing that particular phase of the struggle.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his reply to-day, stated that he set up a <Col N="471" /> committee of inquiry to investigate the conditions of the industry, and that the recommendations of the committee were implemented in full by the sixth amendment of the Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order which permitted a further increase in the remuneration paid.  He further went on to say that the tribunal to which the matter was referred had it under consideration on the 22nd January, and, but for the strike, it might be assumed that the application would have resulted in the making of a bonus Order.  The dates in this case is not very material but, so far as my information is concerned, the tribunal sat on the 22nd January and the strike took place on the 25th January.  It might have been reasonably expected that a decision could have been given on the 23rd January, or perhaps even on the evening of the 22nd, because the circumstances were such in this particular case, or in fact in any case where there is a dispute of the kind, that the earlier a decision of that sort was come to the better.</P>
    <P>I take it from what the Minister said that some decision must have been arrived at, or at any rate that the proposals were fairly ripe for an actual decision.  But, in the course of his reply, the Minister went on to say that amongst the grievances which were voiced by the Castlecomer miners was the fact that their tonnage rates are lower than those operating at other collieries.  That, according to my information, is the whole sum and substance of this dispute.  In the next part of that particular paragraph the Minister, who is generally fair throughout the whole of the statement, goes on to say that in the case of those collieries which are not modern or not well-equipped, or which are in the earlier stages of their development, extra prices have to be allowed for the coal that is won from them.  Let us take that statement as it stands.  At the present moment there is no competition as between mine and mine. There is sufficient demand for any coal that is mined in any mine in this country.  In fact, the demand far exceeds the supply.  So that, in so far as the relative merits of one colliery and another are concerned, they are not at issue here.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="472" /> The Minister further states in that paragraph that he sees some difficulties, and I am sure that there are some difficulties in the way in connection with a matter of this sort.  But, let us assume for a moment that the coal from one mine costs £X to produce, that £X plus £Y can be secured for that in the market without any difficulty, and that they are in a position to make a profit on that £X plus £Y. It is obvious that those who are employed in a mine only two, three or four miles away will have an objection when they see a price of only £X being paid for what they are mining.  They are doing the same work, they are employed in the same business, they are working the same hours and they suffer under the same disabilities.  The fact that there is a discrimination against them in a case of this sort is what is at the root of this dispute.</P>
    <P>It is particularly satisfactory to note that the production of coal from the Castlecomer mine went up more than 60 per cent. in 1942 over 1940.  There is evidence there of appreciation of the national need of the moment.  The output is certainly satisfactory to an outsider like myself.  I am sure that the more coal that is mined in that place the more satisfactory it will be for everybody.</P>

      <P>I should like to intervene to correct an error in the statement I made.  Figures are given there as to the production of anthracite coal.  That production was not confined to Castlecomer colliery.  There has been an increase in Castlecomer, but the particular figures given would represent the total production of anthracite.  As the Deputy is aware, the statement was prepared at short notice and that error crept in.</P>

      <P>We cannot claim an increase of 60 per cent., but there was an improvement.  The position shortly is this: There are two phases <Col N="473" /> in this problem, the local and the national.  The local one is concerned with the coal miners and the coal owners in Castlecomer and the surrounding districts.  It is vital for them that an early stop should be put to this dispute.  It is in the interests of everybody that it should be resolved. Then there is the national side of it, that at the moment we need this coal and need it badly and that there is a demand for it.  There is natural resentment on the part of the people down there of a matter of this sort which they conceive to be a very serious deterrent to their prosperity. It looks to them as if there were favourable consideration for one mine and unfair discrimination against another.  The history of this country is against centralisation, and I think that, in the circumstances of this case, the Minister should not persist in the claim that as long as a strike is persisted in the Government will not consider any demand of this kind.</P>

    <P>Already there has been a contribution from the men in connection with this matter.  Surely there ought to be an approach from the Government on the same basis.  For a long time I was a representative of this district. The Deputy who represented Kilkenny in the interests of this Party died in the last few years.  Therefore it was only natural that they should approach me in the matter.  There is no political significance whatever attaching to this dispute.  My information is that supporters of the three different Parties who at the last election were represented in that constituency are anxious to have this matter closed as early as possible. My information, for what it is worth, is that an advertisement showing the price of Castlecomer coal, compared with the price of some other coal, was refused publication in the Press. Whether there is any truth in that or not, I do not know.  However, this is a matter in which there is no dispute between the coal owners and the coal miners.  They are both agreed.  It is quite true that they have had a head-on collision with an ordinance which prescribes that while a strike is going <Col N="474" /> on nothing can be done.  In the interests of the peace of the district, in the best interests of the industry of the country, and in order to bring about those relations which ought to exist in normal times, but even more so in a time of emergency, I think that the condition in respect of a strike existing should be waived and that this matter should be resolved in a manner which will reflect credit upon all the persons concerned.</P>

      <P>I do not think there is anything I can add to the statement made by Deputy Cosgrave; but, as a representative of the constituency, and having spent the greater portion of last week trying to deal with the very difficult situation there, I feel that the Minister ought to reconsider the attitude which he indicated to-day.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no question whatever of any political significance being attached to this matter.  I was in the local hall the other evening, when a meeting was called to discuss the matter.  Many prominent people were there, representing all sections of the community, all shades of public opinion, and different religious denominations, and they were all satisfied that if the miners could be induced to abandon this regrettable stay-in strike, every effort should be made to get the Minister to meet them half-way in the matter.  Everybody is satisfied that the miners have a very big grievance. The local clergy spoke very strongly in that regard, and I am quite sure that if the Minister were to hold an inquiry on the spot, he would find that there is a considerable grievance there, and that it was not actually born as a result of this emergency, but is a very long-standing grievance.  I think it must be admitted, also, that if the strike at Castlecomer should continue it would be very serious for the people of this country.  It is almost impossible to get coal now, as we all know, but it must be remembered that the miners of Castlecomer stuck to their job in former days &mdash; with the support of the people of the counties of Kilkenny, Leix, Offaly and Carlow <Col N="475" />&mdash; but even with the advent of a native Government here, not very much was done for them.</P>
    <P>In this emergency period, everybody is in need of fuel and, as Deputy Cosgrave has pointed out, coal, no matter where it comes from, is urgently required, and if this regrettable dispute is not brought to a close, it will have very serious consequences from the national point of view.  Most of our people are depending at the present moment on fuel produced from our own resources, and it would be very serious if this dispute should continue.  Of course, in speaking of Castlecomer, I also include other mines, such as Arigna, Wolfhill, Slieveardagh, and so on.  I appeal to the Minister, therefore, to try to meet the situation to the extent that we are advocating this evening, because the sooner this dispute is brought to a conclusion the better it will be, not alone for the miners of Castlecomer and the people of Kilkenny, but for the welfare of the industry and the nation as a whole.</P>

      <P>I am very anxious to see this strike brought to a conclusion. Some of the miners there are from my own constituency and, as the Minister knows, some of them are involved in this dispute.  I have had some previous experience of dealing with the miners at Castlecomer.  For instance, it is just about eight years ago that, after a consultation with the Minister's colleague &mdash; the Minister for Education &mdash;I accompanied the Chairman of the Seanad on a deputation to deal with a dispute at that time, and I am glad to say that we were able to settle it.  I think I understand the mentality of the miners there, as a result of the meeting we had at that time, and I was also present at the meeting that <Col N="476" /> was held on last Sunday night, where representatives of the miners, the local clergy, and prominent people representing all classes were present. Everybody there was delighted with the action of the miners in coming to the surface, and it was thought that it should be possible to find an easy way out of the difficulty and end the present dispute, have peace restored, and the men go back to their work, which is of such great national importance. Accordingly, I appeal to the Minister now to take the big view of this situation and not rely on red-tape regulations which are enshrined in Ministerial Orders.  I appeal to him to use the powers which he has to bring about a conference with the parties interested in the dispute, under the chairmanship of an official of his Department.  I do not propose to enter into the merits of the dispute in this House, because I think it is too delicate a matter to discuss in this House, and in any case it would not lead to any satisfactory result, but I do appeal to the Minister to take the big view of the situation and use the powers which he has, because I am sure that if he were to do so it would lead to an early and happy termination of this dispute.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputies must grasp the fact that the circumstances of this dispute are of a distinct character from other trade disputes in the past.  It is not like any trade dispute that has arisen in the past, or even like any dispute in connection with Irish coal mines in the past.  Strikes in coal mines in Ireland are not unusual. Anybody who understands the arduous conditions and hardships of those who work in Irish coal mines can easily understand that grievances may occasionally arise which occasion demands being made by the workers on their employers for an improvement of their conditions.  Where, in the past, a dispute of that kind arose, my Department intervened for the purpose of assisting in the negotiation of a settlement of the dispute and, not infrequently, we have been helpful in settling such disputes, but this is not a dispute of that kind.  This is an <Col N="477" /> effort by the miners to force the Government, by a withdrawal of their labour, to change the law.  It is quite clear that there is much more involved in that than the production of coal and that the consequences that would follow from the success of this effort would be very serious for the country. The Government has considered it necessary to impose restrictions upon increases in wages, to limit such increases in accordance with the terms of Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order. Whether Deputies think the Government is acting wisely or not in pursuing that policy does not arise now.</P>
      <P>The Government considers that these restrictions are essential in the national interests.  The Government has made Orders for the purpose of imposing these restrictions.  They apply to all classes of workers.  If this one section of workers, by the withdrawal of its labour and the consequent curtailment of coal production, could force the Government into amending that Order in their interests, inevitably, every other section of workers in similar essential industries would be urged by irresponsible people amongst them to take similar action. The Government cannot possibly concede what these coal miners are demanding. I am sure all reasonable Deputies and all reasonable people throughout the country appreciate that.  This is one thing that cannot be done and I think Deputies are not doing a service to these workers in leaving them under any impression that the Government can be driven to amend the law by reason of a strike of this kind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These workers are subject to the restrictions that have been imposed by Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order. They are entitled to the benefits which that Order makes it possible for workers to secure and they did proceed to formulate an application, under the Order, for a bonus.  That application went forward to a tribunal. Perhaps it was not dealt with as expeditiously as some other applications are dealt with because it was considered desirable that it should be <Col N="478" /> heard in conjunction with similar applications from collieries in the same area so that, if an increase in wages occurred, it would be of general and not of local application.  But the application did go forward and was heard by a tribunal.  My assumption that the application would have resulted in a bonus Order was based on the fact that it was made jointly by the employers and the workers concerned. Then the workers went on strike, or were induced to go on strike, in the belief that they could secure an alteration in the Government Order to the extent of excluding them altogether from its scope.  If they understand that they cannot succeed in that, then the strike must end.  If the strike does end, then the machinery of the Emergency Powers Order can be operated to procure whatever increase in wages is permissible under that Order.</P>
    <P>I know that there is in the minds of many of the workers of Castlecomer a feeling that the Government is in some way discriminating against them. I want to avail of this opportunity to remove any such impression.  I fear that that impression has been created by the company that are employing them.  In the past, that company had an arrangement in which the rates of wages of the workers were related to the price of coal.  That arrangement has been ended by the Emergency Powers Order, but this company, anxious to secure an increase in the price permitted to be charged for its coal, has created in the minds of the workers the impression that if they succeed in increasing the price of their coal the workers will automatically get an increase in their wages.  The price permitted to be charged for Castlecomer coal is yielding a good profit to the Castlecomer Colliery Company. This company has made good profits in the past.  It has been a most paying investment for its owners, and their contention that they should be allowed to charge the same price as other collieries are permitted to charge is completely unjustifiable.  Their costs of production are much lower.  If we are to fix a uniform price for Irish anthracite coal upon the basis of the <Col N="479" /> cost of production in the least efficient or newest mine, then that price will give to the Castlecomer Company grossly excessive profits.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Let me get it clear. The wages of the Castlecomer workers are controlled under Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order and are not related to the price charged for Castlecomer coal.  To some extent, so far as one can judge from references in the paper, this strike at Castlecomer has been represented as a strike for a higher permitted price for Castlecomer coal.  Even if we were to permit an increase in the price of Castlecomer coal, because of the Emergency Powers Order an increase in the wages of the workers would not follow.  Such an increase can be secured only through the operation of Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order.  I know that the leaders of the men's union fully appreciate the situation and understand that in the particular effort upon which the workers are now engaged they cannot succeed.  No amendment of the Emergency Powers Order can or will follow from the strike.  When the strike is over, the particular matters to which special reference has been made will come up again for consideration.  These matters are two-fold.  The workers in Castlecomer have this feeling of discrimination against them because they know that the tonnage rates now paid to colliers in other mines are higher than their tonnage rates.  I think Deputy Cosgrave misunderstood that reference.  A collier is paid on the basis of the quantity of coal he produces. The tonnage rates referred to in that particular paragraph of my reply to the Parliamentary Question are the rates allowed to the colliers for the quantity of coal they produce. These rates are higher at other mines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The particular reference has been made to the mine in the Swan.  The rates at the Swan are higher because the quantity of coal which a collier can produce in that mine in a shift is substantially less than the quantity of coal which a collier at Castlecomer can produce.  A collier at Castlecomer produces on the average about 32½ cwts. of coal per shift.  A collier at the Swan mine produces a substantially lower quantity. Clearly, therefore, if you had uniform tonnage rates for both mines&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister state the quantity in each case?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not state the quantity for the Swan because that has not yet been established.  A figure has been given by the management of that company, the accuracy of which is not yet fully established, but it is quite clear that there can be no question that in that mine, which has only recently been opened up, which is not a well-organised, old-established mine like that at Castlecomer, the output of coal per individual worker per shift is substantially lower.  The point I want to make is this, that if you had uniform tonnage rates, the earnings of a collier at Castlecomer would be substantially higher than the earnings of a collier at the Swan. It is alleged by the Castlecomer colliers, and by the company, that the earnings at the Swan are now higher than at Castlecomer, and that in consequence there has been a tendency for workers to leave Castlecomer to go to the Swan.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesPPattison" hpid="Mr. Pattison Mr. Pattison">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not so sure that is so, but, whether it is so or not, I want to say that before this strike started I had brought into conference the managements of both mines&mdash;I understand that they now cover also the Rossmore Colliery in the County Carlow &mdash; for the purpose of trying to arrive at an agreement as to tonnage rates which would give uniform earnings <Col N="481" /> at each colliery for a worker of equal skill in the same class.  The advantage, from my point of view, of getting established a system of rates which would produce uniform earnings is that it would remove any financial inducement for workers to leave employment at one colliery and seek it at another, since such a movement of skilled workers disorganises production. I am as anxious as the workers and as the colliery managements to ensure that uniform earnings will be established.  Conferences to try to establish a basis for rates which would ensure uniform earnings were, in fact, being held when the strike occurred.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The two points, therefore, upon which the Castlecomer workers have been led to believe that there is discrimination against them resolve themselves, on examination, into a misunderstanding.  Inevitably, the cost of producing coal at the smaller recently opened mines will be higher than at Castlecomer which is an old-established and well-organised mine. Consequently, if there are to be only reasonable profits allowed to the mine proprietors the pit-head price permitted will be different at each mine.  A uniform price, which must cover the cost of production at the most costly mine, will yield excessive profits to the other mine.  There cannot, therefore, be a uniform price, and the absence of a uniform price does not imply any discrimination against Castlecomer.  Similarly, in so far as the output per worker per shift is different in one mine as compared to another, uniform tonnage rates for colliers will not produce uniform earnings.  I am anxious to have some system established which will produce uniform earnings, but if you are to have such a system there will, nevertheless. be varying tonnage rates which must vary according to the circumstances of each mine. While there are at present only three collieries in the Leinster coalfields &mdash; I am not counting Slieveardagh because it is not properly in production yet&mdash; and there may eventually be more&mdash; no matter how many there are, I think we should endeavour to ensure that the bases of earnings are similar <Col N="482" /> so that there will be no inducement for workers to leave employment in one mine to go to another.</P>
    <P>In so far as every trade dispute is primarily a matter of getting more wages, I want the workers at Castlecomer, the workers at Arigna and other collieries to understand that the limitations applied by Emergency Powers (No. 166) Order apply to them and to all workers.  The Government examines from time to time the provisions of that Order in relation to the prevailing circumstances.  It has amended the Order from time to time on changes occurring in the circumstances or upon representations from affected interests.  It may change that Order in the future.  If it does change the Order in the future, the benefit of such changes will be available not only to the workers in the coalmines but to all other workers. It is not possible to grant to one section of workers an exemption from this control while holding others to it. In conclusion, I want to say that I fully appreciate the statements made by Deputies that there is no political basis for the dispute in Castlecomer.</P>

      <P>I am sure that is so in the case of Castlecomer, but I am not sure about Arigna.  In the case of Castlecomer, the discontent which has evidently existed amongst the workers there for some time past is the sole cause of the dispute.  Discontent existed there on other occasions, and it was following the evidence of its existence that I set up the committee of inquiry which reported last year and which led to an amendment of Emergency Powers (No. 83) Order.  I know that discontent exists now.  In so far as there are justifiable causes for that discontent, I am prepared to examine and investigate the possibility of removing it, but I think it must be clearly understood that this strike directed towards forcing the hands of the Government to amend the Order cannot succeed.  Neither can the Government enter into discussions or negotiations with the parties concerned while the strike continues.</P>

I am satisfied that that was not the case in this particular instance. I accepted the application as a <i>bona fide</i> application, not subject to be rejected on that ground, and referred it to the tribunal.
