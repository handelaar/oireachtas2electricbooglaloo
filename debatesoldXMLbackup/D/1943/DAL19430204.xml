      <P>asked the Taoiseach whether he has seen the statement made by the Minister for Supplies to the effect that the public has never been told how often a major catastrophe was avoided by only a hair's breadth during the past three years, and that they could not be told the full story even now because to do so would not be in the national interest; whether he will state the sources of the threatened catastrophe, and indicate why no Party in the Dáil was informed of the dangers, and on what grounds the information as to the threatened catastrophe was withheld from the Dáil and the people.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement, and I will not believe that the Deputy or any Deputy here really expects me, in circumstances like the present, to enter into the details suggested by the Deputy's question.  The fact is, as I have pointed out time and time again for the past three and a half years, that, with the world at war all round us, we in this country have been, and, while the war lasts, will continue to be, in a position of constant danger, which demands that we never cease to be on the alert.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that shortage of tanning materials is resulting in an acute shortage of upper leather for boots and shoes; and whether the Emergency Research Council is doing anything to provide an alternative tanning medium from domestic products.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>The shortage of upper leather for the manufacture of boots and shoes is only partly due to a scarcity of tanning materials.  Imports of finished upper leather, which in pre-war years represented nearly half the total consumption, have been reduced very substantially, and, in addition, supplies of semi-tanned hides from abroad are being obtained with the greatest difficulty and in diminishing quantities.</P>
      <P>The Emergency Scientific Research Bureau has already rendered valuable assistance to the tanners in the matter of supplies of certain materials used in the tanning process.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know if the members of the bureau set up by the Taoiseach to investigate such problems have had this problem referred to them. I asked that question before, and the Taoiseach said he never heard of a shortage of tanning materials.  Has the Minister asked the Taoiseach to get the bureau into action in order to see if something could be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already told the Deputy that the bureau has rendered valuable assistance to the tanners in the matter of supplies of certain materials used in the tanning process.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>And any shortage that now exists is being considered by them?  There is a shortage of certain tanning materials?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The shortage of leather is not due to a shortage of tanning materials.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that it is impossible for retailers to weigh out 448 half pounds out of a 2 cwt. bag of sugar and therefore impossible to give everyone their ration of ½ lb. regularly; and whether he will direct Comhlucht Siúicre Eireann to allow 5 lb. per 2 cwt. bag of sugar to meet the weighing problem.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The margin allowed in September.  In that month each trader was allowed a quantity of sugar in excess of the amount required to give the prescribed ration to customers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On the first of the month a trader gets a bag containing 2 cwt. to supply 448 customers The thing cannot be done.  The trader wants to give every man his quota of sugar, half a pound.  I say there are not 448 half pounds in the bag.  I ask you to put in the 448 half pounds and prosecute the trader if he does not hand them out to his customers.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>I know that traders received, in the month of September, a quantity of sugar expressed as a percentage of their quotas in excess of the quantity required to give the <Col N="491" /> prescribed ration to their customers. I know that that quantity, if reserved by the traders for such a purpose, was sufficient to offset any loss in weighing that occurred in the meantime.  I am also aware that this matter has been discussed with an organisation representative of traders who have agreed that the allowance already given should be sufficient for the purpose up to the present, but who pressed that a further allowance would be required for the future.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Neill</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that the practice in the retail grocery trade always was that sugar was sold as gross weight, that the bag was weighed with the sugar and that, when that was the practice, there was sufficient sugar in a two-cwt. bag to give the 224 lbs: I am told that now a new regulation has been issued whereby retail grocers are compelled to give a half lb. net weight to each customer.  That is the trouble.  The Minister will see that there has been a departure from a very old-established practice in the trade, and if that is the departure which has impelled the Minister to give some extra allowance to make up the short weight, I think the case could be met very easily in that way.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <P>The usual instructional circular was issued to registration officers in November last in connection with the preparation of the Electors Lists for the 1943/44 Register drawing attention to the necessity for having full and exhaustive inquiries made so as to ensure a complete and accurate register of all persons entitled to be on the Register. In addition, instructions were conveyed to registration officers that Electors Lists would consist of three lists, namely, List A &mdash; the existing Register; List B &mdash; persons newly qualified; and List C &mdash; persons no longer qualified.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As perhaps the Deputy is aware, the type of the Register is kept standing.  In previous years the election lists, which are published on the 29th January, were printed from the standing type <Col N="498" /> of the Register, new names being inserted, and the names of persons no longer qualified being deleted from the standing type.</P>
    <P>Because of the paper shortage, only a minimum supply of copies of the Register was ordered in June, 1942, and if any number of copies were required to be printed before June, 1943, when the new Register is published, a reprint of the old Register would be necessary.  If the standing type were altered a reprint would not be possible except at a prohibitive cost.</P>
    <P>The form of the Electors List was, therefore, altered from one long list to three lists, as I have stated.</P>
    <P>Attention was also directed to the recent division of the several counties into electoral areas pursuant to the Local Government Act, 1941, and it was pointed out that the title page of the Electors Lists for a registration unit should show the appropriate electoral area in which such unit is situate.  The Electoral Act sets out the qualification for the Dáil franchise and provides that a duly qualified person may be registered in the constituency in which he is ordinarily resident on the qualifying date, namely, 15th November, or in which he occupies business premises on that date.  Any question arising as to the inclusion or exclusion of a particular person or class of persons must be decided by the registration officer on the facts.</P>

      <P>Arising out of the Minister's reply, what is the use of pretending that we are to have a free election in this country if nobody, except a member of the present Government, is to be allowed to speak his mind?  No matter what Party is in power in this country, the rights of the most isolated individual in this Dáil are just as important as those of a member of the largest Party in the Dáil.

That has been decided a thousand and one times.  You cannot throw up the policy of neutrality, decided upon by the Oireachtas, like a balloon into the air, and allow it to take care of itself. That policy has been sustained and defended here in this country.  Since the beginning of the war, thousands of young men were asked to spend their young lives in defence of our neutrality, and the people of our country have made sacrifices to maintain it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankAiken" hpid="Mr. Aiken Mr. Aiken">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>As it was feared that soldiers' grievances, or alleged grievances, might be used for the purpose of carrying on a campaign to discourage recruiting, it was decided to stop all correspondence on such subjects.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>My question was not concerned with the grievances, or alleged grievances of soldiers, but with the grievances of the wives and children of these soldiers, and the fact that in view of the increased cost of living these people are not able to meet their expenses, and all I want to know is why references are not allowed in the newspapers to applications <Col N="507" /> for increases in the allowances to soldiers' wives.  Why is it that such references are not allowed to be published in the newspapers?  If they are not allowed to be published in the newspapers, what other means of expressing their grievances is there except through putting a question in this House?  I say that it is an abuse of censorship to prevent the publication of such complaints.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken (for the Minister for Education)</NameTxt>
      <P>The introduction of the scheme of partial payment of the salaries of teachers in industrial schools gave rise to certain difficulties of administration in dealing with pupils of these schools who have been attending adjacent national schools and in respect of whom no Government grant was paid by the Industrial Schools Branch of the Department.</P>
      <P>In order to overcome these difficulties it was proposed that all children resident in industrial schools should be dealt with under the new system of partial payment of teachers' salaries.  The adoption of this arrangement would involve the removal from the rolls of the national schools of the names of a small number of children of the classes mentioned in the question.  The arrangement has been objected to by some of the schools concerned, and I am having the matter further considered to see if a more satisfactory arrangement can be made with regard to the classes of children in question.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>As was stated in reply to a similar question last October, the conditions under which the Borstal inmates are living in Cork Prison at Cork have been very much improved.  The authorities of University College, Cork, have allowed the institution the use of a playing field.  Bicycles have been provided and cycling trips organised. These developments remove to a considerable extent what was one of the most serious defects &mdash; the absence of facilities for outdoor exercise.  To provide improved indoor recreation, a new recreation hall was opened some <Col N="514" /> months ago.  It is provided with a stage, a piano, a radiogram, ample seating accommodation, and tables for games, such as chess or draughts. The inmates are permitted to use this hall each evening, and it is used for lectures, cinema shows and other entertainments organised by the Borstal Association.  Specially selected youths of good conduct and industry are also permitted, in company with members of the Borstal Association, to visit places of interest and entertainments in Cork City and vicinity.  The doors of all cells are unlocked from 7 in the morning until 10 at night.</P>
      <P>Generally, conditions are very much better than they have ever been since the Borstal system was started.</P>
      <P>It is, however, definitely intended to transfer the institution to more suitable premises as soon as possible.  A large number of premises have been inspected for this purpose, but were all found to be unsuitable.  At the moment, it would seem probable that the only solution is to acquire a site and build on it, but this would probably involve a long delay, and I have not yet abandoned all hope of finding an existing building which can be adapted for the purpose.</P>

      <P>I appreciate that the Minister's exertions will improve conditions in Cork Jail for these Borstal inmates, but with regard to the acquisition of new premises, has he inspected the Borstal Institution premises in Northern Ireland, which I do not think were specially designed for the purpose of Borstal, with a view to seeing whether, along the lines pursued there, a large house may not be effectively adapted for a similar purpose here?</P>

      <P>I am aware that the members of the A.R.P. Auxiliary Fire Service in Dublin have expressed their discontent in regard to certain matters connected with the service.  In fact, I have already discussed these matters with members of the service and with representatives of the Dublin Corporation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="518" /> The provision of uniforms for the service is a matter of considerable difficulty, because suitable material for the manufacture of these uniforms is, at the moment, in very short supply. I have reason to hope, however, that I will shortly be able to obtain sufficient material from which uniforms can be made up for the personnel of the service.</P>
    <P>As regards equipment, I am not aware that any deficiencies exist.  Supplies of fire-fighting pumps and of auxiliary equipment sufficient to meet the requirements of the Auxiliary Fire Service have been supplied to the Corporation. The Corporation have furthermore secured all the necessary personal equipment for the members of the service.</P>
    <P>As regards training facilities, coordinated arrangements have been made for the training of the members of the service.  All the permanent fire brigade stations are available for training, and, in addition, four auxiliary fire stations have been opened for this purpose.  Furthermore, arrangements have been made to give every member of the service an opportunity of spending every night of one week on duty at a station, so that they may acquire the necessary experience of fire fighting should any fires occur in a station area during their period of duty.  I am satisfied that these facilities are adequate for training purposes.</P>

Is he aware that the Parliamentary Secretary to his Department, on the 6th October of last year, gave me the same reply as the Minister has now given, namely, that the matter was under consideration and that every facility possible would be granted, including the provision of uniforms?

      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  It is the customary annual one, its purpose being to maintain the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Acts in force for a further 12 months, up to 31st March, 1944. There have been no amendments made to the present Act, and I do not think it is necessary for me to say anything further on the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCorish" hpid="Mr. Corish Mr. Corish">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corish</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to say a word or two in furtherance of the matter raised by me at Question Time to-day with the Minister for Defence in regard to soldiers' dependents' allowances.  The Minister stated that an increase was given some time ago to the dependents of soldiers.  I suggest to him that the increase given is absolutely inadequate to enable those people to cope with the ever-increasing cost of living.  As far as I can ascertain, an increase was given about 12 months ago.  Since then the cost of living, according to the figures furnished by the Department of Industry and Commerce, has increased by 48 points.  That was up to mid-November. <Col N="522" /> The probability is that there has been a further increase since.  In view of that, will the Minister ask his colleagues in the Government to agree to give those people an increase that will be commensurate with the increased cost of living?  There is no question at all but that in some parts of the country, especially in the cities and towns, some of the dependents of soldiers are on the verge of starvation. The amount of money given to them is not at all sufficient to enable them to get proper food for themselves and their children, not to speak at all of the provision of clothing.  The Minister has admitted that the cost of living has increased by the figures I have quoted.  He can verify them by referring to the <i>Trade Journal,</i> issued by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
      <P>During the discussion on this question to-day Deputy Davin pointed out that some of these dependents are not in receipt of any allowance at all. They are people who got married after a certain date.  I submit that is very unfair.  When a man is accepted as a soldier the Government should accept in respect of him the obligations they have undertaken in connection with other soldiers.  I should like the Government to have that matter reconsidered.</P>
      <P>Another thing that is a great source of anxiety to the dependents of soldiers is the fact that payment is made fortnightly.  It has been suggested by soldiers' dependents with whom I have come into contact that if they were paid weekly it would be more satisfactory for them.  I think Deputy Byrne has had complaints of that sort, too.  The weekly payment would be much more satisfactory, especially when the amount is so small. I should like the Minister to ask his colleagues in the Government to agree to an increase for these unfortunate people.</P>

      <P>It was not so very long ago, and I know the difficulty I had in getting a case prepared and in putting up arguments to convince my colleagues that the request I was submitting was a reasonable one. The position at the present moment is that a class III private, with a wife and three children, now receives 45/6 a week, as against 33/3 before the emergency. A class I private receives 49/- now as against 36/9.  A sergeant receives 63/- now as against 54/3, and a company sergeant receives 70/- as against 61/3.  If deferred pay is included, it means an additional 3/6 a week.  All these men will, in due course, receive that deferred pay of 3/6 a week, which is being put to their credit.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The figures I have given are exclusive of ration allowances, clothing, accommodation, fuel, and other incidentals.  Further, a large number of soldiers receive additional pay, ranging from 1/9 to 28/- a week. These soldiers would be tradesmen or men in other types of occupation. Apart from pay, additional pay and medical and chaplaincy services, it has been calculated that a single soldier costs the State 24/- a week.</P>

      <P>A class III private with a wife and three children receives the equivalent of 69/6 a week &mdash; that is for the lowest class private in the Army.  A first-class private receives the equivalent of 73/-; a sergeant the equivalent of 87/- and a company sergeant the equivalent of 94/-.  The figures which I have given compare very favourably with the rates which the soldier would receive in average employment in civil life.  I do not think anyone will question that. The present rates of marriage <Col N="524" /> allowance are: A wife, 1/6 a day; one child, 1/-; two children, 2/-, and three children, 2/6.  In other words, a wife with three children receives 28/- a week as against 19/3 before I got this addition awarded to them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is 2/- per day.  With regard to the marriage allowance applying to all and sundry, we cannot do that.  But even there I have been able to get the Government to reduce the age limit to 23 years.  I think it is very reasonable that a young man of 23 years, married and in the Army, is now entitled to go on the marriage establishment, but he must have two years' service, and get the permission of his commanding officer.  If he gets that permission &mdash; if, in the opinion of the commanding officer, it would be well to have this young man on the marriage allowance&mdash;he goes on, but that is not allowed in any other circumstances.  There are a number of young men who have refused to go through the formality of asking this permission.</P>
      <P>As regards weekly payment, that is a thing that I took up with the Department and I found that we would have to bring in a large staff to deal with the weekly payments.  If there is any hardship &mdash; I do not believe there is &mdash; I do not think that, whatever the amount would be, it would be sufficient to warrant going to the expense of enlarging the staff.</P>

      <P>Before agreeing to the passing of this Supplementary Estimate, there are a few points I should like to raise, because, except for the fact that the Appropriations-in-Aid bring the Vote down to practically a token Vote for £10, the increases in comparison with the original Estimate, or in proportion to the original Estimate, are rather high.  Under the heading, &ldquo;Rural Industries,&rdquo; there are at least six materials, the additional sum required being £19,000.  This is explained in the details as being &ldquo;for the purchase of woollen yarns and other materials, including cost of finishing.&rdquo;  That is a fairly understandable item, but in respect of sub-head D 8&mdash;&ldquo;Toy Industry&mdash;there is a sum of £15,900 required, in respect of which the details merely say: &ldquo;Additional amount required for materials.&rdquo;  I am anxious to know what those materials required for the toy industry are&mdash; what type of commodity they consist of, and what has been the increase in price.</P>
      <P>In respect of sub-head D 6, the Supplementary Estimate gives some details of the type of materials, but in respect of D 8, in connection with the toy industry, no attempt is made to show exactly what the materials are. In view of my knowledge of the toys made by Gaeltacht Industries, I find it very hard to understand what the materials are which would have so very greatly increased in price, if an increase in price is the reason for the extra Estimate.  I should like to be clear as to whether it is a question of increased price, or merely a question of getting more materials and providing more work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Parliamentary Secretary referred to kelp, which does not help him considerably in his Appropriations-in-Aid. I do not quite understand the explanation that: &ldquo;The <Col N="529" /> Department purchased only approximately one-third of the amount provided for, because of the fact that others were purchasing without test of any kind.&rdquo;  Does that mean that there were people in the market for kelp who were paying a price without test which the Department could not pay, or paying a higher price than the Department would pay?  There are one or two Deputies here who have said more to the Parliamentary Secretary about kelp than I ever have said, and I think it would be well if he told us what the situation with regard to kelp is.</P>

      <P>I am rather interested in this new development for which money is asked&mdash;namely, the leasing of a mill.  The erection of a mill at Kilcar has been hanging fire now for I do not know how long.  I regret that the Parliamentary Secretary did not go to the North of Ireland when the Americans were there constructing buildings, and ask them to come over for a few hours to Kilcar to finish off the job. They have been fiddling about this spinning and dyeing mill for years.  I do not know at what stage it is now, as I overlooked asking Deputy McFadden, but it has been going on sufficiently long in my opinion to be erected, equipped, and working long ago.  It is rather regrettable, to say the least of it, that we have simply fiddled about up to this stage, and that we have now to go to County Cork to lease a mill.  Of course, Deputy Linehan will applaud that, but I do not. I certainly think that it is a matter that deserves censure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would not have said a word to the Parliamentary Secretary had I known it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know you would not.  It will be welcomed by Deputy Linehan, but not by me.  I am speaking now with regard to efficiency in the direction of matters.  It is rather a commentary on the way things are done generally.  It certainly indicates <Col N="532" /> the slipshod method adopted when anything gets into the hands of a Government Department.  Assuming there was laxity in regard to this matter up to the outbreak of the war, there was still time after that to push ahead and give the contractor, say, six months to do the job.  I regret that was not done.  I regret that it will now have to remain over until after the war and that wool will have to be sent from Donegal to Cork and then back again to Donegal.  That is bad business.  It may be said that we are spending money, but that may either have to be added to the cost or come from the taxpayers.  What I am concerned with is the business aspect of it and the question of efficiency in production.</P>
      <P>As we have reached this stage, I should like to be assured that there will be very close and efficient supervision of the quality of the wool that is converted into yarn and that the dyeing processes will be amply tested to ensure that the cloth that is produced from the dyed wools will be of a lasting quality.  I hope that the utmost care will be taken in dyeing the wool to see that the dyes used are first-class, that the dyes will be of such a character that when the thread is made into cloth it will keep its colour.  It would be very serious in an innovation of this kind if the colours are mixed in such a way that after a short period of wear they would fade. During the last war that happened with cloths for which a high price was paid.  We should take every precaution to see that there is no injurious action.  I would impress upon the Parliamentary Secretary that he should exercise his authority in the control of this new development for the sake of the reputation of the material that is to be produced by the Department of which he has charge.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am glad to know that carrageen is coming into its own.  For years I have been urging in this House the importance of this product for human and animal use.  Of course, one was looked upon as having a bee in one's bonnet about this matter.  In these days of propaganda by means of the microphone, a single voice has no chance of <Col N="533" /> being heard.  I am glad that present circumstances will perform the process of education which I was unable to perform.  I am glad to know from chemists and others that the sale of carrageen is increasing.  A great opportunity is now provided for its sale owing to the shortage of cornflour, semolina, farola, etc.  The carrageen which I have seen, I must say, was in perfect condition.  What I am anxious about is, that the quality of it should be kept up when the market for its sale increases, and that there will be no falling off in the quality, or the packing of the carrageen.</P>
    <P>With regard to kelp, some seven or eight years ago I suggested that steps should be taken by the Government to try to develop that industry from the point of view of the future.  I pointed out that a day might come when it would be necessary to have the industry developed&mdash;a day of tragedy for the world, which, if one may say so, has already arrived.  My suggestion was that the people living along the coast in the Gaeltacht areas should be offered a flat rate of about £5 a ton for the kelp, which would mean, from the national point of view, that it would be an important source of supply of a vital necessity.  Apart from that, it would mean taking men off the dole. Such work would keep them morally as well as physically fit, because they would be getting money which they earned for themselves.  It would strengthen their moral fibre.</P>
    <P>I should like the Parliamentary Secretary, when he is replying, to tell us, quite frankly, who are our competitors with regard to this, and to what use are they putting the kelp. Are they nationals of the Twenty-Six Counties, or are they from Northern Ireland or from England, and if they are from Northern Ireland, are they acting on behalf of British concerns? Is the kelp being used for chemical purposes, or is it being used as a fertiliser? Of course, when I asked the Minister for Agriculture a question on this matter some time ago, he brushed me aside, but I think it is a fact that scientists in this country have been experimenting for some years and have found out that, in the production of <Col N="534" /> flax fibre of the highest quality, there was no fertiliser to compare with kelp. If the Parliamentary Secretary has any information on that point, I think it would be well for him to tell the House and the country what has been the result of these experiments.</P>
    <P>I think we should be told what is the value, from a fertilising point of view, of the kelp, if the Parliamentary Secretary has the information at his disposal.  I have been convinced long ago, by experience, of the value of that material as a fertiliser, but, again, you have this kind of mass propaganda with regard to commercial fertilisers. Huge combines are concerned, and they can use various weapons whereby they can shut out the operation of an industry like this.  For that reason, I think the Parliamentary Secretary, if he has such information, should give it to the House, so that farmers and industrialists, here as well as elsewhere, could be made aware of the potentialities of this material from the fertilising point of view.  If it has been found by experiments that the application of kelp to certain crops has a greater value than it was previously known to have, then the House and the country should be informed of that, and if there is any possibility of its sale being extended outside this country, our Consuls should be put in the position of being able to use their offices for the purpose of letting that information be known in the countries to which they have been appointed.</P>
    <P>Again, with regard to this matter of the spinning and dyeing mill, I take it that the dyeing is going to take place along with the spinning, but I should like to emphasise the importance of the thread being well made and the dyeing being well done.  The first thing is to see that the dyes are dissolved properly and, secondly, when the wool is dyed, to see that it should not be woven until technical tests are applied to the wool to see that the dye is absolutely fast and will do credit to the country and the Department.</P>

      <P>I fear I shall have to admit that I got very little understanding from the statement that was made by the Parliamentary Secretary <Col N="535" /> in regard to this Supplementary Estimate, and I hope that when the main Estimate comes to be discussed at the beginning of the next financial year there will be something of more interest to the House, or at any rate some more information.  Frankly, I must say that I do not understand what this is all about.  The Parliamentary Secretary first asked for a token Vote of £10, and said that the reason for it was that authority was required to utilise Appropriations-in-Aid in excess of the amount provided in the original Estimate.  The explanation starts off by setting out increased expenditures for various reasons and the second half of the statement explains that the money is not going to be expended at all.  I do not want to delay the House on the matter but I hope that when this item comes before the Public Accounts Committee it will be examined with a view to getting some satisfactory business explanation of the whole thing.</P>

Anybody reading the statement which has been circulated will find that there is a great deal of confusion.  There is talk of buying a spinning mill in one part and of not buying it in another part. There is an explánation given as to why money is needed for it and an explanation of why there will be a saving on the same sub-head because this <Col N="537" /> building cannot be acquired.

      <P>Deputy Linehan was seeking information with regard to certain increases.  The obvious explanation is that we have been endeavouring&mdash;and with a certain amount of success&mdash;to provide the necessary materials to keep the industries going and, to Deputy McMenamin's chagrin, we have gone all the way to Cork in our efforts&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary should have mentioned that in the statement.  It would make it much easier.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash; to secure materials to keep industries going in Donegal and other Gaeltacht industries.  As anybody who has any knowledge of these industries knows, it is not an easy matter to provide the wherewithal to keep these industries going. It is very difficult at the moment to get materials.  We have been endeavouring for some time past to get the necessary machinery for the spinning mill at Kilcar, in Donegal. We have failed.  We have endeavoured by every means in our power to obtain this machinery, but we cannot compel <Col N="538" /> the people who have the control of the machinery to give it to us, although we are willing to pay for it.  We have no power over them.  The machinery cannot be obtained and is not likely to be obtained during the present emergency. Having failed to obtain the machinery, we are still going ahead with the construction of the building there, so that in the future, when we will be able, please God, to provide the machinery, we will have the housing accommodation for it.</P>
      <P>Meanwhile, we have to provide the yarns and to keep on supplying the increasing demands.  For that purpose we have taken over on lease a spinning mill at Cork, at Reenascreena, and that will be a considerable help.  We have, therefore, been able to make provision to keep the industry going for a considerable time to come.  I think, instead of trying to pick holes in the efforts of my Department, the officers there should be congratulated. We have often been taken to task about commercial accounts, and all the rest of it.  We are bound by statute to make out the accounts in the order in which they are made out.  If the Dáil wants to change that system of accountancy, the Dáil alone can change it.  The officers of my Department have to obey the law.  It is an easy matter to apply commercial standards, but there is no man&mdash;not even Deputy Briscoe&mdash;who, if he wanted to start an industry, would go to Donegal.  He would try to start it in Dublin, if I know anything.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanOGrady" hpid="Mr. O'Grady Mr. O'Grady">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Grady</NameTxt>
      <P>With all the advantages there are in Dublin, with its central market, no Deputy who wanted to start an industry would leave Dublin to go to Donegal.  But we are not out&mdash;I frankly admit&mdash;on a commercial basis; we are out to assist the people in the Gaeltacht; but, despite that fact, and despite the handicaps of operating under a Civil Service system, the business has been growing.  Our sales have increased in leaps and bounds.  I think the steps we have taken for the provision of materials for the future, and the fact that I am able to state that for a considerable <Col N="539" /> time to come we have the wherewithal to keep these industries going, indicate that we compare favourably even with the best business methods of Deputy Briscoe or anyone else.  The sales in 1935-36&mdash;if I may go back a few years&mdash;amounted to £34,432.  In 1941-42, the sales have gone up to £177,513.  I think that is very creditable, in view of the many handicaps.</P>

      <P>I can assure the Deputies who have spoken and anybody else who may be interested that they need have no doubts as to the quality of the material or with regard to dyeing and other processes of manufacture. We have experts in my Department who are second to none in this country, who can stand on their own when it comes to giving expert advice with regard to every stage of the process of manufacture.  We are in constant consultation with these people with the result that the standard of our goods will, I think, compare favourably with that of any other manufacturer in the country.</P>
      <P>We have had to make increased provisions here for many reasons, chief amongst them being the obligation that falls upon us to provide for the growing demands which could not possibly have been foreseen at the time the original Estimate was being prepared. With regard to the purchase of kelp&mdash;to which I think Deputy McMenamin referred&mdash;I can assure him that all the kelp will be bought by an Irish firm on behalf of Irish industry and that the entire produce of the kelp will be used for agricultural purposes. There is none of it going abroad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to carrageen, there has been, I am pleased to say, a marked increase in the demand for this food due largely, of course, to the war.  We are not claiming credit for that.  We were doing as much in regard to the <Col N="540" /> purchase of carrageen before this increased demand arose, but the market was not there.  Because of the war there has been a market created for it, with the result that we have now to make increased provision in order to purchase carrageen.  The same applies to kelp in respect of which we are also making increased provision. With regard to the Appropriations-in-Aid, the larger our sales the larger will be the amount of these appropriations. This is merely a token Vote for £10 in order to give us legal authority to use these moneys for the purposes to which I have already referred.  I do not think there is any other point that calls for reply at the present time.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>To-day I asked the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures why it was that references to the inadequate allowances given to the wives of our National Army men were refused publication in the newspapers, and why the soldiers' wives are debarred from getting publicity for their grievances.  I met a group of women quite recently who told me that they had been asked to write letters on behalf of other women to the newspapers, drawing attention to their grievances, and setting out their hardships.  They did so.  They set out the hardships of those women, and the inadequate allowances they are receiving for themselves and their children.  They also drew attention to the very high cost of living.  One woman, I understand, went so far as to send a receipt from a draper's shop <Col N="541" /> for a pair of stockings that she had bought for a ten year old child about 12 months ago, the stockings costing 9½d.  A few days before she wrote to the newspapers she had paid 1/11½d. for a pair similar to the pair that she had bought a year ago for 9½d.</P>
      <P>The cost of all clothing for workers children has increased in the same proportion. Those women submitted other receipts to the newspapers to show how impossible it is for them to pay their rent, to feed their children, not well but moderately, and to clothe them on the inadequate allowances they are receiving.  They drew attention to the wages and allowances paid in other departments of the service, and to the increases recently given to people in these services.  These letters were sent to the newspapers.  The newspaper editors were not allowed to publish them&mdash;to expose the hardships that those people are suffering from. Yet those people could read in the newspapers every other morning reports of the various applications that are being made by other people for increases in their wages.  The latter got publicity simply because a vast organisation in this country is able to defeat Ministers&mdash;not this Minister, but other Ministers&mdash;in their aims to keep down wages.  But simply because men are in uniform the Minister is in a position to keep down their wages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>No consideration is given to the rents that are being paid in the City of Dublin in the tenement quarters&mdash; these rents average 10/- a room.  The soldiers' wives are not getting a rent allowance to enable them to pay that sum even for the humblest room in a tenement quarter.  I am being appealed to everywhere I go to do something about this.  I am sure every other Deputy has had the same experience. I do not claim to be an exception.  I know that appeals have been made to Deputies by soldiers' wives.  Probably I meet them more frequently than others, because there is a very big number of soldiers' wives and their families in the large area that I represent. I am stopped by them 20 times a day.  They say to me: &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Byrne, what are you going to do for us; what is the Government going to <Col N="542" /> do; will you, or the other members of the Dáil, not do something on our behalf; do we count for nothing?&rdquo; I promised them that I would do something. I have raised the question several times here, three times within three months prior to the end of 1942. Quite recently, at the request of this deputation.  I wrote a letter to the Minister asking him to consider favourably an application for an increase in the allowances that are being paid.  I got the usual cold reply on a half sheet of paper saying: &ldquo;Dear Deputy Byrne, you raised this question on such a date in September, on such a date in October and on such a date in December, and the circumstances have not altered since.&rdquo;  The Minister and his officials who say that the circumstances have not altered since must be asleep to what is going on.  Those people are expected to buy so many pints of milk, so many loaves of bread and so much butter, if it is possible for them to get it, and to pay their rent, but, owing to the rapid increase in the price of these commodities the soldiers' wives are not able to do that on the allowances they are getting. It is not right to see the children of our soldiers insufficiently fed and clothed.  I am satisfied that the taxpayers of the country would be anxious to see such allowances given to soldiers' wives as would enable them to keep their children in reasonable comfort.</P>
    <P>A woman told me recently that she had a girl of 17 years of age who is incapable of doing any work.  She is partly an invalid, but her condition is not such as to enable her to get into a home.  Her father is a soldier.  The mother said that when he was employed on the roads in Dublin his wages helped to keep this girl.  The Minister just knocks her off as if she did not exist, simply because she is over 16 years of age.  I hope that her case will get immediate and sympathetic consideration from the Minister.</P>
    <P>My question on the Order Paper related to the Press Censorship.  The Minister, by what he has done, has smothered the grievances of those people.  That is not a good way to <Col N="543" /> carry on government.  To smother grievances only creates dissatisfaction. Those people have grievances and I think they should be allowed to ventilate them.  Publication in the newspapers would provide a safety valve for them.  If people are suffering hardships it is only right that they should be allowed to draw public attention to them.</P>
    <P>A short time ago, when the Army Bill was under discussion here, the Minister for Defence stated what he is going to do.  So far it is jam to-morrow for those people, but never jam to-day.  The soldier's wife is not entitled to infant-aid free milk or to free fuel, nor do I think she is entitled to cheap fuel.  The soldier's children are not entitled to the facilities provided by the Minister for Education in regard to partly free school books. All these privileges are withdrawn from the soldier's wife and children, simply because the husband is employed by the State.  They are suffering from the hardships caused by the high cost of foodstuffs and, with the cost of clothing and rents still further increasing, I ask the Minister to increase their allowances and not to cloak their grievances by refusing permission to the papers to publish them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to associate myself with the protest made by Deputy Byrne, in so far as there has been an abuse of the powers given to the Minister in connection with the censorship. When the Emergency Powers Order was being discussed here in September, 1939, we received a definite assurance from the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, that these powers would be used only to cut out of newspapers matter likely to endanger the neutrality of the country. Protests have been made here since that assurance was given that the powers were being used for other purposes. The Minister, when he was replying to questions earlier to-day, attempted to justify the use of the censorship in connection with this particular matter, on the ground that <Col N="544" /> publication would injuriously affect recruitment for the Army.  I do not want, and neither, I am sure, does Deputy Byrne or any other Deputy, to do or say anything that would prevent the young men of this country joining the Defence Forces either for the duration of the emergency or as permanent soldiers.</P>
      <P>I think it would be far better if the Minister and his colleagues faced up to this situation and gave people who might be willing to join the Army an assurance that, while they were serving in the Army, their dependents would be looked after in a just manner.  The Minister knows well that matters affecting the dependents of serving soldiers have been raised elsewhere. Deputy Byrne spoke about increasing the allowances now given to the dependents of serving soldiers. He knows more about this matter than anybody else, or at least he ought to, and he must be aware that we have hundreds of soldiers whose wives or other dependents are getting nothing. I have taken advantage of other opportunities to protest against that.</P>
      <P>I say it is a disgrace to the Minister and the Government&mdash;to the Minister in so far as he has any responsibility&mdash; that the dependents of men who are in the Army are not provided for. Some of those people, to my own knowledge, are a charge on the ratepayers. Deputy Byrne is entitled to make a protest against the miserable allowances that are granted.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest that the Minister and his Government colleagues should look at this matter from a different angle. By public advertisement they should indicate their desire to provide better allowances for the dependents of serving soldiers.  That is the right way to get recruits for the Army.  I do not think that you will in any way injure the recruiting campaign by the publication of statements made in the House, or in the course of correspondence&mdash;statements or appeals made on behalf of the dependents of serving soldiers.  I regard the refusal to publish them as an abuse of the censorship, in so far as I understood the Taoiseach's assurance, and that is the principal reason why I desire to be <Col N="545" /> associated with the protest made by Deputy Byrne.</P>

      <P>One would think from Deputy Davin's and Deputy Byrne's speeches that they were not living in the country, or that people in the country had not their eyes open, or did not read the newspapers. Everybody knows that on any occasion when the matter of soldiers' pay was raised in the House, it has been published.  This question of censorship to-day related to the publication of correspondence.  I gave the reasons for stopping the publication of correspondence.  It was quite obvious from some of the letters that were submitted, and, indeed, from some that were published, that they were not being put forward with a view to righting grievances of soldiers or their wives or other dependents, but with a view to disrupting the country and having a crack at the defence forces generally.  There are certain people in the country&mdash;and I do not exclude Deputy Byrne from among them&mdash;who must have grievances, who live on grievances, and the more irremediable the grievances, the better they like them.</P>

      <P>I will refer to the Deputy's attitude to-day.  He had three questions on the Order Paper and one related to soldiers' wives. There is a Minister directly in charge of the Army, the Minister who makes orders increasing soldiers' pay.  Did Deputy Byrne ask for his attendance here in order to impress on him the grievances of the soldiers or their wives?  Not at all.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Byrne did not. He had the option of bringing in the Minister for Defence in order to impress on him the need for increasing the allowances to soldiers' wives.  He <Col N="546" /> did not do it.  He acted in the same way as he has often acted.  He keeps his mouth shut during the whole session of the Dáil and then when it is about to adjourn he shouts out asking us what we are going to do about this, that and the other.  There is never a suggestion from him&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>We all know the Deputy's form in matters of this kind. Before he ever raised this question of soldiers or their pay the Minister for Defence and others came together in order to keep the Army as far as possible from being made the plaything of politicians looking for votes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Aiken</NameTxt>
      <P>I answered the question to-day and I have commented on it now.  I do not want to say anything more, except this: I think we are in a dangerous enough situation in this country for Deputies to realise that it is their duty to keep the Army out of mere Party politics.  If there are questions affecting soldiers, I do not think Deputies should stand for having them dealt with by anonymous correspondents in the columns of the newspapers. The matters can be raised here.  The Dáil set up another body to examine into Army affairs and, without giving away any secret, I can say that the matter of soldiers' pay and allowances has been before that body, <Col N="548" /> and, without Deputy Byrne or anybody else here raising the matter, the Minister one year ago increased the pay of soldiers by over 50 per cent. and the allowances of their wives and children by a large amount at the same time.</P>
