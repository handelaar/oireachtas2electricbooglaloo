      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state whether there are any reasons of State policy for withholding from the <i>Kilkenny People</i> advertising matter issued by Government Departments to the more important weekly newspapers in the provinces; and, if so, what those reasons are; whether, if there are no such reasons, he will take steps to ensure that the <i>Kilkenny People</i> will be treated in the matter of State advertising on the same basis as all other important provincial newspapers.</P>

      <P>The answer to the first part of the Deputy's question is in the negative.  As regards the second part, I see no reason for altering the standing practice under which the selection of newspapers for advertising is left to the discretion of the Departments concerned, who are in the best position to decide as to the journals which are most likely to meet their requirements.</P>

I am advised that the question of developing the bog has already been considered in connection with the emergency turf production programme and it has been decided not to proceed with its development for the reasons that (a) the turf in the bog is of inferior quality, (b) there is no scarcity of turbary in the area, and (c) the expenditure which the development of the bog would involve would not be justified.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that turf is being sold in midland towns at prices ranging from 3/- to 3/9 per cwt.; and if he will state whether he will take the necessary steps to see that a fair price is charged inside the turf areas.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am aware that in a few Midland towns turf is being sold at a price as high as 3/- to 3/3 per cwt. I am not aware that the price has reached 3/9 per cwt. in any midland town.  The high prices are due to seasonal shortage and it is probable that the position will correct itself with the advent of the new crop.  I do not consider it practicable to control the <Col N="1610" /> price of turf in the turf areas.  Persons living in midland towns in the bog areas should be able to produce their own supplies of turf, or to organise themselves, through parish councils or otherwise, to get turf at lower prices than those quoted in the question.  I trust that the experience of the present season will result in greater individual and co-operative effort to produce sufficient turf in this season to meet full requirements for the ensuing year.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that persons who have been making the winning of turf a commercial proposition during the past couple of years are now disturbed by the fear of petrol not being available during the coming season for the haulage of turf, and are inclined to give up this necessary work; and, if so, if he will state if petrol will be available for turf haulage.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that any persons engaged in the haulage of turf are inclined to give up the business through fear of shortage of supplies of petrol.  The allocation of petrol for any purpose is dependent on the arrival of supplies and I am not in a position to give any guarantee as to what supplies may be available during the coming season.  I have, however, made arrangements for the allocation of sufficient supplies of petrol to meet the estimated needs of turf haulage during the coming season, should the supplies expected duly arrive.</P>

      <P>I am aware that the prices of certain brands of tobaccos were recently increased, but there has been no increase in the prices of cigarettes manufactured in this country, which are controlled by a maximum price order.  I found it necessary to permit price advances by certain of the smaller manufacturers for pipe tobaccos, having regard to the increased cost to manufacturers of importing tobacco leaf into this country. These price advances have the effect of increasing retail selling prices by 1d. per ounce.</P>

On my directions a provisional arrangement was made for an appointment between Mr. Keane and the Secretary of the Department for the purpose of discussing the claim made in the letter for a share of the Department's advertising for the <i>Kilkenny People.</i>  Unavoidable circumstances required the postponement of the appointment and Mr. Keane was so informed.  In the meantime, however, my attention was drawn to a further article in the <i>Kilkenny People</i> and, having regard to the tone of the article, I felt that no useful purpose would be served by discussing the application made in the letter of March 2nd.  It is not at present proposed to add to the list of provincial newspapers in which the Department's advertisements are inserted.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy must be aware from the terms of the Vote passed in this House, the fuel scheme initiated by the Government last winter was intended to be operative only in the winter months. This was in accordance with the practice followed by the one public assistance authority, which granted heretofore a supplemental allowance for fuel.  One of the objects of the Government scheme, in fact the principal object, was to provide a constant supply of fuel during the winter at reduced prices for the classes entitled to participate in it.  When the winter scheme concluded at the end of last month it was decided, in view of the special circumstances now existing, to continue the arrangements in a modified form during the summer months so as to ensure that the more necessitous <Col N="1621" /> families of the classes who participated in the winter season would obtain a regular supply of turf at reasonable rates up to the time when next winter's scheme will be introduced. So far as the food voucher scheme in Dublin City is concerned, it has not been modified; the Dublin Board of Assistance were informed in reply to representations made by them that they should continue their food scheme pending a review of their particular circumstances.  They have since been informed that the Government will recoup them for expenditure on this service up to an amount not exceeding their expenditure under this head last year.

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that there has been a very serious shortage of butter in Wexford for some weeks past, due to the inability of traders to procure their quotas from the creameries; and whether he will take immediate steps to have an adequate supply of butter made available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Agriculture (Dr. Ryan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that traders in Wexford are unable to procure their quotas of butter from the creameries.  Out of the available stocks in the country, Wexford has been getting a fair supply of creamery butter based on the purchases of each individual trader in the same period last year.  The county manager is in constant and direct communication with my Department on the matter, and at his request the local dairy produce inspector was instructed by me to investigate the position in Wexford and Enniscorthy early in February.  As a result of this inspector's report, the supply of creamery butter to these towns was increased generally, and, where the circumstances so warranted, certain individual cases were specially adjusted.</P>
      <P>The question of supplies for the current month is under investigation at the moment by the local inspector, and when his report is received a decision will be arrived at on the question of making additional supplies available, having regard to the general position of stocks and the quantities of farm butter likely to come on the market.</P>

      <P>No Order was made by me in this matter.  The decision to suspend canning in April and May was taken on the initiative of the majority of the canners themselves.  The temporary stoppage relates only to the canning of stewed steak for the export trade.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the big majority <Col N="1627" /> of the factories agreed to close down. It is obvious that, if one factory held out and tried to carry on, it could get cheap cattle and make a big profit.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Defence whether he received from Mr. Michael McCrann, 13 Garavogue Villas, Sligo, an application for a pension or other form of compensation in respect of the loss of his son, Volunteer Michael McCrann, who was shot dead in the Gilhooly Hall, Sligo, on December 31st, 1921, while on active service; and, if so, whether the application has been examined and a decision taken with regard to it; whether he is aware that, previous to his death, Volunteer McCrann contributed to the upkeep of the household, and that, had he lived, the contributions in later years would probably be very substantial; whether he is also aware that the present applicant and his wife are now old and depend for their maintenance on the spasmodic employment which Mr. McCrann is able to obtain; and whether, in these circumstances, he will take steps to provide a dependent's allowance or other form of compensation for the parents of Volunteer McCrann in their old age.</P>

      <P>Mr. Michael McCrann claimed under the Army Pensions Act, 1932, in respect of the death of his son, Michael, who was accidentally shot dead on the 31st December, 1921.  No award could be made to him under that Act as, although the deceased contributed to some extent to the upkeep of the household, it could not be established that applicant was either wholly or partially dependent on him, having regard to his circumstances at the time of his son's death.  While I am not prepared to dispute the point that, had the deceased lived, his contributions to the upkeep of the applicant's household might have been substantial, I am unable to grant any award of dependent's allowance under the Army Pensions Act, 1937, to the applicant or his wife, as the yearly means of either, as ascertained and calculated in accordance with Part VII of that Act, exceed the maximum laid down, viz., £40, and furthermore, the review of the claim is now debarred under the Army Pensions Act, 1941.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>As I indicated earlier, I propose to oppose this section because I do not think this measure should be allowed to pass until the main question that has been under discussion here&mdash;the amount of &ldquo;married pension&rdquo; paid to officers and soldiers over the basic rate paid to a single officer or soldier&mdash;has been attended to.  The Minister says that the phrase &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; may mean <i>ex gratia.</i> I take it that the words &ldquo;extra&mdash; statutorily&rdquo; would probably mean <i>ex gratia</i>, and that &ldquo;or otherwise&rdquo; may mean payments by statute.  Because of that, I would like to put this point to the Minister.  Under the 1927 Act, in the case of a soldier who died either of wounds or disease and who had six children, the widow would receive 17/6 for herself, 5/- for the first child and 3/6 for each subsequent child.  In addition, she would be entitled to the repayment of an amount proved to have been, in fact, necessarily and properly expended in educational fees, but not exceeding £35 in any one calendar year where evidence of that was produced to the satisfaction of the Minister. Therefore, the widow of a man who had been killed or died as a result of disease during the emergency might, under the 1927 Act, if in receipt of a gratuity of 17/6 for herself, of 5/- for the first child and 17/6 a week if there were five other children, have a total of 40/- a week.  In addition if three of the children were considered to be entitled to educational facilities, she might receive the equivalent of 40/6 a week for their education.  That is to say, she might actually be in receipt <Col N="1641" /> of 80/6 a week.  This Bill provides that if her husband were alive, but 100 per cent. disabled, and had the same wife and six children to look after he would only be in receipt of 52/- a week.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Obviously that has nothing to do with this section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>This section provides that any gratuity, whether paid extra-statutorily or otherwise, may, at the discretion of the Minister, be deducted.  The sum that would have been paid under the 1927 Act in respect of a widow and six children would, as I have said, amount to 80/6.  Under this Bill, if the man were alive but 100 per cent. disabled, and had a wife and six children, he would only receive 52/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Under Section 8 he gets 52/-.  Is that the Deputy's point?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  Section 8, as it stands, gives power to reduce.  That is to say, the man is required to surrender perhaps some part of the 80/6. Section 8 says that &ldquo;any gratuity (whether paid extra-statutorily or otherwise) paid before the passing of this Act&rdquo; in respect of a person who died as a result of wounds or injury &ldquo;may at the discretion of the Minister be recovered&rdquo;.  In view of the obscurity of this word &ldquo;otherwise&rdquo;, and of the type of provision made for the wife and children of a living injured man, I want to assure myself that this provision, in a Bill so queer as this, does not intend that, in the case of gratuities that have been awarded under Schedule 7 (Part II) of the 1927 Act, the person who has got the gratuities will be in danger of having to make a <Col N="1642" /> refund by reason of the passing of this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a matter that is left entirely within the Minister's discretion, a Chinn Chomhairle, and I agree with you in your view that the Deputy was quite irrelevant in discussing other portions of the Bill under this section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not clear as to what your ruling is in this particular matter, but I am clear that the words of the section here are:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;any gratuity (whether paid extra-statutorily or otherwise).&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I imagine that that might include a gratuity paid under Statute.  This section leaves it entirely within the Minister's discretion to require the repayment of a gratuity made under Statute, and I think the Minister should assure the House, in view of the general queerness of this Bill, that it is not his intention, as a result of this Bill&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This section was designed for the purpose of expediting decisions in respect to the various applications.  We do not want to refer non-medical cases to the board.  We believe that cases which do not require that specialised type of decision can be dealt with by a non-medical section and that, as a result, the provision of pensions for the applicants will be greatly expedited.</P>

The Bill contains no provision whatever for the very large number of employees whose fate is in question arising out of it. <Col N="1652" /> The Minister has given no indication of what his proposals are in connection with them.  He has been, as usual, delightfully vague on this question.  I am old enough to remember some of the derelicts who were left here and there throughout the country as a result of a previous measure of this kind, and, thinking of their hard cases, I oppose this Resolution because of the absence from the Bill of any indication that provision will be made for dealing with the employees who will be rendered redundant.</P>

      <P>I should prefer to move this amendment, because I think that we ought to make a provision of this kind in the first part of the Bill; that is, in the definition section of the Bill.  For instance, in the definition section of the Bill, as it stands at present, it is set forth that &ldquo;the Minister&rdquo; means the Minister for Agriculture; that the expression &ldquo;the company&rdquo; means the Dairy Disposals Company, Limited; that the word &ldquo;creamery&rdquo; includes any factory or plant for the manufacture of milk products, and so on; and the section also goes on to describe what is meant by such expressions as &ldquo;creamery premises,&rdquo;&ldquo;proprietor&rdquo; or &ldquo;chattels.&rdquo; All these things are defined in that section, and the one notable omission from it is the word &ldquo;workers.&rdquo;  Accordingly, I wish to move this amendment.</P>

It seems to me, according to that, that if people knew that a creamery was going to be disposed of to-morrow, they could take on, say, ten workers the day before, and that they could, therefore, claim compensation.</P>

      <P>I have been a member of this House since it was established, and I can say that in connection with every measure of this kind, which sought to bring about a scheme of amalgamation of industrial concerns, a section was always included making provision for the payment of compensation of some kind or another for the workers who would be thrown out of employment as a result of such an amalgamation scheme.  This is the first <Col N="1655" /> measure of that kind where no provision for compensation of workers thrown out of employment is made, and I think that, even as a matter of courtesy, we are entitled to hear from the Minister whether he intends to amend this Bill so as to make it possible to provide compensation of the kind I have mentioned.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to admit, and I dare say that Deputy Murphy will agree with me that the wording of the amendment now under discussion may not be the best possible wording when we come to find out what the Minister's intentions are.  The Minister has highly-paid draftsmen at his right-hand side, good advisers; we cannot claim to have any such people at our disposal in the drafting of amendments of this kind.  If the Minister will say quite frankly that, as a result of the insertion of the necessary compensation clause, he will then take the requisite steps to put in a suitable definition section, I would suggest to Deputy Murphy, if you agree, Sir, that he should waive his right to move the amendment at the moment and reserve the right to put it forward on the Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I just want to say a word in regard to the amendments.  There is a number of amendments here all dealing with the one thing, all dealing, generally speaking, with encumbrances, that is amendments Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 19 and 20.  As Deputies may have observed, Bills of this kind that <Col N="1659" /> were passed here in the House in the past, such as, say, the Minerals Development Bill, the Electricity Supply Bill, and so on, had, as a basis for compensation and so on, the Land Acquisition Act.  In drawing up this Bill, we did not follow that procedure. We adopted a basis, as it were, of our own, in valuing those creamery premises, superior interest, and so on. On examination, however, it was found that there was some, let us say, defect in those cases of encumbrances.  It was possible, if you were dealing with dishonest people&mdash;I suppose, in legislation, we must always watch that point &mdash;that there could be injustices done to encumbrancers.  I should like, however, to look further into the question, and I would ask the House to allow me not to move those amendments, Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 19 and 20, and to bring them up again on Report Stage.  I think they might require some further amendment before I bring them forward.</P>
      <P>Agreed.</P>
      <P>Question proposed: &ldquo;That Section 5 stand part of the Bill.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Where does the ordinary creditor stand as regards the State?  What is the intention? There is what is in the Bill and there is what the Minister is going to do. Perhaps he would give us some indication in that regard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This is rather involved law, and I do not claim to be able to follow it exactly but, as the section stands, it is claimed that if there were a mortgage on any property which we were taking over under this Bill it is possible that the mortgagor might be done out of his money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If those amendments go through&mdash;as I say, they may have to <Col N="1660" /> be slightly altered&mdash;it will then provide that the first charge on the moneys provided for the acquisition will be any encumbrances; next, any costs of the sale; and, thirdly, any debt that may be due to any State Department. Whatever is left, of course, goes to the person who is selling the property.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I must say that is a revelation to me after reading the Bill.  When dealing with it on the Second Reading, I think everybody was under the impression that the intention was to postpone every other debt, no matter when incurred, until the State had got its part.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It is involved because of the amendments that are necessary to the present amendments before they are right.  As the section stands, it would appear that the State would come in first, and then that the person selling the property would get the money irrespective of any mortgage that might be there.  These provide that all mortgages and charges will be cleared first.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 7:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (2), page 4, before the word &ldquo;all,&rdquo; in line 17, to insert the following words: &ldquo;within thirty days of such compliance&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>Sub-section (2) says:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Where the proprietor of a creamery complies with a notice served on him under this section the company shall pay to him all costs necessarily and properly incurred by him in relation to such compliance.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The purpose of this amendment is to see that the costs are paid within a reasonable time.  I said on the Second Reading of this Bill that on a former occasion when returns were required and were officially compiled, as I understand was necessary some years ago, there never has been one penny costs paid in respect of them since. The proposal now is to provide for the payment of the costs within a reasonable time, and I suggest in this amendment that that should be within 30 days of the compliance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy is dealing with costs alone that is already dealt with in this Bill, and there is a further amendment to make sure that all costs are covered.  Apart from that, the Deputy's amendment here imposes a time limit.  I think it would be very unwise to put in a time limit of 30 days, because it is quite possible that the costs would not be furnished to the company within 30 days, and then the <Col N="1662" /> company is bound, under certain circumstances anyway, to have the costs taxed and so on, which would take some further time.  I cannot suggest what would be a fair time limit.  I think that, in all the circumstances, we should leave the matter as it stands, on the understanding that the company will be prompt in its payment. I see no reason whatever why they should not be prompt, because the procedure&mdash;every step they are to take &mdash;is laid down, and if the vendor furnishes the costs they will either be paid or taxed as the case may be; then there is no reason why prompt payment should not be made.  It would be dangerous to put in a time limit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister thinks 30 days is too short a time, he ought to indicate the time he thinks would be suitable.  Merely to say that the Dairy Disposals Board should be prompt in paying the costs has no meaning in law; a proposal of that kind cannot be put into an Act of Parliament. It is purely a pious platitude that they should be prompt in paying.  I indicated on the Second Reading that they have not been prompt in paying and I propose now to return to that point. I assert that a return of this kind was asked for in 1931 and was made by one of the concerns with which this Bill proposes to deal and, since 1931, not a penny of the costs involved in making the necessary return has been paid.  I want to guard against a situation of that kind and I say to the Minister that to express the view that the Dairy Disposals Board should be prompt in meeting the costs means nothing in law and cannot be enshrined in an Act of Parliament.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know what case the Deputy is referring to, but I think it is fairly obvious that under this Bill, in the business of acquisition, each case will be dealt with.  But, if the Deputy or any other member of the House has any anxiety as to the delays that may occur, I will undertake to bring forward an amendment relating to the time from which all the returns are made.  If the vendor is <Col N="1663" /> slow about making returns it would not be fair to blame the company but, as from the time the company has all the returns presented to it, we could make a time limit.  I should like to think over this matter and ascertain what would be a reasonable time.  I do not know how long it takes to get a list of costs taxed.  I think we should allow a fair margin of time to the company in the matter of making payments.  I will look into the point and, if the Deputy withdraws his amendment, I will arrange to bring forward a satisfactory amendment on the Report Stage.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (6) page 5, to delete in lines 28 and 29 the words &ldquo;and <Col N="1666" /> the Minister, after consultation with the Minister for Finance, confirms such agreement.&rdquo;</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>This amendment deals with the case where the company and a proprietor agree upon a price subject, as the Bill stands, to the sanction of the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance.  I think it is necessary to have that provision there because, as I explained on the Second Reading, a certain amount of State funds will have to be provided to bridge the gap between what is paid for those premises and what will be received from the co-operative societies to which they are sold.  The two Ministers named have, of course, an interest in seeing that the price paid is a reasonable one.  Therefore, I could not agree to the deletion of those words.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case two people make a bargain as to the price to be paid.  One of the parties, having put all his cards on the table, is then told that the bargain has to go before that very tough gentleman, the Minister for Finance.  Surely, the obvious thing would be for the Minister for Finance, who has been in touch with the company all along, to come in before, and not after, the bargain was struck.  It certainly looks objectionable to have a third party coming in after the bargain is struck, particularly when that third party has been in close touch with the business all the time.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact, what happens is that the negotiator on behalf of the company will have had prior consultations with the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Finance.  He knows the price that he can go to.  If these words were not there, and if, for any reason, the company were to pay outlandish prices that would place Government Departments in a desperate position.  I agree that is not likely to happen, but it might.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows that in all these transactions where proprietary <Col N="1667" /> creameries are taken over and handed back to co-operative societies, there is always a difference to be made good by the State.  The co-operative societies never pay as much for those creamery premises to the Dairy Disposals Board as the latter has to pay to the proprietors, because very often the premises in question are closed down and not used as creameries at all.  In such cases, there is bound to be a loss which must be met by the State.</P>

      <P>In sub-section (6) page 5, in line 36, to delete the words and brackets &ldquo;(whose determination shall be final)&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>The object of the amendment is to make it clear that the decision of the arbitrator in these cases shall not be final and that there will be the right of appeal from it to the Circuit Court judge.  I regard this as one of the most vital matters in the whole Bill. Amendment No. 14 deals with the same matter.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In amendment No. 14 I am proposing, before sub-section (7), page 5, to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(7) Any party to arbitration proceedings under the next preceding sub-section of this section shall be entitled within thirty days after the publication of the award of the arbitrator to appeal to the judge of the Circuit Court against the terms of such award and in all such cases the decision thereon of the judge of the Circuit Court shall be final.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think any arguments are necessary in support of either of these proposals.  The object is to ensure the observance of a well recognised, a well defined, right that, generally speaking, <Col N="1668" /> has been very jealously guarded.  I spoke strongly on this matter on the Second Reading.  It would be highly objectionable, in my opinion, if the Minister who, under this Bill, is seeking to close down or absorb a number of creameries, should have the appointment of the arbitrator put into his hands, and that there should be no appeal from the arbitrator's decision. These amendments seek to remedy that position.  Deputies are aware that valuation appeals and matters of that kind generally go before the Circuit Court judge.  I see no reason why people who are dissatisfied with the amount of the arbitrator's award should not have the right to go before the Circuit Court judge.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I hope that the Minister will accept Deputy Murphy's amendment or else bring in an amendment himself to modify the Bill.  Here is a most objectionable situation, whether there is a precedent for it or not.  In the course of the last ten minutes' discussion, it has become quite clear that the Minister is a party and is interested in the price.  The Dairy Disposals Board&mdash;the company in question&mdash;works with the Minister. It is quite clear, from what we have heard from the Minister, that when any question of price is being discussed, there is full consultation&mdash;and there is to be full consultation&mdash; between the company and the Minister. Yet, <i>ad hoc</i>&mdash;for that particular case&mdash; the Minister, who is one of the bargaining parties, will appoint the person to decide the price.  Surely, that is neither just nor equitable.  There should be the provision which Deputy Murphy referred to, or the arbitrator should be appointed&mdash;as suggested on the Second Reading&mdash;by the President of the High Court or by the Chief Justice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present arrangement seems inequitable, and I put it very seriously to the Minister that he will not lose anything, and that a few pounds one way or another will not count.  It is objectionable that a party to the negotiations for fixing a price should appoint the person for that particular case.  He is not a person appointed to look into a number of cases and who <Col N="1669" /> holds office under the will of the Minister: he is appointed <i>ad hoc,</i> for that particular bargain, and he is appointed by the Minister who, as we have seen in the course of this debate, is a most interested party.  If the Minister gives this matter consideration, he will see that the interests of justice require that he meet the case put up by Deputy Murphy, or that he allow the arbitrator to be appointed by an independent person, such as the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I, too, think there is good reason why the Minister should accept this amendment, as suggested by Deputy O'Sullivan.  It would give more confidence to both parties to the bargain if some such suggestion were adopted.  Without it, I do not see how either party could have confidence in the arbitrator appointed by the Minister, and I ask him to accept it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O'Sullivan has made a very deep impression on me, and I think there is a lot in what he says.  I would like to have finality, whatever arbitrator there be, and would prefer the alternative that the arbitrator be appointed by someone other than the Minister&mdash;maybe by the President of the High Court or by the Chief Justice.  The Attorney-General would advise as to that.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 13:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In sub-section (6), paragraph (b), to delete sub-paragraphs (iii) and <Col N="1670" /> (iv), and substitute the following sub-paragraphs:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(iii) the arbitrator may, as respects the costs and expenses of the parties in any proceedings under this paragraph, by his award and at his direction&mdash;</P>
    <P>(I) direct the company to pay a sum (to be measured by the arbitrator) towards the costs and expenses of the vendor, or</P>
    <P>(II) direct the vendor to pay a sum (to be measured by the arbitrator) towards the costs and expenses of the company, or</P>
    <P>(III) direct the company to pay the costs and expenses of the vendor as taxed by a Taxing Master of the High Court, or</P>
    <P>(IV) direct the vendor to pay the costs and expenses of the company as taxed by a Taxing Master of the High Court, or</P>
    <P>(V) direct the vendor and the company respectively to abide their own costs and expenses;</P>
    <P>(iv) when the arbitrator directs the vendor to pay a sum (to be measured by the arbitrator) towards the costs and expenses of the company or directs the vendor to pay the costs and expenses of the company as taxed by a Taxing Master of the High Court, the company may deduct the amount payable to them under the direction from the said price.</P>
    <P>This deals with costs and expenses. Although it is a long amendment, it differs very little from the original, except in so far as it says &ldquo;costs and expenses&rdquo;.  It was feared that &ldquo;costs&rdquo; alone might be held to refer only to legal costs.  By including the word &ldquo;expenses&rdquo;, it covers all such things as accountants' fees, valuers' fees and professional charges of that kind.</P>

Surely not?</P>

      <P>I asked the same question myself, as to whether it was necessary or not, and it was put to me that the vendor might be very unreasonable and put the company to a good deal of trouble and expense.  It is a matter for the arbitrator, in the end, to decide whether it is necessary for the company <Col N="1672" /> to pay these expenses and whether they should be allowed.  I think it is most unlikely that they would be allowed by the arbitrator.</P>

      <P>Here is a public company, working under statute. It is entitled to charge its expenses, according to this.  Being entitled to charge its expenses, is it entitled to forgo them as a State institution?  I doubt it.  If it ever comes before the Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;and I understand it is not easy to get information out of the company before the Public Accounts Committee&mdash;it <Col N="1673" /> might be very hard to justify its not charging what it is legally entitled to charge.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>In my judgment the arbitrator's powers would be wide enough, without putting further powers into his hands with regard to expenses, apart from costs.  I am very much obliged to Deputy O'Sullivan for the very clear manner in which he has explained this matter. I object to this amendment, and I think it will introduce a dangerous principle and one that tends to whittle down whatever few rights will be left to the proprietors.</P>

There are five alternatives.

      <P>I move amendment No. 15:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Before Section 10, but in Part II of the Bill, to insert a new section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Any creamery acquired by the company shall be disposed of, not later than three months after its acquisition by the company, to the nearest co-operative dairy society in the district in which such creamery has been operating.</P>
      <P>I think it is necessary that something should be done to ginger up the Dairy Disposals Board to carry out the work they are supposed to do, and that is to dispose of the creameries they acquired.  It was pointed out on the Second Reading that once creameries were acquired the word &ldquo;disposal&rdquo; was never given effect to as far as the board is concerned.  The object of this amendment is to see that the intentions of the Act are carried out, and that creameries that were acquired will be handed over as soon as possible to co-operative creameries where they are working.  It may be pointed out that this Bill will enable the Dairy Disposals Board to get hold of creameries that are redundant.  I suppose the amendment should deal only with creameries that will not be redundant, and that it is necessary to keep alive, but I suggest that they should be handed over at an early date to co-operative creameries.</P>

I would be more definite in the second case, that in a particular area in South Cork, the Dairy Disposals Board will have to hold groups, there for some time until there is re-organisation. That could not possibly be done in a month.  I do not know how long it will take.  It might take six or 12 months but re-organisation will be necessary in that area.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister is trying to have this amendment withdrawn on the undertaking that there will be no delay in carrying out its object.  This Party has taken up the attitude that if the intention of the original Act had been carried out in a reasonable period, ten or 15 years was long enough to see the policy enshrined in the Act put into operation.  As the Minister <Col N="1677" /> and the Government have been in office for 11 years, I hope he will not take that as a reasonable period within which to put a certain policy into operation.</P>
      <P>I am glad to hear the Minister state that it is his intention, or the intention of whoever succeeds him in the next Dáil, to bring in legislation for the regularisation of the activities of the Dairy Disposals Board.  There should be an interesting discussion on that Bill as to the meaning of the word &ldquo;regularisation.&rdquo;  There is one thing we should have.  The Minister should give a definite undertaking to Deputy O'Neill as to what he means by the carrying out of the policy enshrined in this Bill.  What is the reasonable period within which the Minister thinks the intention will be put into operation? Deputy O'Neill is asking for certain things to be done inside a period of three months.  The Minister has failed to do certain things within a period of 11 years.  I will not hold him responsible for the activities of his predecessor in holding up the operation of the original Act for four or five years previous to that.  Is 15 or 16 years a reasonable period, or is three months an unreasonable period? Within what period does the Minister think the intentions of this Bill will be carried out?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps Deputy O'Neill and Deputy O'Donovan will understand when I explain that what I have in mind is that Kilmallock and Ballinascarthy might go over straight away. I do not think there will be any delay. In the Skibbereen area, however, re-organisation is necessary, and that may take some time.  I do not think it will be 11 years.  I think it may take more than one year, maybe two years.  I think two years ought to see it through.  I would not like, however, to put it into a Bill because you do not know what you will be up against.  I do not want to go back on the discussion we had on Second Reading. Deputy Davin referred to groups already there.  I think in each individual case, if Deputy Davin likes to go into it, he will find that there was some reason for the delay.  There are certain of these groups I do not see <Col N="1678" /> any objection to going over to the co-operative societies.  But one of the troubles, of course, is the question of price.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>The primary purpose for which the company was set up was to acquire certain properties, do away with redundancy, reorganise the creamery industry generally and dispose of the creameries to the co-operative societies.  During the first years a good deal of progress was, in fact, made, but during the period the Minister has been in office very little property has been disposed of.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>In fact of that situation, it is not unreasonable for the House to insist that a period should be fixed within which these properties should be disposed of to the co-operative societies.  I think myself that three months is ridiculous.  It is far too short.  Suppose you fix two years, or even three years.  There ought to be a time limit fixed.  This company appears to be very anxious to hang on to these properties indefinitely and no effort is being made to dispose of them to the co-operative societies.  Proposals have been put up by a number of societies without any result.  The demands that have been made by the company have been uneconomic from the point of view of the societies.  How can the Minister or the House hope that the properties in the possession of the company will be disposed of at all if they persist in their attitude of asking an uneconomic price or a price that is not attractive to the societies?</P>
    </Speaker>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is so.  I do not know who will settle that.  On the basis of the milk supply, I do not think the price is excessive asked for some of these groups.  Neither do I think that on the basis of the machinery the price is excessive either.  It would be very hard to insert a time limit here.  I think this whole question might be discussed when the Dairy Disposals Board Bill comes before the Dáil. That would be the best time to discuss it.  Whether we might put in a time limit then or not is a question.  There are arguments against putting a time limit on it.</P>

      <P>I have great respect for the Civil Service.  If they cannot find reasons for delay I would be surprised.  You can, of course, find reasons.  As the Minister just let drop in the course of his statement, when this nebulous Bill which he has in mind comes before us very strong arguments may be used, and will be put forward probably, against fixing any time limit.  In other words, strong arguments will be put forward for allowing the board to be the permanent proprietors of these creameries.</P>

When the Minister stated that the introduction of the Bill for the regularisation of the Dairy Disposals Board would be the proper time to discuss this it struck me that that will be a Bill to allow the Dairy Disposals Board, in contravention of the original purpose, to act as a trading company and to continue for all time to act as a trading company.

      <P>I was afraid that Deputy Davin was about to get on to the banks.  It made me nervous for a moment.  Surely the policy is to hold these and to work them.  I think <Col N="1681" /> the Dairy Disposals Board has been more or less ingenious in finding reasons for not disposing of each and every creamery.  The Minister admits that they have not disposed of any.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  If they have very good reasons for not having disposed of them, what hope is there that within a reasonable time they will ever dispose of any?  The three months limit mentioned by Deputy O'Neill may be altogether too little.  It seems to me it is, but there ought to be some indication that there is a drive away from the recent policy. I think the conditions that have to be satisfied and the requirements of the Dairy Disposals Board that have to be satisfied on the part of any co-operative creamery have become more onerous every six months almost.  Difficulties are piled up between the proposed co-operative purchasers and the Dairy Disposals Board in striking a bargain. I think that is the general impression that is abroad on the part of people who were interested in the original intention of the Dairy Disposals Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that policy is the policy that will be continued, and I think everything which the Minister has said is an indication that it is really the policy and the policy that ultimately will triumph, not the policy of handing them over to the co-operatives.  I gather that there is a certain amount of reasonable complaint on the part of the co-operatives.  Here you have a powerful company owning a large number of these creameries, not keeping a balance sheet for each creamery and, consequently, able to compete in any area at cut prices with the neighbouring creamery.  I have heard that charge made.  That is not fair.  This is a public company subsidised by public funds, run to a certain extent at the expense of public funds, having all these chain stores practically, and using its position, I am told, to undercut existing co-operative societies.  In how many cases that has happened, I cannot say, but surely this is a company run as an ordinary company except that it does not pay any interest <Col N="1682" /> on its capital, or, at least, very little. It has great advantages and it has naturally the tendency to cling on to what it has got.</P>

      <P>I am interested in two creamery premises in Limerick which will come under the provisions of this piece of legislation.  They are the only two proprietary creamery premises in County Limerick.  On this amendment, I would refer to the question of the disposal of these premises after they are taken over, under the provisions of the Bill, by the Dairy Disposals Company.  It may be suggested to the Minister that one or both of these creameries are redundant. Frankly, one is redundant in view of the fact that it is across the road from the co-operative creamery.  In the other case there is no creamery within a reasonable distance, and it would be altogether unfair to the dairy farmers who are supplying milk to the premises that I am speaking of to declare it redundant and close it down.</P>
      <P>I want to sound a note of warning in respect of any proposal of that kind which might be put to the Minister. The creamery I am interested in particularly is that at Castletownconyers, County Limerick.  The rumour has gone abroad already that it is proposed to close that premises when it is acquired by the Dairy Disposals Company. Any proposal of that kind would be very bitterly opposed by the dairy farmers in the area who are concerned. I have a fairly intimate acquaintance with conditions in the area and I think it should be dealt with as proposed in the amendment put down by Deputy O'Neill and the creamery handed over to the co-operative society nearest to it.</P>

How is it that these negotiations were not brought to a successful conclusion?  In other words, will the Minister tell the House what caused negotiations to break down there, if it was not the question of an economic price as far as the society was concerned?  Then there is <Col N="1683" /> the Dicksgrove group in Kerry.  Would the Minister give us the history of the negotiations in those two cases?  The Minister feels a time limit is not necessary. Will he say why it is that the societies there found it impossible to arrive at a price which, from their point of view, was an economic price? What caused negotiations to break down?</P>

      <P>In regard to the accusation that there is reluctance on the part of the company to dispose of groups to the co-operatives, I do not think that that can be borne out, fully at any rate, by the facts.  There were certain units taken over in the last six or seven years&mdash;handed over direct to the co-operatives.  They were not held at all by the Dairy Disposals Board, but passed over.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Some of them, at any rate; I do not know what number.  I am quite sure that, whenever the Bill comes before the Dáil, good arguments can be put up against any time limit, because, for instance, when we set out to organise these areas from Cahirciveen down to Castletown Bere.  I asked for a vote of £40,000, and I said I thought we might lose it.  Nobody contradicted that statement.  There is no doubt that no proprietor or co-operative would have attempted to try to re-organise these areas.  The Dairy Disposals Board went in.  They have reached a paying stage, but they have hardly reached a stage, I think, where a co-operative would like to take them over and be responsible for any price that might be put on them, even if the price were small.  There may be areas &mdash;I do not know&mdash;that will be developed even in years to come that will have to be held by some body as that, so I think it is possible the Dairy Disposals Board, or some such body, will be there for years to come.  I am surprised that Deputy Davin should base the opposition of the Labour Party to this Bill on the fact that the Dairy Disposals Board is holding on to creameries, because, surely, it is the nearest thing to nationalisation &mdash; the ideal of the <Col N="1684" /> Labour Party&mdash;that the Dairy Disposals Board should hold creameries like that on behalf of the State.</P>

So that you have an ideal system of nationalisation and I thought I should have the support of the Labour Party in maintaining it. I am not sure, but I think I prefer co-operation on the whole.  To come down to the point as to why these creameries were not handed over, there is a difference between what the co-operative society in Newmarket is prepared to pay and the price at which the Dairy Disposals Board is prepared to sell.  There is not a big difference between them now.  The board has come down a good deal in its price and the co-operative has gone up a good deal in its price.</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;until compulsion of this kind comes in.  I should like to deal with one other point.  Deputy O'Sullivan said that the Dairy Disposals Company is accused of using its position to pay a good price in places where there is more competition than in others.  I take it that what is meant by a good price is that they will pay a higher price for the milk.  It is a rather strange thing that if you take any of the three last years you will find that the highest price paid by the Dairy Disposals Company was paid in the two groups Cahirciveen and Kenmare where there is certainly no competition. If the Deputy's allegation were right the highest prices would be paid in the Cork groups, but in the Cork groups they paid a much lower price than in those two areas I have mentioned.  As a matter of fact, I think they have pursued a policy, if they are in an area surrounded by cooperatives, of paying whatever price the co-operative pays, so that any fault cannot be found in regard to the price.  Coming back to the amendment proposed by Deputy O'Neill I think it would be impossible to put any time limit on the Dairy Disposals Company's ownership.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to call attention to a question raised last year at the Public Accounts Committee in regard to the taking over of these creameries.  At that time, the accounting officer said: &ldquo;We would have no difficulty in disposing of these creameries <Col N="1686" /> to new societies if we would give them at a low price.  We are inclined to hold out for such price as will recoup the State for the original cost; plus the cost of improvements&mdash; new plant and new buildings&mdash;since they were taken over.&rdquo;  If that is your attitude, that you want a price that will cover compensation, redundancy, etc., you may wait until Doomsday to get it.  If the Government feels from the national point of view that it should improve and reorganise the dairying industry.  I think the State should be prepared to expend some capital and to incur some losses in doing so and it would be good business to do that.  I think that the intention under the original Act was to incur such losses but, according to the accounting officer, the attitude of the disposals company is to look for a price that will recoup all losses and expenditure.  That is unreasonable and that is why you cannot get societies to take over these creameries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That principle is not applied in individual cases.  I think there are 16 groups in all and the aim will be to recoup the State for outlay on the 16 groups, but the principle which the Deputy has mentioned would not apply in individual cases.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>After all if the State develops a particular area and, say, doubles the supply of a particular area, and sells at the total cost, it would be handing over a very good investment to the buyers.  There are three ways in which you can test the value of these creameries.  If you apply any of these three tests you can see whether the buyers are getting good value.  The first is the cost up to date; the second is the milk supply at so much per gallon; and the third, the economic value at which you might sell any business, that is, the balance sheet value.  On any of these tests I think you will find that too much is not being asked.</P>

    <P>(1)  Whenever the Minister makes a sale order in relation to any creamery premises and the chattels thereon, the following provisions shall apply and have effect concerning the workers employed in or about such creamery, that is to say, the sale order shall provide that such workers or any specified workers named therein are entitled to transfer their services to the employment of the company or that such workers or any specified workers named therein are to be regarded as redundant and entitled to compensation for loss of employment in accordance with the provisions of this section.</P>

      <P>Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 are alternative proposals for compensating employees who may become redundant under the Bill. Technically, there can be only one amendment before the Committee at the same time.  However, as the terms of amendment No. 17 are wider than those of amendment No. 16, I suggest that the discussion cover amendments Nos. 16 and 17.  If Deputy Murphy desires a division on No. 17 he may formally move it after amendment No. 16 has been disposed of, and get a decision upon it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move amendment No. 16.  I think there are several precedents for the proposal contained in this amendment.  Under the Road Transport Act, the Shannon Electricity Supply Act, and the Local Government Act, huge sums were paid by way of compensation to redundant employees, and under the 1927 Act relating to this industry compensation to the extent of £53,000 was paid even though no provision was made for that in the Act.  I suggest that provision should be made in this Act so as to ensure that no employee of these concerns will be victimised by any Act of this House. I should like the Minister to give us some information as to what he intends to do in this respect.  The amendment also suggests that the expression &ldquo;suitable employment&rdquo; shall, for the purposes of this sub-section, mean, in the case of a married man, employment within three miles of his usual place of residence.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think that it would be fair to send an old, married man with a family too far from his home for employment. From what I know of the área in West Cork which has been left undeveloped by the Dairy Disposals Company and by the proprietary and co-operative creameries, there is plenty of room for the employment of the men who will be displaced.  There is a huge area to be newly organised and there is a huge area to be re-organised. I think that the Minister should include in the Bill a clause providing for suitable employment for each displaced <Col N="1691" /> employee.  If suitable employment is not obtainable, compensation should be provided.  I know that it is very hard to fix a rate which will compensate a man for loss of employment. If a man cannot get a similar job which he is equally able to do, it is doubtful whether he can be compensated at all for loss of his employment but I think that my proposal of a gratuity equal to one-sixth of his present yearly earnings for each completed year of employment is fair. Under that proposal, consideration could be given to men with long service and men with short service.  It would not be a question of their ages but of their service with the creameries concerned.  The Minister might now give us an indication of what he proposes to do as regards these amendments.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy understands that he may move amendment No. 17, without discussion, when a decision has been reached on amendment No. 16, in order to get a decision. The two amendments are being discussed together.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. T. Murphy Mr. T. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I understand. Amendment No. 17 is a long, comprehensive proposal, but it means something that is exceedingly simple and exceedingly necessary.  It aims at making provision for the employees who will lose their employment in the creameries in which they are now engaged.  These men may or may not get employment in other creameries. If they do not get such employment, they are entitled to some compensation. A number of them have many years of service.  In a number of cases, the employment was well paid.  In the case of some of the concerns which are liable to disappear under this measure, it was practically unheard of for a man to be dismissed.  Son followed father into the same employment and the employment has, generally, been of a very high standard.  I make no apology for saying a word in defence of concerns which paid men well and in the <Col N="1692" /> service of which they were happy and content.  Despite the Minister's sneers regarding the policy of the Labour Party, I shall not be diverted from an expression of that view.  Some of the employees who will lose their employment are in the evening of life, and they will find themselves out on the roadside without any prospect of employment. I have had letters from a number of those concerned, and it would be most regrettable if no provision were made for them.</P>
      <P>The view has just been expressed that there should be no victimisation. Surely we know that there has been victimisation in many matters in the past.  Apart from Acts of Parliament, there has been victimisation of the meanest kind, and there has been political victimisation in many cases.  So far as I can protect the employees concerned, I propose to do it.  My proposal seeks to give the persons concerned some crumbs in the way of compensation in the event of employment not being available for them.  It will not amount to a great deal, but the people concerned are entitled to simple justice.  The number of people who will be affected by this Bill will be 300 in the case of one concern.  Some of them have been in their present employment for 30 or 40 years.  Surely, people in that position are entitled to compensation if they are not reemployed. I should like to have the Minister's view at this stage as to how far he proposes to meet the demand for alternative employment or compensation for these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that the proposals contained in Deputy Murphy's amendment are reasonable and fair in the circumstances.  Some provision should be made for compensation for employees who may be found to be redundant.  Where possible, they should be transferred to other creameries.  Where that is not possible, it is merely a matter of justice to provide some form of security for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree with Deputy O'Sullivan when he said that you can hardly compensate a person for loss of employment.  However, I must admit <Col N="1693" /> that he and Deputy Murphy made a very good attempt to compensate the persons concerned in this case.  The proposals put up are, I shall not say extravagant, but ridiculous.  Under Deputy Murphy's proposition, a man might get the equivalent of ten years' salary down for loss of employment.  I do not think that such provision was ever contained in any Bill brought before the Dáil or any other Parliament. In the proposals before us, we are going altogether too far.  In fact, I think that it would be extremely difficult to deal with this problem by legislation.  Deputies are under a wrong impression if they think that it was dealt with by legislation in 1927. There was no legislation on this question in 1927.  A scale was laid down which was not, in my opinion, adequate.  It was improved by me about 1935, after some years of negotiation with the Minister for Finance. We arrived at a better scale of compensation for those whose cases were still outstanding under the 1927 arrangement.  The best plan, of course, would be to give all these men equivalent employment.</P>
      <P>The problem is not as big as some Deputies would lead the House to believe.  I do not know what the total number of men employed in the affected groups would be but it is easy to make a rough survey of what will happen to the various groups when taken over.  Having made that rough survey, I am satisfied that we shall not have any trouble except in connection with 20 or 25 men and from nine to 11 auxiliary managers.  Our problem is, therefore, very small.  I am very confident&mdash;one can never be sure&mdash;that equivalent employment can be offered to all these men without exception.  However, I may be wrong in that.  Something may miscarry in the calculation. There may be some trouble about the transfer of a particular unit to some &ldquo;co-operative&rdquo; or there may be some breakdown in the negotiations, necessitating a change of policy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That might, in turn, involve some change in what I have in mind with regard to the absorption of these employees. With the best will in the world.  I should find it impossible to <Col N="1694" /> enshrine in a clause in the Bill a guarantee of equivalent employment for the persons concerned because &ldquo;equivalent employment&rdquo; is very difficult to define.  On the whole, I think it would be much better to leave this matter outside the Bill, as it was left outside the 1927 scheme, but with this difference: I am quite prepared to give a much better undertaking than was given at that time.  I have no doubt that Deputy Murphy is right in saying that these men enjoyed good employment during many years and were quite happy in their work.  It is a great misfortune for them that they have to be disturbed.  I have every sympathy with these men and we must treat them as well as possible, but everybody will agree that, if financial compensation on the terms laid down in the amendments were provided, it would be very hard to persuade men who were offered equivalent employment to take it.  They would, naturally, be tempted to claim six years' or ten years' salary down and take their chance of finding a job.  Any man would expect to find as good a job as he has within six years.  At the same time, he would enjoy the cash compensation offered under the amendment. It would be very unwise to offer such huge amounts by way of compensation.  It would lead to discontent on the part of men who took any job and left that huge amount of cash behind.  I do not think that it is possible to have these amendments accepted or included in the Bill but, in lieu of that, I am prepared to give an undertaking publicly that every one of these employees will, in all probability, be put into equivalent employment and that, where equivalent employment is not possible or is not accepted by the persons concerned, then they will get the best compensation that was offered under the 1927 scheme.  I can assure Deputy O'Sullivan and others who referred to Acts dealing with this compensation question that the compensation in this case was far more favourable than the compensation given under any of the Acts mentioned by the Deputies.  That compensation was: one year's salary for men under 50 years; one and a half years' <Col N="1695" /> salary for men between 50 and 60 years and two years' salary for men over 60 years.  That is far short of what is proposed in the amendments here&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  Although it is far short of what is proposed in the amendments before us, it is very much better than that originally given under the 1927 Act.  Under the 1927 arrangement 13 weeks' salary was the compensation given in the beginning, and many of those concerned went out with that compensation.  I am confident that every man can be kept in equivalent employment&mdash;I do not say the same employment.  Deputies will understand that, if you have two creameries side by side, and one is taken over by the other, you cannot make the second manager a central manager, because there is a central manager there already.  However, if equivalent employment is provided, I think that those concerned should be quite satisfied.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. T. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not admit for a moment that the proposals contained in this amendment are ridiculous.  As Deputy Hughes said, they are, on the whole, quite reasonable.  I have some well-defined precedents to guide me. An Act was passed to provide pensions for Ministers.  That Act provided that Ministers be paid pensions at the rate of one-third of their salaries after service of five years.  This proposal is not at all as revolutionary as that. There was no means test in that case&mdash; the kind of thing usually applied in other directions.  The Minister himself has reason to know, from his knowledge of that measure, that it is far more generous to the section with which it deals than is this proposal of mine.  Perhaps, the difference is that I am making this proposal for ordinary working people.  Perhaps it is expected that they should not make claim to anything approaching the treatment regarded as natural and proper to other sections.  If that is the view, I do not accept it.  Under <Col N="1696" /> the Railways Act of 1924, a number of comparatively young people were put out of employment, and have been paid pensions since.  A number of them received as pension half the amount of their retiring salary.  The Minister said that neither in this House nor in any other Parliament were proposals as strange as my proposal introduced.  I refer the Minister to the two instances I have cited.  These Acts were passed by this House, and they are on far more generous lines than the provision contained in my amendment.  I adhere to the proposal contained in my amendment, and I regret that the Minister has given no indication that he has anything to offer these people but a few crumbs.</P>

      <P>In the circumstances in which these men, who have given faithful service, will find themselves, I think that there is nothing extravagant in Deputy Murphy's proposal. Not many of the men will, I think, become redundant: The bulk of them should be absorbed under the new arrangement.  No young people will be involved.  These are all middle-aged employees.  Those of them who will become redundant will, probably, be one or two managers and a few others who will be advanced in years and who would not be able to get alternative employment.  The least that should be given to those people after their years of faithful service would be something such as is embodied in the amendment suggested by Deputy Murphy.  I do not agree with the Minister's proposal at all.  I think it is most unfair.  We do not know what the arbitrator may do, and I think that the Minister should rise to the occasion now, and deal fairly and squarely with people who may lose their employment as a result of the passing of this measure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of the opening remarks of the Minister, I am surprised at the attitude he is now taking. When we were speaking about the necessity for inserting a clause dealing with this matter in the definition section of the Bill, I understood the Minister to indicate that he was prepared to do something in the way of <Col N="1697" /> compensation for persons who might lose their employment as a result of the operation of this Bill, in the same way as has been done, both under this Government and the previous Government, where legislation of this kind was passed through this House.  I know, of course, that the Minister has the best intentions, but I am very sorry that I sat here in this House on a certain occasion and did not protest when the Minister discussed with Deputy Dillon, across the floor of the House, the necessity for inserting a similar clause in the Live Stock Insurance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On that occasion also, I know that the Minister was actuated by the best intentions when he gave an undertaking to Deputy Dillon, which Deputy Dillon accepted, that alternative employment, under equally suitable conditions, would be found for the people concerned in that case.  I now know, and I think the Minister also knows, that that did not happen in that case. As a matter of fact, I know of the case of a very efficient young man, married, and with a family, who lost his employment owing to that measure, and for whom no alternative employment was provided.  That young man is now seeking a permit to be allowed to go across to work in England, simply because what the Minister intended to be carried out at that time was not carried out.  It was the Minister's intention that alternative employment under equally suitable conditions should be provided for such people, or that compensation should be given to them, if suitable employment could not be provided.  As I have said, I am sorry that I sat here and listened to that discussion, because I feel that I, or somebody in the House, either on this side of the House or the other side, should have got up and advocated the insertion of a protective clause of a similar nature to the one we are advocating now.  I am certain that on that occasion the Minister had the best intentions, but he passed over the control of that matter to a body outside this House, with the result that a decent young man, married and with a family, must now seek a permit to go across to work in England&mdash;all <Col N="1698" /> because the people to whom the Minister gave control would not deal with that man's case properly.</P>
    <P>I thought that the Minister would at least accept the principle contained in Deputy Ted O'Sullivan's amendment, with a view to making certain that if people do lose their employment as a result of this measure and cannot get employment under equally suitable conditions, they should get compensation. I appeal to the Minister now to give this matter serious consideration, and I am not saying that in any offensive way, because I know that the Minister has the best intentions.  I know that he means to have the livelihoods of these people protected, and I agree that it is right and proper that they should be provided with suitable alternative employment, but if something happens which we cannot now foresee, as happened in the case to which I have already referred, I think it is necessary that some protective clause-should be inserted in this measure so as to ensure that something in the way of compensation will be provided for these people and their dependants, if suitable employment cannot be provided for them.</P>
    <P>I think that compensation is a reasonable alternative to the failure of the powers-that-be to provide suitable employment.  I think the Minister himself would admit that.  The Minister intends to do a certain thing, and he says that, doubtless, it will be done, but he said the same on a previous occasion, and, as I say, I am sorry that I sat here and listened to him without any protest, because I happen to know of the cases of people who suffered as a result of the Minister's handing over that control to an outside body.</P>
    <P>Whether under the Cosgrave Government or the de Valera Government, whenever the Dáil passed legislation of this kind, providing for the amalgamation of such concerns, it has always been the practice to put in a protective clause so that people who lost their employment, as a result of such legislation, would get compensation, either by way of gratuity or pension, and I hope that the Minister will see his way to <Col N="1699" /> insert some such clause in this measure. If it is possible to provide suitable employment for these people, under equally good conditions, and if, therefore, the necessity for providing compensation does not arise, well and good.  We shall all be glad if that should prove to be the case, but if that should not turn out to be so, then these people should be compensated, and I appeal to the Minister to insert that principle in the Bill.  I do not think the Minister disagrees with the policy enshrined in the amendments proposed by Deputies Murphy and O'Sullivan, and I would appeal to him to put in something of that nature in the Bill so as to ensure that people who may lose their employment as a result of this measure will be provided with equally suitable employment, or else compensated.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. Ted O'Sullivan Mr. Ted O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Ted O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I also am disappointed that the Minister cannot see his way to insert one or other of these clauses in the Bill.  I can quite understand that it might not be possible to provide suitable employment in some cases&mdash;although I believe that in West Cork, at any rate, it would be possible to provide equivalent employment for these people&mdash;but I cannot understand why it should not be possible to provide compensation for such people as may not be able to get suitable equivalent employment.  Of course, I accept the Minister's undertaking, and I am sure that when he gives a public undertaking, such as he has given, he will honour it.  I am fairly certain that suitable equivalent employment can be found for these people, but I would still press on the Minister to accept some provision to deal with the question of compensation, in the event that suitable employment cannot be found for these persons.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to draw the attention of the House to what I feel to be a very grave danger in regard to this matter of reasonable compensation or the provision of suitable employment.  A great deal of stress has been laid upon the provision of equivalent occupation.  Now, there may be a desire on the part of the powers-that-be to retain in employment <Col N="1700" /> people who really are redundant, with the result that the industry concerned may be hampered economically, and become both uneconomic and inefficient. To my mind, there is a grave danger there.  The Dairy Disposals Board, or the creamery company concerned, or even the Minister, may possibly be inclined to keep people in employment because no reasonable compensation can be paid to them.  I think that that would be very bad, and I would much prefer the Minister to make some reasonable compensation available so that, if necessary, the creameries could be cleared out, even to the last man, and that they should not be retaining people who are redundant because there is no compensation for them.  That is the danger we are up against, and if we want efficiency we ought to take care that that does not happen to us.</P>

      <P>In spite of the meaning that he wanted to convey, the two cases mentioned by Deputy Murphy are not exactly parallel.  He did cite, of course, Ministers' pensions.  That has been cited by the Labour Party both inside and outside the Dáil&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;as if they had not approved of them when they were going through.  They may not approve of them now because they have no great hope of ever being Ministers themselves. There is no Minister who gets ten years' salary when he leaves his office.  That is what Deputy Murphy is proposing in his amendment&mdash;ten years' salary down for a man who loses his office; if he has, say, thirty years' employment, and he gets four months for every year, that means he gets ten years' salary.  As I say, I do not think there was ever such compensation offered.  He also mentioned employees who left the Railway.  I should like to know whether those employees were pensionable or not?  In all probability they were.</P>

He belongs to a creamery that will be taking over some of those units.  If I say: &ldquo;So-and-so should get equivalent employment in your creamery&rdquo;&mdash;Deputy Brennan has fears about the man being redundant &mdash;I have not the slightest doubt that if Deputy O'Donovan goes to his committee and says: &ldquo;Give this man ten years' salary and let him off&rdquo; there will be no trouble about getting rid of him.  Deputy O'Donovan wants to be generous at the State's expense; let him be generous at his own committee's expense and give this compensation.</P>

In the case of a man who is over 60 years of age, if I say: &ldquo;Here is equivalent employment,&rdquo; he will say to himself: &ldquo;I have only five or six years to go anyway, and if I find fault with the employment I will get ten years' salary down.&rdquo;</P>

We ought to be reasonable about this matter. Whatever our feelings may be, we have to be reasonable about it.  I think if there is any hope of giving equivalent employment, and especially if there is any hope of getting those men to agree that they are being given equivalent employment, we cannot make the compensation too high; we must keep it at a reasonable level.

      <P>For the information of the Minister, I should like to say this: he appears to have some doubt as to whether or not the persons who got pensions under the Railways Act of 1924 were previously pensionable.  I can quote one case where the Act made it possible for&mdash;I will say obligatory on&mdash;a railway company to give a manager £2,072 a year, and he enjoyed that for 19 years, although he never paid a penny into a superannuation fund.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the Minister will realise that a fair way to fix a gratuity or pension is on the basis of service and not of age?  You can have a man who came into the service at 58 years of age getting a pension on better terms than a fellow who came into the service of the creamery at 25 years of age.  A fair basis for compensation is service and not age.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say to the Deputy that that particular question was threshed out very fully about 1935. At that time we discussed with the men themselves, and with those who spoke for them, the question as to whether the compensation should be graded with regard to service or to age, and in the end it was decided that age was a fair basis.  Taking the human element into it, a man over 60 would find it very hard to get another job; a man between 50 and 60 would find it fairly hard, while a man under 50 would find it less hard, and so it was graded in that way rather than on years of service.  I do not think it makes much difference, because as far as I know&mdash;I have seen an account of a number of those employees&mdash;the two things more or less coincide, that is years of service and age, because they all came in at a reasonable age.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry that I cannot give the Deputy an undertaking on that.  As Deputies know, I am more or <Col N="1704" /> less bound by procedure in those matters.  Unless I could get my colleague, the Minister for Finance, to agree&mdash;which I am afraid would be very difficult, because I do not think I could put up good arguments to him, considering that the compensation granted in this particular case is very much better than that under many of the Acts that were passed dealing with other matters like electricity and so on &mdash;I should not like to promise the Deputy that there would be very much hope of making any improvement.</P>

I really think an undertaking is just as good.  The Deputy said that I may not be here.  That is quite true; but I think the Deputy knows that, even if a different Government comes in, they always honour undertakings given by a previous Minister.  I think the Deputy will admit that any undertakings of that kind given by Ministers of the last Government were honoured by us when we came along.</P>

It is for that reason that I am pressing the Minister to insert a clause.  There is another reason at the back of Deputy Murphy's mind, and at the back of my mind.  We will not be allowed to refer in this House to the activities or the operations of the Dairy Disposals Board, and that is the body that will have to carry out the Minister's promises in this matter.</P>

But I think the Deputy will see that it is much better for the employees to have <Col N="1705" /> a public undertaking rather than have a clause inserted.  I think that with an undertaking you have to be a bit more generous.  Then there is the very point that the Deputy mentioned. Certain things that we do not foresee may turn up, and our clause might not be of any use at all.  I think the undertaking will probably be interpreted to cover unforeseen circumstances, and, on the whole, the undertaking is better.  If the Deputy were satisfied that what I am offering is all right, I would say that he should be more pleased to have an undertaking rather than to have this put into the Bill.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Minister for Finance, the Commissioners of Public Works and the County Councils of Clare and Galway to give effect to the terms of a consent that was arrived at as a result of the settlement of a legal action.  This action was taken by the proprietors of certain lands in the County Clare, who sought compensation for damage done by breaches that occurred in the embankments of the River Fergus between Ennis and Clarecastle.  The consent is printed in the first section of the Bill and was made a rule of court on the 29th October, 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Fergus drainage district is an old drainage district, which was brought to award in 1860.  It comprises about 70 miles of river and different tributaries, and it has been shown that 7,362 acres of land were improved. The control of the district was vested in trustees appointed triennially by the owners of the improved lands.  The duties of the trustees were to keep the district in order and to levy and collect such rate as was needed for the maintenance of the works.  Like many other drainage districts throughout the country, the works in the Fergus drainage district got into a state of disrepair about 1925.  In pursuance of the terms of the Drainage Maintenance Act, 1924, certain improvements and works of restoration were undertaken.  These works were completed in 1928, at a cost of £19,897, of which 25 per cent. was given as a State grant and £3,750 by the Clare County Council.  There was <Col N="1710" /> a balance of £11,172 11s. 3d. to be recovered from the owners of the improved lands under the terms of the Act.</P>
    <P>In 1931, an Order was made transferring the district from the trustees to the County Councils of Clare and Galway.  The county councils, for certain reasons, challenged the validity of the Order.  For the same reasons, an Order which charged lands of the district with the proportion of the cost recoverable from them under the 1924 Act works was not issued.  The reason for this was that about that time breaches occurred in the embankments and the county councils were unwilling to take over the works, claiming that these works had not been finished properly. The Fergus downstream to Ennis is doubly embanked, and these embankments were in existence even before the original drainage scheme was put into operation&mdash;the scheme as we knew it, or as we have any knowledge of it.  These embankments seem always to have given trouble, and breaches have occurred in them and have been repaired by the trustees as they occurred.  These breaches occurred when heavy floods in the Fergus coincided with abnormally high tides. These tides occur at the outfall of the Fergus, usually when there are southwesterly gales.</P>
    <P>In August, 1930, after the works of restoration had been completed, one of these breaches occurred.  As a consequence of this breach, further works were carried out in regard to renovating and strengthening the embankments. The complete cost of this work was £13,600, of which £3,000 was contributed by the County Council of Clare and the balance was defrayed by State funds.  However, in January, 1934, two further breaches occurred under exceptionally severe conditions of flood and tide.  The breaches made at that time threw a new light on the difficulties that had been known hitherto, and showed a previously unknown factor in the problem of river control.  On examination, it was found by various borings that there existed, at a considerable and varying depth under the surface, beds of shell marl and that, under the considerable <Col N="1711" /> weight of water caused by a flood and high tide, this shell marl was penetrated by the water.  This resulted in limiting the strain which the embankments on either side of the river could withstand.</P>
    <P>The reason I mention these things is that we have a new proposal embodied in this Bill, which may seem incongruous&mdash;that is, the abandonment of 300 acres of land which was previously part of the land protected and shown as being in good order.  All the engineers who have discussed the matter feel that a certain safety valve or reservoir for flood waters should be made, so as to control the extra strain that is placed on the embankments during periods of high flood and heavy tide.  There is also a proposal to erect automatic tidal sluices at Clarecastle.</P>
    <P>Provision is made for the latter work only if it can be done without endangering other property.  It is difficult to estimate what effect a barrage of this sort would have in tidal waters, and a good deal of investigation is necessary in order to form an opinion as to what its real effects for good may be.  The position at the moment is that material cannot be secured for the sluices, and it may be that the other works proposed to be carried out may render their erection unnecessary.  However, it is considered necessary that provision should now be made for the possibility of having to put in these tidal sluices, if necessary, when it is possible to secure the material.</P>
    <P>If we turn to the main purpose of the Bill, following the breach in 1924, certain trial borings were made along the river to see what possibility there was of discovering the real difficulties and to try to provide remedial measures.  While these experiments were being made proceedings were instituted and came to court.  The trial judge upheld the validity of the transfer from the trustees to the county council and suggested the possibility, in view of the very heavy costs involved in continuance of the action, that the parties concerned might get together to discuss a possible settlement. <Col N="1712" /> A settlement was finally reached, and is embodied in the consent which is part of the Schedule of the Bill.  The settlement imposed certain obligations on the State and on the county councils, the fulfilment of which is outside their existing powers.  Therefore, we have this Bill. It empowers the County Council of Clare to purchase land which is to be used as a safety valve and reservoir, and enables that county council, and the County Council of Galway to raise £6,000 to meet part of the purchase price of the land as well as the cost of legal proceedings.  It also provides that the State shall provide £2,500 towards the purchase of the land, and undertake further works costing £21,500 for the protection of the embankments as well as a further £10,000 which is to be utilised upstream of Ennis, which needs attention from the maintenance point of view.</P>
    <P>This is a special purposes Bill.  As Deputies are aware, the whole of our existing drainage code has been found unsuitable to present-day conditions, and we are at present engaged in the drafting of a Bill which will deal with the whole question of arterial drainage throughout the country.  Because of that we would not embark on any new drainage activities until legislation has been adopted.  An exception is being made in the case of the Fergus drainage district, so that there shall not be undue delay in honouring the terms of the consent arrived at.  The present measure is confined to taking the powers necessary for that purpose. It may be said&mdash;it is practically certain&mdash;that its terms will be abrogated by the new drainage code, but at this particular time we cannot anticipate.  We must make a start at once by taking such powers within the general framework of the existing code as will permit us to proceed, leaving the general question of drainage, in regard to the drastic alterations recommended by the Drainage Commission, to be dealt with in the comprehensive Bill at present on the stocks.  This Bill is directed completely towards one particular district, and that is to meet the terms of the consent which was <Col N="1713" /> arrived at as a result of the settlement of the legal action.  It has no concern with the general question of drainage.</P>

      <P>This is one of the most difficult Bills I have ever had the pleasure of reading.  I wonder if the Bill is more complicated than the scheduled agreement which I found rather difficult to follow.  A couple of questions have been raised by the Parliamentary Secretary on which, perhaps, he could give me some information. Do I understand from his statement that maintenance was satisfactory up to the year 1925?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not suggest that it was satisfactory.  I said that the embankments gave trouble before we ever heard of them.  All the time we have been hearing of them they have been giving trouble.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I misunderstood the Parliamentary Secretary. I took a note that the embankments have been neglected since 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I would be surprised at that.  I want to point out that many drainage districts have undoubtedly been neglected for ten, 20, 30 or 40 years, and that the State has undertaken, even if it be at the suggestion of a judge, certain commitments in this particular case.  I am glad that it has done so, and I would be glad if it would undertake commitments elsewhere where embankments have been broken down and considerable damage done.  Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary will explain or justify why, even at the suggestion of a judge, the State undertakes responsibility in this case.  It has done so.  I am not complaining.  I am only complaining that the practice is far from universal.  As the Parliamentary Secretary knows, there are many drainage districts in the country badly maintained, and some that were reconditioned under the Drainage Maintenance Act of 1924.  Complaint is made that they are entirely unsatisfactory but the State has to my knowledge taken up the position that once the work is handed over to county councils all its responsibility ceases.  I <Col N="1714" /> welcome a departure from that procedure here, even if it were as a result of consent.  Remember there were two parties to the consent.  The Government must, therefore, have consented to undertake that responsibility. Otherwise, it could not be a rule of court.  When the Parliamentary Secretary's Estimate comes on I may have an opportunity of mentioning many other drainage districts.  He will be familiar with them if he remains much longer in the position.  I can assure him that this is the only case I know of in which the State has undertaken to shoulder responsibility for damage done and undertaken to do certain work.  I admit that it is about time somebody took responsibility.  But the only answers I have ever got in the case of other districts have been that it is not the responsibility of the Board of Works, that it is not the responsibility of the Land Commission&mdash;it is the responsibility of nobody.  But tremendous damage has been done by breaches in banks and the most you can get for that damage is either a minor relief grant&mdash;though that is not easy to apply to this particular purpose of improving embankments or rebuilding them&mdash;or else a few pounds from the Land Commission. I am speaking now of drainage districts long neglected, as the Fergus district was.</P>
      <P>There is one thing that is not quite clear to me.  A certain amount of money was spent on this particular district under the 1924 Act.  On two occasions the State stepped in and spent a considerable amount of money owing to the breaches that occurred. I find no fault whatsoever with the original work.  This sort of accident will occur.  Certain things cannot be foreseen.  So far as I know, there is no blame whatsoever attaching to the engineers.  Very often these things are only discovered as time goes on.  But now, in addition, I gather the State is to expend a sum of £31,000-£21,000 and £10,000.  Is that a free grant?  The Parliamentary Secretary did not make it quite clear that that was a free grant.  Is that £31,000 a charge on anybody?</P>

      <P>Then it is a free grant.  That is a very excellent precedent and I am quite satisfied. I like the Bill from that point of view. The State already under the 1924 Act made a considerable grant.  Did the Parliamentary Secretary say that £19,000 was the original estimate?  I could not gather whether it was £90,000 or £19,000.  I think it was £19,000, judging by the tots.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is machinery.  A great deal of this work will require machinery.  Then there are shovels and spades and labour. Everything has gone up.  Surely the Parliamentary Secretary will not contend that an estimate that was good four years ago is valid at present for the same amount of work?  A sum has been mentioned in the scheduled agreement&mdash;that is the awkward thing&mdash;but the essential thing is the work.  You agreed to do a certain amount of work and it seems to me you will have to increase the estimate.  It is quite obvious that this estimate is out of date.  The Parliamentary Secretary will understand that I am not criticising him or indeed anybody in particular, <Col N="1717" /> but all that delay means increased expense.  That is another statement that can be generalised.  In the case of these drainage districts where a considerable amount of damage is being done, where, particularly, breaches of banks take place, every year that passes by adds to the amount of damage that has to be repaired and adds to the cost of the repairs.  So far as the Bill itself is concerned, the only thing I would say is that I am afraid it is a bit belated.  I am not therefore holding it up&mdash;I should like to expedite it.  I gather that there is no indication that even now work can be done on it; that, particularly so far as the sluices go, they are ruled out at present.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary did not make this clear, at least not to my mind: what is the relation between the sluice portion of the solution and the further work which he mentions?  Are they independent one of the other?  I thought they were part and parcel of the one scheme until I heard one portion of his statement&mdash;that it is possible that certain work may be rendered unnecessary by the other work.  Is it that the other work may render the sluices unnecessary?  Is there any reason why the other work could not be undertaken once the Bill passes?</P>

      <P>I am glad that at least some work is to be undertaken even if it is imposed, so to speak, by the court.  It is not altogether imposed by the court, because the Government consented.  I must always point out that the Government gave consent to this.  I am glad that work of this kind is being done and I can only regret that other work which is equally urgent, in places specifically picked <Col N="1718" /> out by the Drainage Commission, is not being carried out.  The Parliamentary Secretary may not be long enough in the Board of Works fully to have studied the Report of the Drainage Commission.  I commend it to his study, especially where it refers to two particular works that are urgent.  One of them is the Brick and Cashen and the other is the Brosna.  There is hardly any preparatory work being done in them.  I get the same answer every year in regard to them, that things are as they were.  May I point out to the Parliamentary Secretary the many excellent precedents that this Bill provides and the various commitments, by implication, that it provides? It is not so much for the Bill itself but for the implications it contains that I welcome it.</P>

      <P>I was particularly struck by the terms of this Bill, in present circumstances.  The Parliamentary Secretary's statement makes one still more suspicious because he emphasises the fact that the provisions in this Bill are particular to this drainage scheme and may be subordinated to the Bill at present being drafted dealing with drainage generally throughout the country.  This scheme is taken out of the general scheme and brought before us as a particular and exceptional work to be carried out as distinct from the provisions of the Bill which the Parliamentary Secretary tells us is in draft.  There are other things that arouse one's suspicion. Apparently, it was recommended that sluices would be essential in carrying out this work.  That would appear obvious, even to a non-engineer like myself.  But one's suspicions are aroused by the fact that because sluices are unprocurable, 300 acres of land are to be converted into a lake.  Seeing this report has been in existence for four years, and that four years ago materials for making sluices were available, I am anxious to know why there is such urgency about this now, on the eve of a general election.  It is rather an extraordinary thing.  I am deeply concerned about certain works in my own constituency.  Some three months ago, when the Minister for Agriculture visited my constituency, <Col N="1719" /> we particularly urged on him the necessity for a small temporary relief work of, say, £300.  That was to receive attention but, so far, there is no word about it.  £300 would have done a considerable amount in the particular matter, the urgency of which was undisputed.  Some thousands of acres of the best arable land in East Donegal were affected and made unworkable. Last year, thousands of pounds worth of good crops were lost.  Of course, that work was for Donegal, and there is no Minister or Parliamentary Secretary representing that constituency.  Even though a general election is pending, this Bill may be perfectly <i>bona fide,</i> perfectly honest.  It may be urgent.</P>
      <P>But one is very curious to know why this work is taken out of the general Report of the Drainage Commission and made the subject of a special Bill to be rushed through here at a time when the Parliamentary Secretary tells us a Bill to deal with the general question of arterial drainage is in draft, the provisions of which may override certain provisions in this Bill. One is particularly struck&mdash;apparently Deputy Professor O'Sullivan was also struck&mdash;by the fact that no charge is to be made on the riparian owners who will benefit by improvements to the land upstream.  One does not like to probe too far.  One does not like to stick the knife too deeply into the wound, but I think one would be wanting in his duty, not discharging the trust upon him, if, in all the circumstances surrounding this Bill, he failed to direct attention to these matters, seeing that there are hundreds of works equally clamant for attention to which no attention has been paid.</P>

      <P>This is quite an exceptional case, and the history of it goes back quite a while.  This Bill is to implement a decision of the High</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1720" /> Court.  It is four years overdue, the delay being due to engineering difficulties. The Board of Works had been carrying out certain engineering works in preparation for this Bill, spread over a period of years.  This work could not have been rushed, and hence the delay in bringing forward the Bill.</P>
    <P>With regard to the moneys that are to be expended in the upper reaches of the Fergus, I would like to point out, having local knowledge of what the situation is there, that a similar action might possibly have to be faced in the immediate future if the decision of the courts was not implemented. There are other lands in the upper reaches of the Fergus, above the town of Ennis, also liable to flooding.</P>
    <P>It was felt that if effect were not given to the decision of the courts the farmers concerned whose lands were flooded would have an equal claim with those whose lands were affected by the tidal waters of the River Fergus.  I merely wish to point out these facts and to repudiate the suggestion that the reason for the introduction of this Bill is that there is to be a general election in the near future.  I can assure Deputies opposite that neither the Taoiseach nor the other Deputies on these benches who represent Clare have the slightest need of any such aids to secure their return at the general election and to repeat what they did at the last election&mdash;take the first three seats in a row and leave the Opposition fighting for the last two.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is hardly any necessity to make this an election issue.  We are all very pleased to see this Bill brought forward.  As a matter of fact, I had been urging something of this nature for years and years on the former Parliamentary Secretary, the late lamented Deputy Flinn, with regard to the River Suck which is in a similar condition, but I could get no assurance beyond the fact that there was a drainage commission set up, that they were considering the whole matter and that no steps whatever could be taken until a decision had been come to on the recommendations made by the Drainage Commission.  I am very glad to see, as my colleagues <Col N="1721" /> Deputy McMenamin and Deputy O'Sullivan have stated, that at least one work is being singled out and that a breach has been made not alone on the banks of the Fergus but as regards all drainage districts that need attention all over the country.</P>
      <P>There is one point about this Bill which strikes me particularly.  I am not an engineer; I am an ordinary layman, but I do not think it creditable at this hour of the day that we should have to flood 300 acres of land in order to relieve the situation.  We have been reading of drainage in other countries, of the feats that have been performed in Italy and other places, and of how engineering science has succeeded in doing things that nobody would have dreamt of some years ago. The Parliamentary Secretary did not give us the real history of the Fergus River or did not tell us whether it has been conducting itself for the last two or three hundred years as it has been for the last five or six years.  I do not know what is the quality of the land which it is proposed to flood, but apparently it was of some use; it may have been good meadow land or good fallow land, but apparently we are going to flood 300 acres and at this hour it really does not look well. I am afraid the fact that we have to do it is not a tribute to our engineering profession.  It ought to be possible to do better than that but if that is inevitable, one would have expected a little more history from the Parliamentary Secretary with regard to the bursting of the banks.  We could have some history to show that it was an ill-conducted river for generations past.  We have been given only a few instances of what occurred quite recently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to see other districts treated as generously but I do not think we can afford to do it.  Some lands, as was pointed out, will undoubtedly be benefited, but we have already written off some £10,000 or £11,000 in this district.  I do not want to deprive these people of that amount but we have been very generous to them.  What is worrying me is what I shall say when I go back to Roscommon and when it is pointed out to <Col N="1722" /> me that the county council in Roscommon is collecting a charge of this sort in respect of the River Suck from people whose lands have been equally flooded.  A certain amount has been written off in this case and I shall be asked why I do not get a similar amount written off for the people of Roscommon.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether the Parliamentary Secretary can give us any inkling as to why we are rushing this Bill through apart from its virtues as an election bribe.  I am not alleging of course that it is a bribe.  Apart from that, we have a peculiar provision in Section 11, and I wonder if the people who signed a consent to this Bill ever signed a consent to Section 11 which says:</P>
    <P>No action or other proceeding shall lie nor shall any damages be recoverable in any court against the councils, jointly or severally, the commissioners or the trustees of the Fergus district in respect of anything done or omitted to be done by them or any of them in relation to the Fergus district at any time (whether before or after the passing of this Act) before the date of the charging order under this Act.</P>
    <P>The people who have signed a consent to this Bill feel that they are entitled to some consideration but they have given a kind of blank cheque here, and I hope you will not disappoint them. We shall be anxiously looking forward to the operation of the Fergus Drainage Bill when it becomes an Act.  I hope it will be a success and that it will be followed by similar Acts, that operations in other districts will not be hung up to await the implementation of the report of the Drainage Commission which I am afraid is still a long way off.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>It appears to be extraordinary that no defence was made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the charge that this particular river is being lifted out of the general scheme recommended by the Drainage Commission, for the implementation of which we have been waiting for such a long time.  Why preferential treatment <Col N="1723" /> has been given to this particular river I cannot understand.  We are all agreed that drainage is an acute problem in many counties, that a national scheme is an urgent problem and a pressing necessity for the whole country, that in fact if we are going to increase the general productivity of the land, one of the prerequisites to that general improvement is drainage. That must be the basis of whatever improvement is to be effected generally in the country in the way of increased fertility.  There is no doubt that there are thousands and thousands of acres of good arable land in a water logged condition, flooded during the greater portion of the winter, which could be brought into a useful productive condition if the drainage were attended to. The Parliamentary Secretary says that there is a Bill in draft at the present time dealing with national drainage, and I cannot for the life of me see why this particular locality has got preferential treatment above all others.  Why should we not wait for a couple of months or for whatever period will elapse until that other Bill envisaged by the Parliamentary Secretary is introduced and let that Bill cover all national schemes?  If the Government saw fit to concentrate on this particular river first one could understand it, but why they give it their special attention and special consideration in a Bill of this sort is beyond my comprehension. I do not think the Parliamentary Secretary has attempted to explain it.  The proposal to flood 300 acres appears to me extraordinary.  I do not know what the quality of land is, but if it is any kind of fair land, considering the land hunger that exists in this country, why should we throw away 300 acres for a period of years, no matter how short that period may be?</P>

      <P>For ever.  Anyhow, it is an engineering problem, but when we consider the results achieved by drainage experts in other countries, where there were problems of levels and so on to be tackled and solved, it is an extraordinary state of <Col N="1724" /> affairs if the drainage of a river of this kind cannot be solved without sacrificing 300 acres of what may be very useful land.  It is not very creditable to the engineering staff if they cannot drain this river without asking us to sacrifice 300 acres of land which would carry at least half a dozen families in very good circumstances. I should like to hear some explanation from the Parliamentary Secretary of that engineering aspect of the matter.</P>

      <P>They are absolutely annoyed and they suggest that there is some ulterior motive or secret idea at the back of somebody's mind.  It just &ldquo;gets their goat&rdquo; at the moment. Deputy O'Sullivan, in particular, is most annoyed and Opposition Deputies would lead us to believe that something of an underground nature was happening, when it is quite obvious to any Deputy reading the Bill and not knowing County Clare or anything about it that the purpose of the Bill is to implement a decision of the court.  The County Council of Clare were in an awkward position a few years ago, owing to somebody's neglect.  Whether it was their own neglect or the neglect of the Board of Works, we are not concerned with.  It does not concern us now as the court decided all that matter.</P>

      <P>The court gave its decision long ago, whether it was a consent or not, and this Bill is to implement that decision.  Whether it was agreed or otherwise does not matter.  The Bill follows fairly closely in many respects the lines of the Drainage Commission Report.  The Drainage Commission recommended that the State should provide about £6,000,000 for capital works.  This Bill provides a certain amount, and there is no objection to that.  I am interested in the Drainage Commission Report, and in the major Bill.  I hope that Bill will soon come along because certain parts of my constituency are crying out for it.  I only wish the Government would introduce the Bill in the morning, and put it into operation.</P>

There is only one thing about which I want to ask the Parliamentary Secretary for information.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Allen</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad of that, because I think the idea underlying the Drainage Commission Report was that the State would bear the capital expenditure and that no portion would be charged to the lands benefited or to the local ratepayers.  If that is the principle in the Bill and if the major Bill is to follow on these lines, I think it a good and sound policy.</P>

      <P>This is not at all a matter for laughter.  I assure Deputies on the Front Opposition Bench that it is a matter which concerns 14 land holders in Clare very seriously. What Deputies in addressing themselves to this Bill overlook entirely is that 14 plaintiffs brought the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the Clare County Council into the courts.  If other persons in their constituencies consider that they are injured in the manner in which these 14 plaintiffs were injured, the courts are open to them, too.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>I assume that if the constituents of the Deputies had an equally sound case, they would have long since brought the matter into court.  Fourteen plaintiffs, as I say, instituted a case and brought the Minister for Local Government, the Minister for Finance and the Clare County Council into the court.  The case came before the court on 24th January, 1939, and, after a hearing of more than a week, the court decided that it was a matter for the plaintiffs and the defendants to consult around the table rather than in court as to the liability of the plaintiffs, on the one side and the defendants, on the other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who are arraigned as defendants in court do not usually agree to go into conference, unless they are satisfied that the case against them is sufficiently strong, and I assume that <Col N="1727" /> the Minister for Local Government and the Minister for Finance would not have agreed to a conference, were it not that they believed that these 14 plaintiffs had a substantial case against them and the county council. These are the facts which Deputies on the opposite side seem to disregard.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>Not at all; we do not disregard them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterJosephOLoghlen" hpid="Mr. O'Loghlen Mr. O'Loghlen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>Oh, yes, you do. Then they complain that this work was not begun immediately following the decision of the court.  The case was before the court on 24th January, 1939. The consent was not brought before the court for ratification until 29th October, 1941, when it was made a rule of court.  That is less than two years ago.  October, 1943, would be two years, so that it is only about 17 months.  There was no undue delay on the part of the Office of Public Works or the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs were pressing to get this agreement made a rule of court.  A measure of this kind took some time to complete so as to formulate the agreement in accordance with the direction of the judge.  The matter could not have been rushed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was an obligation placed on the respective Departments and the county council apart and distinct from the national drainage Bill.  There was no decision to introduce a national drainage Bill when the case came before the court, and it was an obligation accepted by the Departments and by the county council entirely separate and distinct from the national drainage Bill.  It was an obligation which had to be discharged and this obligation is being discharged by the Government Departments and by the county councils concerned entirely irrespective and distinct from the national drainage Bill.  They were obliged, since the matter was brought into court and made a rule of court, to discharge that obligation.  Where is the purpose in asking: &ldquo;Why not have kept this Bill back until a Bill for a national scheme of drainage came to be introduced?&rdquo; There is no purpose in that.  It was also asked why this measure was <Col N="1728" /> peculiar to Clare.  Those who criticised the measure forgot that, as regards the previous improvement to the Fergus drainage district, the county council refused to take over the work, subsequent to its completion by the Board of Works, on the advice of their county surveyor.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>We refused to take over the Suck scheme, too, but it was pushed over on us.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PeterJosephOLoghlen" hpid="Mr. O'Loghlen Mr. O'Loghlen">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>In this case, the surveyor advised the county council that the work was not properly completed and recommended the county council not to take it over.  The liability remained as between the Office of Public Works and the county council.  An agreement was arrived at whereby the Fergus drainage district was to be improved as the Bill sets out&mdash;to be &ldquo;repaired and maintained&rdquo;. That is simply fulfilling the obligation which the Office of Public Works and the County Councils of Clare and Galway took on their shoulders.  This measure is due to the farmers in the district whose land was injured.  Their lands were being continually flooded owing to the break-down of the banks of the river.  They brought a case to court.  If that case had been prosecuted, on the advice of counsel on both sides they would have succeeded against somebody.  The responsibility was accepted to make good the injury inflicted on these people by the break-down of the banks.</P>
      <P>There has been criticism as regards the question of the flooding of the land. Five engineers have reported on that and it cannot be asserted that they are all engineers of the Clare County Council.  They included engineers of the Office of Public Works, of the County Councils of Clare and Galway, and an independent engineer.  Those who say that these engineers are wrong should have some engineering qualifications if their assertion is to carry weight.  One would gather from certain comments made by Deputy O'Sullivan that the idea of introducing sluices was thought of subsequent to the preparation of the Bill.</P>

      <P>A serious question arises, whether the erection of the sluices would not do damage to adjoining land.  It is only by experiment it can be discovered whether that damage would arise or not.  It is only when the engineers are satisfied that no damage can arise from the erection of the sluices that they will be erected.  The question of procuring the sluices is a secondary matter.  It is simply to confuse the matter to urge that the works now proposed are as a substitution for the sluices and were thought of because the sluices could not be procured.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Loghlen</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I gathered.  The records will show whether that was said or not.  The sluices were provided for in the original scheme but the possibility of their doing damage can only be ascertained after trial.  I assume that, if there is any danger of the adjoining lands being injured, the sluices will not be erected.  Ninety per cent. of this work will not require the introduction of machinery and, therefore, the added costs of which some Deputies have spoken cannot arise.  A high percentage of this work must be carried out by manual labour and no enormously increased cost can arise as between the date of the consent in 1941 and to-day&mdash;less than two years subsequently.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I welcome this Bill and I am satisfied that it has arisen entirely because 14 plaintiffs went into court, satisfied that they would obtain compensation. The obligation then assumed is being discharged and justice is being extended to the men whose property was injured, while the property of others will be protected against similar damage in the future.  There is no other purpose behind the Bill.  There is no other motive in introducing the Bill than that of doing justice to those <Col N="1730" /> people whose property was injured. Those who seek to attribute to the introduction of the measure any other motive are not expressing themselves truthfully.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMoylan" hpid="Mr. Moylan Mr. Moylan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Moylan</NameTxt>
      <P>To me, this seems to be a very simple matter.  I am surprised at the high tidal flow of oratory which it has called forth.  If such a high tide and heavy flood had hit the Fergus, I am afraid that there would not be any embankment left. Deputy O'Loghlen has given a complete answer to the critics of the measure, and I cannot say much to augment his statement.  I disagree with him on one point.  I do not grudge the Opposition their enjoyment. If legislators can get any little enjoyment out of a Bill, I think they are entitled to it; life is dull enough. There has been no serious criticism of the Bill.  Deputy O'Sullivan praised the Bill with faint &ldquo;damns&rdquo; in his suave, southern fashion.  Deputy McMenamin's &ldquo;damns&rdquo; were not so faint.  He said that the Bill made him more suspicious than ever.  I think that he has a naturally suspicious mind.  Perhaps it is because I did not quite understand his accent that I have not got a note of the points he made.  He did insinuate that this drainage Bill was part of the proposed national drainage Bill.  It is not.  It is very definitely a Bill drafted to meet a particular condition that arose out of a legal action, and the State is bound, in all conscience, to meet that. I know, of course, that in Kerry there are many difficulties about rivers. Many of the rivers in Kerry are regarded as very bad neighbours.  We, on this side of the House, if there is to be an election, do not need any adventitious aids of this sort.  I think it will be found, when the election comes, that we will be &ldquo;first in the hearts of our countrymen.&rdquo;  Of course, this question of drainage in Kerry might prove to be a help in the coming election to Deputy O'Sullivan, but I am afraid he is past all help.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one rather serious thing about this matter.  I am rather surprised at Deputy O'Sullivan's attitude as to throwing the whole cost of drainage on the State rather than <Col N="1731" /> having a reasonable ratio of costs as between the State and the local authorities.  It seems to me that he seeks something in the nature of painless financial extraction, so far as the people of Kerry are concerned. I think, however, that the local people should meet a little of their own bills.  This Bill is drafted to meet certain responsibilities which the State could not avoid.  There has been no delay that could have been avoided in connection with this Bill.  From the time the matter was first examined and the report on it came in, until the Bill was drafted, there has been no real delay.  One criticism was made by Deputy Hughes with regard to the abandonment of 300 acres of land. People are inclined to expect rather too much from drainage.  I once heard my predecessor in office say that if we are to have successful drainage, it must begin at the sea, and that is the reason for the main Drainage Bill.  I must say that I did not realise, as has been alleged, that the country around the Fergus was so waterlogged. However, as to the Fergus, there is a condition there that seems to be incurable, and even though it may seem to be drastic to abandon 300 acres of land, yet, when all the engineers, surveyors, and experts generally, are agreed that it is necessary, I think that we must agree to do so.  As Deputy O'Sullivan himself pointed out, there has been very little criticism of this Bill, except, as has been said, by way of a joke.  Deputy Brennan, naturally, is interested in the River Suck, and all I can say is that we will get round to it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>On the Order Paper to-day, the following question, in my name, appeared:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he has recently made an appointment at Mallow, County Cork, of a manager of the local employment exchange; whether he will state whether, before the making of the appointment, the vacancy was advertised or otherwise announced; the number of applications received, and the method followed for selecting a suitable candidate; whether an interview board was constituted, and, if so, whether the person placed first by the board was appointed; whether he will state the grounds on which he declined to appoint the young lady who had been administering the office, on behalf of the then manager, for a period of ten years; whether he will state the name, experience and the qualifications of the person appointed to the post and the grounds on which the appointment was made.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The Parliamentary Secretary replied as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A part-time branch manager has recently been appointed to the Branch Employment Office, Mallow. The vacancy was advertised in the local Press and by posters exhibited in the branch office area.  Applications were received from 26 persons, but eight of these subsequently withdrew. A board was appointed to interview the candidates and report on the suitability of each for the appointment. From among those considered suitable, Mr. Martin Kelly McGrath, of Banteer, appeared to be the best qualified for the post, and he was appointed.</P>
      <P>I do not consider it in the public interest to disclose the placings of candidates by the interviewing board or the grounds upon which one candidate rather than another was considered best qualified for appointment.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1734" /> Now, I should like to say at the outset that this phrase, &ldquo;in the public interest&rdquo;, has become a sort of parrot cry in this House whenever it is necessary for Ministers to shirk explanations. It has been used very frequently, and, I suggest, it has been abused very frequently.  I think I will be able to convince the House that that phrase has been abused here this afternoon.  It was employed here this afternoon to hide a transaction that was neither creditable nor honourable.</P>
    <P>Mallow is a very important and historic town, a town that produced very many great men, a town of hallowed memories, a town of unsullied patriotism so far as very many of its prominent citizens are concerned.  On this occasion it is coupled with what I regard as a very discreditable transaction, a transaction in which all claims to service, to experience, to merit, every consideration that should guide the authorities in the making of an appointment of this kind, were flung to the winds; a transaction in which political favouritism and political racketeering were carried perhaps even further than they have been carried in the last few years, and that is far enough, because we do know&mdash; there is no secret about this fact&mdash;that in appointments of this kind the policy which has guided the present Government is that the spoils should go to the victors.  That is the pure and unadulterated truth.  In spite of that pious rectitude with which the Taoiseach surrounds himself occasionally, and in spite of the platitudes we have heard about the Constitution and equality of liberties, there is not a thought or a word about principles of that kind when it comes to sharing the spoils.  Perhaps I should not say &ldquo;sharing the spoils&rdquo;, because they are not shared; they are kept well within the Party fold on every occasion when they come to be apportioned.</P>
    <P>The story of this appointment in Mallow is a simple enough one.  In the town of Mallow, in charge of the branch employment exchange, there was a manager who had attained a <Col N="1735" /> venerable age.  For a number of years he had been assisted by a lady who acted as his deputy, and who had really been for that number of years &mdash;ten years, I think&mdash;actually managing the exchange.  I have not the least idea as to whether or not that lady has any political affiliations.  I know nothing about her views on questions of that kind.  But I am reliably informed, and I assert here, that she was the best qualified person for this post. I make the further assertion that the person who was placed first by the interview board set up to examine the qualifications of the candidates was not appointed.  I suggest to the Parliamentary Secretary that that is the reason why it was considered necessary to employ here this afternoon the parrot cry that it was not in the public interest to disclose either the qualifications of the candidates or their placings by the interview board.  I suggest further that the person appointed was appointed purely because of political reasons, because of political claims, because he was the principal adherent in that constituency of the Parliamentary Secretary who made the appointment.  I repeat that the qualifications of the person who had been virtually in charge of the employment exchange for a number of years were bound to rank extremely high.  In fact, I have testimony, which I will produce to the House at a later stage, to show that that is so.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that the story of what happened in Mallow is the story of what happened in Newmarket, and the story of what happened in Bantry recently, where a young lad who was fully qualified, having passed the matriculation and leaving certificate examinations, was turned down for a post in the labour exchange, while the appointment was given to a political adherent of the Party in power, who had none of those qualifications.  The Parliamentary Secretary knows the position in Newmarket, but if there is any desire for further illumination on that point I am prepared to give it. If we had here&mdash;perhaps we will have &mdash;a definite avowal that all appointments of this kind will automatically <Col N="1736" /> go to supporters and adherents of the present Government, then we would know exactly where we were.  If that is definitely stated here in this House, we will know exactly where we stand.  If, on the other hand, we have a continuation of this farcical procedure under which the Department sets up an interview board, invites applications, and, as in this case, induces a number of people to apply, I think the whole position is ridiculous having regard to the fact that the appointment is made in advance.  Why not refer them to the executive of the Fianna Fáil organisation in the constituency, and let them make the selection?  In this case, the secretary of the Fianna Fáil organisation in the constituency was appointed, and I suggest that that was his main claim to the appointment.  I am borne out in that view by a letter written by the Parliamentary Secretary from his office on 21st January, 1943.  Deputy Moylan, writing to Mr. Gilligan on that date, committed himself to the delightfully frank views of which I am about to put the House in possession.  The letter reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Mr. Gilligan,</P>
    <P>I have your letter and a number of others in relation to Miss Nan Gilligan's application for the position vacant at Mallow.  The appointee shall, in the first instance, be certified as competent and suitable for the position by the interview board. I believe Miss Gilligan will fulfil that condition.  From the list certified as competent, I shall appoint the person best suited to the position from a political viewpoint.  No matter what decision I make I am bound to offend a number of people, but I intend myself to make the appointment.  I could not agree to delegate authority to do so to anybody else.</P>
    <P Just="Right">Yours very sincerely,</P>
    <P Just="Right">SEÁN MOYLAN.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The letter was addressed: &ldquo;Mr. J. Gilligan, 4 Chapel Street, Tullamore, Offaly.&rdquo;  A further letter to Miss Nan Gilligan, 72 Main Street, Mallow, written on 16th February, 1943, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I regret that in making the appointment in Mallow I have had to <Col N="1737" /> regard the claims of another applicant as being more urgent than yours.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the whole story.  I would be satisfied if that viewpoint were expressed officially and laid down as a principle, because it would save all this trouble about applications, and we would all be quite clear as to the position.  In fact, in this particular case the eight candidates who withdrew were keen, intelligent people, because apparently they realised that with Mr. McGrath in the field they had not a chance, and they did not desire to participate in the farce any further.  But Miss Gilligan, relying on her merits, relying on her experience, relying on her knowledge of the work she was offering to undertake, continued in this forlorn fight, with the result of which the House is aware.</P>
    <P>There is a system in America whereby, when a Government comes into power, all the offices within the gift of that Government go to their friends.  That creates a situation that is quite well understood in America and, when a change of Government comes about there, all the persons expecting positions of any kind know that their time has arrived.  It has not been admitted, here, even though there have been many indications that things of that type have taken place, that that is the principle on which appointments are made.  Although I am aware what a frank person the Parliamentary Secretary is&mdash;he is rather unconventional in many ways&mdash; I thought that his letter on this occasion was an unusually frank one.  I think it is right that the House should be informed that, so far as the Parliamentary Secretary who made this appointment is concerned, there are no longer any illusions about the manner in which appointments of this kind have been, or are likely to be, made.</P>
    <P>I decided to bring this matter forward, not that I have any hope that what has happened in Mallow is going to be changed in any way by anything that I say, and not that I have any hope that the Government will admit anything in the way of political corruption in relation to the appointment, <Col N="1738" /> or that they will be inclined to change, in the evening of their existence as a Government, and will treat the country to anything like a death-bed repentance. All the indications are that the sands are running out for the Government. I am sure they have quite a number of people to provide for still, so it is probably too much to hope that there will be any change in their attitude.</P>
    <P>I regard transactions of this kind as truly discreditable.  So long as there is any pretence at having an interview board and there is any system of competitive examination in vogue, I regard it as discreditable that appointments should be made in this way.  If the pretence of approaching the filling of vacancies of this kind in a fair and impartial manner is completely abandoned, there is no more to be said about the matter, but, so long as that attitude is maintained, surely the views of the interview board, and their recommendations as to the general suitability of candidates, ought to be the factors that count?  I suggest they did not count on this occasion.  I repeat that the person placed first by the interview board was not appointed. I repeat that the persons best qualified for the post were not considered and that the appointment was made purely on a political basis.</P>
    <P>This is an example of what has happened in many other respects.  We are aware that Ministers have gone so far as to interfere in the appointment of auxiliary postmen in the country.  That has frequently occurred, and ministerial meddling in appointments of this character has become the accepted order rather than the exception for a number of years past.  I challenge a policy of that kind and I ask the people who came into this House on the high-sounding slogan that Fianna Fáil was out to abolish past dissensions, and who treated us to a number of high-sounding catch-cries of that type, to justify a policy of that kind, to explain why the manager of this office in Mallow should be appointed for political considerations only, and to say whether that is their conception of democratic government and impartial administration.</P>

      <P>It is a pity that the Deputy, when he went to the trouble of preparing his brief, did not go more thoroughly into the matter.  He has made the statement that the young lady who acted as deputy for the former manager of the employment exchange for ten years had been turned down.  The young lady who acted as the former manager's deputy did not apply for the position at all, good, bad or indifferent.  The case Deputy Murphy is making concerns, I presume, another young lady, who was employed in a clerical capacity in that office.</P>
      <P>But even Deputy Murphy, notwithstanding all the allegations he has made, has not stated that the person who was appointed was not fully qualified.  The Deputy has gone out of his way to try to make political capital out of the appointment.  The gentleman who was appointed was in every way qualified to carry out the duties of the office.  I have examined the file very carefully, and I have looked up this man's qualifications and record in previous employment, and, in addition, I might add that he is a man who served his country in time of need.  Because of that consideration, I think men of his type are entitled to a preference, all other things being equal.  I stand over the appointment made by my predecessor; it is an appointment that I would be proud to make.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1740" /> Deputy Murphy makes great play about the constitution of the board. The board is constituted for the purpose of examining candidates in order to ascertain their qualifications, and the recommendations of the board have to be borne in mind when the appointment is being made.  That was the procedure in this instance and my predecessor determined&mdash;and I agree with his decision&mdash;that the person concerned, Mr. McGrath, was the best qualified and the most suitable person, and I do not think that I or my predecessor should have any apology to make to anybody for what was done. I stand over the appointment.  If the papers had been submitted to me, without knowing any of the parties and merely going through their files, I would have acted exactly as my predecessor did.</P>
