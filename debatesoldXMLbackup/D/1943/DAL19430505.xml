    <P>The figures given in respect of unestablished staffs do not include (a) persons employed on relief schemes, (b) persons employed on a fee basis, and (c) artisans, labourers, etc., employed on schemes or works of a temporary nature, other than relief schemes, who are not regarded strictly as civil servants.</P>
    <P>In order to make the figures given above for 1st January, 1932, comparable with those for 1st January, 1942, a total of 792 persons, some of whom were employed on a taskwork, piecework, or fee basis and some of whom were employed on works of a temporary nature, are not included in the particulars for 1st January, 1932.</P>
    <P>The annual cost as at 1st January, 1942, includes the cost of the increase in cost-of-living bonus granted as from 1st January, 1940, when the Civil Service cost-of-living figure rose from 75 to 85.  The annual cost of this increase is approximately £200,000.  Civil Service cost-of-living bonus was stabilised at the figure of 85 as from 1st July, 1940, and no further increase in bonus was given until the 1st June, 1942, when certain limited increases were granted under the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) (Amendment) Regulations, 1942.  On the 1st January, 1943, emergency bonus increases, inclusive of the increases granted in June, 1942, were granted to civil servants generally, whether their salaries had previously included a variable cost-of-living bonus or not, by the Civil Service (Emergency Bonus) Regulations, 1943.  The annual cost of these increases, which is not, of course, included in the figure of annual cost as at 1st January, 1942, is estimated to be approximately £300,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>In July, 1942, the price of fancy bread was controlled following on complaints received by my Department that excessive prices were being charged by bakers for such bread.

    <P>The prices per ton shown in above statement are those applicable at the close of the periods referred to.  The actual cost cannot be determined until the full tonnage of turf produced is ascertained by actual disposal.

      <P>The Deputy will appreciate, so far as my Department is concerned, the view must be that county councils undertaking turf production are responsible in the first place for meeting their own fuel needs and those of institutions under their control.  It is natural that Dublin County Council should look to the County Dublin bogs for producing its requirements.  At the same time, it is desirable that private persons who wish to engage in turf production should be accommodated as far as possible. I am accordingly making inquiries into the matter and will communicate with the Deputy.</P>

      <P>The arrangements for the medical inspection of passengers arriving at Dún Laoghaire were reviewed towards the end of 1941 but it has been decided not to undertake a complete medical examination of each passenger.

      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that the Dublin Corporation dispensary for the prevention of tuberculosis has been under-staffed for a considerable time; and if he will state the reason for the failure to appoint an assistant medical officer and a nurse to the dispensary, as has been recommended.</P>

      <P>The staffing and administration of the tuberculosis scheme in Dublin has received special consideration in my Department.  The position is to be further reviewed as soon as the additional appointment of a deputy medical superintendent officer of health is made.  The services of an additional nurse were sought.  It appeared that she would be assigned the visitation of cases in Howth, and it has been suggested to the corporation that the <Col N="2247" /> arrangements for the visitation of patients by the nurse employed by the local District Nursing Association prior to the transfer of Howth to the city might be continued.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am in consultation with the Dublin potato trade about arrangements which should facilitate the purchase of available surplus stocks to meet the needs of consumers in Dublin. My Department has made exhaustive inquiries in order to ascertain all possible sources of supply, and the information obtained has been communicated to the Dublin potato trade. Special transport facilities are being afforded for the assembling in various rural centres of potatoes intended for the Dublin market, and, in consultation with the Department of Supplies, arrangements for the equitable distribution of the potatoes obtainable are being worked out. While I am hopeful that the supply position in Dublin will be improved, I am not so optimistic as to expect that the area's requirements of potatoes can be met to the full up to the end of this month.  As from the beginning of June, however, when the new <Col N="2251" /> potatoes come on the market, I expect to be able to have in operation a scheme under which the needs of the Dublin area will be fully met.</P>

      <P>Can the Minister state the normal weekly requirement of potatoes in Dublin City?  Can he state further the total quantity of potatoes in the country?  Can he indicate how far short of normal requirements are the supplies of potatoes available in Dublin at the moment?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The requirements in Dublin City are about 1,000 tons a week.  It is very hard to say what is the amount of potatoes in the country, because we cannot get a census of the quantity on each farm.  It is estimated that about 3,000,000 tons were produced last year.  It is doubtful, from the survey made, if we can get enough to supply Dublin's requirements in full until the new potatoes come in.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>There was a survey made five or six weeks ago&mdash;a very full survey.

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I should put it as 90 per cent. due to a shortage generally in the country, and perhaps a small shortage due to lack of transport.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That, of course, is a question that might be put to the Taoiseach under the Ministers and Secretaries Act.  I think that, generally speaking, as regards food supplies, such as potatoes, butter, meat and so on, the responsibility is on the Minister for Agriculture to see that they are brought to a particular place.  Price is a matter for the Department of Supplies, and I should say that distribution is a matter on which the two Departments consult together.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fagan</NameTxt>
      <P>In November and December of last year farmers who had supplies of potatoes could get no sale for them.  I advertised for sale ten or 15 tons of potatoes in the local papers, and could not get buyers for them.  I had to feed them to pigs. There was no sale for potatoes at that time.  The price of £3 per ton that was being offered for them would not cover the cost of taking them to the railway station at Mullingar.  That was my position, and the position of a number of other farmers.  I think that if the Minister were alive to his duty, as the Minister for Agriculture in England is, he would have made better provision.  In England, even though the potatoes rot, the farmers there are being paid £10 an acre for the growing of them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>My task here to-day is not an enviable one.  With all Parties on the alert on the eve of a general election, some looking to scoff and some to praise whatever is produced in the way of a Budget, irrespective perhaps of its contents, I am bound to disappoint not a few in both categories. Last year, it will be remembered, there was no major change in our taxation programme, and the subsequent results have, I think, shown the wisdom of that decision from the national standpoint.  In the international field the war has broadened in area and grown in violence.  More countries have become involved; destruction has become more widespread on land and sea.  While the tide of active hostilities has not <Col N="2266" /> touched us, we have not been without our war losses.  Our small fleet of merchant vessels has been further depleted by sinkings in which toll has unhappily been taken of human life.  With a heavily increased proportion of their resources devoted to total war, civilian consumption in all countries to which we have access has become further restricted, goods available for export to neutrals have diminished, and this has naturally had its reactions on our trade position.  But despite the numerous obstacles in the way of trade, visible imports since the beginning of the war had up to 31st March last exceeded visible exports by some £17.3 millions in value.  This is an achievement on which the trading interests concerned, as well as the State Departments, deserve a word of recognition.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Economic activity on the whole, including agricultural production, has been fairly satisfactory throughout the past year and the result has been shown in the continued buoyancy of the revenue, which exceeded anticipations under quite a number of important heads.  The difficulties of estimation. serious enough in ordinary times, are of course, much intensified in existing circumstances, and we have to balance a number of fortuitous gains against deficiencies which occurred in respect of other important items and also against the ever-growing burden of our expenditure.  State expenditure continues to mount in a fashion that causes me not a little uneasiness and, as Minister for Finance, I continue to receive a constant stream of proposals for fresh expenditure, not only from within the Government, but from all quarters inside and outside the House, some even from those who proclaim most loudly the gospel of economy. The voice of caution is seldom raised. Half-hearted political admonishments are, it is true, occasionally heard but, in the political field, I find no one except myself really serious about this business of economy.  The daily Press is vocal with clamour for State expenditure on everything ranging from bog roads to concert halls.  We have, as it were, become infected with a kind of financial hysteria traceable, no doubt, to the enormous and unprecedented <Col N="2267" /> scale of expenditure which all belligerent countries have to shoulder in order to meet the commitments of total war.  We forget that these countries are fighting a desperate battle for survival and that this expenditure measures the extent to which their citizens deny themselves many of the necessaries and most of the amenities of life and even the boon of life itself.  To put it in another way, all resources of man-power and material are to the utmost extent possible taken by the Government which pays for their use with money raised in every conceivable fashion, by taxation, by borrowing, by liquidation of foreign investments, and by using up domestic capital of all types, agricultural, industrial and commercial, in a manner and at a rate that would be considered reckless in ordinary times.</P>
    <P>Apart from what is spent abroad, the outlay of these warring Governments passes into the hands of the citizens, though not necessarily the same class of citizen.  By rationing and controls of many kinds &mdash; reinforced by patriotic appeals &mdash; this purchasing power is not put to its normal uses so far as consumption goods are concerned. What is left after heavy taxation has been met is siphoned off the economic system by means of savings and so prevented from bidding against the particular Government and from diverting the economic activities of the nation back to civilian channels or inflating the price of consumption goods and services.  In these circumstances privations and hardships are cheerfully endured which no neutral nation would expect its citizens to bear.  Conscription of person and of purse is accepted without question.  The State, in effect, takes on an increasingly totalitarian aspect and the individual ceases to count.  A position of full employment is, however, attained.  If one may judge from the reactions in Parliament and Press against the relatively mild restrictions which have been imposed on economic activities in this country since 1939, there would be little disposition to put up with the major controls, discomforts and privations accepted by the peoples of the belligerent <Col N="2268" /> nations.  This may be because we are not at war and have not the sense that our existence as a nation is at stake.  At all events, it is a fact which people should bear in mind when they read or hear of the various nostrums and panaceas so widely publicised as remedies of our social ills&mdash; unemployment, emigration and the rest.  All or most of these measures, even if they were sound in other respects, would call for a degree of interference with individual freedom which our people would almost certainly resent and oppose, and none of them could succeed without wholehearted popular co-operation.  Failure to recognise that public policy must adapt itself to the character of the people whom it is intended to serve is the besetting sin of our social theorists, as it has always been of their kind. Those of us who have to reach decisions in matters of policy, and to take responsibility for the results, cannot afford to indulge any similar proclivity which we may have.  We must consider the popular reactions to our measures. We cannot, for example, risk an indefinite increase in State expenditure on the facile assumption that the public would accept all the restrictions and controls necessary to avert the disastrous inflation which would be the normal result of such an increase.</P>
    <P>The solution of our social ills is not, therefore, just a matter of finance, as many allege, although finance has a contribution to make to what can only be described as an assortment of problems.  To this contribution I will refer later.  It is sufficient now to say that, on the information available, our taxation appears to be as heavy in proportion to our national income, which is the only true yardstick of taxation, as that of any neutral country in Europe and even of some belligerent countries.  Further increases can only help to intensify unemployment by destroying economic incentive, increasing costs of production, reducing efficiency and competitive capacity and ultimately hindering our efforts at national reconstruction and expansion in the post-war period.  It should be remembered that economic stability is an essential factor in maintaining political <Col N="2269" /> independence and that heavy taxation and, still more, over-taxation is the surest way to weaken and undermine the stabilising forces in our national economy.</P>
    <P>I cannot here pursue this topic further as our present care must be the financial situation of the State, as seen from the results of the past financial year and the prospects for the coming year.</P>
    <P>From the tables circulated to-day Deputies will see that the realised deficit in the national accounts for the 12 months to 31st March last was £2,145,000, as compared with £4,558,000 anticipated.  This good result was due to revenue rising above expectations and expenditure falling below.  On the tax revenue side, we anticipated a yield of £10,265,000 from customs which, in the event, gave us £395,000 more.  The main contributor to this happy result was tobacco, which returned us an excess of £500,000 at £7,969,000.  This is accounted for by the increase of approximately one-eighth in the clearances of unmanufactured tobacco from bond which we allowed under Emergency Powers Orders as from 1st November, 1942, and also by additional imports of manufactured tobacco.  We felt able to permit increased clearances last autumn because of the improved leaf stocks in this country.  These were at a dangerously low ebb about 12 months ago, but thanks to the co-operation of our manufacturers and the services of Irish Shipping, Limited, the quantities in hand have doubled during the year.</P>
    <P>Clothing and apparel duties also showed a welcome increase in yield in contrast with an anticipated heavy decline.  Our drapers lost no opportunity of adding to their stocks of imported merchandise, and besides the trend of prices throughout the year was upwards &mdash; a fact which greatly helped the yield of this as well as of all other <i>ad valorem</i> duties.</P>
    <P>The wine and spirits group of duties turned out reasonably well.  The high price and occasional scarcity of spirits were partly responsible for the increased attention paid to wine, the <Col N="2270" /> consumption of which brought us in a revenue of £212,000, or £42,000 more than we had anticipated.  Here again increased imports, mainly from the Iberian Peninsula, have enabled us to build up better stocks.  Larger supplies have also induced a wider consumption of brandy which, at £155,000, returned over 50 per cent. in excess of the estimate.  The whole of the imported spirits group yielded us well over £500,000, or £100,000 in excess of the estimate.</P>
    <P>There was a big decline in the imports of sugar and a corresponding falling-off in the duty paid, as compared with the previous year.  In the hydrocarbon oil group, which includes petrol, we also fared badly, the total receipts being £830,000 as against £895,000 anticipated.</P>
    <P>As regards excise, the leaders in this section, beer and spirits, retained their place, the former with a yield of £3,112,000 and the latter with £2,107,000.  The rates of duty in both cases were, of course, heavily increased in the autumn of 1939, shortly after the outbreak of war.  The consumption of home-made beer in terms of bulk barrels has shown in recent years a slight upward tendency, which continued in the last 12 months.  The consumption of home-made spirits has likewise shown an improvement, to be accounted for, no doubt, in part by the falling-off of imported varieties.</P>
    <P>It is of some interest to note that beer and spirits between them produced in 1942-43, £5,219,000, or 71 per cent. of the total revenue from excise. If we include tobacco, the aggregate yield from these commodities came to £13,976,000, or 42.7 per cent. of the total tax revenue, excluding motor vehicle duties.  Thus does the Exchequer benefit from our little weaknesses.</P>
    <P>On the inland revenue side, pride of place must be given to income-tax, the yield of which, together with surtax, passed the £10,000,000 mark for the first time in our history.  There has been a number of steep increases in rates in recent years in this, the most unpopular, I suppose, of all our direct taxes.  The present standard rate of <Col N="2271" /> income-tax of 7/6 in the £ is one which I sincerely hope we may not be called upon to exceed.  Its high level acts to some extent as a brake on individual effort and as a deterrent to industrial and commercial enterprise.  In this way it has reactions harmful to the national economy, a result which does not follow from most forms of indirect taxation if kept on a reasonable basis.</P>
    <P>Some ill-effects are also discernible from the undoubtedly high level at which we pegged excess corporation profits tax.  The patriotic impulse which drives people to an all-out war effort even under a 100 per cent. excess profit tax is, in part, lacking in a neutral country.  The tax has, however, been much more fruitful than expected, and the concessions which I announced 12 months ago at an estimated net loss of £100,000 did not cost us anything if we measure the actual yield of duty, £2,760,000, against the revised estimate of £2,420,000 made after the concessions had been allowed for.  The combined yield of income-tax and surtax and corporation profits tax at £12,840,000 amounted to 39.2 per cent. of the total tax revenue, excluding motor vehicle duties.</P>
    <P>The most important remaining item on the inland revenue side is estate duty, including legacy and succession duties, which, at £1,370,000, improved on the estimate by £40,000.  The yield of these imposts is necessarily conjectural, depending on the mortality rate and on the value of stocks, shares and other forms of personal and real property.</P>
    <P>The last big item, stamp duties, brought us £490,000 as compared with an estimate of £463,000.  These are to some extent a barometer of business activity, as they include duties on the capital of companies, on cheques, bills of exchange, contract notes, insurances of all kinds and a variety of deeds and other instruments which relate to the passing of property.</P>
    <P>On the basis of the Exchequer return as at 31st March last which, as Deputies are aware, does not distinguish between normal and abnormal <Col N="2272" /> expenditure, the gap between Exchequer issues for Central Fund and Supply Services and Exchequer tax and non-tax revenue was £3,317,000.  The figures for previous years were: &mdash;1941-42, £3,644,000; 1940-41, £3,134,000; 1939-40, £2,006,000.</P>
    <P>In the period so far covered by the emergency, our total Exchequer deficits have been £12,101,000, all of which had to be financed by borrowing.  Accompanied as this was by heavy rates of direct taxation involving, to an appreciable extent, the transfer of income from the saving to the non-saving section of the community and releasing in this way a large volume of purchasing power which would not otherwise be effective, it is not surprising that prices have been advancing here at a fairly rapid rate and that the cost-of-living index has reached high levels. Numerous other influences, to some of which I shall refer later, have, of course, been at work in promoting inflationary tendencies but the influence of public finance in this direction cannot be ignored.  Those who press for bigger deficits or higher taxation should ponder this fact.</P>
    <P>A succession of deficits makes the task of restoring budgetary equilibrium extremely difficult.  Departments become accustomed to a higher scale of outlay.  Fresh services and posts are created and vested interests tend to be built up.  Spending is a habit which takes root easily and with its growth retrenchment becomes more difficult. We are, of course, far from unique, even amongst neutral countries, in having our Budget unbalanced.  As in other cases, the heavy expenditure on the Army and the Defence Services associated with it is mainly responsible for throwing the normal working of the financial mechanism out of gear.  In the year just closed our Exchequer issues for Army purposes were £8,395,000, as compared with £8,155,000 in the preceding year, an increase of £240,000.  In the last complete year of peace &mdash; to 31st March, 1939 &mdash; Army issues were only £1,766,000, so there has been a five-fold increase.  Heavy expenditure on military objectives, while essential for national safety, does not add to the stream of production or <Col N="2273" /> to capital assets.  It adds to taxation and promotes the growth of deadweight debt.  In the peaceful days which, I hope, lie ahead, when swords revert to ploughshares, this serious impairment of our national finances will, no doubt, be largely removed.</P>
    <P>The capital liabilities of the State, including the estimated capital value of State contributions under the Housing Acts, amounted on 31st March, 1943, to £91,938,000, an increase during the year of £1,768,000.  In the same period capital assets, mainly cash balances, declined by £1,444,000.  The net addition to the capital burden during the 12 months was thus £3,212,000.</P>
    <P>On 31st March, 1942, the gross debt of local authorities amounted to £36,388,000.  After allowing for the value of State contributions towards housing and for certain electricity and technical instruction loans, the net debt outstanding was £22,767,000, an increase of £293,000 on the previous year.</P>
    <P>The combined indebtedness of the State and local authorities on 31st March, 1942, totalled £110,700,000, after allowing for the amount of the advances from the Exchequer to the Local Loans Fund outstanding at that date.  Assuming an increase of £1,000,000 in the case of local authorities during the year, the aggregate gross liabilities of the State and local authorities amounted on 31st March, 1943, to £114,200,000, a very substantial figure.</P>
    <P>During the year we have increased by over £700,000 to £12,237,000 our indebtedness in respect of Savings Certificates, while to Post Office depositors we owed on 31st March last in respect of principal and interest a sum of nearly £19,250,000 &mdash; including £1,550,000 belonging to the Trustee Savings Banks &mdash; which was £4,250,000 greater than on the previous 31st March.  There has thus been a very rapid growth during the 12 months in the earnings of the people deposited with the State and in our responsibility towards this large and thrifty section of the community.  The number of depositors, in round figures, in the <Col N="2274" /> Post Office Savings Bank is now 460,000, and in the Trustee Savings Banks 29,000, while the number of holders of Savings Certificates is 225,000.</P>
    <P>Owing to the satisfactory yield of revenue in 1942-43, the financing of the various categories of expenditure was effected more easily than usual.  For the first time since its establishment, no capital advances were required by the Electricity Supply Board from the Exchequer, owing, doubtless, to the non-availability of materials and equipment; and for a similar reason the Local Loans Fund, instead of drawing on the Exchequer for capital as was anticipated, was able to repay the appreciable amount of £600,000 capital borrowed in former years.</P>
    <P>The substantial Exchequer balance of £2.4 millions in hand at the opening of the year, together with the receipts from Savings Certificates and from other short-term borrowings of £1,900,000, left a useful sum of £1? million in hands on 31st March last after meeting all outlay chargeable against borrowings.</P>
    <P>Included in the disbursements on capital account during 1942-43 there is, as Deputies will have observed from the Exchequer returns, the large payment of £1,053,770 made to the Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company under the provisions of the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938. That liability had been, as it were, hanging over the Exchequer for a few years but it did not fall to be discharged until the complicated valuations provided for in the amalgamation agreement were finally completed and examined in December last.</P>
    <P>The Act of 1938 placed on the Minister for Finance the obligation to make good the deficiency in the funds of the four Irish companies whose life assurance and industrial insurance business was transferred to the terminating company formed under the amalgamation arrangements.  At the outset it was estimated that the Exchequer liability would be about £600,000, but this figure was not based on any detailed investigation, and <Col N="2275" /> proved to be far below the deficiency revealed by the final valuation of the assets and liabilities of the four companies as at 16th September, 1939, the statutory date of the transfer of business. The increase in the liability to over £1,000,000 may be explained, firstly, by the fact that the excess of the insurance liabilities over the assets of the four participating companies as provisionally valued at 31st December, 1937, was found to be well over £200,000 short of the actuarial deficiency proved to exist at 16th September, 1939; secondly, by the addition of the costs of transfer, including compensation to redundant staff, amounting to nearly £120,000, for which no provision had been included in the earlier estimate; and thirdly, by the obligation falling on the Minister for Finance to pay interest totalling about £107,000 on the ascertained deficiency in respect of the period from the transfer date to the date of discharge of the Exchequer liability.</P>
    <P>The payment of this large sum undoubtedly placed a serious burden on our financial resources.  At the same time no one can fail to recognise that the very size of the deficiency is a proof of the need that existed for State intervention in the domestic field of insurance and for the reorganisation carried into effect by the Act of 1938. If that Act had not been passed, the early collapse of these four companies would have caused widespread hardship to policy holders, creditors, borrowers and staff, and possibly would have had a damaging effect on national credit.</P>
    <P>The Exchequer has a tangible asset to show against the payment made to enable the new company to conduct its operations in a condition of solvency. Under the Statutory Amalgamation Scheme the company has transferred to the Minister for Finance shares which represent approximately 20 per cent. of the issued capital, while the Minister also holds the sole voting rights.  Eventually when the terminating company is wound up and its assets transferred to the permanent company, the Irish Assurance Company, the Minister will possess an equivalent shareholding in <Col N="2276" /> that undertaking although without the sole voting control that exists in relation to the temporary company.  It is too early yet to gauge what return the Exchequer will reap from its investment but the asset which it holds may be of considerable importance if the business of the new company prospers as it should when the initial difficulties have been surmounted under prudent direction and vigorous management.</P>
    <P>During 1942 attention was given by the Government Departments concerned to the question of providing credit facilities for farmers, not so much now as in the post-emergency period when restocking and revitalising the land will be a pressing national necessity.  Consideration was naturally focussed on the part which the Agricultural Credit Corporation might play in the solution of this important problem.  I do not wish to deal generally here with agricultural credit, but I may mention a transaction of the past year which added to the contingent liabilities of the Exchequer and at the same time provided the Agricultural Credit Corporation with the opportunity for making loans at a reduced rate of interest.  As Deputies are aware, the Agricultural Credit Acts of 1927 and 1929 enable the Minister for Finance to guarantee the principal of and interest on borrowings by the Corporation.  In this way, the corporation raised £500,000 in its early days through the issue of mortgage bonds carrying interest at 5 per cent., which was the rate applying, under State guarantee also, to the original share capital.  This 5 per cent. on its capital has been in the past a decisive factor in the corporation's leading rate.  Last year the board of the corporation approached me in the hope that means might be found of using the prevailing low interest rates to secure funds to redeem its existing capital indebtedness.</P>
    <P>The mortgage bonds to which I have referred carry optional dates of redemption, the first series of £250,000 in November, 1944, and the second series of £250,000 in May, 1946.  Accordingly, last December, under statutory powers I gave my consent and guarantee to <Col N="2277" /> the creation of a new series of Certificates of Charge, amounting to £1,000,000, called State-guaranteed Mortgage Stock, issued at par, bearing interest at 3 per cent. and redeemable in 1957/67.  £500,000 of the 3 per cent. Mortgage Stock was immediately issued, and I facilitated the corporation by taking up the whole allotment for the investment funds under my control, thus saving the corporation the expense involved in a public issue.  The proceeds will be used by the corporation to pay off the 5 per cent.  Mortgage Bonds as they fall due for redemption during the next few years.  The corporation have the right to issue the balance of the £1,000,000 of 3 per cent. Mortgage Stock at any time and this power can, as opportunity may offer, be used either to complete the liquidation of its existing 5 per cent. capital structure or to procure funds at this low rate of interest for re-lending to the agricultural community.  In the meantime the corporation has reduced its lending rate to 4½ per cent, a reduction which is also applicable to loans outstanding at the old rates of 6 per cent., 5½ per cent., and 5 per cent. Deputies will appreciate, however, that the beneficial effects of the issue of 3 per cent. Mortgage Stock on the expenses of the corporation will not be realised until after the 5½ per cent bonds have been redeemed.  In the interval the concession given in the reduction of the rate of interest on loans to 4½ per cent. involves a substantial loss of income and, correspondingly a call on the Exchequer to honour its guarantee of the 5 per cent. dividends payable on the shares in the corporation held by the public.  Provision for this contingency appears in the White Paper among the estimated Central Fund liabilities during 1943-44.</P>
    <P>In preparing the White Paper Estimates of Receipts and Expenditure for the year ending 31st March, 1944, I have proceeded on the same assumptions as in previous Budgets, namely, that despite the further expansion and growing intensity of the war, no major economic catastrophe will overtake the country; that supplies from abroad of various important commodities will continue to reach us, and that, with <Col N="2278" /> the co-operation of home producers of food and materials, we will be able to carry on with some comparative degree of comfort.  These assumptions underlie the revenue side of the Budget and, while they introduce an element of conjecture into the picture, we can only hope that they will prove valid.</P>
    <P>On the basis of existing taxation our estimate of tax revenue for 1943-44 is £35,195,000, as compared with payments into the Exchequer of £33,381,000 for 1942-43, an increase of £1,814,000.  Customs revenue is expected to rise by £440,000 to £11,100,000, which is very gratifying, especially as it shows a drop under all heads except tobacco, sugar and wine. The greatest loss is in the hydrocarbon oil group, from which we received £1,243,000 in 1941-42 and £830,000 in 1942-43, but can expect only £470,000 in 1943-44.  Tobacco is relied on for a yield only a few thousand pounds short of £8,500,000.  The duty on imported sugar is likely to show a useful increase owing to higher imports of raw sugar from the British West Indies in the coming year.  As regards wine, current stocks in bond are markedly above those of a year ago and in view of the buoyancy of the demand increased sales may be anticipated with corresponding benefit to the revenue.</P>
    <P>In the case of clothing and apparel, we face declining imports and a drop in yield of £129,000.  A downward trend in the receipts during 1942-43, coupled with indications of a complete cessation of imports of certain classes of clothing in 1943-44, is responsible for the reduction.</P>
    <P>Imports of tobacco have been on a more satisfactory scale during the last 12 months.  The continued importation of leaf, which comes mainly from the United States, is a matter of interest not only for revenue but also for employment. The demand for the American crop grows in intensity as the war expenditure of the United Nations expand.  At the same time, labour and other difficulties in the United States of America are tending to force a reduction in acreage.  For the next 12 months, however, I think <Col N="2279" /> we can run the risk of maintaining clearances at the rate of 90 per cent. of the standard year, as compared with 80 per cent. previously allowed.  This means that our consumption will be over 9,000,000 pounds of tobacco.  In terms of cigarettes, this represents a figure the magnitude of which is not generally realised.  If we assume that two-thirds of our consumption of tobacco is in the form of cigarettes, and that the latter run to approximately 400 per lb., the consumption, when we add the imports, works out at 2,500,000,000 cigarettes per annum, or about 50,000,000 per week&mdash;over 7,000,000 per day.  Pipe smokers consume 50,000,000 ounces a year.  The snuffers account for most of the remainder.</P>
    <P>The great expansion in cigarette smoking in recent years is undoubtedly due to the spread of the habit among women.  No figures are available as to their precise contribution to the national smoke cloud, but their activity in this line puts around £2,000,000 a year into the Exchequer.</P>
    <P>I may turn now to the inland revenue prospect for the coming year.  Its main feature is, of course, income-tax. The standard rate was raised by 1/- to 5/6 in 1939-40, and in November, 1939, was further increased to 6/6 in the £ for the 12 months beginning 6th April, 1940.  In May, 1941, yet a further 1/- brought it to 7/6.  The receipt in 1942-43, as shown in the White Paper, amounted to £9,500,000, which may be presumed to reflect in full the benefit of the latest addition to the rate.  For 1943-44 it is put at £10,619,000, which easily makes it the most valuable of all our taxes for Exchequer purposes.  Its companions, surtax and supertax, which yielded £580,000 in the past year are expected to be slightly less in the current year at £575,000.</P>
    <P>Motor vehicle duties which, at £631,000 in 1942-43, were £31,000 above expectation are put down at £450,000 for 1943-44.</P>
    <P>As regards non-tax revenue, the alterations made in 1941-42 in postal and telephone charges have added substantially <Col N="2280" /> to the receipts which are expected, at £2,525,000, to be increased by £100,000 in 1943-44.  The commercial accounts of the Post Office show, however, that it has been run at a loss for some years past, except in 1941-42.  There have, of course, been years when a surplus was shown on the accounts, but taking the whole period from 1922-23 to 1941-42 the excess of deficits over surpluses amounts to £2,830,000.</P>
    <P>The next most important item of non-tax revenue is land purchase annuities which, at £1,750,000, show a slight falling off from last year due to an anticipated fall in the amount of redemptions, as the acquisition of land for public purposes is on a declining scale.</P>
    <P>An item of £280,000 receipts in respect of surplus income from the Central Bank is included.  The corresponding receipt in 1942-43 was £225,000.</P>
    <P>As regards the Road Fund, while its income in the current year will decline substantially, payments into the Exchequer in respect of debt incurred in past years will show a considerable reduction.  The net assets at its disposal will be greater and I propose to avail of this happy circumstance for Budget purposes.</P>
    <P>On the expenditure side the principal outlay for the coming year will, of course, be on Supply Services.  The detailed Estimates set out in the volume already presented to the Dáil provide for an expenditure of £40,696,000 to which have to be added two Supplementary Estimates, one of £280,000 for the Department of Supplies, already approved by the House, and the other of £120,000 for the Department of Local Government and Public Health which is soon to be submitted.</P>
    <P>As social services and social security are topics that attract a large degree of public interest just now, it will not be out of place at this point to outline briefly the extent to which the social services sponsored by the State have helped to swell the bill which I am presenting to-day.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2281" /> On social and ethical grounds conditions of full employment are admittedly our most worthy objective and to that end the thought and energies of the Government have all along been directed.  Even in peace time, however, the problem is so beset with difficulties that nothing approaching a complete solution has been found.  Those difficulties have multiplied in our present circumstances and the solution now seems more remote than ever owing to the war-time scarcity of supplies which has not merely put a stop to industrial progress but seriously threatened the position of industrial development we had attained before the war.  Still, every possible effort is being made to realise in full measure the employment values inherent in the native resources of the country and Government money is being spent liberally with this object. Thus, the Employment and Emergency Schemes Vote provides £1,250,000 for purposes such as urban and rural amenity and utility works, minor employment schemes, development of bog roads, land improvement and reclamation, seed and lime distribution schemes and miscellaneous schemes providing work for the relief of unemployment and distress.  This expenditure will be supplemented by a contribution of £180,000 from local authorities. The Votes for Local Government and Supplies contemplate an outlay of £734,000 for works incidental to the production of turf and firewood on a large scale&mdash;activities which fulfil a dual function by affording useful employment and by safeguarding the health and comfort of the citizens in providing a substitute fuel for the coal which has disappeared from our hearths.  The Public Works and Buildings Vote will contribute some £596,000 for new works and buildings, while expenditure from other Votes in respect of land improvement, forestry, coal and minerals development, Gaeltacht services, and fisheries and grants for housing, drainage, etc., will also help to provide or stimulate employment. These various items add up to the considerable sum of £4,053,000.</P>
    <P>On top of this there is provision for capital issues as indicated in the White <Col N="2282" /> Paper for electrical development, road work and tourist development schemes, totalling £839,000, making an aggregate of just under £5,000,000.  Furthermore, the State has assumed contingent liability for numerous additional activities directed towards the provision or maintenance of employment. I have, for example, given my guarantee for very large overdrafts which are still current for such operations as the importation of tea and fuel, while the activities of Irish Shipping, Limited, which have brought so many vital supplies to our shores, were facilitated by a similar guarantee given by me.</P>
    <P>Among the provisions which have already appeared in the Supply Services Estimates there is this year a new benefit.  It has been represented that certain classes of works carried out as minor employment schemes in rural areas in which there is unemployment, should also be executed with State aid in other areas where the works were needed, but where the unemployment situation would not warrant their being carried out on the conditions usually associated with employment schemes.  What was mainly aimed at in these representations was the construction and, where necessary, the repair of roads connecting two public roads, of accommodation roads to houses, farms and bogs, and the carrying out of small drainage works other than field drains.</P>
    <P>After much thought I have decided, as it is desirable as an emergency measure to increase to the fullest extent the productive capacity of farms and the provision of turf for farmsteads, that a sum of £100,000, to be expended in grants for the purpose indicated, be made available out of the amount set out for miscellaneous schemes in the Vote for Employment and Emergency Schemes.  The farm improvements scheme has been almost invariably availed of by individual farmers, but the benefit of the works now proposed would in general accrue jointly to groups of farmers.</P>
    <P>Where efforts to provide work fall short of accomplishment our social services are available to alleviate destitution <Col N="2283" /> and distress whether due to unemployment or other involuntary cause. These services are not surpassed by those of any country with resources and national income comparable with our own.  Following a progressive and enlightened social policy, the State, with the loyal co-operation of the local authorities, has undertaken responsibility for assisting the poor and the unfortunate.  A substantial measure of social justice is in this way achieved. The Estimates provision for the current year in respect of what might be called the social services proper furnishes abundant evidence of the truth of this statement.  For old age and widows' and orphans' pensions, for the various grants included in the Vote for Local Government and Public Health, for national health insurance, for unemployment insurance and unemployment assistance and for other cognate services the remarkable total of £7,500,000 is provided in 1943-44 as against £7,000,000 in 1942-43.  A large portion, approximately £1,000,000, of the former sum is earmarked for the relief of distress and hardship directly traceable to emergency conditions as, for example, the food allowances scheme in operation since 1941, the grant to provide fuel for necessitous families, the setting up of a special register of turf and agricultural workers and the increased provision to encourage the working of allotments by unemployed men.  In the last pre-war year, 1938-39, the expenditure for social services was approximately £6,000,000 so that current demands represent an increase of 25 per cent on that figure.</P>
    <P>Direct Government subsidies in 1943-44 will cost £3,644,000, an increase of £567,000 on 1942-43.  A large portion of this will go to mitigate the effect of the increased cost of essential food items.  To subsidise the price of turf we are providing this year no less than £660,000.</P>
    <P>Educational services from primary school to university will cost £5,312,000 as against £5,150,000 provided last year, and £4,786,000 spent in 1938-39.</P>
    <P>The sum of all the grants to be voted in 1943-44 for the provision and <Col N="2284" /> encouragement of employment and for social services is over £20,500,000.  This considerable figure represents one-half of the aggregate of the Supply Services Estimates.  It is an increase of £858,000 on the 1942-43 provision and of just £5,000,000 on the actual expenditure under the same heads in 1938-39. This total leaves out of reckoning several other essential services such as the courts of justice, the Civic Guards and various allied services; the Post Office and the assistance rendered to agriculture by way of grants and otherwise.</P>
    <P>An additional social service which has been widely and warmly advocated in recent years is children's allowances. The cost of any such service in this country, with its, happily, large number of children, must be very heavy no matter how modest the allowances or how restricted their scope.</P>
    <P>The Government has already officially announced its decision to bring into operation a scheme of children's allowances.  The Bill to implement this decision is being drafted. As some months must elapse before such a measure can be passed into law and as a considerable further period would be required before arrangements for putting a scheme of the kind into operation could be completed, I am not asking the Dáil to make any financial provision for children's allowances in the current financial year.</P>
    <P>I would invite persons who question our outlook on social matters or criticise the adequacy of our social services to reflect seriously upon the figures mentioned above, from which, incidentally, administrative costs have for the most part been excluded.  Generally speaking, the proportion of State expenditure representing the pay of civil servants is not unreasonable. Nevertheless the continued growth in the numbers and cost of the Civil Service is a cause of serious concern.  The latest figures available, which relate to the beginning of January, 1912, show an increase since the corresponding date in 1939 of 275 in the number of established civil servants and of 1,126 in unestablished personnel.  The increase in the total amount of salaries <Col N="2285" /> and wages during the same period was approximately £560,000 a year, about £200,000 of which was due to a higher rate of cost-of-living bonus.  Although statistics for the present year are not yet available, it is certain that the numbers and cost of the service have risen still further since the beginning of 1942.</P>
    <P>The position, unsatisfactory as it is, would be much worse if the emergency services created since January, 1939, had not been manned largely by borrowing staff from normal services. In this connection, I must say that it is becoming increasingly difficult to maintain the loans of staff at the point they reached earlier in the emergency period.  Departments are constantly being pressed to restore their full pre-emergency activities and they, in turn, are tending to press for the return of the staff lent to emergency services. This is a matter in which the Dáil can help by accepting and encouraging the public to accept the very limited curtailment which has occurred in certain peace-time activities.</P>
    <P>The most comforting fact about the expansion of the Civil Service since 1939 is that four-fifths of the increase in numbers is attributable to the recruitment of persons whose employment can be terminated when the need for their services comes to an end. This consolation, however, is decidedly lessened by reflection on what appears to be a permanent upward trend in State activity.  Year after year, before the emergency began, as well as since, the Government has felt itself impelled to assume new functions and establish new services.  If that tendency continues, and all the indications are that it will, further expansion of the Civil Service is inevitable.</P>
    <P>It is the fashion at the moment to ascribe increasing Governmental activity, increasing intervention in economic affairs, for example, to the hidden hand of a supposed bureaucracy.  In truth, as all but the most prejudiced commentators on public affairs know, there is no bureaucracy in this State.  Public policy is determined by a Government <Col N="2286" /> responsible to the Oireachtas, and it is administered under the control of that Government.  Rightly and necessarily, civil servants have some influence in the formation of policy, but only in so far as their advice commends itself to the particular Ministers under whose direction they work.  I think I am doing the Civil Service no injustice when I say that it is very rare indeed to find its members exercising their influence in favour of an extension of State activity.  If they have a bias, it is, speaking generally, in the opposite direction.</P>
    <P>There remains, however, this great problem.  Can we stem the tide of Governmental intervention in what was formerly regarded as the domain of private enterprise, private charity, or voluntary organisation?  In order to do so people should, in my opinion, develop a greater spirit of reliance, I do not say on merely individual, but on organised co-operative effort.  The trend of social and economic development here, as in other countries, imposes the need for more and more standardisation of products and regulation of activities.  We cannot resist that. The only choice open to us is whether we shall respond to the need by increasing the powers and functions of the Government or by the creation and effective operation of a network of organisations to protect the legitimate interests and promote the welfare of the various economic and social elements of the community, while reserving to the Government the function of safeguarding the common good and protecting those who are not strong enough to protect themselves. Theoretically, there would not, I think, be much doubt about our choice; none of us desires the all-powerful State. Yet we are drifting steadily towards it. We are doing so partly because, as our community is at present organised, only the State can do many of the things that require to be done, and partly because, in spite of our theoretical dislike of State interference, we all tend to rely upon the State to do for us things which, if we had the will and were ready to co-operate with our neighbours, we could do far better and more economically for ourselves.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2287" /> I could give many instances of this tendency to undue reliance on the Government, but it is unnecessary. Deputies already know them.  It is a very dangerous tendency, one of the most dangerous of all from the standpoint of the political and social welfare of our people.  It would be relatively easy for the Government to create the network of organisations I have spoken of; but the real problem lies deeper than that, it lies in this mental attitude of our people, of all of us.  Unless we can change this attitude, and learn to depend more on our individual and group efforts and less on the Government, there is no hope of averting State omni-competence and an ever increasing and ever more costly Civil Service.</P>
    <P>Reverting to my outline of the 1943-44 finances, the Supply Services, as in previous years, contain provision for capital and abnormal expenditure usually met by borrowing.  The chief amongst items of this kind, all of which are set out in the Table Explanatory of the Budget, is £471,000 in respect of defence expenditure on Vote 10 for Public Works and Buildings and on Vote 63 for the Army.  Barracks, store accommodation and a gymnasium are among buildings provided for, while out of the latter Vote armoured cars, transport vehicles, guns, ammunition, and A.R.P. equipment are to be purchased on a substantial scale.</P>
    <P>In respect of airports, including meteorological equipment, the demand is estimated at £193,000 in the coming year.  Deducting the annuity, calculated on a 15-year basis at 3½ per cent. interest, required to meet the total estimated expenditure, we get a figure of £13,000 to be borrowed.  Of the total cost of land acquired and cultural operations for forestry, I propose to borrow £52,000, and in regard to employment and emergency schemes, which have been merged into one Vote, I am borrowing one-fourth of £1,250,000.  In respect of expenditure totalling £734,000 on fuel production, under Votes 41 and 69, I feel justified in treating as a non-revenue charge one-fourth of the whole amount, viz., £183,000.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2288" /> These capital items aggregate £1,032,000, and if we deduct this from the total of Supply Services we get a figure of £40,064,000, to which have to be added Central Fund Services costing £5,073,000, making a total of £45,137,000.  We cannot make a deduction for anticipated savings as the experience of past years has shown the difficulty of avoiding Supplementary Estimates.</P>
    <P>On the existing basis, tax revenue, as shown in the White Paper, is estimated at £35,195,000 and non-tax revenue at £6,287,000, making a total of £41,482,000.  This leaves us with the substantial margin of £3,655,000 between revenue and expenditure.  It is difficult to see how this gap can be closed except by further borrowing. The alternatives are economic or additional taxation.  As regards the former it is, of course, part of the functions of the Minister for Finance to take all possible steps to eliminate waste and to promote efficiency.  He has not only to raise the revenue required for the multifarious activities of the State, but also to see that it is spent to the best advantage.  In the discharge of the latter duty he has to depend mainly on the help he receives from other Ministers and Departments. I am assured by my colleagues that there is no avoidable waste and that, in present circumstances, economies are not feasible.</P>
    <P>As regards additional taxation, I have already referred to the considerable increase in the burden of both direct and indirect imposts which we have sustained in recent years.  It is a wise policy, I think, to reduce our borrowing as much as possible in order to keep debt charges down and so help us in the post-war period.  Debt charges are, indeed, already considerable, amounting to £4,025,000, approximately, for the coming year.  But while the maintenance of a sound economic and financial front is desirable I feel that a further advance in taxation cannot now be advocated.  We cannot bear here the unusually high levels reached in the United Kingdom where the monetary incomes of the population have shown continuous and <Col N="2289" /> rapid expansion under the impetus of war expenditure and where the earnings of the people have outstripped the rise in the cost of living.  The British national income measured in terms of money has increased by leaps and bounds but here the relative increase has been much lower.  Besides we are suffering now to a more marked degree from shortages of the solid and liquid fuels, raw materials, and semi-manufactured goods and chemical products required for industrial operations; machinery, machine parts and all kinds of replacement equipment are also scarcer.  Agricultural production, it is true, has undergone considerable expansion in terms of money, but it is difficult to tax the farmer and in any case agricultural production, generally speaking, does not show as good a margin of profit as industrial and there is, therefore, less available for the tax collector.</P>
    <P>While no general increase in rates of taxation is being proposed to-day, I think it well to deal at some length with corporation profits tax as some misunderstanding appears to prevail on the subject in business circles and elsewhere.</P>
    <P>If the profits of a company do not exceed £2,500 it does not pay corporation profits tax at all.  If its profits exceed £2,500 it is charged ordinary corporation profits tax at the rate of 2s. in the £ on the amount by which those profits exceed £2,500.  If its profits exceed its standard profits, or £2,500 (if £2,500 is greater than its standard profits) it is charged on the amount of the excess both ordinary corporation profits tax at the rate of 2s. in the £ and excess corporation profits tax at the rate of 10s. in the £, i.e., a total of 12s. in the £, in other words at the rate of 60 per cent.  Corporation profits tax is allowable as a deduction for income-tax purposes, and the company also pays income-tax at the full rate of 7s. 6d. in the £ on what is left. The ultimate effect is that, if a company is at present making profits in excess of £2,500 per annum and also in excess of its standard profits as computed in accordance with the law, we take from it in taxation 7s. 6d. in the £ on the first £2,500 of its profits; <Col N="2290" /> 8s. 9d. in the £ on the amount by which its normal or standard profit exceeds £2,500, and 15s. in the £ on the balance, i.e., on the amount which it makes in excess of its normal or standard profits.</P>
    <P>It may be well to remind the Committee how the standard profit is computed.  There is first of all the minimum standard of £2,500.  Then, as regards companies entitled to a standard higher than the minimum, no difficulty normally arises in the case of a company which has been in existence for several years.  The profit of the best of the last three years prior to the emergency for which the company has made up its accounts is taken as its standard or peace-time profit, and unless the circumstances have been exceptional it cannot be suggested that this is anything but a fair measure of standard profits.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to new companies is different.  Some of the new companies had been trading for less than three years prior to the commencement of the emergency.  Some, which had been trading somewhat more than three years, had not yet got into their stride.  It was decided, therefore, in 1942, after careful consideration, that any company incorporated on or after the 1st January, 1934, should be allowed a standard, to be called a substituted standard, of 9 per cent. on its issued capital (including debenture capital, if any) as an alternative to any profits standard to which it might be entitled, based on profits made in a pre-emergency year.</P>
    <P>In 1942 some criticism was directed against the allowance of 9 per cent. on preference and debenture capital; but if it is borne in mind that the substituted standard is simply intended to serve as a measure of the trading profit which a company with a certain capital might reasonably be expected to earn it will be seen that this criticism is misconceived.  If a company's capital is £200,000 the manner in which that capital has been subscribed will not affect the amount of its trading profit one way or the other, and since we are merely endeavouring to arrive at a figure to be taken as the normal trading <Col N="2291" /> profit of the undertaking in peace-time we are not concerned with the manner in which such profit falls to be distributed amongst the individuals by whom the capital was subscribed.</P>
    <P>I have again been approached this year, mainly by representatives of the new companies, on behalf of which it is argued that where the substituted standard applies they are being left, after meeting the burden of taxation, with insufficient funds to pay reasonable dividends and provide reserves to meet contingencies which may be expected to arise at the end of the emergency.</P>
    <P>I found that the contingency concerning which there is most apprehension in business circles is one which my advisers have had in mind all along, but with regard to which we cannot legislate at present.  It is a matter which concerns old as well as new companies.  As Deputies are aware, the normal practice of traders when making up their accounts is to value stock-in-trade at cost or market value, whichever is lower.  Now it is probable that in many businesses there will be a fall in the market value of stocks following the termination of the emergency, and there is a fear in business circles that if excess corporation profits tax were brought to an end before the slump in stock values took place such fall in values would never be reflected in the computation of the liability of traders to this form of taxation.</P>
    <P>The point is not a new one.  Special legislation in relation to excess profits duty was passed following the War of 1914-1918 to meet a somewhat similar set of circumstances.  It is obviously not practicable to introduce legislation of this nature until the end of the emergency, and it is equally obvious that I have no power to pledge the Dáil which will then be in existence, to any particular course of action; but I wish to place it on record that, in my opinion, if the situation which I foresee arises it is inevitable that suitable legislation should be passed to enable the question of the taxation liabilities of companies in respect of excess <Col N="2292" /> profits made since the emergency to be reviewed by reference to any such fall in the market value of stocks following the end of the emergency period.  I hope that this statement will allay the apprehension on this subject which has hitherto existed.</P>
    <P>It has also been urged that the amount which is being taken from the new companies in taxation is too high, due to the substituted standard of 9 per cent. on issued capital giving an inadequate measure of the normal peace-time profits of these companies. I am quite unable to accept this contention. The point has been the subject of further careful examination this year and I am satisfied that the 9 per cent. standard gives a full and fair measure of the profits which these companies would have been making to-day if there had been no world war.</P>
    <P>That being so, is there any ground for the suggestion that these companies should be allowed some relief? The answer to this question depends, I think, on the standpoint from which one approaches it.  There is a large body of opinion which, considering the matter by reference to the effect of the taxation on the proprietors of all companies which are making excess profits, would say at once that the taxation is, in fact, too low.</P>
    <P>There is, however, the post-emergency standpoint.  Because of it, we have framed our legislation so as to leave to companies liable to excess corporation profits tax 25 per cent. of their excess profits, and have at the same time, by Emergency Powers Order, imposed a limit on the distribution of the profits of public companies to their shareholders.  Our policy in both respects has been dictated by the consideration that business concerns should be enabled to provide for the changed conditions that will arise after the war, and also to help in providing employment for our people then.  If there is anything further which we can do now to encourage employers to place themselves in a better position to give increased employment later on by extending their operations and to encourage the investment of further capital in Irish industries, <Col N="2293" /> it is desirable that it should be done.</P>
    <P>In the light of these considerations and of the special position of companies which have not been long established, I am prepared to grant some concession to new companies which are liable to excess corporation profits tax.  I want to emphasise the word &ldquo;concession&rdquo;.  I am satisfied that the substituted standard as it is at present enables us to arrive at a correct measure of these companies' excess profits and that the change I propose to make will have the effect of bringing into charge something less than the full amount of the excess profits of the companies which will benefit by the concession.  The concession will operate as from the 1st January, 1943, only.  From that date the substituted standard for new companies, that is to say for companies incorporated on or after the 1st January, 1934, will be 10½ per cent. of the issued capital instead of 9 per cent. as at present.</P>
    <P>It has been suggested that the substituted standard for old companies should be the same as for new ones. I am unable to accept this view.  Most of the older companies have had ample time to get past the period of growing pains and reach the stage of maturity.  Such companies, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, have no real ground for claiming any standard except a profits standard ascertained from their actual profits in peace time.  The great majority of them have, in fact, a good profits standard and very few of them have approached me at all.  In the case of one old company which claimed to be harshly treated, it was found that its best year for 19 years prior to the emergency showed a profit of only 6 per cent. on its issued capital, and under the law as it stands it had been allowed a standard of 7½ per cent. However, taking again the long view, and having regard to the fact that most of the comparatively small number of old companies which are on the substituted standard were not doing well prior to the emergency and that in the light of the considerations to which I have already referred there <Col N="2294" /> is much to be said for helping them to attain a more stable financial position, I propose to increase the substituted standard for old companies from 7½ per cent. to 9 per cent. of the issued capital.  I want to emphasise the fact that these concessions are not designed to enable shareholders to get bigger dividends; they are intended to encourage the companies which benefit by them to plough back into their businesses as much profit as possible and thus put themselves in a position to give increased employment after the end of the emergency.</P>
    <P>I estimate the cost of these concessions in a full year at about £30,000. The cost in the current year is not likely to exceed £5,000.</P>
    <P>One resolution relating to corporation profits tax will be submitted to the Committee.  Under the law as it stands a company which by its constitution is precluded from distributing any profits amongst its members is not liable to the tax.  A public company, the shareholders in which would naturally expect to receive dividends when profits were available, would not be likely to attempt to evade the tax by altering its constitution.  But a private company consisting of a few members could do so, for example, by altering its articles of association so as to prohibit the distribution of profits.  In due course, after the termination of the excess corporation profits tax it could again alter its articles so as to permit the distribution of profits, and during the intervening period its proprietors could obtain by way of loan from the company what they were precluded from obtaining by way of dividends.  It is proposed, accordingly, that a provision precluding distribution of profits which was not embodied in the constitution of a company prior to to-day's date shall not operate to take the company outside the scope of the charge to corporation profits tax.</P>
    <P>There are a number of other minor changes of taxation involving resolutions which I will describe briefly.  The first relates to the income-tax code.  A section was passed in 1941 to enable a <Col N="2295" /> measure of relief from double taxation to be given to individuals who are domiciled and resident in this country after a period of residence overseas in a country within the British Commonwealth of Nations or in the United States of America in respect of income derived from such country.  It has been found that on a certain interpretation of this section the recipient of such relief might be left in the position that the total amount of income tax borne by him on the foreign income would be less than one of our own citizens would pay in Irish tax alone on income of the same kind arising in this country.  It is proposed to include in the Finance Bill a section to prevent this.</P>
    <P>The next change relates to excise. I propose to abolish an exemption from entertainments duty which is available for entertainments promoted for partly educational purposes. The concession is too wide and costs about £7,000 in a full year.  Provided that any portion of the proceeds of the entertainment, however small, is devoted to purposes of education, exemption must be granted in the present state of the law.  The entertainments affected are of various descriptions but cinematograph exhibitions predominate.  Complaints have been received from proprietors of ordinary cinematograph concerns that the exemption confers an unfair advantage on the exempt houses and it is agreed that these complaints are reasonable.  In future, exemption will be granted in advance in respect of entertainments (1) which are promoted for wholly educational, philanthropic or charitable purposes, provided no expenses are incurred in respect of the entertainment, or (2) which are wholly of an educational character, or (3) which are promoted by an organisation such as the Gaelic League, the primary object of which is the extension of the use of the Irish language. Where an entertainment is promoted for wholly educational, philanthropic or charitable purposes and the expenses are to be paid out of the takings, duty will be payable, but it <Col N="2296" /> will be repaid if it is shown that the expenses did not exceed 30 per cent. of the takings.</P>
    <P>Provision will be made to remove any doubt as to the liability of dances to entertainments duty in so far as the attendance comprises dancers as distinct from spectators.</P>
    <P>Further resolutions will provide for a charge of duty on excise licences for the sale of intoxicating liquors and tobacco on passenger aircraft.  The yield of revenue will be negligible.</P>
    <P>We are now in a position to strike the final balance.  The cost in the current year, £5,000, of the concession announced re excess corporation profits tax will be met by an increase of equivalent amount from the adjustment referred to in entertainments duty.  The only other addition to revenue which I propose to make is the sum of £100,000 which, following precedent, I feel justified in taking as a contribution from the Road Fund.  The deficit of £3,655,000 in the national accounts which we arrived at earlier is reduced thereby to the figure of £3,555,000, and I cannot see any way of providing this further sum otherwise than by borrowing.</P>
    <P>The past year has seen the enactment by the Oireachtas of the Central Bank Bill.  This measure has come at an opportune time as war conditions create for all countries, whether belligerent or neutral, acute strains on the economic situation of which the combined effect is most readily apparent and most directly transmitted to the whole community through the currency system.  It is valuable for us in such conditions to have improved the technique of our monetary administration so that it will assist in protecting our people as far as possible from the loss and suffering which a time of war inevitably entails even for those who try to keep aloof from it. The dominant problem in the currency sphere is, of course, inflation.  We in this country retain from the last war and its aftermath some recollection of the evil effects of inflation, but we were fortunate then to escape its worst manifestations which have given other countries a salutary dread of courses <Col N="2297" /> that would favour its recurrence. Unlike that former occasion our fate to-day is largely, but not altogether, in our own hands and the degree of our success will depend much on our handling of forces within our own control.  In our case, as in that of other countries, the problem has a twofold aspect, being partly international and partly domestic.</P>
    <P>On the international side the high value of our external trade in proportion to our domestic trade necessarily gives us a keen interest in all that concerns the exchange value of our currency and in all that affects the value of the currencies of the countries with which we have important dealings.  The future course of sterling has a special interest for us as the sterling area is the chief destination of our exports as well as the main source of our imports.  Other currencies, however, and in particular the United States dollar are directly or indirectly of importance for our external trade.  In the last peace-time year, that is, 1938, there were 14 countries outside the sterling area with each of which we had an external trade of £250,000 or more, consisting predominantly of imports, our aggregate trade with these countries amounting in that year to a total of over £15,000,000.  In addition to these visible trade transactions we had large external dealings with sterling and other currencies arising from such matters as investment transactions, tourist traffic, emigrants' remittances and so forth.</P>
    <P>We have accordingly a close practical interest in the post-war outlook for the international monetary situation and in the various measures, particularly the British and American schemes, which are being discussed abroad in this connection for obviating those harmful currency disturbances which afflicted the world generally after the last war.  The exact nature of the ultimate problems that will confront the major external currencies cannot be foreseen while hostilities are still in progress.  There can be no doubt, however, that if, as must be hoped, economic progress is to be resumed <Col N="2298" /> after the war our concern with external trade and, in consequence, with international currency stability will be greater than before.  Our major task for the moment in this sphere must be to pursue a policy which will leave us in the most favourable position for taking our part in the resumption of external trade and for accommodating ourselves, so far as it may be advisable, to any measures that may be devised in relation to the currencies of countries with which we have important economic relations.</P>
    <P>In the actual mechanism of these external monetary affairs the central banks of the countries concerned have a task of growing responsibility.  In the international currency sphere the chief hope for the future seems to lie in the better realisation that some reasonable stability of exchange is of universal advantage and that co-operation for this purpose can be both feasible and effective.  In the creation of the Central Bank of Ireland we have equipped this State with the institution which is necessary in modern conditions to give such co-operation a practical form.</P>
    <P>On the domestic side the measure of our own responsibility in regard to the problem of inflation is greater.  In such a matter we are not and cannot be altogether free agents.  Our courses of action in currency matters, even within the State, have to take account of the facts of the outside world and of the necessities of our external trade and economic relations.  They must be such as to facilitate a prosperous export business by selling on terms that the outside market will accept and to permit of the acquisition from elsewhere of the numerous requirements of our import trade.  In essence, however, there is no conflict between our external and internal interests in this respect.  Inflation is injurious from either standpoint and although outside forces beyond our reach may sometimes encourage it the internal factors which we should ourselves be in a position to control are the more decisive.</P>
    <P>Broadly and essentially, inflation is an increase, in terms of money, of <Col N="2299" /> prices, salaries and wages without an attendant increase of production on a sound and lasting basis.  While it is reflected partly in an increase of the volume of currency, the active causes which in the circumstances of this country are liable to promote inflation are largely those which operate directly in the agencies determining the current levels of prices and wages. It is, therefore, of the highest importance that the various guaranteed and controlled prices should be kept within due limits from which too abrupt a recession will not become necessary after the war.  Wages or salaries likewise cannot safely be left to climb unchecked with the prospect of rendering insoluble the serious problems of unemployment and high manufacturing costs which would aggravate the post-war economic position.</P>
    <P>In regard to the physical volume of production during the course of the war we have statistical evidence which throws sufficient light for practical purposes on the broad course of events. In the sphere of agricultural output it would seem that, notwithstanding compulsory tillage and high prices, the general volume of production has not altered much.  As regards industrial output the latest available figures indicate that the volume of output of industries producing transportable goods has fallen by some 20 per cent. since the beginning of the war.  This takes no account of, amongst others, the highly important building industry where the decline has been much heavier.  This position as regards the change during the emergency in the general volume of economic output is in strong contrast with the upward movement of prices and also, though to a less extent, of wages.</P>
    <P>The cost-of-living index has risen by about 60 per cent. since the outbreak of war.  This figure is affected in a high degree by the rise in the cost of food.  The result is accordingly in correspondence with the movement shown by the index numbers of agricultural prices.  The rise in the agricultural price index in the same period has been approximately 75 per cent.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2300" /> A study of banking figures suggests that the impetus to these increases has not its origin in the banking system. Bank deposits within the country have increased during the war by about 40 per cent.  They have not, however, been reflected in any expansion of internal bank credit as the total of loans and advances within the country from commercial banks actually shows a decline of more than 10 per cent. since the outbreak of war.</P>
    <P>The problem of dealing with inflation, therefore, is largely a matter of maintaining adequate checks on the demands so frequently made for higher prices and wages.  In the case of primary products in particular the lesson to be drawn from the figures is that producers must turn their minds away from subsidies, guarantees and other adventitious aids and look especially to improved output and efficiency to carry them through the difficulties of the remaining war period and of the time of strain which must follow it.  This becomes all the more necessary in view of the high level to which taxation has been forced by the pressure of circumstances and from which, if only in the interest of employment, some relief will be imperative when the period of emergency expires.</P>
    <P>Such is the picture of the State's financial position that it is my privilege to present to the nation's representatives to-day.  My review may not be a very inspiring or exhilarating one but I submit that it reveals our financial position as sound.  Even though our Budget be balanced by borrowing, the ratio of borrowed money is not excessive if we compare it with the ratio adopted by any of the small neutral States of Europe since war began to rage around us.  If we can escape with this low ratio from now till peace is restored to the world we can count ourselves, financially speaking, not unfortunate.</P>
    <P>I anticipate that critics will-take full advantage of this opportunity to point out many things for which no financial provision or inadequate provision, as they may claim, has been made.  So be it.  I, for my part, make bold to say <Col N="2301" /> that the financial dispositions I have set before you for this year offer to all sections of the community and the various economic interests a fair apportionment of the State's available financial resources.</P>
    <P>We are passing through most difficult and dangerous days.  We cannot foresee how long this period of stress and strain may last.  Nor can we be certain that even more trying times may not be before us.  It is the Government's duty to watch and guard with paternal solicitude the interests of all the citizens but in particular to be anxious as to the welfare of those on whom the hardships incidental to this emergency press with greatest severity.  I suggest that the disposition of our finances which I have outlined proves that the Government has not, within the measure of its resources, been unmindful of its duty or its responsibility to any section of the community.</P>
    <P>Wise planning and prudent statesmanship have helped us to remain outside the world-wide holocaust thus far. May it please God to keep us under His all-powerful protection at peace with all the world till the time of danger has passed.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>The main characteristic of the Budget in connection with which the Minister has just made his statement is, of course, its size.  Even with the taxation which is now in force &mdash;and it never was higher in the history of this State&mdash;the bill is not met.  Whatever criticisms may be urged in this connection, it will be conceded that the Government entered into office in this State charged, according to itself and to all its undertakings, to promote trade and to stimulate employment.  Everybody, not only in this country but outside it, realises the great difficulty there is in providing employment for the people. In addition to their responsibility for stimulating trade and helping to swell the number of persons in employment, since the emergency the policy of the Government has been directed towards securing, maintaining and regulating supplies, controlling prices and dealing generally with the administration of those activities which arise from the emergency.</P>
      <P>In so far as this Budget before us to-day is concerned with the expenditure that has been added for these purposes, the House has reason to be dissatisfied with the result, if we exclude entirely from our consideration now the war period and take the effect of Government policy on employment. They were apparently dissatisfied with the expansion of employment taking place in this country prior to their taking office.  In the last five years of their predecessors in office&mdash; the years 1927 to 1931&mdash;an additional 57,000 persons were added to the numbers in employment, or an average of 11,400 per year.  Take now what has happened from 1932, each year inclusive, down to December, 1939. The addition that was made in those eight years was 75,000, or an average of 9,025 per annum.  Therefore, they were 2,000 per annum under the pace of acceleration of their predecessors. Had they been able to keep up the pace of their predecessors, there would have been on December 31st, 1939, 16,200 extra persons in employment in this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2304" /> The most disturbing feature of these statistics&mdash;which are to be obtained in Government publications&mdash;is that, in the last of those two years&mdash;that is, 1938 and 1939&mdash;only 1,000 additional persons were added each year to the roll of those in employment.  That information will be found in the Statistical Abstract for 1942, published by the Department of Industry and Commerce, page 104.  Had trade been stimulated, had employment been increased, had supplies been maintained and prices kept under control, this Budget, notwithstanding its size, would have had at least one plea of justification for it.  One of the most depressing of all publications issued by the Government is that dealing with our trade.  Before this Government entered into office, they complained about the fall in trade.  One Minister recently asked if I were aware that the total trade of this country had gone down by £20,000,000 in the last year. I am not aware of it; it went down by about £15,000,000.  The best year of trade that we have had&mdash;including the war years, when prices are up, and when the index of prices is far in excess of what it was some ten or 11 years ago&mdash;and the best year that the Government has been able to show, is still £7,000,000 under the worst year of the previous administration.  That is a matter from which we derive no satisfaction.  Considering that that particular drop in the acceleration pace of persons going into employment was marked as long ago as 1938, one would have expected that some special attention would have been directed towards the policy of the Government with a view to improving it, rectifying whatever was wrong and improving, above all, the most important and the most exhaustive store for expanding employment, namely, agriculture.</P>
    <P>I would say this for the Minister's Budget speech: it is, probably, the best he has delivered up to this.  It faces up to a difficult situation with, perhaps, more candour than has distinguished some of the previous Budgets to which we have listened.  I would remind him, however, that if he looks up the Banking Commission Report, he will find this reference, in paragraph 278:&mdash;</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2305" />&ldquo;It may be, perhaps, added that the wild inflationary movements which have been witnessed after the war have not been due, in the degree that is commonly believed, to excessive lending by private credit institutions, but to other causes and essentially to an abuse of credit powers for meeting State expenditure... The fall in prices tends to increase the real burden of debts, to arrest economic activity, to intensify trade depressions, and cause widespread unemployment, equally undesirable from an economic, social and moral point of view.  A fall in production and a shrinkage of national income, though unequally distributed, must to some extent affect all classes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>When we lecture other people about the dangers of inflation, and while we take steps to prevent inflation as far as the activities of other persons are concerned, the efforts of the Government in that direction have not been marked with any degree of success. No private person since the beginning of this war has been borrowing money at the pace at which the Government has borrowed.</P>
    <P>If we take any sphere of activity to which one would expect them to pay more than usual attention during the last few years it is the rise in the cost of living.  Let us compare the cost of living in this country with what it is across the water.  I think the rise in food prices has been claimed by the Minister for Finance in Great Britain as not having exceeded 30 per cent., and it is at present as low as 20 per cent.  The cost of living here, according to the Minister's statement, has increased by 60 per cent.  It has certainly increased by over 50 per cent. of what it was when hostilities broke out. It is in that direction that I would advise that even greater precautions should be taken than in many others that have been mentioned.  In the course of his statement the Minister said that the agricultural index figure had gone up about 75 per cent.  It is a relative figure, which has probably gone up 75 per cent. from the outbreak of war down to the last date on which <Col N="2306" /> the index figure was published for December, 1942.  The average for 1939 was under 121.  The average for 1942 was not quite 83, so that the increase in the index value would be only about 50 per cent. instead of 75 per cent. Times are difficult.  Nobody will deny that, but it does appear to us that responsibility for a good deal of the disturbance, for the lack of provision of essential commodities, and the increase in the cost of living can be traced to the Government by their action or inaction during the last few years.  There is no reason why, in a time of emergency, with practically every power that the Government sought granted to them, the House should not be taken into the confidence of the Government.</P>
    <P>Let me take one case that was mentioned here during the last two or three years, the Stabilisation of Wages Order No. 166 and all its amendments. Why should not a case for that be made in this House?  Would it not be fairly considered?  Would not recommendations be made to the Government? Were they not told, before taking up the flat-footed attitude of allowing no increase, that there should be some Department of State to which applications could be made in certain circumstances? This is a time in all countries, whether neutral or belligerent, when there should be co-operation in the representative institutions, in the way of bearing whatever burdens fall on the Administration.</P>
    <P>There has been no reluctance in this country to share those burdens, but there has not been candour or approach on the part of the Ministry to the House and, as a consequence, we have a whole series of orders, regulations and things of that sort which are made in the vast majority of cases without consultation with the persons concerned.  Nothing could be more irksome or more objectionable.  Perhaps it is too late now for the Government to mend its ways in that respect but, whatever time there is left for doing so, it would be well before further action is taken in connection with interference with trade or business that there should be consultation.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2307" /> Have we not good reason to be dissatisfied with the sum and substance of the Government's embarkation on the provision of fuel when it costs this State 87/6 per ton?  People outside are sometimes amazed when they hear that turf is costing 87/6 for a ton.  It is dear at 64/- but what about 87/6? The quality is unsatisfactory&mdash;highly unsatisfactory&mdash;and all the satisfaction one gets when complaints are made is a sharp answer from the Minister or something of that kind.  We may have questions of high policy in international affairs, and high sounding terms of one kind or another but what concerns the majority of the people in this State are supplies, and nearly everywhere we hear dissatisfaction with regard to the shortage that prevails, with regard to the high prices of things that are available.  Of all countries in the world there is now a shortage of potatoes in the City of Dublin.  Although reference has been made already to these matters when dealing with the Estimates, I repeat, we are dissatisfied for these reasons with the action that has been taken. We are satisfied that with the amount of money available and at the disposal of Ministers there ought to have been better results.</P>
    <P>The last thing I have to say concerns a matter that was put before me by an income-tax expert, who complains that there are occasions in connection with which this charge falls, when it is practically impossible for people in business to keep track of the manner in which the charges are made.  He says that in the case of an individual trader surtax or ordinary excess tax is not considered until about June, 1943 in respect of profits made in the year ending 31st December, 1941.  He says that these people will almost have forgotten the figures which have very puzzling permutations.  The worst feature is that surtax is not assessed until the fall of 1943 and is not payable until January, 1944.  Why legislation is framed in this manner, he observes, is a mystery and he says that in case of taxation imposed in a neighbouring country there is a simplification of the charge without any hangover from <Col N="2308" /> December, 1941 to December, 1943.  I shall give the Minister particulars of the case if he wishes.</P>

      <P>In the course of his lengthy introductory speech the Minister as if suffering from the results of introspection in respect of the Budget, said that his review of the nation's finances and its general outlook might not be inspiring or exhilarating. In saying that, the Minister said the truest thing that has ever been said in connection with an economic or fiscal review of the nation's affairs because, indeed, the Minister's review was neither inspiring nor exhilarating.  The Budget was most colourless, the most unimaginative, and certainly the most disappointing Budget, introduced in this House for the last 11 years.</P>

      <P>It is not an election Budget.  You will get your walking papers on this Budget far more quickly than you would have got them before it was introduced.  I take the view that taxation in any country, if commonsense is exercised, must be related to the productivity of the nation, to the national income in goods and services and must take cognisance of the standard of living of the people. We have got therefore to view this Budget in the light of the circumstances in these spheres.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="2309" /> What is the position to-day?  It is not necessary for me to assert what the position is.  The Minister has reviewed the position in the course of his statement and, for the purposes of my remarks, I can accept the Minister's statement.  The Minister has told us that notwithstanding compulsory tillage and what he described as the high prices for agricultural produce, there has not been much alteration in agricultural output in 1943 as compared with 1937.  In the four years of the war we have not increased to any material extent the agricultural output of the country.  In other words, production in agriculture is stagnant to-day.  Is it any wonder it is stagnant?  Whilst we might have been unprepared in the first year of the war, whilst we might have been caught on the wrong foot as it were in the first year and suffered the repercussions of that in the second year of the war, this is not the first or the second year of the war.  This is the fourth year of the war and one would have imagined that our agricultural activities would have been geared up sufficiently to ensure that we would be producing to-day the maximum quantity of agricultural and dairy produce from the 12,000,000 acres of arable land available for cultivation in this country.</P>
    <P>What is the position?  In the fourth year of the war with all the Governmental approbation of increased agricultural activities, we find in this predominantly agricultural country, a shortage of butter, a shortage of sugar, a shortage of flake meal, and now, paradox upon paradox, a shortage of potatoes in a country that has been always famous for the production of potatoes.  We had potato queues in the last two weeks in Dublin.  Last year we had bread queues, and the Minister for Supplies then told us that there was plenty of bread, but that the people were looking for hot bread.  I suppose the Minister for Agriculture will explain the potato queues this year by saying that the people want hot potatoes or new potatoes.  However, that is the position, that in the fourth year of the war in this predominantly agricultural country there is a shortage <Col N="2310" /> of agricultural produce, and, so far as one can judge from the answers received from the Government Benches to questions in the House to-day, there is not much hope of any improvement in the position in the near future.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Industry and Commerce has told us that there has been a 20 per cent. fall in the output of industry in the country.  The same Minister also told us that there had been an increase of 60 per cent. in prices. That percentage increase is arrived at by adopting the limited medium of measurement used in the compilation of the cost of living index figure, but everybody knows that certain commodities, commonly used in households, have increased by much more than 60 per cent., fuel being an outstanding example.  Wages have increased in twelve industries engaged in the production of transportable goods, according to the Minister, by not more than 9.4 per cent.  While prices have risen by 60 per cent., wages &mdash;the passport to goods and services and to a civilised standard of living&mdash; have increased by 9.4 per cent. according to the Minister for Supplies.  As if that were not sufficiently gloomy, we have the further paramount fact that we still have in the country 80,000 unemployed persons, with thousands not registering at the exchanges because of the miserable pittance which they get there, and this notwithstanding the fact that during the past two years we have exported approximately 100,000 people to the Six Counties and to Britain, and also notwithstanding the fact that approximately 40,000 young men have joined the Army.  In a condition such as that&mdash;agricultural output stagnant, industrial output down by 20 per cent., prices up by 60 per cent., wages increased by less than 10 per cent., 100,000 of our population gone out of the country, and 80,000 unemployed still at home&mdash;in this type of national workhouse we proceed to earmark £4,000,000 a year for the service of debt.  I wonder could anyone imagine any more cheerless or depressing picture than that revealed by the Minister's statement?</P>
    <P>The Minister referred to the fact that considerable expenditure on social <Col N="2311" /> services was necessary.  That is true, but even that expenditure is inadequate for the problem that has to be dealt with under our scheme of social services here.  Our social services are not in themselves virtuous things.  They are rendered necessary because of the inability of the citizen to make provision for his own needs. When we have a situation in which 80,000 people are denied an opportunity to create wealth, to earn wages that will enable them to buy food and provide clothing and shelter for themselves and their families, it is inevitable that the State will be compelled to enact legislation which will provide some type of relief for the unfortunate citizens who are affected by prevailing conditions in the country, We have to make provision for national health insurance benefit for sick people, the sickness being brought on by malnutrition which, in turn, is brought about by unemployment.  We have to make provision for unemployment insurance benefit and for unemployment assistance benefit for the simple reason that we have not organised the nation in such a way as to provide regular employment for all our people.  If we could do as the Government promised to do in 1939, abolish unemployment, if we could organise the nation on the basis of providing fulltime regular employment for all our citizens, then it would be possible to avoid the expenditure which is now necessary on social services because of our failure in that respect.  The best way of economising on wasteful expenditure is to provide regular employment for our people at decent rates of wages.</P>
    <P>The victims of our present system of society, those who are sick through malnutrition, those who have to go to the labour exchanges for the small pittance they receive there, those who have to look for food vouchers and fuel vouchers, do not desire those methods of assistance at all.  They are driven to accept them because of the failure of the State adequately to organise the resources of the nation or to utilise the wealth-producing capacity of its citizens.  Those people would prefer to be able to make provision for themselves, <Col N="2312" /> to be able to earn a decent living and provide themselves with the necessaries of life.  If they are not able to do that to-day, it is because of the failure of this Legislature to provide them with the opportunity of doing so. When the Legislature fails to provide them with that opportunity, the least it can do is to provide social services for them.  Although we are spending, as I have said, a large sum on social services, we are not spending half as much as the situation demands to-day, having regard to the condition of tens of thousands of our people.  The Minister deplored the fact that large numbers of persons are looking to the State to assist them instead of making provision for their own needs by individual or co-operative efforts.  I would suggest to the Minister, if he desires to pursue that line of argument, that he can best give a lead to citizens to turn away from complete dependence on the State to reliance on their own efforts by giving those people an opportunity of earning their own living instead of compelling them to look to the State for food vouchers, fuel vouchers, or those other artificial sources of assistance which must be made available to them to-day because of their inability to provide those goods and services for themselves.</P>
    <P>I was most disappointed with that portion of the Budget which referred to family allowances.  All Parties in this State, and indeed all progressive-minded citizens in this State, are in favour of the introduction of a scheme of family allowances, so as to make sure that parents who are blessed with large families will have an opportunity of rearing them in decency and comfort instead of being compelled to rear them under circumstances which do not permit of good physical development or good educational or cultural development.  It was disappointing to me, and I think it will be disappointing to the country to learn that in the current financial year we will not have a scheme of family allowances, and from the Minister's statement in that connection I take it that it will probably be far into the next financial year before a scheme will emerge in a form suitable for application here.  I think the Minister might well have <Col N="2313" /> pressed forward the introduction of a scheme of family allowances, which, as I have said, has been advocated by all Parties in the State and by many citizens in the State.  The introduction of such a scheme would I think do more than anything else that is immediately practicable to take up the sag in low wages in agriculture and in other industries and services throughout the country.  Before the debate on the Budget concludes, I hope the Minister will be able to give the House some indication that the introduction of a scheme of family allowances will be pressed forward with vigour, and will be introduced with the least possible delay.</P>
    <P>Here and there in the course of the Budget statement the Minister touched on post-war planning and our relationship with the post-war world, from the standpoint of our trade relations and from the standpoint of our financial relations with other countries, whether they are in the dollar bloc or in the sterling bloc.  As I listened to the Minister's statement in that connection, I was hoping that he would pull back the curtain and give us some picture of the post-war world for which the Government are planning, but not once in the course of a very lengthy speech did the Minister reveal any plans for the post-war period, or give any indication that the Government recognise the necessity for planning to meet the situation which will arise in the immediate and ultimate post-war years.  In every country in the world, post-war planning is rightly occupying a paramount place in the consideration of matters of national importance affecting those countries.  Whatever may be the position here behind the scenes, the public at all events are not being told much as to what the Government contemplates doing in respect of the post-war years.  I said at the outset that the Minister himself had confessed that his Budget was neither inspiring nor exhilarating.  As I have said, that statement by the Minister was perfectly true.  I think it is a colourless Budget.  I think it is a stale Budget.  I think it shows no appreciation whatever of the difficulties through which the nation is passing, <Col N="2314" /> and offers the people no policy calculated to rouse them or to brace them for the tasks which inevitably must fall on any people in a time of crisis, in a time of war.  All I have to say in conclusion is that if the staleness and want of imagination shown in this Budget is the best that the Government can give us, then an election to give us a fresh Government has much to commend it to the people.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  I think the House will be generally agreed that at the forthcoming general election every effort should be made to facilitate the electorate in voting, and that, in order that there should be a full poll, every elector should know where he is to vote.  Very considerable changes, however, have been made in the scheme of polling districts and polling places which hitherto was in force and no doubt a great many electors will be affected by these changes.  We have tried, of course, to appoint a polling place within easy reach of every elector, but, as I said, unless an elector is made aware of his new polling place, there may be a great deal of confusion.  Accordingly, it is proposed in this Bill to require the returning officers in all constituencies to send a card to each voter telling him or her where he or she is to vote, with information as to his or her number.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill is a very short one. Section 1 contains the necessary definitions. Section 2 requires that at a general election held during the emergency, whenever an election in a constituency is contested, the returning officer shall send to each voter, other than a person who is entitled to vote by post, a card setting out the number of the elector in the register of voters and the place at which he is to vote.  Postal voters, that is to say, members of the Defence Forces on full pay, will not require this information as they will have already been told that they vote by post.  The form of the card will be prescribed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and its form will be such as to make it clear that the card which a person may receive carries no entitlement to vote and is sent to him merely for his information, that it gives no entitlement to vote <Col N="2322" /> and is no proof of his identity. Presumably, he may take it with him to the polling booth in order that he may tell the polling officers what his number on the register is and enable them quickly to identify him, but I want to make it quite clear that the form of the card will be such as to leave no doubt in the mind of any person who can read or write that the card is not an identity card and that possession of it does not carry any entitlement to vote.</P>
    <P>Under Section 3, the expenses incurred in issuing the card will be the expenses of the returning officer for the purposes of the election.  They will be a charge on the Central Fund and will be regulated by scales made by the Minister.  It is anticipated that due care will be exercised by all returning officers in the preparation and issue of the cards and by the post office in their delivery, but a guarantee to exclude any possibility of error could not be given.  For instance, a mistake might happen in directing a particular card&mdash;although I think it is rather unlikely that such a mistake would not be detected in time.  If, however, such a mistake should not be detected in time, as a result it might be held that the election was not in accordance with the law.  That might lead to the raising of an election petition, and the purpose of Section 4 is to prevent an election petition being put forward as a result of failure to deliver a polling card.  I should like to point out, in this connection, that we are not making any change so far as Section 5 of the Electoral Act of 1923 is concerned, and candidates will still be entitled to send polling cards by post, if they wish to do so, but I take it that it will not be necessary to send them so long as the number on the register is correct.  The main purpose of the Bill, as I have already said, is to give, in the most precise manner possible, a clear indication to every elector as to where he is to vote.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>We have no objection to this Bill, but it seems to us that such a Bill should contain in a Schedule to it a copy of the form which is to be sent out to the electors.  It <Col N="2323" /> says here that it shall be left to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health to prescribe the form in which the polling cards shall be sent out by the returning officers.  I think that that is a departure from the ordinary procedure.  I can quite understand that there are certain difficulties due to the present emergency, but I should like to ask the Minister whether he has had the prescribed form drafted and, if so, whether he would not be prepared to put it in a schedule to the Bill when it goes to the Seanad.</P>

      <P>Very good, because I think it would be more satisfactory to do it in that way, instead of leaving it to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health.  If the Minister would give us a description of the form now, and also tell us from what address it would be issued, and under whose name, it would be a help to this House with regard to what is going to happen.  We welcome the Minister's statement, that this is not intended to interfere with the ordinary rights of voters, and I do not think that anybody would expect it to do so, but this may cost some money and may be difficult to carry out.  So far as Dublin is concerned, at any rate, I think it will cost some money.</P>

In the various districts in Dublin, I understand that the returning officers are under a statutory obligation to inform, by post, the people who live in a particular street or district, and who are entitled to vote, the particular place where they are to vote, and also the table in the polling booth where they are to vote.  I suggest that it would be possible to economise in that direction, in paper and so on, if the Minister were to introduce an amendment relieving the returning <Col N="2324" /> officers of the obligation which they now have.</P>

      <P>This Bill is a welcome departure in so far as it indicates an effort on the part of the Minister to facilitate voters to cast their votes in the forthcoming election, but there are one or two points on which I should like to get some information.  For one thing, I should like to know whether the polling cards will be uniform for the whole country, and I think it would be well if the Minister would make available for this House a specimen of the polling card before the Bill reaches its final stage.

      <P>Will the Minister give us an assurance that the granting of this facility will in no way involve a curtailment of the amount of paper that might be available for the use of the various Parties taking part in the forthcoming election?  I have heard a suggestion that this Bill may be a forerunner to a severe rationing in paper that might be used by political Parties in the election.  I am not saying that that is so, but the suggestion has been made that numbers of individuals and Parties would be placed in a most disadvantageous position, as compared with the Government, so far as the election is concerned, inasmuch as the Government have at their disposal a newspaper with a very wide circulation, whereas other individuals or Parties have no such facilities.  Therefore, anything in the nature of a severe rationing of paper would operate to the great disadvantage of individuals or Parties opposing the Government in this election.  There is another point which I should like to refer to.  I think the Minister ought to avail himself of the earliest opportunity of impressing on the returning officers in Dublin and <Col N="2325" /> other cities the necessity of having the polling booths placed as near as possible to the residences of the voters.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think this is a good Bill, particularly in view of the alterations in polling places that have taken place, which would otherwise cause a good deal of confusion.  As a matter of fact, there was a considerable amount of confusion in some areas in the last local election.  People went to the polling booths to which they were in the habit of going to vote, and were turned away.  In many cases they resented being turned away and did not vote at all.  It is desirable, therefore, that this Bill should be put through before the election.  While it is a good Bill, as far as it goes, I think it could have gone a little further along the lines indicated by Deputy Dockrell, <Col N="2326" /> and that the card should state the names of the candidates and their Party affiliations.  It may be difficult in the forthcoming election for all Parties to secure an adequate supply of paper so as to put their viewpoint before the electorate.  For that reason a list of the candidates who had been nominated and their Party affiliations would be a guide to the ordinary elector who might otherwise, as a result of the present emergency, be unable to obtain the information which he would require.  The present provision of free postal facilities for the distribution of propaganda may be nullified to a great extent by the shortage of paper, but I think to an even greater extent by the shortage of envelopes. I think this Bill should be amended on the lines I have suggested, so that the electorate might be provided with the names of the candidates and their Party affiliations.  Some people might be inclined to suggest that the Bill should go further and give a little <i>resumé</i> of the policy of each Party, but I do not think that would be practicable.</P>

In Section 2, provision is made that the card should reach the electorate not later than three days before a poll.  I wonder would the Minister think of fixing a maximum period so as to reduce the possibility of cards being mislaid and provide a maximum period <Col N="2328" /> of eight or ten days and a minimum period of three days.</P>

It would certainly be a great facility to the electors at any time.  I deprecate any attempt to extend it in the form suggested by Deputy Cogan.  I personally would prefer to see it carried out without any identification whatever with any Party or any candidate.  I would prefer that it should appear to be a function of the returning officer, as a service to the voter, indicating to him that his number is such and such and that his polling station is such and such and that the cards should be completely dissociated from any one Party or from any relation with Government.  I think it should be a plain card telling the elector where to vote and his number on the register.  His duty as an elector ought to be his own and the functions of the Parties ought to be theirs.  If we were to go the distance suggested by Deputy Cogan and include a <i>résumé</i> of the policies of the different Parties, I think photographs should accompany them as well.  Personally, I believe it is much better to have just a plain card giving just the number and the polling booth.  I welcome the Bill.  I hope it will be passed without delay and I think it will serve a very useful function towards the electorate.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>A point was raised by Deputy Mulcahy in regard to the provision in the Bill that the form should be prescribed by the Minister. That is usual.  I think that the only printed form repeated in the Schedule to the Electoral Act is the form of the ballot paper, but other forms necessary for use during the course of the election are as a rule prescribed by the Minister.  I would not have any objection at all to accepting an amendment in the Seanad to include the form of the card except <Col N="2329" /> that we might find that we might have to depart from it in some minor particular and that might cause some trouble.  The form of the card has in fact been drafted.  At the top of the card, along the side, there would be the voter's number on the register. Underneath that there would appear that the card was issued by the returning officer.  On the back would be a formula something like this: &ldquo;This card does not entitle the person to whom it is sent to vote.  This card is not proof of the identity of the person in whose possession it may be.  The number in the register and the polling place of the person to whom the card is addressed are as stated on the face of the card.&rdquo;  That would be the general form of the card that we propose to send out.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If it were worded exactly like that, it might be so negative as to persuade him he had not a vote at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think so. We want to make sure that people who get the cards will understand their position.  Any person who has had experience of elections knows what happens. A person comes in with a card issued by a political Party.  There may be a mistake in the address on the card, probably it may have got into wrong hands but the person presenting it may consider that because the card is sent to him he is entitled to vote. We want to let the person know where he is to vote and to know his number on the register, because that facilitates the polling officials, but we do not want him to be under any misapprehension whatever that, simply because a card of this sort falls into his hands, he is entitled to vote and to kick up a row if he is not allowed to vote.  It does emphasise that the mere possession of the card does not carry any entitlement to vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The cards will be uniform.  The idea is that we should have them printed in bulk in Dublin.  The Stationery Office will have them printed and the <Col N="2330" /> requisite number will be sent to each returning officer.  It is not proposed to put on the card any more information than I have mentioned.  We could not possibly go to the length of putting down the names and addresses of all the candidates.  The names and addresses would not be known until the day of nomination.  The political Parties, as a rule, know their candidates in advance, but the returning officer cannot take cognisance of that fact, and, until a candidate is properly nominated, the name cannot be printed on the ballot paper.  It will be quite a difficult matter these days to get the ballot papers printed in time.</P>
    <P>As to rationing of paper, this card arrangement is being done quite independently of any intention the Minister for Supplies may have with regard to the rationing of paper.  I do not know that he has any intention of rationing. I have not heard it suggested that there will be any definite allocation of paper to candidates or to Parties. Candidates will have to make sure that the printer to whom they entrust their printing for the election will have an ample supply of paper.  I do not see how the matter can otherwise be dealt with.  This card is being sent out solely with the desire of letting everybody who is entitled to vote know, in so far as it can possibly be done, where he is to vote.  In that connection I do not think I could accept Deputy Mulcahy's suggestion that we should amend Rule 17, because we should then be simply taking away with one hand what we give with the other.  As regards the lists of polling places, these will be issued by the returning officer and candidates require them as well as other people.  A considerable number of people are interested in these and I think it would not facilitate the general conduct of the election if we were to dispense with the existing provisions of Rule 17.  I would not welcome&mdash;in fact, I would resist&mdash;an amendment to relieve the returning officer of the obligation that rests upon him to print and publish, for the information of the general public at large, a list of polling places.</P>
    <P>Deputy Hannigan referred to certain matters which I would like to touch <Col N="2331" /> upon, although they are not strictly within the terms of the Bill.  I refer to them in order to clear up any public misapprehension.  It must be clearly understood that the responsibility for drawing up a scheme of polling places in any constituency rests with the local authority.  In the City of Dublin it is the Dublin Corporation that submits to me a scheme of polling places, and in a rural constituency it is the county council which draws up the scheme and submits it to the Minister for Local Government for ratification.</P>
    <P>As a rule, unless a not too detailed examination discloses that there are some glaring anomalies, or unless we receive representations from a substantial number of electors&mdash;I think the number is 30&mdash;we naturally accept the scheme which has been submitted to us by the local authorities.  On the other hand, I think, in relation to Dublin, from some things I have heard and seen, there would seem to be room for changes and, if a substantial number of voters are dissatisfied with the existing scheme of polling places, they can petition me and I think I have power to make changes to meet their point of view.  But time is getting very short and the register has soon to be issued. It is in course of printing now.  The number of changes it would be possible to make, even to meet what would appear to be a reasonable ground of complaint, may be very few, bearing in mind the limitations in regard to time under which we are operating.</P>
    <P>I think the point raised by Deputy Hughes was that we should try to ensure that the cards will not be posted so as to arrive so much before the day of the poll that they would be in danger of being lost.  I think we could not put a provision of that sort into the Bill and, anyway, I do not think it is necessary.  The general intention is that the returning officer will have all these cards in his hands addressed and ready to be posted on the day of nomination.  That means that they will arrive at their destination after the election is definitely on.  In any event, it is up to those interested in the election as candidates, or as members of the organisations concerned in the <Col N="2332" /> election, to ensure that the voters keep those cards carefully.</P>
    <P>It was suggested that this Bill should be made a permanent measure. I am afraid, in present circumstances at any rate, that the Minister for Finance would not agree to make this a permanent charge.  The Bill will cost about £20,000 and, although I think the £20.000 would be very well spent, particularly in the present circumstances, when so many necessary changes have been made in the old and accustomed places of polling, it might be a different matter if we were to have this £20,000 imposed on us at every election.  However, we shall see how it works out on this occasion.  It would be quite simple to bring in an amendment to delete the clause which limits it to the emergency.</P>

If Deputy Hannigan can get 30 electors to petition me in relation to the polling arrangements in the area to which he referred, I shall have the matter looked into.  In our preparations for this election, we have endeavoured to facilitate the voter so far as possible.  A general instruction went out to all concerned with the preparation of these schemes that, so far as possible, they should arrange that no voter should have to walk a greater distance than one-and-a-half miles to a polling booth.  It has not been possible in all cases to observe that instruction strictly.  However, a great change has been effected in the previous position, and that change is reflected in the fact that the number of polling places throughout the country has been increased by almost 40 per cent.</P>

      <P>I am opposed to increasing the life of the Dáil to a period of six years.  I do not think that the Minister gave any real reason for such an extension.  My recollection is that he referred the proposed extension to present circumstances.  But we have to look to the normal carrying on of <Col N="2335" /> political work.  Here, we have a democracy, with Parliamentary institutions clearly based on that democracy. We have the Dáil manned by proportional representation.  We have planned for the operation of Parliamentary institutions in a way in which Governments will not change very quickly or very often.  When you base your Parliament on a democracy and introduce the principle of proportional representation, you accept a position in which the electorate will be called upon only at stated intervals to decide who will represent them in the Parliament. In these circumstances, I do not think that anybody would suggest that the electorate should be called upon to act at less frequent intervals than once every five years.  On one occasion, I said that, when the Angel Gabriel was sounding the last trumpet, the Taoiseach would be asking for one minute more to give another explanation. I detect, in the suggestion made with regard to this additional year, the implication that everything would be all right if the present Government could only get another year in which to pull the strings together.  I do not think that we should carry on our business in that way.</P>
      <P>It would be a great mistake if Parliament were to last longer than five years in view of the foundations on which it rests.  I do not think that any wishes arising out of the weaknesses or dangers of the present position should drive us into taking a decision of that kind.  We are to have a new Dáil elected now.  It will live the early years of its life in rather difficult and exceptional circumstances. If the emergency continues and if there is any reason for extending the life of the Parliament, nothing that Parliament would consider necessary in that connection would be beyond its power.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The very fact that we are likely to be running into difficult circumstances would be one of the reasons why I would oppose an extension beyond five years.  There is no doubt that the strength of our institutions here arises out of the political understanding of our people and their general economic <Col N="2336" /> strength.  I think that we have departed more than is desirable in bringing our Parliamentary institutions farther away from the ordinary people. We have made representations here from time to time about the way in which the Government has strengthened its hands as against the people, the way in which the Government and the Government Party have refused practically to discuss various aspects of national policy.  That was reflected in Deputy Cosgrave's speech on the Budget to-day.  I myself have reiterated it again and again on various Estimates and in various discussions here.  We have weakened the strength of Parliament by the fact that policy has not been discussed openly and effectively here.  I think that the speech of the Minister for Finance to-day indicated that he and perhaps other members of the Government, now realise that they have gone too far in that direction.  At any rate, our political strength rests, and must rest, on our people as a whole.  It can only be really great if our people are closely associated with our Parliamentary institutions.  I think that at the present time it would be a disastrous thing to feel that we were asking the people, in the coming election, to elect a Parliament which they would have no control over for, say, another six years.  I think it is essential to make them feel that they have a certain type of institution here, and that the period will never be longer than five years within which they will be in a position to call that institution to account.  Therefore I am very much opposed to this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that Deputy Mulcahy has only been voicing his personal opinion, because I must admit that all my instincts are in favour of having a six year life for future Dáils. The life of the Tenth Dáil is now drawing to a close.  Twenty-four years ago last January the First Dáil came into being.  Therefore, the average life of Dáils to date has been something under 2½ years.  In my view anything that would help to increase that average should be supported.  I am hoping that in voting for a Dáil with a life of six years we may, at least, have one in the <Col N="2337" /> future with a life of five years.  In practice, this is the first time that a Dáil has run out its full course.  It went very near it once before when it ran for a period of, I think, four years and three months.  It is unlikely that, in the future, Dáils will run the full period of six years, but I think the provision should be there.</P>
      <P>We are now facing the end of the life of the Tenth Dáil.  There was considerable opinion throughout the country, with which I must say I do not agree, that the life of this Dáil should be prolonged.  I think it would be most undesirable that any Dáil should have the power to prolong its own life.  There is no such objection, of course &mdash; there cannot be &mdash; to this Dáil providing that future Dáils should have a longer life. It may be that we may find ourselves at the end of five years &mdash; after the next election&mdash;when it would be desirable that the Government in office should continue without a general election.  I think now is the time to make the provision, and, therefore, as far as I am personally concerned I certainly should like to be free to support this measure. I think that no harm can come of it. With regard to what Deputy Mulcahy has said about the people feeling that they will have no power or control over Dáils for six years to come, well, at any rate, if we do not make this provision they will not have that control for five years to come.  What extraordinary harm the adding of an extra year is going to do, I am afraid I cannot see.  As far as I am personally concerned &mdash; unless there is a Party decision to the contrary &mdash; I certainly am entirely in favour of having a six years' life for future Dáils, in the hope that we shall at least have Parliaments with a life of five years.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to appeal to some of the Deputies who have spoken to reconsider their view in regard to this Bill.  Unfortunately, I was not here when the matter was being discussed, and I was greatly surprised that there had been opposition taken to the Bill because, honestly, I thought that the attitude of the Deputy who has just spoken would represent, generally, the attitude of most experienced Deputies in the <Col N="2338" /> House.  My own connection with this matter, and my thoughts on it, go back to the time when we were considering the present Constitution here.  At that time Deputies may remember we extended the period of six years, which was the period prescribed in the old Constitution, to a period of seven years.  I think I pointed out that while we had no desire to extend the legal life of Parliament, as determined by the ordinary law, beyond the period of five years which was prescribed, that if a crisis should occur making, it extremely desirable to do so, that Parliament's power should not to unduly restricted by the Constitution: that there should not be hard and fast lines drawn by the Constitution at six years. Accordingly, we put it into the Constitution that the constitutional length beyond which it would not be permissible for Parliament to prescribe as the interval between Parliaments should be seven years.  Now, I have to confess that at the time what has been brought up very clearly during the present emergency did not occur to me.  Although I thought that in a crisis it would be desirable that Parliament should be able to extend its own life, it did not occur to me how extremely difficult it would be for Parliament to do that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that most people in the country would agree with the remarks made by the last Deputy and regret very much that we should have an election at this particular time.  Personally, if I did not see the great danger that would result from not having an election I would be of that opinion myself.  We are passing through dangerous times&mdash;there is no use in blinking the fact &mdash; and it gives a wrong impression, at first sight anyhow, to people to have an election in times like these.  They will think there are no dangers when the Government and all the activities of the State can be thrown into what they regard for the time being as a contest between Parties.  The position in which we found ourselves then was this, that if the Government, for instance, was satisfied that it was in the national interest that there should be an extension of the life of Parliament and attempted to have that put through <Col N="2339" /> against the will of the other Parties in the House, there would be the immediate feeling that the Government, in its own interests and not for the national good, was trying to lengthen its life.  And even if all the Parties agreed to extend the life of Parliament, even that was going to bring dangers with it because there are other groups outside who would say: &ldquo;It is the representation of Parliament as a whole that we want to have changed; we are not satisfied with the representation of the existing Parties.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>There may be other Parties outside who will say: &ldquo;We believe it is we who represent the people and that we should have representation in the Dáil. It is not satisfactory from our point of view that the Parties in the Dáil should agree amongst themselves that they will keep on as representatives of the people without consulting the people.&rdquo;  When we were bringing in the Constitution, although I thought of the possibility of a crisis in which it would be desirable not to have the power of Parliament limited too narrowly, I had not thought of the great difficulty of any Parliament extending its own life. Having decided here that we were to have an election because of the dangers attaching to not having an election, we were discussing some question &mdash; I forget exactly what it was&mdash;and it occurred to me that nobody knows how long the present war may last.  We do not know how intense and how dangerous the immediate emergency just after the war may be.  I thought it would be desirable, now that we have had the experience of what can happen, that we should at least not put the coming Parliament in perhaps the same predicament that we find ourselves in, and that therefore we should provide, in so far as we reasonably can provide, that the next Parliament would not have the same difficulty that we have and that at least they would be in a position to have a six-year period.  You may say: &ldquo;Why not make it a seven-year or an eight-year period&rdquo;?  or something else like that.  First of all, I think that for Parliament to extend the period mentioned in the Constitution would be disastrous.  I agree with <Col N="2340" /> Deputy Mulcahy that you cannot do that.  But, within the period in the Constitution, I think you can.</P>
    <P>I must say that I was not thinking of this merely because of the emergency because, although it is the emergency that brought it very forcibly to my mind, I have been thinking on exactly the same lines as Deputy Lynch has been thinking.  I did not go back so far as he did, but I counted up how many general elections we have had here since 1922.  We had one in 1923; we had two in 1927; we had one in 1932; we had one in 1933; we had one in 1937; we had one in 1938; and then we have the forthcoming election. That works out, I think, at about seven in a period of 20 years.  In other words, the average length of Parliament determined, not by the figure put in the statute as the maximum length of Parliament, but by the ordinal political position, has worked out at about three years.  I do not think that anybody would think it was desirable to have it as short a period as that. Therefore, with the idea of trying to lengthen out the average somewhat, it seemed to me that to extend it from five to six years would probably bring about something between four and five years as the average; that is, that the people would be consulted in a period between four and five years.</P>
    <P>Most of us are experienced in the business now and we realise that if there is an election due definitely within a certain period, as it is due this June, from the moment the election year comes in a certain amount of disturbance takes place.  You have the various Parties thinking in terms of Party, much more, in my opinion, than they are thinking of it at any other particular period of time, and there are measures which will not get the same type of consideration in Parliament in an election year that they would get in another year.  I think that there is always a portion of the year, anyhow, when a definite election is due as the result of Parliamentary provision, which is bad from the point of view of the conduct of business.  The result is that a Government having the interest of the people at heart try to anticipate that period, and you find that they do <Col N="2341" /> in fact go to the electorate earlier than the time provided for.  I can say for ourselves that if this had been an ordinary period we would have gone to the country and got the opinion of the people at an earlier period than the present.  It is the prerogative, I think, of the Taoiseach to decide matters of that sort, and I can say for myself that I certainly would have decided to appeal to the people earlier were it not for the emergency.  I felt, however, that during the emergency it would not be justifiable to go to the country any considerable time before the time we were bound to go by law.  That consideration would not have held in ordinary circumstances.  I do believe that the result of having a five year limit inevitably means that you never will get a longer period than about four and a half years, if you get that; and that for the other elections which are likely to take place, as they have taken place, as the result of the political situation in the country, the average will be very much less than four years.  If you do agree to put this in the statute, on the law of averages I certainly would be willing to wager that over a period of years the life of Parliament would not be five years, even when you have agreed to six years.</P>
    <P>This Bill was agreed to by the Government and was introduced.  As I say, I was rather disappointed to find that the attitude adopted towards it had not been such as was indicated by the last Deputy, which was my anticipation, because it seemed to me that all experienced Deputies would take that point of view.  Again I ask Deputies to reconsider their attitude towards it.  It is naturally the sort of measure upon which one would like to have agreement.  As was pointed out by Deputy Lynch, it cannot affect the life of the existing Parliament.  It has to be done in advance.  If this were an ordinary period, with the experience I have got as the result of this crisis&mdash;the experience we have all got &mdash;I certainly, for the ordinary public good, would introduce this measure as a measure, not for the emergency alone, but generally.  Even if it were to be introduced from that point of view, surely with the experience we <Col N="2342" /> have just had about the emergency, it would be desirable that it should apply to the emergency also.  Therefore, it should be introduced now to apply to the next Parliament rather than be introduced in the next Parliament to apply to the subsequent Parliament, because it has always to apply to the subsequent Parliament. Again I would ask Opposition Deputies to look at it from that point of view and to see whether the objections which they have indicated could not be waived.  I feel very strongly that it is in the public interest that the period of time should be lengthened by a year.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I support the view expressed by Deputy Lynch as I think it is very proper that the present Parliament, at the end of its days, should prolong the life of future Parliaments. No Party here can be accused of prolonging its own life, because nobody knows what is going to happen at the coming election.  Having heard the Taoiseach's views on this question, and his references to the present emergency, I appeal to him to reconsider the whole position, and with the leaders of other Parties in the House, see if it is not possible for all of them to sink their differences in the interest of the country as a whole.  Nobody wants an election at the present time. There is absolutely no doubt about that.  If the leaders of all Parties would sink their differences they might form a National Government.  As I pointed out previously the Taoiseach could look around and select the best brains in the House, in the Seanad, and even outside amongst business men&mdash;I am not saying that there are not plenty of good business men in the House&mdash;who cannot win an election but whose services to the country would now be very valuable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They are men whose views may not appeal to the country, or who may not have a national record to suit the area that they would wish to contest, and who would not be elected, but there are many big business men in Dublin and elsewhere whose services could be procured in view of the present scarcity, men who realise how essential it is to keep the attention of workers <Col N="2343" /> directed to the production of food and to the securing of materials to carry on industry.  I think it is a sin against the country to have an election during the present emergency.  That has always been my view since the emergency started.  I stated previously that no matter what Government is in power there will be certain elements outside who will say: &ldquo;Oh, you are afraid of the electors.  You are saving your own seats.&rdquo;  Big men in charge of the country's affairs should not allow that kind of talk to influence them.  It is right to postpone an election now in order to have 100 per cent. production of food, so that the attention of those engaged in such work should not be diverted from the serious dangers that face the country.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach has said here, and many others have said it outside and in the Lobbies, that an election now will arouse bad blood amongst some elements.  I feel that if there is an election in June, there will be another in November or December.  As no Party is going to secure a majority, there will have to be a combination whose life will not be a very long one. If the Parties are in favour of a National Government after the election why not now?  Why not give the country this message, that the big men in the Dáil&mdash;and the leaders are big men with a broad outlook&mdash;will at least sink their differences for the time being.  There is an atmosphere in the Dáil that one does not like to contemplate in regard to small matters. At college debating societies one hears this view expressed by youths: &ldquo;Ah, we are more interested in where we are going to get a living; what our profession is going to do for us; what appointments we can get.&rdquo;  One hears fathers and mothers asking about the future of their boys or girls.  They are not interested in elections.  Sometimes they say: &ldquo;Will you politicians stop talking and give us some hope by telling us what we are going to do with our children?&rdquo;</P>
    <P>If that is the attitude of people with sons from 22 to 25 years of age who have not yet earned 1/-, why should it not be heard in this House?  Why <Col N="2344" /> should I be afraid to talk about what might appear to be a small matter in the National Assembly?  In reality it is not a small matter, because it concerns the life that young people have to live when some of us will be gone, and when their security may not be safeguarded.  At the eleventh hour I earnestly appeal to the better sense of all Parties to agree to form a National Government in which every section would have representation.  In the first Great War Great Britain brought in as food controllers and coal controllers men who were not members of the House of Commons, and who were not the elected representatives of the people.  I want to know why we are not big enough to do that.  When the emergency is over, when the food supply is guaranteed, and when materials necessary to carry on industry are available, then six months after the emergency it could be said that the time had arrived to ask the people for their views, and to announce an election in which all Parties could go to the country and let it send back representatives of the people's will.  I hope it is not too late to appeal to the Taoiseach, to Deputy Cosgrave, to Deputy Norton and other Deputies who differed in the past to come together and to announce to the people the happy message that there will be no election.</P>

      <P>When Deputy Byrne was speaking he said that nobody wanted an election.  I want to disillusion Deputy Byrne at once, and to say that I am one person who wants an election.  I believe that those who want an election are in an overwhelming majority and that the reason why an election is wanted is because the Government has not been a success.  I believe that the affairs of this country are not being competently carried out at the present moment and, in consequence, I want the people to have their choice.  If the people think that the present Government is a good Government, it is for them to return that Government; if they think that the present Government is a bad Government&mdash;as I think&mdash;then it is the duty of the people to put the present Government out of office and let new <Col N="2345" /> men with fresh ideas discharge the duties which are now being discharged by those in office.  That is, I think, distinctly and entirely irrelevant to the matter under discussion, but when I heard the expression of opinion put forward by Deputy Byrne, I could not refrain from expressing my views, differing as they do <i>in toto</i> from his.</P>
      <P>As far as the Bill before the House is concerned, I am opposed to the lengthening of the life of Parliament beyond its present term of five years. We have wandered a very long way since the great democratic ultra-radical idea was embodied in the people's charter 100 years ago, which set England on fire and in which &ldquo;An Annual Parliament!&rdquo; was one of the great cries.  The radical idea in those days was that the people should have the opportunity every year to change the Government and that, when a Government showed itself incompetent to carry out its work, the people should be able to change it.  It is perfectly obvious that an annual Parliament was the view of doctrinaires. An annual Parliament would not allow any Government to do its work: it would mean that the eyes were on the coming election every minute and not on doing solid work for the State.</P>
      <P>The idea that Parliaments should not be unduly prolonged is, in my opinion, a sound idea.  A Parliament that has had five years of life has had every opportunity to show the electorate whether it is a good one or a bad one.  It has had plenty of time to evolve its policy and to put that policy into force.  On the other hand, when in this country a Parliament loses the confidence of the people, experience has shown us that there is never a swing round inside the House itself, as there is sometimes in the British House of Commons.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I use Great Britain as an example, because that country evolved the theory of Parliamentary government and all other representative Governments are more or less moulded upon that model.  In the British Parliament, when a Government begins to lose the confidence of the people, it loses the confidence of its own supporters in the House.  Governments <Col N="2346" /> which have large majorities on paper are beaten in the House and are compelled to resign.  Anybody who reads through the Parliamentary history of the 19th century in England will see many examples bearing out the truth of my words.  In this country, no matter what grave blunders the present Government might have committed&mdash;and I am taking a suppositious case now, for the purpose of argument&mdash;I do not believe that one single member of the Fianna Fáil Party would vote against them on a vote of confidence.  For that reason, the case for prolonging the life of Parliament in this State has nothing to be said in its favour and has a great deal to be thought and said against it.</P>
    <P>Surely, five years is quite long enough for any Government to be in office.  Allusions have been made to the fact that this is a time of crisis, that it is bad to have a general election in a time of crisis and, therefore, that there ought to be a lengthening of the life of Parliament in order that, if another period of crisis arose, Parliament would not have to be dissolved at the end of five years.  There is nothing in an argument of that nature. The crisis might arise at the end of the sixth year as easily as at the end of the fifth or at the end of the third year.  We never know when crises will arise.  Please God, in our time there never will be another emergency.  I have lived through two great wars. Unfortunately, the second great war is not yet over, but I certainly do not want to see another great war or another emergency.</P>
    <P>I cannot see the disadvantages of holding a general election during the emergency.  We are told it will arouse a lot of bad feeling.  There was a time when elections were very &ldquo;hot&rdquo; in this country.  That is not so now.  Were not the last two or three elections fought here the quietest elections that could be?  I have spoken already from the platform at several election meetings and have found everything quiet, peaceful and orderly, and not one sign of bad blood or of any undue arousing of the passions.  I have not seen passions aroused anywhere and until this election campaign is over I am <Col N="2347" /> perfectly satisfied that there will be no quarrelling and no successful incitement to passions.  When this election is over, the people having been given their choice and having selected those persons whom they think most fit to carry on the duty of government, the overwhelming number of the citizens elected to this Dáil will, I believe, give the Government a very fair chance. There will be very little, if any, danger of what Deputy Byrne seems to visualise&mdash;another election following close upon this one.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>I have a great deal of sympathy with the view expressed by Deputy General Mulcahy in aiming at the continuance of the five years' life of Parliament.  Personally, I think five years is a reasonable and happy medium to strike for a democratic parliament.  While we cannot have elections occurring frequently and hope to do any constructive business in between, it would be much worse to have an extension.  That would be against the best interests of the democratic system.  I would personally favour the three year election of local bodies and I believe that any deterioration that has taken place in recent years in local government is directly traceable to the fact that there have not been sufficiently frequent infusions of new blood into those bodies.  That cannot be related to the national Parliament.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>While I have a great deal of sympathy with the point of view expressed by Deputy Mulcahy, we must have regard to the speeches made by the Taoiseach and Deputy Lynch, that this is the only Dáil of the ten that has run its normal period of five years. The average that has been mentioned shows Dála to have a life of less than three years.  The Taoiseach argues, and so does Deputy Lynch, that the addition nominally of another year to the life of a five year Parliament might give us a prospect of an average of something round four years.  I do not know by what mathematical system we could work out what the tendency in future would be because I am not inclined to think that the nominal term <Col N="2348" /> of five years had very much to do with the calling of elections in the past. We had elections after Dála had been in existence for a few months&mdash;12 months, nine months or ten months&mdash; and it would be very difficult to relate the reasons for the calling of these speedy elections to the stated life of the Dáil as set down in the Constitution or in Acts of the Oireachtas.</P>
    <P>I am not inclined to think, from the history of the Dáil since it was first set up, that the adding of one year to the statutory period would result in giving a four years average as the Taoiseach expects it might.  One thing reasonably sure is that if a six years' life is permitted, you are not going to exceed an average of five years.  I think that is a reasonable assumption.  While I am anxious to preserve the right of resort to the electorate within a reasonable period, I do not think that the proposal to extend the life of the Dáil to six years should frighten Deputies because I do not think that it is going to be realised except in very special circumstances.  At the present time we have facilities in the Constitution to extend the life of the Oireachtas to seven years, but I think it would be most undesirable to operate that machinery because it would have to be operated by an existing Dáil to extend its own life.  That must be held to be objectionable.  I might mention that Deputy Byrne started off by stating that it was most objectionable for a Dáil to extend its own life, but he immediately asked the House to extend the life of the present Dáil indefinitely.</P>

      <P>I think it is much more desirable that a Dáil which is about to go out, feeling from experience, perhaps, that it would be a good thing <Col N="2349" /> if another year were added nominally to the life of Parliament, should extend the life of an incoming Dáil rather than that any future Dáil should attempt to extend its own life on the ground that an emergency was in existence. For that reason I have no objection to this Bill.  I am speaking personally on this matter; I am not expressing a Party viewpoint.  It seems to me that the principle of the Bill is less objectionable than a proposal by an existing Dáil to extend its own life, in that it permits a future Dáil to carry on its work for a longer period than is now permitted, if the interests of the people should appear to make that course desirable.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think that any case can be made for extending the life of the Dáil to six years.  Personally, I think that the weakest case that can be made for it is a case based on averages.  For the life of me, I do not see what averages have got to do with this question.  After all, it does not matter whether the life of the Dáil is a five year or a six year one.  Elections have been held in the past on short notice, and they would have been held at short notice irrespective of whether the statutory period of the life of the Dáil was five years or seven years.  Why then should we lay so much stress on averages?  If the case could be made that there was some occasion on which a certain policy had been put before the country, that it had been proved that a five year period was not sufficient to bring it to fruition, and that, therefore, on that score there was good reason for this proposal, something might be said for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But let us take the case of the present Government.  They have been in office since 1932.  I think the Taoiseach made the remark himself some time ago that he thought it desirable that the life of the Dáil should be extended so that the Government would have an opportunity of completing its programme in some period of years over five.  The present Government however has been in office for 11 years.  Surely in that period it should have been possible for it to complete its programme?  The country is <Col N="2350" /> about to judge that in the near future. I do not want to go into that now, but I do think that the Government has not made a success of its administration in 11 years, much less in six years.</P>
    <P>Although I do not agree with the proposal, an endeavour might be made to make a case for this proposal on the ground I have mentioned, but the extension of the life of Parliament for a further year does not appear to me to be sensible.  As the Leader of the Opposition stated here when this Bill was first introduced, there is always the great danger that when a Government is in office for a lengthy period, you will have a violent change at the end of that period.  If, as he pointed out on that occasion, there was a gradual change and if the people had an opportunity every four or five years to change the personnel of the Dáil, you would probably have much more of the old members coming back to resume the reins of office where they left off than if they had been in office for a lengthy period before.</P>
    <P>Deputy Keyes has mentioned that the addition of one year would not matter very much but taking two successive Dála, it would mean the addition of two years, an extension from ten years to 12 years, and if an unpopular Government were in office towards the end of that period, the electorate might be very glad to have an opportunity of expressing their views at an election at the end of, say, eight years or ten years at most.  If they had to tolerate that Government for another two years, you would probably have a very abrupt and violent change at the end of 12 years.  By this type of legislation you would probably create in the minds of the people a reaction against Parliamentary institutions altogether.  Under our present laws the people have a right to change the personnel of this House within, at most, five years and I think that right should not be taken from them. Deputy Byrne urged that we should have a National Government here and now but I think Deputy Keyes is right in stating that to do that you would probably have to extend the life of the present Dáil and that is a step which we are not entitled to take <Col N="2351" /> except in very extraordinary circumstances. Nothing that I have heard in support of the proposal to extend the life of this House beyond five years convinces me that a case has been made for it.  I think a period of five years is quite sufficient.  If the Government in office during that period feel that they are entitled to a <Col N="2352" /> further period in office they can go to the country and if the people think that they are entitled to another period they will elect them for a further five years period.  I think five years is quite long enough and I do not see any virtue or merit in the proposal to add another year.</P>

      <P>When I spoke a short while ago, I indicated that I was surprised by the speeches made on the previous occasion against it.  They completely surprised me because I thought that Deputies who had experience here would have taken the view which was in fact taken by a member of the Opposition Party, Deputy Lynch.  He anticipated the speech which I intended to make and made it almost in its entirety.  Deputy Keyes from the Labour Benches had a similar point of view, and Deputy Byrne&mdash;I do not know whether he is attached to any Party; I think he is an Independent member&mdash;said the same thing and I must say that I was altogether surprised that it was made a Party <Col N="2354" /> issue.  If there is strong objection to the Bill, I do not think it desirable that we should go on with it.  I think the proposition to which the House, by a majority, has agreed is in the best interests of parliamentary government in this country.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I did make the statement when I referred to this matter originally that if there was agreement, in view of the situation existing, I would have a measure of this sort brought in.  It was in consequence of that that this measure was brought in. I did not happen to be in the House when it was introduced, but there were some references to my statement and I came here to-day deliberately in order that if any questions were raised I would be here to speak about them. From the debate until the division was called, it seemed to me that it was not going to be taken as a Party issue. Apparently I was wrong, but I was not aware that I was wrong until I saw the voting in the Lobbies, because members of the different Parties had spoken in the same way as I spoke.</P>
      <P>Now the position is that if the Opposition Parties strongly object to the Bill, the Government will not proceed with it.  If they do not strongly object to it, if they are prepared to take the vote of the House as deciding the matter, it would be better to have all stages of the Bill as soon as possible, because there is a great deal of other work to be done in the time that is available.  If the Opposition Party were opposing it, I would decide, for no other reason than to save Parliamentary time, not to go on with it in present circumstances.  If there is objection to taking the remaining stages now, I will accept that as an indication on the part of the Opposition Parties that they do not want the Bill, and under these circumstances I would not proceed with it.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to make a few remarks in the same way as the Taoiseach made some remarks. The Taoiseach suggested that he did not dream that this was a Party issue. I do not know whether it was a Party issue as such.  In the first place, the Taoiseach indicated, when he originally referred to it some time ago, that if agreement could be got, he would introduce the Bill.  The Taoiseach sought for no agreement when he introduced it.  When it was introduced and discussed, my recollection is that both Deputy Cosgrave and Deputy Costello very vigorously opposed it, and that my parting remark on the last day the Dáil discussed it was a challenge to the Taoiseach to get a single member of the House, outside his own Party, who would support him in the matter.  That ought to have been a suggestion to the Taoiseach that there were serious differences of opinion, but in the meantime no attempt has been made by the Taoiseach to consult other Parties to see whether general agreement to the measure could be got.  There are, as I understand the position, a number of people in our Party at any rate from whom the Taoiseach could not get general acceptance of legislation extending at this particular hour of the life of this Parliament the life of subsequent Parliaments in this way.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what the Taoiseach intended, but what we understood was entirely different.  We understood that there would be some subsequent approach, but no such approaches were made, and perhaps if they had been made, there might have been an avoidance of the difficulties which have arisen to-day.</P>
      <P>So far as this Party is concerned, it is opposed to the Bill, but not with any great vehemence, because it does not seem to me to be a matter of major importance to-day, particularly in view of the problems surrounding us.  The Bill has no meaning whatever, and can have no meaning whatever until 1949, six years hence.  What matter to-day are the problems of to-day, of next week, of next month and of next year, and if this country can survive all the trials which beset it this year, and which will beset it every other year for the next five years, I imagine that, having had the ingenuity to get over all these difficulties during the next five trying years, it will devise some means by which it can hold an election in 1948 or 1949.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So far as the ordinary people of the country are concerned, the Bill is not worth twopence.  It has no importance, and it is not worth while reading it. It speaks entirely of what is going to happen six years hence.  What we are concerned with is what is going to happen six days hence or six hours hence.  As far as I am concerned, the Taoiseach can have the Bill a thousand times, but I object to it on <Col N="2357" /> principle, because I think such a measure is a burlesque of parliamentary government, and a waste of time of Government, particularly in an emergency of this kind.</P>

    <P>Tá obair Institiúid Ard-léighinn Bhaile Atha Cliath tar éis teacht chó fada ar aghaidh agus go mbíonn toradh an tsaothair le cur i gcló agus le foillsiú, agus is é an costas sin is fáth leis an méadú sa Meastachán ó £16,460 go dtí £17,250.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an Vóta do Bhun-Oideachas, is truagh liom é bheith le rádh go fóill nach bhfuil an lucht freastail chó líonmhar agus ba mhian linn; ach, mar sin féin, tá cuma níos fearr ar an scéal ná mar bhí le tamall maith de bhlianta.  O bhí bliain 1927 ann, bhí gnáth-líon na ndalta ag dul i ngainne; ach tháinig feabhas beag ar an bhfreastal i mbliain 1941-42.  Gan páistí coigríche do chur san áireamh, bhí 456,750 ar na rollaí sa mbliain sin&mdash; 750 níos mó ná mar bhí i mbliain 1940-41.  Cúis áthais an méid sin féin. <Col N="2361" /> ach dar ndóigh, is í an aimsir innseochas dúinn ciaca bhéas sé ina mhéadú buan nó nach mbeidh.</P>
    <P>Ar feadh na ndeich mblian seo caithte, ba é an freastal a bhí ann, ó 82 per cent. go dtí 84 per cent. den méid dalta bhí ar na rollaí; agus don tréimhse sin go léir, bhí an meán-fhreastal ós cionn 83 per cent.  Sa tréimhse céanna bhí an meán-fhreastal ó 84 per cent. go dtí 85 per cent. i gcás na ndalta a mbaineann an tAcht Freastail Scoile leo .i. páistí idir 6 bliana agus 14 bliana d'aois.  Sa mbliain do críochnuíodh an 30adh Meitheamh seo chuaidh thart, bhí 84 per cent. de mheán-fhreastal ann; agus do réir na bhfigiúr oifigiúil, do tháinig méadú ar an bhfreastal scoile sa mór-chuid de na contaethe agus na contae-bhuirgí.</P>
    <P>I gContae-Bhuirg Bhaile Atha Cliath, Choreaighe agus Phort Láirge, mar a bhfuil na coistí scoil-fhreastail ina n-údaráis áitiúla, bíonn an freastal i gcomhnaidhe níos fearr ná mar bhíos sé sa gcuid eile den tír.  Do rinneadh freastal chó hárd le 85 per cent. agus le 88 per cent. sna cathracha sin.</P>
    <P>Sa mbliain do críochnuíodh an 30adh de Mheitheamh seo chuaidh thart, do rinneadh 88.2 per cent. de mheán-fhreastal i gCathair Choreaighe, 87.5 per cent. i gCathair Bhaile Atha Cliath agus 85.7 per cent. i gCathair Phort Láirge&mdash;i geás páistí idir 6 bliana agus 14 bliana d'aois.  Maidir le páistí den aois chéanna sna ceanntair eile, do rinneadh 85 per cent. de mheán-fhreastal i gCo.  Chorcaighe, i gCo. Chiarraighe, i gCo.  Chill Choinnigh agus i gCo. an Chláir; ach bhí an meán-fhreastal faoi 82 per cent. i gcontaethe eile&mdash;Tír Chonaill, Muineachán, Cill Dara, Longphort, An Mhidhe, Cill Mhanntáin, Sligeach agus Liathdruim.  I gceanntair mar iad sin, do bhí o 18 per cent. go 20 per cent. as láthair, gach lá, de na páistí a mbaineann an tAcht leo.  Ní féidir a rádh gur scéal sásúil é sin.</P>
    <P>Maidir le tógáil tithe scoile, do húdaruíodh sa mbliain airgeadais seo caithte £120,075 de dheontais do ghnáth-thithe scoile, agus do húdaruíodh £18,000 den mhéid sin le haghaidh deontas &ldquo;Gábhach&rdquo;.  Chun 21 de <Col N="2362" /> thithe nua scoile do thógáil, chun 4 cinn eile d'fhairsingiú, agus chun feabhsú do chur ar 178 eile seadh do deonuíodh an t-airgead seo atá luaidhte agam.  Ina theannta sin, do deonuíodh £120,318 chun dhá cheann de mhór-scoileanna nua do dhéanamh &mdash;scoil bhuachaillí agus scoil chailíní agus naoidheanán, i gCabrach Thiar. Mar sin de, do deonuíodh £240,292 sa mbliain airgeadais 1942-43.  Sa mbliain do eríochnuíodh an 31adh de Mhárta, 1943, do chaith Coimisinéirí na nOibreacha Poiblidhe £240,900, agus bhí £422,885 de riaráiste ortha an ladh d'Aibreán, 1943.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an mbliain airgeadais atá ann fá láthar ag súil le bheith i ndon deontais den méid chéanna d'údarú do ghnáth-chásanna&mdash; taobh amuigh de nua-scoileanna a mbeadh riachtanas speisialta leo mar gheall ar imirce as ceanntair phloduithe chathrach.  Acht tá luach na n-ábhar ag síor-mhéadú, agus is deacair ábhair áirithe d'fháil ar chor ar bith.  Ó thárla sin amhlaidh, ní beifear i ndon oiread de thógáil tithe do dhéanamh agus d'fhéadfaí a dhéanamh ar an airgead céanna roimh airmsir an chogaidh&mdash;no i mbliain 1942-43 féin.</P>
    <P>Ó bhí an t-athrú Riaghaltais ann, i mbliain a 1922, do rinneadh 538 de thithe nua scoile, agus do rinneadh feabhsú mór ar 828 do bhí ann cheana. Idir an ladh d'Aibreán 1922, agus an 31adh de Mhárta, 1932, do rinneadh 173 de thithe nua scoile agus do rinneadh feabhsú mór ar 210; agus idir an ladh d'Aibreán, 1932, agus an 31adh de Mhárta, 1942, do rinneadh 365 de thithe nua scoile agus do rinneadh feabhsú mór ar 618.  Sa dá thréimhse chéanna, do rinneadh a lán mion-fheabhsú ar thithe scoile.  On ladh d'Aibreán, 1922, go dtí an 31adh de Mhárta, 1932, do deonuíodh go hiomlán: Gnáthach&mdash;£672,967; Gábhach&mdash;£104,059; sé sin, £777,026. On ladh d'Aibreán, 1932, go dtí an 31adh de Mhárta, 1943, do deonuíodh go hiomlán: Gnáthach&mdash;£1,882,959; Gábhach&mdash;£324,104; sé sin, £2,207,063. ach, dá ainneoin sin go léir, teastuíonn go fóill uainn mórán eile den tsórt céanna oibre do dhéanamh.  Séard a <Col N="2363" /> meastar go geaithfimíd tréimhse áirithe do leagan amach, 10 mbliana go dtí 15 bliana, abair, chun leanúint go dícheallach do dhéanamh tithe scoile, sa gcaoi nach mbeidh orainn, tar éis an tréimhse sin, ach an méid do theastódh go nádúrtha tré imeacht na haimsire. Chun a leithéid sin de phlean do chur i ngníomh, ceaptar go mba riachtanach ó 900 go dtí 1,000 de thithe nua scoile do dhéanamh, go gcaithfí feabhsú agus fairsingiú do dhéanamh ar 1,200 dá bhfuil ann cheana, agus go gcosnódh an obair go léir tuairim's £5,000,000.</P>
    <P>Is truagh nach mbeifear ábalta obair dá leithéid sin a dhéanamh le linn na héigeandála.  Is é a dtig leis an Roinn a dhéanamh san am i láthair cuidiú a thabhairt le scoileanna nua a thógáil i gcásanna a bhfuil géarriachtanas lena leithéid agus foirgneamh ar bith atá dona go leor a fheabhsú ar dhóigh go seasódh sé go cionn tamaill eile de bhlianta.</P>
    <P>Maidir le téidheamh agus glanadh na mbun-scol, is maith liom é a bheith agam le rádh go gcuideoidh méadú an deontais le haghaidh téidheamh leis na bainisteoirí a raibh a sáith le déanamh aca sa cheist seo.  Rinneadh socrú go mbeadh árdú sealadach de 50 per cent. ins na deontais seo i gcóir na bliana dar chríoch an 31adh de Mhárta, 1943, agus leanfar de sin a fhad is bhéas luach an ábhair teineadh chó hárd is atá sé. An tsuim de £41,000 a cuireadh i leataoibh ins na meastacháin i gcóir na bliana dar chríoch an 31adh de Mhárta, 1943, do théidheamh agus do ghlanadh na mbun-scol, rinneadh méadú air sin go £45,000 ins na meastacháin don bhliain a chríochnuíos ar an 31adh de Mhárta, 1944.  Cuirfear amach ciorcallán ina thaobh seo chuig bainisteoirí na mbun-scol gan mhoill.</P>
    <P>Maidir le cúrsaí oideachais, an príomh-athrú is mó baineann sé le scrúdú an bhun-teastais.</P>
    <P>Nuair a bhí mé ag cur meastacháin na bliana 1942-43 ós cóir na Dála, dubhairt mé go rabhthas ag cuimhneamh ar scéim nua scrúdúcháin a chur ar bun, ó thárla nár chuir níos mó ná 25 per cent. den lucht tinnrimh isteach ar an scrúdú.  Tá socrú déanta <Col N="2364" /> ó shoin go dtiocfaidh an scéim nua i bhfeidhm i mbliana.  Beidh an scrúdú ann Dia Máirt, an ladh de Mheitheamh, agus gach dalta atá cláruithe i Rang VI agus a rinne freastal céad lá ar a laghad, caithfe sé an scrúdú sin a sheasamh.</P>
    <P>Níl sé riachtanach ar dhaltaí ar bith dá bhfuil ins na hárd-ranga an scrúdú seo a sheasamh i mbliana, murar mian leo féin é, ach tá súil agam go mbeidh a lán de na daltaí atá i Ranga VII agus VIII ag cur isteach ar an mbunteastas anois&mdash;iad sin nach bhfuair caoi go dtí seo an scrúdú a dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Sa bhliain 1944 agus as sin amach is é an rún atá ann go geaithfidh na daltaí go léir i Rang VI agus ins na hárd-ranga agus nach ndeachaidh faoi scrúdú an bhun-teastais an scrúdú sin a sheasamh, má tá an freastal atá riachtanach déanta aca agus muna bhfuil leithscéal réasúnta aca a bheith as láthair.</P>
    <P>Bhéarfaidh an scéim nua caoi chun tástáil a dhéanamh i dtrí hábhair scoile.  Gaedhilg, Béarla agus Aireamh na trí hábhair sin, le cois tástáil speisialta in áireamh de ghlanmheabhair, agus beidh an scrúdú thart i lá amháin.  Cuirfidh bainisteoirí na scol in iúl cá háit ar mian leo ionaid scrúduithe a bheith, ach toil na Roinne a fháil i gcóir na n-ionad sin.  Tig leis na bainisteoirí sin maoirseacht a dhéanamh ar an scrúdú, nó tig leo an mhaoirseacht sin a thabhairt d'oidí nó do dhaoine feiliúnacha eile.  Ach beidh gach socrú aca seo ag brath ar aontú d'fháil ón Roinn, agus ag brath ar an gcoinníoll nach mbeidh cead ag aon oide bheith ina mhaor ar an scrúdú ná bheith páirteach i maoirseacht an scrúduithe ina scoil féin, muna mbeidh scoláirí eile ag dul faoi scrúdú i dteannta a chuid scoláirí féin.  Chun postas agus mion-chostais eile d'íoc, bhéarfar deontas beag d'oidí scoile a bhéas ina maoir ar an scrúdú.  Do gach cigire-cheanntar, toghfar oidí chun na páipéir scrúdúcháin do mharcáil faoi threoir chigire an cheanntair.  Daltaí a n-éireoidh an scrúdú leo, bronnfar an teastas ortha, agus deimhneoidh an teastas gur éirigh leo sna trí thástáil úd, agus, ina theannta sin, cuirfear i scribhinn ar an teastas cad iad na hábhair eile de <Col N="2365" /> chlár Rang VI a bhfuair an dalta teagasc ionnta sa scoil-bhliain chéanna. Caithfear 40 per cent. de na marcanna do ghnóthú i ngach ábhar faoi leith chun pas d'fháil; ach, sa nGaeltacht, glacfar le 30 per cent. de na marcanna ar son Béarla.</P>
    <P>Is dóigh liom go rachaidh idir 40,000 agus 50,000 dalta faoi'n scrúdú seo i mbliana.  Is mór an beartú é, agus táim ag súil nach dualgas lom ach dícheall a dhéanfaidh na bainisteoirí agus na hoidí lena chur in éifeacht. Is minic adubhrathas go hoifigiúil go mba chóir caoi chothrom chun an teastas seo do ghnóthú bheith ag gach dalta ionscrúduithe dá bhfuil sa tír. Tá an chaoi cothrom sin dá cur ar fáil anois, agus táim cinnte go mbeidh fáilte roimpi ag na tuismitheoirí go léir a bhfuil an tsuim cheart aca in oideachas a geloinne.</P>
    <P>Tá sé de dhóchas agam go n-éireoidh na teastais seo níos luachmhaire do réir a chéile.  Nuair a rachas an saol chun socrachta, ba chóir go mb'fhéidir a n-úsáid mar phasanna isteach chun oideachais níos airde, chun ceárda, chun printíseacht, agus chun a lán gnó eile.  Ar an mbealach sin do beifí ag tnúth leo, mar gheall ar a dtairbhe saolta chó maith lena dtairbhe oideachais.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an meán-oideachas, tá líon na ndalta ag méadú ó bhliain go bliain.  I mbliana, tá 39,000 dalta ag freastal meán-scol&mdash;uimhir atá 300 ós cionn líon na bliana seo caithte.  Ó 1929-30 go dtí 1941-42, d'éirigh an uimhir ó 27,645 go dtí 39,500, rud is ionann agus beagnach 1,000 dalta de mhéadú ós cóir gach bliana.  Mar sin de, tá ráta an mhéaduithe níos lugha i mbliana; ach ní bheadh a leithéid de laghdú ann mura mbeadh iarsmaí na héigeandála.  Ní hé amháin go bhfuil busanna agus traenacha gann, ach is deacair rothair d'fháil, agus tá siad sin an-áisiúil ag daltaí a bhfuil comhnaidhe ortha sna ceanntair tuaithe.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gelár agus leis na scrúdúcháin, tá athrú amháin tábhachtach le n-innsint agam, agus is é sin an t-athrú atá á dhéanamh ar an gcaighdeán le haghaidh onórach.</P>
    <P>Is minic adubhrathas go dian gur róíseal <Col N="2366" /> an caighdeán do bhí againn le haghaidh onórach sna scrúdúcháin teastas agus i ngach ábhar faoi leith, agus go raibh an iomarca dalta ag gnóthú an teastais le honóracha.  Tá machtnamh cúramach déanta agam ar an scéal, agus táim ag brath athrú áirithe do dhéanamh, i mbliana, ar na rialacha bhaineas le bronnadh na dTeastas seo.  Chun meán-teastas le honóracha do ghnóthú, beidh sé ar na coinníollacha go gcaithfidh an t-iarrthóir onórach 60 per cent. d'fháil i dtrí hábhair, nó onóracha i dhá n-ábhar agus 50 per cent. i dhá n-ábhar eile.  I gcás an lán-teastais, táthar ag brath caighdeán na n-onórach d'árdú ó 50 per cent. go dtí 60 per cent.; agus i gcás pas ar pháipéar na n-onórach, táthar ag brath an caighdeán d'árdú ó 30 per cent. go dtí 40 per cent.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gclár léighinn, tá cúrsaí in eólaidheacht talmhaíochta da n-eagrú faoi láthair, agus táim ag súil lena gcur ar chlár na meán-scol le haghaidh na scoil-bhliana seo chugainn.  Go príomhach tá na cúrsaí seo á mbunú do scoileanna a bhfuil feirmeacha aca féin, nó a bhfuil talamh le fáil aca go comhgarach. Séard a bhéas ionnta, teagasc teóireach agus obair saotharlainne, maraon le hobair láimhe agus teagase sa ngort agus sa ngáirdín.</P>
    <P>Fiú amháin sna scoileanna móra ina dteagasctar an clár iomlán d'ábhair liteardha, is féidir mórán do dhéanamh maidir le tréineáil talmhaíochta, agus is ri-mhaith atáthar ghá chruthú sin i gceann de na meán-scoileanna is mó dhá bhfuil againn.  Sa scoil seo, atá buidhean buachaillí a bhfuil an tsuim aca i bhfeirmeóireacht, agus cé's moite de roinnt chonganta fostuithe déanann siad féin gach uile obair dá mbaineann le tógáil eallaigh agus mue agus éanlaithe, le caomhnú glaisfhéir agus triosca, le brúghadh coirce, le planntáil chrann, etc., etc.</P>
    <P>I ngach slighe is an-suimiúil an toradh atá ar an tréineáil seo.  Ní hé amhain go bhfuil breis agus dá fhichid acra talmhan dá saothrú i mbliana, ach tá na buachaillí tar éis tosnú ar mhairtfheoil agus caoirfheoil an choláiste do sholáthar, agus tosnóidh siad ar an muicfheoil do sholáthar, <Col N="2367" /> freisin, nuair a gheobhfar a chead sin ó Bhord Bagúin Bhaile Atha Cliath. Is óna gcuid eallaigh féin a fhághann siad bainne le haghaidh an Choláiste agus soláthruíonn siad dóthain an choláiste agus na feirme de bhiadh ón talamh ina theannta sin.</P>
    <P>Maraon, leis an deagh-obair sin go léir, tá nidh eile an-tsásúil le tabhairt faoi deara.  Ní beag an feabhas atá tar éis teacht ar thoradh na scoile seo sna scrúdúcháin phoiblí agus is léir gur mhaith an congnamh chuige sin na buachaillí do bheith níos fuinneamhaighe agus níos dícheallaighe ó chuaidh siad i mbun na hoibre atá luaidhte agam.</P>
    <P>Is fiú, freisin, a thabhairt faoi deara nach bhfuil congnamh ar bith airgid dá fháil ón gcoláiste ag an bhfeirm. Is amhlaidh do fuarthas iasacht on mbanc lena haghaidh ar dtús.</P>
    <P>Díoltar toradh na feirme leis an gcoláiste do réir reacht an mhargaidh, agus mar gheall ar na proifidí do rinneadh air sin, do bhí sé i gcumas na feirme, ó bhliain go bliain, a thuilleadh stuic do cheannach agus a thuilleadh oirnéise le haghaidh na hoibre.  Maidir leis sin, is cóir a chuimhniú nach bhfuil ach fir-bheagán de thalamh churaíochta ag, an gcoláiste féin agus gurbh éigean talamh ar cíos d'fháil sa gcomhursanacht, do réir mar bhí an obair ag dul i méid.</P>
    <P>Nidh eile atá suimiúil, creideann udaráis na scoile seo gurb í an obair láimhe is fáth leis an spéis mhóir atá ag na buachaillí i saothrú na feirme. Gach obair dá ndéanann na mic léighinn taobh amuigh d'uaireanna scoile, déanann siad í dá ndeoin féin dar ndóigh.  Taithníonn sí go mór leo, agus ní hé amháin go dtáinig feabhas ar a n-obair scoile lena linn, ach do tháinig feabhas ortha maidir le sláinte agus sástacht intinne.</P>
    <P>Ní leagtar amach an cúrsa talmhaíochta ina chúrsa fá leith agus gan aon bhaint aige le am-chlár na coda eile den choláiste.  Déanann na buachaillí atá ina n-abhar feilméaraí cúrsa iomlán na meán-teistiméarachta, agus ina theannta sin bíonn am aca le cluichí a imirt gan aon chosúlacht a bheith ortha iad bheith tuirseach.  Ní <Col N="2368" /> dóibh siúd amháin ar b'eol a bheith fútha dul le feilméireacht a ceaptar obair feilme.  Bíonn fáilte roimh bhuachaill ar bith ar mian leis dul ag obair ar an bhfeilm.</P>
    <P>Ní gádh dhom a rádh nach sompla é seo de na meán-scoltacha go léir atá againn.  Níl ann ach sompla den rud is féidir a dhéanamh i scoil mhóir a mhúineas líon iomlán na n-ábhar eile. Is maith liom é bheith le rádh agam san am chéanna go bhfuil coláisti eile ann a bhfuil tosach déanta aca leis an gcineál seo oibre agus tá súil agam go ndéanfaidh coláistí eile fós iarracht seo a dhéanamh freisin.</P>
    <P>Sula gcuiridh mé deire le ceist seo an mheán-oideachais ba mhaith liom a rádh go bhfuiltear tar éis tuilleadh a dhéanamh lena chur in áirithe nach mbeidh aon difríocht mhór idir an cineál scrúduithe a bheas le déanamh ag na scoláirí san Árd-ghrád sa mheánscoil agus ins na scrúduithe máithreánacha san Ollscoil Náisiúnta.</P>
    <P>Rinne mé tagairt anuiridh do na socruithe a rinneadh le cóiriú a dhéanamh ar na cúrsaí a bhí ann don Ard-Teistiméaracht agus do scrúdú máithreánach na hOllscoile Náisiúnta. Chun an cóiriú sin a chur i lán-fheidhm ta socair i mbliana scrúduitheoirí comhairleacha eachtrannacha cheapadh i gcóir scrúdú na hárd-teistiméarachta. Is ó Ollamhna agus ó Leigheachtaithe na hOllscoile atá lán-cháilithe leis an obair seo dhéanamh tríd an nGaedhilg ceapfar na scrúduitheoirí seo.  Cuideoidh coistí beaga de na cigirí leis na scrúduitheoirí seo nuair a bheas na páipéirí á leagan amach aca. Maidir leis an socrú seo ba mhaith liom a chur in iúl go soiléar gur agam-sa, an tAire Oideachais, a bhéas an lánúdarás chun an scrúdú do dhéanamh agus gur orm-sa a bhéas an lán-fhreagarthacht chuige sin.</P>
    <P>Tá tosnú déanta againn i gcóir an chéad scrúduithe eile agus chuige sin ceapadh scrúduitheoirí den tsórt sin do na príomh-abhair agus beidh ainmneacha na scrúduitheoirí sin ar na páipéiri scrúdúcháin.</P>
    <P>Máidir leis an ngairm-oideachas, tá orm a chur in iúl nach raibh ar an rolla sa mbliain 1941-42 ach 63,975 scoláire, cé go raibh 65,618 ar an rolla sa mbliain 1940-41.  Fá'n dtuaith is mo a thárla an chuid is mó den laghdú <Col N="2369" /> seo, óir níorbh fhéidir, cheal gléas iompair, an oiread céanna cúrsa chur ar bun ins na háiteacha a bhí i bhfad ó bhaile.  Sheas an tinnreamh go maith i rith na bliana ins na ceanntracha buirge agus ins na baile-cheanntracha, ach ins na bailte beaga agus ins na scoltacha tuatha thuit an tinnreamh go mór i ngeall ar theora a bheith le gléas taistil phuiblí agus i ngeall ar ghanntanas buinn do na rothair.  Do thuit an tinnreamh ins na scoltacha tuatha freisin san earrach i ngeall ar an nglaoch mhór a bhí ar lucht oibre don churadóireacht agus do bhaint agus do shábháil na móna.  In áiteacha bhí ar na scoláirí bheith tréimhsí fada as láthair agus in áiteacha eile b'éigean dóibh bheith as láthair an t-am go léir.  Ba bhliain an-chruaidh í do scoil leanúna ar bith a ndéanann scoláirí freastal uirthe dá ndeoin féin.  Agus an scéal do mheas ina iomlán níl aon chúis casaoide againn fá'n toradh seo.  Maidir leis an obair a rinneadh ins na scoltacha is áthas liom a rádh go bhfuil sí ag dul ar aghaidh go maith.  Rinneadh scrúdú speisialta le trí bliana anuas ar obair gach oide lán-ama agus obair go leor de na hoidí páirt-ama a bhí ag múineadh ins na gairm-scoltacha.  Tá na tuarasgbhála go maith chó fada is bhaineas le teagasc na n-ábhar fá leith. Tá cuspóirí áirithe ag na hoidí agus leanann siad dóibh ag obair leo do réir scéimeanna a hathruítear Ó scoil go scoil ach atá feiliúnach go generálta don chuspóir atá rómpa aca.</P>
    <P>Go sonnrach tá teagasc na gcleachtabhar go maith tríd an tír.  Tá na ceárd-sheomraí leagtha amach go maith agus na cistiní cóirithe go maith agus an t-iomlán faoi dheis mhaith agus in úsáid i rith na seachtaine.  Tá na hoidí sár-oilte ar a gcuid ceárd agus na scoláirí a láimhsíonn giúirléidí nó gléasanna cistinighe den chéad uair ní fada go mbíonn siad oilte ar iad d'úsáid agus foghluimeann siad an chaoi lena n-úsáid go tapaidh agus obair mhaith a dhéanamh leo.</P>
    <P>Sé an rud is mó a bhíonn le déanamh ag na hoidí ceangal a dhéanamh idir an teagasc a tugtar do na scoláirí ins na hábhair go léir i dtreo gur fearrde ar an mbealach sin an t-oideachas <Col N="2370" /> generálta a tugtar dóibh.  Is fíor seo go mór mhór i geás na gcúrsaí lae lán-ama, mar ba cheart go bhfuigheadh daoine óga cothrom maith den oideachas ghenerálta i dteannta na ceárd-oiliúna a tugtar dóibh.  Cé go bhfuil na hoidí na hoidí cáilithe ina gcuid ábhar féin cliseann ortha leorsmaoineadh a dhéanamh ar an gcaoi lena gcuid ábhar féin a cheangal leis na habhair eile atá ar an gcúrsa.  Ní thuigeann na hordí i gceart nach leor bheith ag smaoineadh i gcomhnaidhe ar chaighdeán áirithe a bhaint amach don rang in ábhar fá leith, ach gur ceart breathnú freisin ar an scéal ó thaobh an oideachais níos leithne ba cheart thabhairt don ghlúin óig seo go háirithe ó thaobh oideachais sóisialta.</P>
    <P>Tá feabhas do réir a chéile ag teacht ar éifeachtúlacht an teagaisc a tugtar sa tuath-eolaíocht.  Deich mbliana ó shoin ní raibh aon trácht ar na cóábhair a thagas fá'n il-theideal seo, mar ní raibh oidí, ná garraithe scol ná nós ann.  Bhí ar na fir óga a tháinig díreach ó na coláistí a mbealach a dhéanamh ón ngarraí féir go dtí an garraí scoile, agus ón seomra scoile go dtí an tsaotharlann eolaíochta.  Bhí ortha, san am chéanna, intinn na ndaoine óga agus intinn a naithreacha agus a máithreacha a dhíriú ar an gcuspóir nua.  Rámhaiocht in aghaidh an tsrotha a bhí ann dóibh, agus theastuigh misneach agus iarracht speisialta uatha.  Tá obair sár-mhaith déanta ag cuid de na hoidí agus bhain siad cáil amach dóibh féin agus dá gcuid scoil i measc muintir na tuatha.  Cé's moite de roint oidí tá obair-mhaith a dhéanamh ag an gcuid eile agus tá siad ag dul ar aghaidh ó bhliain go bliain.</P>
    <P>Ba mhaith liom tagairt a dhéanamh annseo don obair mhaith a rinne oidí tuath-eolaíochta an geimhreadh seo ag tástáil síol arbhair do na feilméaraí. D'iarr an tAire Talmhaidheachta ortha an obair seo a dhéanamh le laghdú a dhéanamh ar an gcruadhóig oibre a bhi ar phríomh-stáisiún tástála an tsíl. Rinneadh an obair ar fud na tíre agus socruíodh an nós oibre ag roinnt cruinniú a tionóladh in áiteacha thall agus i bhfus ar fud na tíre.  Cuidíonn an ghairm-scoil le feilméaraí an <Col N="2371" /> cheanntair in aisce.  Baineadh feidhm mhór as an socrú seo agus tástáladh 5,722 sampla ins na scoltacha go dtí Mí Feabhra.  Tá áthas orm é bheith le rádh agam gur thug na scoltacha seirbhís luachmhar den chineál seo in am na práinne.</P>
    <P>Chó fada is bhaineas leis an bpolasaí generálta Oideachais atá againn ba cheart feasta, creidim, ceangal níos dlúithe a bheith idir an dul chun cinn atá déanta ag eolas na heolaíochta agus oiliúint na heolaíochta.  Sa saol atá ann indiu ní féidir mórán dul chun cinn a dhéanamh ar an bhfeilm, sa gceárd-sheomra, san oifig agus sa gcistinigh, gan cabhair ón eolaíocht. Má tá faoi dhaoine ar bith dul ar aghaidh sa saol caithfe siad feidhm a bhaint as an eolaíocht.  Ní mór an teagase seo a chur abhaile ins na scoltacha.  Mara ndéantar seo beidh thiar ar an Eireannach sa gcoimhlint ghéar a bheas ann de dheascaibh an droch-bhail atá ar chúrsaí gnótha indiu.</P>
    <P>Is áthas liom a rádh maidir le leathnú a dhéanamh ar oideachas leanúna ins na scoltacha gairmoideachais go bhfuil ag eirghe go rímhaith ó thaobh an oideachais leis an socrú a rinneadh i gCathair Chorcaighe le haghaidh tinnrimh éigeanta ó dhaoine óga ar scoil nó cúrsa oideachais de chineál eicínt go dtí go mbeadh siad sé bliana déag d'aois. Fá'n socrú seo tá sé d'fhiachaibh ar suas le míle duine den aos óg freastal ar chúrsa deagh-cheaptha staidéir ins an scoil oideachais leanúna.  Marach sin ní thiocfaidís fá thionchur oideachais d'aon chineál an tráth dá saol is so-mhúnluithe iad.  Is iomdha áis thairis sin a cuirtear ar fáil i bhfuirm léigheachtaí, cuirmeacha ceoil, teasbántaisí oideachais, aclaíocht cuirp, lúithchleasa, agus claisceadail dóibh seo atá ag freastal na &ldquo;cúrsaí éigeantacha&rdquo;.  Is mór an tsuim a cuirtear ins na nithe sin.  Tréis chó hionmholta is atáan socrú tá aon locht amháin air, sé sin, gur minic nach mbíonn obair le fáil dá lán de na buachaillí agus na cailíní ar chríochnú a gcúrsa dhóibh.  Tá lucht ceannais na scol thréis búreau fostaíochta a bhunú <Col N="2372" /> ach ní go maith a d'éirigh leis go nuige seo.  Dar ndóigh is rud andeacair obair fháil d'aos óg na geathracha agus is ceist í ó thaobh na códhaonnachta dhe a caithfear a scrúdú go cúramach chó luath agus is féidir é.</P>
    <P>Maidir le iallach a chur ar dhaoine óga i gceanntracha eile freastal ar chúrsaí den chineál céanna cuireadh i bhfeidhm le Ordú i gCathair Luimnigh ar an gcéad lá de Dheire Fómhair seo a chuaidh tharainn na forálacha de chuid a cúig d'Acht an Oideachais Ghairme Beatha fána bhfuil na cúrsaí éigeantacha seo ag obair i gCathair Chorcaighe.  Fritheadh Árus feiliúnach i gcóir na hoibre agus fá Mhí na Nodlag bhí 330 duine ar an rolla. Tuairim is 500 den aos óg atáthar ag súil a thiocfas fán Ordú nuair a bhéas sé fá lán-scód.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag smaoineadh an socrú céanna a chur i bhfeidhm i gCathair Phort Láirge.  I láthair na huaire táthar ag dul i gcionn ceist seo an aosa óig ar bhealach eile i mBaile Átha Cliath.  Ins an mbliain airgeadais seo caithte tugadh £5,000 de dheontas do Choiste Oideachais Ghairme Beatha Chathrach Átha Cliath le ionaid oiliúna i gcóir an aosa óig a bhunú le cúrsai feiliúnacha a chur ar fáil d'aos óg na cathrach nach bhfuil ag obair. Tá an deontas dá fháil acu arís sa mbliain airgeadais seo.  Is ar fhochoiste speisialta a toghadh de barr suim fá leith a bheith acu in obair códhaonnachais agus de bharr cleachtadh fá leith a bheith acu urithi atá cúram an deontais.  Tá dhá ionad oiliúna bunuithe cheana, ceann ar an taobh thuaidh den chathair agus ceann ar an taobh theas.  Tá sé ar intinn péire eile a bhunú.  Tá oideachas feiliúnach agus caitheamh aimsire feiliúnach le fáil ins na hionaid sin do dhaoine óga idir cheithre bliana déag agus ocht mbliana déag d'aois.  Is mó de ghnéithe an chlub ná de ghnéithe an tighe scoile atá ag baint leis na hionaid sin.  Meastar gur nidh an-tábhachtach é tionchur chinnirí an aosa óig a fuair oiliúint fá leith i gcóir na hoibre agus a chuidíos leis na daoine óga ar bhealach cháirdiúil, rud nach bhféadfadh an gnáth-oide a dhéanamh.  Is iomdha sin caoi a cuidítear le clubanna <Col N="2373" /> agus le cumainn aosa óig eile na cathrach; cuir i gcás, cuirtear teagascóirí oilte chuca nó tugtar uirlisí oibre ar iasacht dóibh.  Tháinic tuairm is £2,000 ar fad fá'n scéim i rith na céadbhliana agus tá an-bhaochas tuillte ag an bhfo-choiste as ucht ceann maith a chur ar an obair.</P>
    <P>Maidir leis an gceárd-oideachas féin, tá áthas orm go dtig liom a rádh go bhfuil dul chun cinn dhá dhéanamh i gcomhnaidhe, go háithrid maidir leis na scéimeanna éagsúla atá ann le printíseacha céirde a oiliúint.  Sé an scéim a bunuíodh fá chóir phrintíseacha Bhord Sholáthar an Leictreachais an ceann is sásúla orra sin.  Is de thoradh scrúduithe trí scríbhinn, trí chómhrádh agus in obair láimhe a leigtear printísigh isteach.  Ar feadh trí mhí i ngach bliain den téarma printíseachta, déanann an printíseach freastal ar chúrsa speisialta ceárdúil i gCéard-Scoil Shráid Chaoimhghein. I rith na coda eile den bhliain nuair a fhilleas na printísigh ar a ngnáthobair ar fud na tíre, leantar den oiliúint neamh-cheárdúil tríd an bposta.  Ioctar bónuis le printísigh a n-éirigheann leo i scrúduithe teicneolaíochta na Roinne.</P>
    <P>Scéim an-tsásúil eile i gcóir oiliúint printíseach is eadh an scéim atá ag an Roinn Cosanta do phrintísigh mheicníochta ins an Aer-Chór.  Is ins na ceárd-scoltaca éagsúla a tugtar an oiliúint réimh-phrintíseach agus is i scoil speisialta na Roinne i mBaile Domhnaill a tugtar an chuid eile den oiliúint.  Scéimeanna eile atá fé stiúrú Choistí Printíseachta, más fé reacht nó go deontach a bunuíodh iad, agus a bhfuil obair an-tsásúil á dhéanamh acu is eadh na scéimeanna atá ann i mBaile Atha Cliath i gcóir printíseach clódóireachta, pluméarachta, bríceadóireachta, déanamh troscáin, déanamh uaireadóirí, bácaerachta agus obair tighthe peictiúirí.  An printíseach atá ag dul le haon cheann de na céirdeanna sin is éigin dó freastal ar an gceárd-scoil le linn a théarma printíseachta nó roimhe sin. Tá lucht na céirde agus an scoil ag obair as lámha a chéile agus bíonn deagh-thora dá réir ar a gcuid oibre. Sé caingean na Roinne an cóoibreachas <Col N="2374" /> sin a chur ar fáil i ngach céird inar féidir é, ach níl sé éasga sin a dhéanamh ach amháin ins na céirdeanna a bhfuil cumainn láidre aca.</P>
    <P>Cuireadh scéim ar bun an fómhar seo caithte le printísigh a oiliúint chun bheith ina gcaidí i gcabhlach tráchtála na hEireann.  Thairg <i>Irish Shipping Limited</i> (Comhlucht Loingseoireachta Eireann, Teo.), agus roinnt de na coistí oideachais gairme beatha scoláireachta i scoil mhuiríochta sóisearach a fuair moladh ón Roinn.  Tá lucht buaite na scoláireachta ag freastal a gcúrsa i gceárd-scoil na Gaillimhe.  Chuir an scoil sin múinteóir sár-oilte agus fearais den chéadscoth ar fáil i gcóir na hoibre.  Tréis doibh oiliúint bhliana i muiríocht agus in abhair gaolmhar leis d'fháil bhéarfar caoi dhóibh a dhul chun fairrge i longa <i>Irish Shipping.</i>  Le bail-chríoch a chur ar a gcuid oiliúna le bheith ina gcéad nó ina ndara máta, ina gcaiptín nó aroile déanann siad freastal ar feadh tréimhsí anois agus arís ar scoil de mhacasamhail Scoil Muiríochta na hEireann.</P>
    <P>Táthar ag súil go gcuirfear scéim nua i bhfeidhm an seisiún seo chugainn le innealtóirí mara a ghlacadh isteach agus a oiliúint.  Fén scéim seo beidh ar phrintísigh trí bliana chaitheamh i gceárd-scoil mholta.  Airmheofar an tréimhse sin mar dhá bhliain phrintíseachta agus ní mór na trí bliana eile a chaitheamh i scoil mholta innealtóireachta. Thárlódh go gcuideofaí leis an scéim le scoláireachtaí.</P>
    <P>Tá laghdú mór go maith tréis tigheacht ar fud na tíre ar an uimhir atá ag freastal ar ranganna innealtóireachta gluaisteáin, ach níl neart air sin. Sé an laghdú atá tagtha ar an gcinéal sin oibre de bharr an chogaidh is ciontach leis.  Tá Cumann Ceannaithe Gluaisteáin na hEireann i gcomhairle leis an Roinn tréis scéim a cheapadh le printísigh a ghlacadh isteach agus a oiliúint agus ba chóir go gcuideodh sin go mór le riaradh ar an mbreis oibre ceárdúla a bhéas le déanamh ag an gcumman sin tréis deire an chogaidh. O na ceárd-scoltacha lae de thoradh scrúduithe a toghfar na printísigh i ngach garáiste a bhfuil a bhainisteoir <Col N="2375" /> ina bhall den Chumann.  Nímór dóibh éirghe leo i scrúdú sóisearach céirde na Roinne ins an triú bliain dá bprintíseacht agus ins an scrúdú sinnsearach céirde roimh dheire a dtéarma.  Tig leis an bprintíseach diplóma speisialta a bhronn an cumann a bhaint amach má éiríonn leis i scrúduithe speisialta de bhreis ortha sin.  Tá leagan amach na scéime go han-mhaith agus d'fhéadfadh árdtoradh a thigheacht as.  Tiocfa sé i bhfeidhm go luath.</P>
    <P>Gan trácht ar na scéimeanna móra sin tá scéimeanna eile nach bhfuil cho mór ach atá an-tábhachtach ann. Ceann acu sin an scéim a chuir stiúrthóirí Monarchan Bróg <i>Halliday-Clarke</i> ar bun i nDún Deálgan le gairid.  Fán scéim sin tugtar cead don lucht oibre óg freastal trí lá sa tseachtain ó 4 p.m. go dtí 6 p.m. ar ranganna sa gCeárd-scoil.  Is mó is cosúil le hoildeachas leanúnach ná le ceárd-oideachas an teagase a fhághas siad.  Tugtar aire fá leith d'oiliúint in obair láimhe do na buachaillí agus in obair tighe do na cailiní.  Iocann na stiúrthóirí £200 den chostas bliantúil a bhíos ar Choiste Oideachais Gairmhe Beatha Co. Lughbhaidh de bharr na scéime.</P>
    <P>Ba mhian liom gearr-thagairt a dhéanamh d'obair Choláiste Naomh Muire um Ealadhain Tighis, atá fé threoir Chómhaltais Chathair Atha Cliath, agus a chríochnuigh obair a céad-sheisiúin i Mí an Mheithimh seo caithte.  Tá baochas tuillte ag an gComhaltas de bharr na mór-bhuntáistí atá ar fáil sa Choláiste sin.  Do b'é tinnreamh iomlán ag na cúrsaí sa ló ar feadh an tseisiúin ná 335 agus ag, na cúrsaí tráthnóna 812, gan corr-léigheachtaí speisialta d'áireamh.  Do haistríodh oiliúint na n-oidí o Chill Mac Coda mar a ndéantaí é i Scoil na Roinne, go dtí an nua-Choláiste seo, agus táthar sásta len a thoradh san. Tá a lán cúrsaí suimiúla aidhmeannacha ar fáil sa Choláiste, go róspeisialta i gcócaireachta institiút, agus i gceannaireacht institiút, do dhaoine a bhéadh fé oiliúint i gcóir oibre in otharlanna, i scoileanna agus i mbonndaireachta eile dá sórt.  Dar liom, fóghnann an nua-Choláiste seo do <Col N="2376" /> riachtanas ró-léir, agus beidh sé in a mhór-áis don chathair.</P>
    <P>Do tugadh mór-chabhair, arís, ar fuaid na tíre, don scéim i gcóir léigheachtaí breise do chóruigh Cumann Ríoga Atha Cliath i gcomhar leis na Comhaltais Ghairme Beatha.  Cuireann an scéim sin i gcumas na gceanntar is iar-gcúlaighe tairbhe léigheachta ó árd-údair d'fháil.  Bhí tinnreamh maith ag na léigheachtaí, go mór mór aca-sa a bhain le cúrsaí talún agus cuireadóireachta.</P>
    <P>Borrfar, chó maith, oideachas daoine fásta le teasbántasaí pictiúirí ó Ghaedheal-ealadhantóirí.  Tá an Róinn ag soláthar na dteasbántas san i gcóoibriú leis na Cómhaltais Ghairme Beatha.  Samplaí coranntuiseacha d'obair na nEaladhantóirí is eadh a bheidh ins na pictiúirí, agus de ghnáth, is iad na hEaladhantóirí féin a thugann ar iasacht don Roinn iad chuige sin.  Táthar ag súil go spriocfaidh na teasbántasaí so a déanfar in a lán scoil tuatha suim in ealadhain tarraiceóireachta, agus go mborrfaid múinteóireacht ealadhan i gcoitiann.</P>
    <P>Tá socrú déanta ins na meastacháin i gcóir cúrsa speisialta chun múinteóirí Gaedhilge d'oiliúint.  Do bhunuigh an Roinn cúrsa den tsórt san sa bhliain naoi gcéad déag a ceathracha, agus a ceatharacha a haon agus tá sár-obair déanta ag na múinteóirí a hoileadh sa chúrsa so, i gceanntair tuatha. Bunófar an cúrsa nua in Ath Cliath agus beidh sé fé threóir Ard-Oifigigh de Chigirí na Roinne.</P>
    <P>Tá spré bheag á chur i leataoibh ins na Meastacháin i gcóir cúrsaí athnuachainte sa tSamhradh so do mhúinteóirí.  Beidh trí cúrsaí den tsórt san fé threóir&mdash;bainfidh ceann aca le déanamh agus coimeád cogalaighe gaoithe agus slite eile i gcóir soluis agus comhachta i mbaill tuatha; bainfidh ceann eile le leagan agus suidheamh foirgintí feirme; agus cúrsa in ealadhain biadaireachta is eadh an tríomhadh ceann.</P>
    <P>Maidir le múinteóireacht na n-ábhar eile tríd an nGaedhilg, do deineadh mór-chuid plé ar an scéal san Oireachtas le deireannaighe.  Uime sin, ní mian liom aire an Tighe do tharrac ach chun a rá gur dóigh gun <Col N="2377" /> cóir dúinn aghaidh a thabhairt ar an scéal go díreach, mar, má theastuíonn an Ghaedhilg d'aithbheochaint, ní féidir san a dhéanamh ar a mhalairt de shlí ach le múinteóireacht tríd an nGaedhilg, agus gurb é atá i gceist agus fé dhíospóireacht ná an aidhm iomlán atá againn chun aithbheóchana na Gaedhilge, agus méad an duaidh is gá chuige sin, agus nach é modh a dhéanta ar chor ar bith.</P>
    <P>Muna bhfuil d'aidhm againn ach díreach an Ghaedhilg do choimeád beo, ina dara teangain órnáidigh gur cheart í do bheith ar eolus, a bheag nó a mhór, ag gach Eireannach, amhail agus a bhíodh eolus ar Laidin agus ar Fhrainneis ag daoine leigheanta san naoú aois déag&mdash;féadfaimíd an aidhm sin do shroisint ach an Ghaedhilg do mhúineadh ar feadh aon uair an chluig amháin sa ló i ngach scoil&mdash;agus an chuid eile den obair, nó a furmhór, do dhéanamh trí Bhéarla.</P>
    <P>De thoradh múinteóireachta den tsórt san, is dóigh go mbainfeadh miondaireacht de lucht gríosattha i ngach glúin, feidhm as an nGaedhilg in a teangain labhartha, ach do dhearmadfadh furmhór mór na daoine i, iar bhfágaint na scoile dhóibh&mdash; díreach mar a dearmadtaí an Laidean agus an Fhrainncis&mdash;agus bheadh Eire mar cheann de na náisiúin a labhras Béarla, fé dheoidh agus ar deire, gan súil a casta choíche.</P>
    <P>Is eagal liom gurb é seo an staid atá ar aigne a glactha ag cuid aca so a chuíreann i gcoinnibh múinteóireachta na n-ábhar uile tríd an nGaedhilg.  Níl mise sásta glacadh leis agus ní dóigh liom go bhfuil an Rialtas ach oiread.</P>
    <P>Ach tá mór-chuid daoine gur mian leo an Ghaedhilg do bheith arís ina fíor-theangain ar fuaid Eireann, agus fóraoir, ní thuigid gur obair fhathaigh i an Ghaedhilg do aithbheóchaint ina teangain labhartha d'iomlán muinntir na hEireann, agus ní hamháin ina dara teangain do bhraisle de lucht gríosattha, ná fós ina teasbántas múséum, go mór i gcoinnibh na díleann so de Bhéarla lena bhfuil ár saol tuilte fé láthair, i dtreo ná slánódh múinteóireacht uaire an chluig sa ló ar scoil, faid do múinfí an leanbh ar feadh na n-uair an chluig eile go <Col N="2378" /> léir, trí Bhéarla, an teanga Ghaedhilge, ná an cultúr a ghabhann léi.  Is deacair liom a thuigsint cionnus a shamhluíonn na daoine seo atá ar aon aidhm linn gur féidir cúig uair déag de shaol leinbh ina dhúiseacht, caithte trí Bhéarla, do chur ar neamh-ní le haon uair an chluig amháin a caithtear trí Ghaedhilg.  Nách leor an méid sin a rá, dar liom, chun go dtuigfí a léiramaideacht.</P>
    <P>Is é lán-fhírinne an scéil ná; dá múintí na hábhair uile gach lá don ghnáth-leanbh, go mbeadh mór-bhreis nirt fós ar thaobh an Bhéarla, mar tá deich n-uaire a' chluig eile, nó dhá uair déag, le caitheamh ag an leanbh taobh amuich den scoil, agus níl ach cúigear as an gcéad d'ár leanbhaí nách gcaitheann na huaireanna san i measc cómhluadair a labhrann Béarla, ionnus go mbfhéidir nách n-eireódh linn an teanga do shlánú le lánchomhacht ná modh atá i bhfeidhm againn fé láthair, toisc an treis do bheith chómh héachtach láidir sin ina coinnibh ag an mBéarla.  Ach níl ach &ldquo;sin mar atá toisc gur mian liom é&rdquo; d'aoinne bheith á shamhlú go ndéanfar teanga bheo imease na ndaoine go léir den Ghaedhilg ach í mhúineadh ar feadh uair a' chluig sa ló, agus nach gá iarracht níos treise ná sin do dhéanamh.</P>
    <P>Ní dócha go dtuigeann an dream so a labhrann inár gcoinnibh an fhírinne seo&mdash;fírinne a caithfear a thuigsint más mian linn an fhadhb do réiteach go macánta&mdash;nach féidir linn an Ghaedhilg do shlánú gan sár-iarracht do dhéanamh i gcoinnibh Béarla, agus uaireanta i gcoinnibh an nádúir dhaonna féin, i dtreó go mairfeadh an teanga. Ní féidir cogadh mí-chuíbheasach teangan den tsórt san do choimeád ar siúl gan íbirt, agus gan iarrachtaí diana, buan-tseasmhacha&mdash;agus níl a mhalairt sin de rogha againn muna mian linn leigint don Ghaedhilg bás d'fháil mar theangain labhartha.</P>
    <P>Is ana-dheacair a chreidiúint go leigfeadh clanna Gaedheal don Ghaedhilg bás d'fháil.  Tá cruthú in ár stair go huile gur thuig ár ndaoine nách i gcóir a ré féin amháin a mhaireadar, agus ná fuil i nglúin aonair de náisiún ar bith ach cuid bheag den mhór-iomlán, agus <Col N="2379" /> nuair a gheibheann náisiún an oighreacht is riachtanach ón ré caithte, nách foláir di an oighreacht san d'uadhachtú don ré atá le teacht. Do léirigh clanna Gaedheal i ngach aois go rabhdar féin toilteannach chun bás d'fháil ionnus go mairféadh an náisiún.  Agus a leithéid sin de thuigsint phaisiúnta ar náisiúntacht againn, nách bhfuil sé do-chreite go mbeimís toilteannach an oighreacht náisiúnta is mó agus is tábhachtaighe againn san nglúin seo do leigint uainn, tré gan glacadh leis an aon-mhodh amháin trén ar féidir í choimeád?</P>

      <P>On Deputy Mulcahy's behalf, I wish to move: &ldquo;That the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration.&rdquo;  I should like, as usual, to start off by thanking the Minister for his courtesy in providing me with a translation of his speech.  I do not intend to discuss in detail the speech of the Minister.  There are two matters, however, which I should like to mention.  They are of general interest, being matters affecting general policy.  One is the position of Irish and the other is the proposal, made public, I understand, at the beginning of this year, to have the leaving certificate examination in the primary schools compulsory as from 1st June of this year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I fully agree with the Minister that the effort to restore Irish as a language is not merely exceedingly ambitious, but I wonder whether I would be wrong in saying that it is almost unparalleled.  It is an effort of extreme difficulty and I wonder, judging from the Minister's peroration&mdash; and I may say I intend to discuss this problem without the slightest heat or the slightest thetoric&mdash;whether he <Col N="2380" /> realises that one of the principal difficulties those who are anxious to make Irish a living language, a real language for the people, have to face is either the hostility of large masses of the people or their complete indifference. His experience may be very different from mine, when I was Minister for Education.  He knows that I did start this particular system in the hope that we might make Irish, and that we should make Irish, a living language. But I never deluded myself that I had the enthusiastic support of the great bulk of the people of this country, and I hope the Minister is not deluding himself in that way.</P>
    <P>I do not suppose that any education is popular.  I never thought this form of education was popular, but for a number of reasons I considered it sound national policy and, consequently, I took the responsibility for it.  I had a number of aims.  I was hoping to realise them all; I was hoping that they all might be realised.  I wonder whether, in the last 20 years, we have made any reasonable advance &mdash;I shall not say considerable advance &mdash;towards the satisfaction of any of these aims.  When I speak of making Irish a living language&mdash;and I think I expressed the view before in this House&mdash;I have not in view making it a language like French or German, making it the language of people who never really think in these language. I always regard that kind of knowledge of a language as simply another form of thinking in English, with a different set of symbols.  I wanted Irish to be a language, and I hoped gradually it might, with English, be a language, in which the people of this country could think, because language helps you to think; that when you spoke you were not continually, even if you had, in one sense, fluent Irish, under the necessity of, so to speak, translating from the English.  That was the aim.</P>
    <P>I thought if the responsible Government of this country took in hand the promotion of a policy of that kind, a certain number of things which I considered valuable might be achieved; that Irish might become a real language in which the people would think <Col N="2381" /> as they think in English&mdash;I mean with the same facility.  In that sense, having two languages, I hoped that without any diminution of standard of education, certainly without that sacrifice spread over a number of years, we might have the minds of the people quickened.  I happen myself to have a command of two languages, though I learned a number.  I think I derived considerable advantage from the fact that I had to learn German as an ordinary vernacular language&mdash;I never learned it at school&mdash;and I found it useful.  I think the command of two languages in that way would be useful.</P>
    <P>Finally, I believe, if I may quote the actual words of one great enthusiast for the Irish language and its restoration, &ldquo;that by restoring the Irish language we might strengthen the national fibre of the people&rdquo;.  I think these were legitimate aims.  The difficulties were great, and I am sorry to say that they have turned out to be much greater than I supposed at the time.  I was not convinced, when this effort was inaugurated, that it was impossible, without damaging the minds of the children, to teach them through the medium of a language like Irish which they did not know.  Children, as I know, have an extraordinary facility for picking up languages, a much greater facility than grown-up people have.</P>
    <P>What I am perturbed about is this, that I am not at all convinced that we have made genuine progress towards the realisation of any of these three aims.  I have quoted the words of a man who, unfortunately, is no longer with us.  I have quoted his phrase because it always stuck in my mind as a summing-up of at least one portion of the aim for the restoration of Irish, &ldquo;the strengthening of the national fibre&rdquo;.  Yet, I remember, that one day in my office he came to me&mdash;there were others present&mdash;and he expressed this doubt&mdash;I do not know that there was any man keener on the particular programme that we were then adopting than he was&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;whether with this language drive we are doing as much for the promotion of national feeling as we hope.&rdquo;  It struck me, coming from him, <Col N="2382" /> as an extraordinary doubt.  He went on to say: &ldquo;It strikes me that in my youth the ordinary young man was much more interested in the history of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;possibly it might not be very accurate history: I must say my friend was not so much perturbed about that as about the knowledge or sympathy with Irish history that, for instance, one gets from &ldquo;The Story of Ireland&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;than the youth in our schools at the present day.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I was still in office at the time.  I wonder, looking at many young people to-day, whether a real national spirit is as strong as it used to be.  Now, there may be an explanation for that. I am not for the moment blaming the Irish language for that.  That is not my argument.  All that I am going to say is, that I do not think we have advanced in that direction very much. It may be natural, of course, that the feeling of nationalism would be more keen and more assertive in people who are trying to achieve national liberty than it could be expected to be when that national liberty has been achieved. That may be the explanation, but I cannot, much as I should like to do it, rid myself of the feeling that in that respect the country has possibly retrograded. I should be very slow to think so&mdash;at least it would be altogether against the grain to think so&mdash;and, yet, I find evidences that I must say perturbed me in that particular way.</P>
    <P>Two years ago I raised this matter in the Dáil.  As a rule I refrain from discussing the general policy of the Department of Education, but two years ago I thought the time had come when some kind of an impartial investigation should be made into a number of things, not merely as to whether we want to restore the Irish language, because I take it for granted that we do, but whether we are really restoring it.  It is no good getting thoroughly cloquent and saying how attached the Irish people, as a whole, are to the Irish language; that they would rather die than give up such hope.  The question is: are we doing it?  I do not think anybody can answer that question, or that anybody ought to be rash enough to say &ldquo;yes, we are advancing.&rdquo;  I do not think the reality of the advance can be measured, or <Col N="2383" /> even roughly assessed.  That is one of the reasons why, two years ago, I advocated the appointment of a commission composed, as far as possible, of people who believe in the restoration of the Irish language, but who are not necessarily wedded to any particular method by which the Irish language might be restored.</P>
    <P>Possibly, the minds of some Deputies may not go back to the time, many years ago, when we did make this attempt&mdash;to give a strong impetus to the restoration of Irish by teaching through the medium of Irish.  The attempt, as I say, was unparalleled.  We on our part believed that it could be done.  We thought that even sound educational theory might back us up. Possibly, the wish was very much father to that particular thought, but we did convince ourselves that it could be done.</P>
    <P>Now it has been tried for a number of years, and what reason is there for refusing an inquiry of the kind to which I have referred to see what advance we have made: whether we are making a real genuine advance, whether the methods employed are the proper methods, or whether any improvement is possible?  It may, of course, be questioned that the whole experiment is unsound, that it is a mistake to attempt to restore a language that is dead so far as the great bulk of the population is concerned.  I am not discussing that.  I am assuming that it is our policy to restore the language, and I am pointing out to the House that grave doubts in that respect&mdash;as to the progress we are making, and as to the fruitfulness of the methods that we are employing&mdash;have been put up to me.  I have heard them expressed again and again by ardent friends of the language, by men who can speak the language quite as fluently as I speak English, by men of my own generation, by young people of a later generation who know the language, by men who identified themselves with the promotion of Irish not as a museum subject, not as a mere dead, learned language, but as a living language, by people who saw to it that their children were taught that language, and were fluent in it.  Those are <Col N="2384" /> the people who have expressed grave doubts to me on the subject. Am I, who have no command of the language, whose only work for it was to secure, when there was no compulsion about it, that my children should be taught the language&mdash; am I justified in saying that those people do not know what they are talking about, or that they are less sincere in their advocacy of the Irish language than I was when I was Minister?  Have I the right to sneer at them and say that they are nincompoops?  I do not feel that I have that right, nor do I feel that anybody else has, even by implication, that right.</P>
    <P>I am putting aside those who hold that the whole experiment was fundamentally a mistake.  I am, in discussing this subject, on common ground with the Minister in his desire to restore the language.  Why has the Minister thought fit to ignore the document published by the national teachers?  See the difficulties which he will encounter. The task is immense.  The language is to be restored through the schools. The Minister has stressed, in the speech which he has just delivered, the great difficulties that confront the language. Even though pupils be in the atmosphere of the language during school hours, the moment the bulk of them leave school they hear only the English language.</P>
    <P>That is true in the greater portion of Ireland.  Once pupils leave the national school at the age of 14 years, the great majority of them do not attend any school.  The difficulties are, therefore, immense.  What has been the result of the present method, according to a committee appointed by the national teachers?  Again, you may not accept their verdict.  You may disagree with it.  I cannot quarrel with the Minister for having his own opinion on that matter, but it is doing no service to the language to treat that report practically with contempt.  That committee examined a number of people who were familiar with this problem, who were capable, according to the document published, of carrying out the programme, and who were certified by the Department as being so capable.  This was their deliberate opinion.  That opinion may be wrong, but is the <Col N="2385" /> language served by ignoring it?  I do not think that it is.  Their opinion was that not merely was violence being done by the present system to the young mind, but that damage was being done to the cause of the language. Surely, coming from a body of that kind, that is a matter which deserves the closest possible public examination.</P>
    <P>I never deluded myself, and the Minister should not delude himself, by the belief that there was such enthusiasm for the restoration of the language on the part of the great bulk of the people that obstacles of that kind could be ignored.  They cannot.  While there is still time, I would earnestly appeal to the Minister to hold investigation into this matter.  I suppose I am wasting my breath.  For two years running, I have urged that course.  I think that I can claim to speak with a little authority on this subject, and I bear in mind, too, that what I am asking the Minister to do is to subject to examination a system, experiment or method which I inaugurated myself. Before the cause of the language is lost, I ask the Minister to undertake that investigation.  I do not want to exaggerate the importance of, or to pass judgment on, this report, formally put forward by the national teachers. It seems to be a remarkably well-documented pronouncement.  It professes&mdash; I do not throw any doubt upon it when I use the word &ldquo;professes&rdquo;; I am merely refraining from passing judgment upon it&mdash;to be based upon evidence which was received and examined.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="2386" /> I find in that document the same doubts which were expressed by men whose enthusiasm for the language is beyond question.  It is almost presumptuous for me to speak of that enthusiasm because mine is but a pale light in comparison with it.  They have the same doubts not as to the desirability of the end to be achieved but as to the methods by which it is to be achieved.  The Minister and others are wrong if they think that agreement on the general policy necessarily means that those who agree with the policy agree with the methods to be adopted for achieving the common aim.  I avoid exaggeration, as I have always done in debates on this Estimate.  I find that, when people get on to this subject, they have an irresistible impulse to indulge in exaggeration on one side or the other.  That would be one of the difficulties the Minister would have to face in appointing a committee for this purpose.  But surely the intellectual calibre of the State has not fallen so low under the aegis of the past or present Minister for Education that we cannot find half a dozen men objectively to examine a matter of this kind. If that be the case, I am afraid that there is little to be said for the value of the educational system or the high lights which it produces.</P>
    <P>I move to report progress.</P>
