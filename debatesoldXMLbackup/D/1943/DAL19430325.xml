      <NameTxt>Mr. P.S. Doyle (for Mr. McGilligan)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance to indicate whether any inflationary tendency has been observed in this country in the last two years, and to estimate how far this has been brought about by (a) the increased circulation of money in Éire due to earnings of citizens of Éire working in England; (b) Government borrowing and the spending of such borrowed moneys; and (c) any other cause.</P>

      <P>In the present conditions of world war it is inevitable that inflationary tendencies should exist everywhere.  The resultant inflation cannot be ascribed in precise proportion to the several causes in operation, but there can be little doubt that the causes (a) and (b) referred to by the Deputy are of much less significance than other causes, especially the high level of agricultural and other domestic prices, the considerable increase in wages, and the great volume of public expenditure on the Army and various emergency purposes.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne (Junior)</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether he is aware that some benevolent societies are anxious to provide new pensions and to increase their present payments to retired workers and their widows from funds to which the workers have contributed, but that the provision of <Col N="1490" /> such would operate to deprive the recipients of corresponding amounts of old age pension; and if, in view of this fact and of the greatly increased cost of living, he will amend the Old Age Pension Acts so as to allow old age pensioners to receive increased means without prejudice to their present rates of old age pension.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>In calculating the means of a person for old age pension purposes account is taken, <i>inter alia</i>, of the income which that person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year, in cash, excluding certain items specifically exempted by law.  The rate of pension payable per week is based on the yearly means of the pensioner.  An increase in a cash allowance paid to an old age pensioner might disentitle him to the rate of pension of which he is in receipt, and steps would then have to be taken to reduce his pension to the appropriate rate.</P>
      <P>Since September, 1941, allowances in kind have been given to old age pensioners (including blind persons and their dependent children) resident in county boroughs and incorporated towns.  A fuel scheme has been put into operation during the past winter to supply fuel at cheap rates to necessitous classes, including old age pensioners and blind pensioners in county boroughs, boroughs and urban districts in non-turf areas.  I am not prepared to take action on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In view of his continued refusal to allow old persons to receive extra cash payments to meet the cost of living, and in view of the appeals from all sides of the House, will the Minister not consider making provision similar to that which applies in the case of widows' and orphans' pensions whereby an amount up to £6 10s. 0d. a year is allowable before the means test is operated?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The allowance does not take into account the increase in the <Col N="1491" /> cost of living.  It allows for a certain amount of the essentials of life in the way of food but there are other essentials. Will the Minister ever realise, or will the Fianna Fáil Republican Government ever realise, that old persons cannot offer buttons to the rent collector, cannot buy the essentials of life with their prayers or their good wishes, or cannot be sustained with the alleged consoling thought that there is a better Ireland just around the corner because their hungry grandchildren and great-grandchildren are learning to repeat, parrot-like, &ldquo;a dó is a dó, sin a ceathair&rdquo;?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will say whether he has received any representations with reference to the low rate of 1d. per lb. on butter fixed by him to cover handling costs and profit, and whether, as business people with heavy overhead charges find it impossible to handle butter at this rate, he will reconsider his decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Questions Nos. 3 and 4 together.  It is evident that the Deputy misunderstands the position. The Order made by me and which came into force on the 15th March fixed the maximum retail price of all butter at 2/- per lb., which was the prevailing price for bulk butter in Dublin during practically the past 12 months.  Representations have been made as to the rate of profit which this price allows, and generally it was suggested that the margin was 1d. per lb.  This is not correct.  In the sale of bulk butter, the retailer's margin varies from 2d. to 2½d. per lb. according to the quantity he purchases.  The representations made have had my most careful consideration and I am satisfied that I would not be justified in increasing the price to the consumer above that now fixed by Order.  In the light of the representations received I am having further investigations made in regard to the sale and distribution of roll butter, that is, butter supplied by creameries already weighed and wrapped in lb. lots.  I should say, however, that it is not intended to increase the prices to consumers above 2/- per lb.</P>

      <P>In the country.  I am not concerned with Dublin.  The bulk <Col N="1493" /> of the butter sold is roll butter, and in a great many cases other costs have to be added to the wholesale price. Traders therefore find it impossible to handle butter within the margin of 1d. per lb. allowed.</P>

      <P>I am not aware that harness makers in County Dublin are unable to obtain supplies of ticken, or that coupon equivalent licences granted to such persons for the purchase of ticken cannot be met by traders in Dublin City.  Supplies of ticken are being made available to traders for distribution but, as these supplies are restricted, because of the shortage of yarn, harness makers may not be able to get all they would wish. A scheme to conserve supplies of harness ticken for harness makers has been prepared in agreement with the distributors and will be put into operation at an early date.  I am aware that hemp is not obtainable, but limited supplies of a satisfactory substitute are available.</P>

      <P>The following is the best information available in my Department on the various heads of the Deputy's question:&mdash;(a) The percentage increases in the cost of living between mid-August, 1939, and mid-February, 1943, were as follows:&mdash;(1) food, 54 per cent.; (2) fuel and light, 84 per cent; (3) all other items, 59 per cent.; and (4) all items, 58 per cent. In this connection it should, however, be remembered that the cost-of-living index is prepared on the basis of the cost of quantities of various commodities estimated to have been consumed by a family of 5.6 persons during a period in June, 1922.  Many of these commodities are not now purchasable in the quantities assumed and some may not be available at all.  (b) The increase between 1st September, 1939, and 1st September, 1942, in the rate of wages in certain industries producing transportable goods is estimated at 9.4 per cent.  Separate particulars are not available for persons in receipt of less than £6 per week or more than £6 per week.  The percentage increase for each of 12 industrial groups will be published in the forthcoming issue of the <i>Irish Trade Journal and Statistical Bulletin.</i>  (c) The average retail price in Dublin (1) for coal as used by the wage-earning classes was 3/3 per cwt. both in mid-May, <Col N="1496" /> 1939, and in mid-August, 1939. (2) In accordance with Emergency Powers (Control of Prices) (No. 135) Order, 1942, the maximum retail price of turf on and from the 11th May, 1942, in the County Borough of Dublin was 3d. per dozen sods up to a maximum of 4 stone.  All quantities in excess of 4 stone must be sold by weight at not greater than the fixed price of 64/- per ton, or 3/2½d. per cwt.</P>

      <P>As the Deputy is no doubt aware, the estimates of my Department for this year provided only £50,000 for this purpose. I do not think that the Deputy's forecast will prove to be correct.  The Government grant to public assistance authorities for the purpose of providing assistance in kind to home assistance recipients is effective up to the end of the present month.  The withdrawal of the grant does not necessarily involve the cessation of such allowances.  The <Col N="1498" /> disbursement of assistance to necessitous persons is a responsibility of the public assistance authority and the additional assistance in kind which was provided this year out of a Government grant can be continued to be made by such bodies in appropriate cases from their own funds without seriously affecting their financial position.  In this connection, the Deputy must not lose sight of the fact that within the past few weeks recipients of unemployment assistance in rural areas have been granted increased allowances at a cost of £150,000 to the Exchequer.  For this and other reasons, there is every likelihood that the demand for home assistance in rural areas will be considerably reduced and, in any event, will not be greater than can be met readily and conveniently out of their own resources by the local authorities concerned.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the question, the cases referred to are, presumably, those in connection with which an assistance officer has been removed from his post.  The present information at my disposal would imply that the home assistance recipients continued to receive special food allowances but that the traders supplying the goods remained unpaid for some time as a result of the negligence of the officer concerned.  I have caused a special audit to be made of the expenditure of home assistance in the county.</P>

      <P>I have seen a copy of the notice served on the occupier of lands on the Kirkpatrick estate at Coolmine, County Dublin, limiting, subject to penalty, cultivation on the holding to certain fields mentioned in the question. Article 13 of the Emergency Powers (No. 234) Order, 1942, provides that no such restriction incorporated in any covenant or agreement affecting the lands shall have effect so as to interfere with the cultivation required by the Order.  There is, therefore, no necessity for any action by me at this stage.  I understand that the occupier has, in fact, arranged to cultivate an area in excess of the prescribed quota for the current year.</P>

The Land Commission have not, so far, taken any further steps in the matter and the case (with many others) is now governed by the emergency restrictions which prevent the undertaking of fresh commitments except in special circumstances.</P>

A notice was issued to the owner intimating that the Land Commission, after inspection, had decided to proceed with the acquisition, and informing him that the notices prescribed by the Land Act would be published and served on him in due course.  In the meantime, owing to the emergency, it was found necessary to curtail the operations of the Land Commission, and, at the moment, I cannot say when the proceedings are likely to be continued.</P>

Does he not think that the resumption notice ought to be executed right away, or that the farm ought to be left the property of the tenant? Does not the Minister appreciate that the moment a tenant is served with a resumption notice he has no further interest in the farm, and that he will get what he can out of it while the going is good?  Is that good national policy?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot accept Deputy Hughes' interpretation of the position as the owner obviously has his rights <Col N="1503" /> to appear before the Land Commissioners and also to appeal to the Appeal Tribunal, in the event of his being dissatisfied with the price.  I am not at all in agreement with him that the owner is not interested in the matter merely because a resumption notice has been served.  That would mean that all lands in respect of which such notices have been served were automatically taken over.  We know that a certain legal procedure has to be followed and there is no certainty whatever, when the Land Commission institute proceedings, after they have served notice, that in fact the land will be ultimately acquired.</P>
      <P>With regard to Deputy MacEoin's point, the position in 1938 was that, owing to a legal decision, all operations for the acquisition of land were held up for a considerable time until amending legislation was brought in.  By the time this amending legislation had become law and the necessary rules of court made to enable it to be brought into effect, the war had begun, and all proceedings were then held up, except those which were well advanced. The matter is under constant consideration, but I fear I cannot make any promise at present that the Land Commission will continue proceedings at any early date.</P>

Has the Minister taken into consideration the fact that there are a number of uneconomic holders in the vicinity who are prepared to manure and cultivate the land properly?

      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no question of setting a bad example to the rest of the community, as the Land Commission have tilled more than the appropriate quota of the lands in their possession since the compulsory tillage Orders came into operation.  These lands, as I have said, were let by auction last week.  The Land Commission are not in a position at present to implement schemes for certain lands in their possession, owing to shortage of staff.  A very large number of our inspectorial staff have been transferred to the compulsory tillage section of the Department of Agriculture.  In addition, a very large number of staff from the acquisition, resale and purchase branches of the Land Commission have been transferred to other Departments for work arising out of the emergency.  The result is that it has been found necessary to curtail greatly the work of the Land Commission.  In addition, only a very limited amount of petrol is available for the limited staff at my disposal, so that, even if normal conditions obtain in the near future, it will take some time to have all these schemes put into operation.</P>

In so far as that Act has failed in its purpose, because of technical flaws in drafting or otherwise, a comprehensive effort is being made in the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Bill, which is at present before the Oireachtas, to remedy any such flaws, and the protection of Part V is, in fact, being extended to leaseholders to whom the 1931 Act did not apply, namely, leaseholders in non-urban areas.

Payments at the full rate agreed on (i.e., 7/- per Irish perch) were subsequently made to owners of a number of banks on which turf was cut by military personnel, but in certain cases arrangements were inadvertently made with the same persons in respect of banks which had been acquired by the Irish Land Commission under the Emergency <Col N="1510" /> Powers Order, and payments for turf cut and removed by the military from these banks will be made direct by my Department to the Irish Land Commission.  The amounts to be paid to the persons whose turbary rights were acquired is a matter for the Irish Land Commission.  I am asking the Minister for Lands to look into the matter with a view to expediting settlement of the claims.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I said last night, Sir, that I was prepared to support this Bill in so far as it proposed to complete the organisation of the creameries under the co-operative movement.  It was probably never more necessary than now that all the creameries should be organised under one head.  Post-war conditions, conceivably, might make it inevitable that there should be uniformity in the development and marketing of our dairy produce, if any, and, so far as we have had experience, the co-operative form of organisation best lends itself to that development in marketing.  There may be other views, of course.  Deputy Dillon, for instance, speaking yesterday, seemed rather to disagree with co-operation in dairying, and suggested two other courses: one, that the Government should withdraw from the business altogether and let competition wipe out the inefficient creameries, and the second, to establish a board, somewhat on the lines of the Electricity Supply Board, which would be given a monopoly.  Now, as regards the first proposal, it was in operation for a good number of years and led up to the conditions which made it imperative on the late Mr. Hogan, then Minister for Agriculture, to see about the organisation of the creameries in the co-operative way. <Col N="1513" /> We have had years of experience of the running of co-operative creameries, and there has been no adverse criticism of that system.  On the whole, it has been run very successfully. Deputy Dillon's second proposal, to create a monopoly, by which the business would be, conducted otherwise than through a co-operative society, would not be approved of by any farmer in this country, and I doubt if it would be approved of by any business people in the country.  The people are rather afraid of monopolies.  On the whole, I believe the co-operative scheme is the only one that presents any hope of success.</P>
      <P>So far, most of us are in agreement with the Bill, but there is a fear amongst the people principally concerned that, although it purports to include all the creameries in the co-operative movement, it will not immediately achieve that purpose.  The Minister, speaking yesterday, rather added to those fears, because when he was introducing the Bill he said that it might be asked whether the board was competent to run all this business, and on that point he would say there would be need for further legislation. He went on to say that it would be necessary to regularise the board's position.  He said that in fact there were four bodies operating under the board, with the one staff.  If it is not the intention to allow the Dairy Disposals Board to continue in operation when they have acquired the remainder of the proprietary creameries, why did the Minister speak in that way?  If there is no intention of carrying on the Dairy Disposals Board indefinitely, then it is not easy to see the need for legislation regularising their position. Does the Minister intend to convey that they have been irregularly running their business for the last 15 or 16 years?  We all know that they carried on their activities under great difficulties at the start, and that for a long time they traded at a loss.  One does not blame them for that; in the circumstances I certainly do not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We should like to be assured by the Minister, when he is replying, that there is a definite intention, immediately the creameries are <Col N="1514" /> acquired, to pass them on to be run by the farmers, and further, that there will be a time limit to the activities in general of the Dairy Disposals Board.  That body was set up by the late Mr. Hogan for a definite object, to carry out his idea of complete co-operation in the creamery business.  Nobody conceived that that operation would take 15 or 16 years.  There may have been a reason why certain commercial activities, like the manufacture of condensed milk, and one or two items like that, might have been carried on by the board or by some other body if the farmers themselves were not ready to engage in those particular activities, but in regard to creameries which the board has held for the last 15 or 16 years, there does not appear to the ordinary person any reason why most of them could not have been handed over to the farmers. There may be reasons which have not been advanced in this House.  One cannot gather from the meagre information that we have had whether or not some of those creameries were an economically sound proposition, but as far as my knowledge of creameries goes, I have no reason to assume that they were not.  The experience of the co-operative running of creameries for a number of years past has been that nearly all of them have been run successfully and economically.  One hesitates to assume that the Dairy Disposals Board were unlucky enough to get only creameries that could not be successfully worked.</P>
    <P>During the debate, there has been a great deal of criticism of the general financial position of the Dairy Disposals Board.  I do not want to criticise it in an undesirable way.  I realise that eventually, when everything is cleared up, there will be a certain sum which the State will have to bear. I do not think any Deputy believed from the start of the operations of the board that there would not be such a sum.  But one cannot conceive any reason why the accounts of the board have not been presented to the Dáil in the usual manner.  Everybody who has any interest in the matter has found <Col N="1515" /> it exceedingly difficult to get any real idea as to what is the financial position of the concern.  The Minister said that it controls four or five different bodies working under the same staff. Surely it would have been possible to segregate the operations of the different bodies?  For instance, surely it would have been possible to present a profit and loss account in the case of the condensed milk concern, and in the case of each of the other concerns operated by the board.  It is not inconceivable that a profit and loss account could have been presented for each individual creamery.  In the early days, there may have been a reason why those accounts were not given.  I believe there was.  I think there was a hope at one time that a certain portion of the business of the Dairy Disposals Board, outside of the ordinary creamery work, would be passed to other hands.  It was hoped at one time that commercial concerns might eventually purchase or control them. It is possible that the Minister did not want to publish all the financial intricacies of the board at that time. But for years past there has been no reason whatsoever why the House should not have been given a full account of the financial position of the board.  For a number of years past, the House has been, to all intents and purposes, voting money for the Dairy Disposals Board in much the same manner as we vote money for the Secret Service Fund.  We get practically the same amount of information as to the expenditure of the money. That is a position which should not be allowed to continue indefinitely, and I should like to see the whole matter cleared up.  Those are the two points which have been raised generally in the debate, first, that there is no hope that the completion of the acquisition of the various creameries will be advanced by this Bill, and secondly, that the finances of the body which is to control them for the time being ought to be disclosed to the House. As I said, I do not see any reason why that information should not be given.</P>
    <P>There are various excuses offered as <Col N="1516" /> to why the creameries held by the Dairy Disposals Board have not been passed on to the farmers during the last 14 or 15 years.  One does not know what is the real cause.  I would like to suggest that perhaps it is because the other body that is intimately connected with the dairying business, the I.A.O.S., has not fully co-operated. Has the I.A.O.S. been to blame in any way for the hesitancy to pass on the creameries to the farmers?  These are points upon which the country would like to be assured before we pass this measure.</P>
    <P>Most of the Deputies who spoke on this Bill are in favour of the proposal that the Minister says he has in mind, to finish the job started by the late Mr. Hogan.  If we could be satisfied that that is the real intention underlying the Bill and that it is going to be put into operation speedily, then I do not think there will be any great objection raised.  While the principle involved in the Bill is a simple one, the Bill itself, in some of its sections, has presented some rather terrifying features to Deputies not intimately concerned with the creamery industry.  There are, for instance; clauses which give certain powers to the Dairy Disposals Board and there would appear to be no time limit to their activities.  There is no assurance that, having acquired the creameries with Government aid and with money voted by this House, they will not hold on to those creameries for another 18 or 20 years, and perhaps indefinitely.  I think there should be some assurance given to the House that that is not the intention.  I would prefer to see in the Bill, in plain language, a time limit to the operations of the Dairy Disposals Board; there should be a time limit within which the creameries acquired, if not, as the Minister stated, altogether put out of operation because of redundancy, would be passed on to the farmers.</P>
    <P>If the Dairy Disposals Board is going to carry on these concerns for as long a period as they have carried on the creameries since the amalgamation proposed by the late Mr. Hogan, <Col N="1517" /> then one sees no great difference in the existing position; they might be run for another 15 years in accordance with present arrangements, or they might be carried on under the Dairy Disposals Board&mdash;either way, I believe, would run them efficiently&mdash;but the House has a right to know what the position is.  I hope the Minister will make the financial position of the Dairy Disposals Board perfectly clear. He might give us some indication of their liabilities; we do not require an exact return of their operations.  The farming community welcome the publication of the financial position of any body carrying on, directly or indirectly, any form of agricultural activity.  We have pleaded for that here on many an occasion.  The more the public know about the financial position of organisations concerned with agricultural matters, the better. I believe the House has a right to this information.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear from the Minister that it is the intention speedily to pass on the creameries acquired to the farmers, and perhaps he will consider the wisdom of inserting a clause in the Bill imposing a time limit within which the creameries will be handed over.  Indeed, there ought to be a time limit put to the operations of the Dairy Disposals Board.  I have never criticised that body unfairly.  I am not criticising their operations now.  They have carried out the difficult work allotted to them in a creditable manner, but I think the time has arrived when the board should be dissolved and their work carried on, in the main, by farmers.  The portion of the work which farmers may not be prepared to undertake might be carried on by this particular board, reorganised in some fashion, or by some other body that the Minister might think it well to establish.  I hope the day will soon arrive when the farmers will be prepared to carry on the rather technical work in which the Dairy Disposals Board engages. Perhaps the time is not ripe for that now.</P>
    <P>I am as interested in the extension of the co-operative movement as any Deputy.  I want to see that type of <Col N="1518" /> thing hastened and, in so far as this Bill purports to hasten it, I am willing to give it my support.  I am rather hesitant to believe that there will be any immediate development in that respect, but I hope the Minister will make it clear that his intention is that it will be achieved as speedily as possible.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ErnestEdmondsonBenso" hpid="Mr. Benson Mr. Benson">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Benson</NameTxt>
      <P>I object to the principle underlying this Bill and I think the House should be very slow to pass a measure of this description, which gives practically confiscatory powers to a body such as is proposed here.  I think the House should hesitate more particularly because the body to which it is proposed to give these powers is one over which it has absolutely no control and of which it has practically no knowledge.  The Minister may be able to advance satisfactory reasons&mdash; unfortunately, I had not an opportunity of hearing his opening statement &mdash;why these powers should be given, but I think on principle it is wrong that the House should hand over confiscatory powers over ordinary commercial interests without some very sound reasons for doing so.  I think the Minister should very specifically explain the meaning and intention of Section 5, which is almost a unique section.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Most of the remarks made with reference to this Bill have been by way of criticism of the Dairy Disposals Board.  This company was apparently born out of wedlock, and its existence was not legalised until some time after it was there.  In fact, its early days seem to have been somewhat unsettled. I think that is explainable in this way: that it appears the original hope was that it would be a purely temporary structure, and that the time would not be long before all the creameries which it took over would be either closed down or formed into co-operative societies and handed back to the farmers for operation.  That, at least, is suggested by the name of the company. If the company is to continue, I think its name ought to be changed from the Dairy Disposals Company to the Dairy Acquisition Company.  The position is that something like half the creameries <Col N="1519" /> that have been taken over are still, I believe, being operated by this company.</P>
    <P>This Bill proposes to give the company power to take over more creameries.  What the final intention is we do not know.  The Minister did say&mdash;Deputy Bennett has already referred to it&mdash;that he proposes to regularise the position of the company, but, as far as I understand, he did not give any amplification of what he means by the word &ldquo;regularise.&rdquo;  I hope that, when replying, he will do so.  The Minister also indicated that further legislation will be introduced. That, it seems to me, is the general system of operation by the present Government in dealing with matters of this description.  They introduce one piece of legislation and say that another Bill will deal with an ancillary subject, so that it is impossible to learn from the one what the effect of the other may be on it.  We had an example of that a little while ago from the Minister for Local Government and Public Health in the case of three Bills from his Department, all inter-related and all introduced at different times. The result was that if a matter was raised on one Bill we could always be told that it could only be dealt with under either of the other two.  Here the Minister is proposing to give this company fresh powers, and, at the same time, tells us that he proposes to introduce further legislation dealing with the company.  I think he should have introduced the legislation dealing with the company first, or, at all events, should have introduced the two Bills together so that we might get a true picture of the situation.  The position is, as so many Deputies have said, that money is being voted by the House year after year and we have absolutely no record of what is being done with it.  The Banking Commission had something to say on this. On page 291 of their report they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It will be evident from the foregoing description that there is much in the present arrangements which is incompatible with any proper system of Parliamentary control of State activities, and with the need <Col N="1520" /> for affording opportunity for adequate public understanding of what courses of action are pursued in this matter by the Government and with what financial results.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Finally, they say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The issue as a Government publication of accounts adequate to indicate the financial results should be made mandatory.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>With that I think everybody must agree.  As to the relative merits of the operation of creameries by co-operative societies, or by a company or board, such as this purports to be, I am not competent to speak.  I do not know anything about the matter, and it would be very foolish of me to offer any remarks on that aspect of the question. The point which I do want to make is that the present position of this company is not satisfactory from anybody's point of view.  I think that the Minister should have indicated more clearly&mdash;better still, by the actual production of a Bill&mdash;what form he proposes the company should take in the future.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Keyes</NameTxt>
      <P>Like some of the previous speakers, I am rather anxious to know if the Minister is satisfied that he can make any case at all for this legislation.  One would imagine that there are many more urgent matters calling for the attention of the Government. Where did the demand come from for this legislation, and what purpose is it going to serve?  It is supposed to be in the interests of co-operation, and of the more efficient organisation of the creamery industry. It seems to me that its purpose is to continue the policy of the Dairy Disposals Board&mdash;the acquisition of successful undertakings.  It was stated that there was some overlapping in the West Cork area and that, consequently, the working of some creameries there was uneconomic.  It would be interesting to have the causes of that overlapping explained.  So far as my information goes, the concerns which are to be acquired have all been a success.  The milk war has been referred to.  I understand that the proprietary concerns were not responsible <Col N="1521" /> for that.  It was forced on them by those who now seem inclined to gobble them up.  The milk war ceased when the aggression ceased.  The position was that the people who were running those creameries had to protect themselves.  That was how the milk war came about.  We have not a milk war now, but we have a price war which does not seem to call for the introduction of legislation on the part of the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the County Limerick, owing to the fact that some creameries seem to be getting favoured treatment as against others, a good deal of inequality prevails as regards the disposal of milk.  Has the Minister statistics before him to show the abnormal profits made by some creameries due to the favoured treatment they have received under the Government scheme?  They have been able to make thousands and thousands of pounds in excess of what they normally could have made if the milk taken to the creameries had been employed for its primary purpose of being turned into butter.  If the proprietary creameries have been worked successfully that, surely, is no justification for Government intervention and their compulsory acquisition.  The owners should be free to continue to carry on their business and make a success of it.  They have been giving good employment.  If there is this overlapping, some method, other than that of compulsory acquisition, should be found in order to correct the position. They certainly should not be handed over to the Dairy Disposals Board, to a combine which is receiving public money and is not obliged to account to the public as to how it spends that money.  The extracts that have been read from the Reports of the Public Accounts Committee indicate that, over a long number of years, the board has not shown a profit in the carrying out of its operations.  We are told that there was provisionally a profit, but the Public Accounts Committee discloses that of the £1,500,000 handed over to them they still owe to the country £970,000, against which the only asset is the fixed buildings and plant which, we are also told on the authority of the accountant, would not <Col N="1522" /> be sufficient to meet the charges against them from public funds.  It is, therefore, difficult to see where the profit has been made under the expert guidance of these people.  If they have not been able to make a profit from the creameries for the purpose of reconditioning, reconstructing and reorganising over the period of years from 1927 to 1943, there would not seem to be any strong guiding principle to encourage us to hand over further creameries which we know happen to be successful at the moment.</P>
    <P>The only assurance we will get from our action in this matter is that certain of these creameries will be closed down in the interests of more economic working.  In closing down creameries, men will be disemployed and, possibly, inconvenience will be inflicted upon suppliers.  I cannot discuss that in detail, but it is possible and probable that the convenience of adjacency will be taken from them and there is also the certainty that men will be thrown on the scrap heap.  Such men should not be forgotten, but the framers of the Bill do not seem to think it worth while to insert a specific clause into it guaranteeing compensation for the men so disemployed.  Surely, men who have built up the creamery industry and given their lives to it are entitled to reasonable compensation, if some other combine were going to come in with the avowed purpose of improving the creamery industry.  These men should have no right to come in with <i>carte blanche</i> to close down any creamery that they consider it necessary to close down and not be compelled to provide any compensation for the people whom they make redundant.</P>
    <P>As far as leaving these things to the fine, good, generous spirit of the people operating it, we have had examples in the 1927 Act where provision was made for compensation for redundant creamery workers; and I know&mdash;and other Deputies from the south know&mdash;that for many years we have been chased and pursued by the victims of that Act, who failed to get one penny piece from the compensation clauses.  They were so cluttered up with barriers and obstacles that <Col N="1523" /> some men died without receiving one penny in compensation for the loss of their livelihood, having given the best part of their lives to the creamery industry.  Surely, in 1943, if the majority of this House will insist on forcing this unwanted and unnecessary measure through this House, when the House is certain that men will be disemployed, the responsibility of being public representatives should not allow us to let the Bill go through without its having certain specific and clearly shown compensation clauses on a reasonable basis for the men who will become redundant.</P>
    <P>At a time like that through which we are now passing, appeals are being made by the Government to private employers of every kind to try to retain their staffs in this national emergency as a national gesture, but this is gratuitously ignored by the Government, although there is an assurance that it is going to cause further unemployment. If it does not create further unemployment, the Bill is valueless from the point of view of its promoters, as they wish to close down and so dismiss.  I suggest that further reasons should be adduced by the Minister as to the necessity for the Bill at this juncture.  We are told by the Minister that he has been satisfied in his own mind as to the improvement that will materialise in the creamery industry as the result of this measure. Surely, if he is to have the measure granted and passed in this House, he will assure the House that he will take the necessary steps to see that there will be no further infliction on the unfortunate victims of it, but that reasonable and clearly-defined compensation clauses will be set down in the Bill to compensate them, if they can be compensated, for the loss of their livelihood.</P>

      <P>As far as I can recollect, only four Deputies opposed the Bill&mdash; Deputies Murphy and Keyes and Deputies Dillon and Benson.  Strange to say, we had the spectacle here of Deputy Murphy&mdash;a man who is alleged to have Labour principles&mdash;standing up for capitalism as against co-operation <Col N="1524" /> or State ownership.  Deputy Keyes did not speak so strongly on that line, but I take it that the gist of his speech is that things should be left as they are, and that we should continue to run our creameries as far as possible as capitalistic concerns, and should not try to go any further in the direction of co-operation or State ownership.</P>
      <P>Why there should be an exception in the case of the creamery industry amongst the Labour Party, I do not know.  We have been hearing from the Labour Party that railways should be State controlled, that flour should be State controlled, State owned, and so on; but when it comes to creameries in the Counties Limerick and Cork, where the two Deputies are concerned, then with Deputies Murphy and Keyes evidently principles do not count.</P>

      <P>Deputy Murphy stated the position a little more plainly than Deputy Keyes.  He complained about this State company, the Dairy Disposals Board, getting money from the State and paying no interest.  I thought the Labour Party were going to provide money for everybody after the next election free of interest.  Now we have the Labour Party holding the Dairy Disposals Board up to the ridicule of the people of this country because they will not pay 5 or 6 per cent. interest on money they are getting from the State.  Before he sat down, Deputy Murphy held up before us the appalling spectacle that the Minister&mdash;to quote the Deputy's own words&mdash;&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;can create an entirely new and revolutionary position in this whole matter&rdquo;.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Is the Labour Party becoming afraid of new and revolutionary positions in <Col N="1525" /> the creamery industry and elsewhere? We have the Labour Party objecting to any move whatever away from capitalism, and Deputy Dillon, on the other hand, saying that, as far as he is concerned, he would favour the whole milk industry being put under a milk board.  In other words, State control and ownership for Deputy Dillon, but capitalism for Deputies Murphy and Keyes.  Parties are changing round, and we do not know where they will be before very long.</P>
    <P>Deputy Benson was the only Deputy here, I think, opposing the Bill, who made the type of speech I would expect from Deputy Benson, that is, that we were unjustified, that we had not made a case for going any further in the direction of State control and should leave things as they were under capitalist control.  But I am sure that Deputy Benson did not expect to have as his disciples Deputies Keyes and Murphy, when making that plea.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I made that yesterday, and if Deputy Keyes was not here I cannot help it.  He can read about it in the Official Report next week. Deputy Dillon made the case that the middleman should be eliminated.  That was his case for this State board. There are no middlemen, as far as butter production is concerned.  We have these co-operative creameries to which the producers bring in the milk. They are their own creameries.  In other words, the creamery is co-operatively owned and the products are sold thence practically direct to the consumer, so that there is no middleman there.  There are, of course, middlemen in the liquid milk business, in the distribution of liquid milk in cities, but that only applies to the cities.  Taking the milk business as a whole&mdash;milk, butter, cheese and so on&mdash;I think there is no business where the middleman is so little apparent.  In that way, I do not know if Deputy Dillon could make a very strong case for this plea of a State board to manage the whole business. That plea had better be made on some other line.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Murphy asked me if I were satisfied that I had exhausted all persuasive <Col N="1526" /> methods before resorting to this Bill.  Indeed we have; both the Dairy Disposals Board and I.  I do not think that I or the Minister before me ever intervened in any of these deals between a proprietor and the Dairy Disposals Board until these few cases were left.  Then I did intervene personally, to try to get some co-operation between the two parties, but it failed, and the only possibility of disposing of the few creameries that were left in private hands was to bring in a Bill such as this.  A number of Deputies here agree with the principle of the Bill, but they criticised the Dairy Disposals Board in many ways, mostly on the form in which they presented their accounts.  I do not think that is altogether justified.  I do not think it is fair to say that there is no information whatever given with regard to the working of this board. I gave figures here yesterday which, although they were given in a very comprehensive but not detailed way, would give any Deputy an idea whether the Dairy Disposals Board had made a success of the business or not. I think that the figures went plainly to show that the Dairy Disposals Board, taking everything into account, made a wonderful success of this whole business.  Deputy Dockrell said, for instance, that they were very slow about presenting their accounts, because I had stated that the 1942 balance sheet was not yet available to me.  He said he thought they had contracted Government paralysis.  Why he should say that I do not know. There is no institution in the country which presents its accounts so quickly as the Government.  They present them the morning after the end of the financial year.  I am sure there is no business concern in the city or elsewhere that will do that.  There are many business concerns, I am sure, that have not yet presented their accounts for 1942.  The Dairy Disposals Board may have specific reasons for the delay in the presenting of these accounts.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">

      <P>I said the Government do. The Deputy sarcastically remarked that the Dairy Disposals Board had contracted Government paralysis.  I say that, so far as the Government are concerned, there is no institution which presents its accounts so quickly. They present them the day after the end of the financial year.  The Dairy Disposals Board do present their accounts to me, and they will come along in due course.</P>
      <P>Deputy Hughes hinted that there were huge losses.  That is not so.  Anybody looking at the figures I gave yesterday will see that it is by no means true.  As a matter of fact, anybody looking at the figures I gave yesterday will see, if the Dairy Disposals Board were to avail of the subsidy which they had been authorised to use, and to avail of the amount which the State thought it was their duty to pay, that is the compensation for redundant workers in the various creameries, that taking these two items out, the assets of the board, as shown by the latest return, would be quite sufficient to pay all outstanding amounts to the Government, and probably, in addition to that, pay a fair interest on that money for the length of time they have had it.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon said that I did not want to disclose these accounts because I do not want prospective buyers to know the financial record of any particular unit.  There is something in that, but not for the reason that Deputy Dillon has in mind, because I have had this experience: that where a co-operative society wants to buy a group, if they find that that group has been making a profit, they will say: &ldquo;They have made the profit off us who are their suppliers and, therefore, the price should be a fair price less the profit made for the last eight or ten years.&rdquo; On the other hand, if we say that the group has not made a profit, they will say: &ldquo;If it has not made a profit, it is not worth anything and, therefore, we should get it for nothing.&rdquo; Whatever way you put it, they are able to argue that they should get the group at less than is asked for it.  Therefore, to avoid trouble, it is better not to disclose the figures at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1528" /> Listening to Deputies here, I think they have been rather unfair, because you would imagine that you were dealing with a body that was managing, let us say, a fairly well circumstanced creamery.  When I was coming to town this morning I passed a flock of sheep and after the sheep there was a man with a cart who picked up those that fell out.  It would be very unfair if the owner said he should get the same price at the end of the journey for these sheep which were in the cart as the other ones&mdash;I mean, comparatively speaking.  There is the position we had.  The Dairy Disposals Board had to take up every lame duck in the country; every co-operative society that went wrong for the last 15 years had to be taken over by them, and it is most extraordinary that, even with that, they had to make the business pay.  They had to do that. They had to develop many areas that no capitalist or no co-operative society would attempt to develop.  Does anybody think that any co-operative society or any capitalist would have gone down to develop South Kerry from Cahirciveen around to Castletownbere? I came to the Dáil three or four years ago with an Estimate for £40,000 to develop that area and I said that I was not sure that we would ever get a ½d. back, because it was a very big risk to try to develop that area. I said we would take the risk.  No Deputy thought at that time that we would get back any of that money. That sum is included in the accounts of the Dairy Disposals Board.  They have to account for that £40,000 like everything else.  They had to go in, as I say, to develop an area no one else would attempt to develop.  There were many other areas like that which are not so well known or not so big. Deputy Dillon said yesterday that nobody would attempt to develop a place like West Kerry, because it was obviously not a creamery area.  He is probably right in saying that it was not a creamery area.  Still the board are carrying on there and, what is more, I think they will do well there in time.</P>
    <P>Then the Dairy Disposals Board also had to run other companies like the <Col N="1529" /> Condensed Milk Company and the Toffee Company.  I suppose it is well known to everybody, in the creamery industry anyway, that it is nearly impossible to make a condensed milk company pay between one war and another, and that there were losses on that company, at any rate up to some years before the present war commenced. If the only loss to the State on this whole business is to be what is paid to redundant workers, which is obviously a thing that the industry itself can hardly be asked to carry and, secondly, the loss on resale&mdash;if the board, as they did in the early years, paid a proprietor, say, £16,000 for a certain group, and immediately resold it to a co-operative society for, say, £12,000, then that £4,000 was put down as a subsidy&mdash;we must pay for the reorganisation of the creamery industry in that way.  But I do not think it would be fair to expect that the Dairy Disposals Board, in carrying on the remaining creameries, should be asked to bear that loss.  Surely it would be more reasonable to say to the co-operative society to whom the business was given: &ldquo;You will carry the loss, not we.&rdquo;  Therefore, these two items should be, in all fairness, eliminated from the accounts before we sit down to judge the board on their performance.</P>
    <P>I said here, and it was referred to by some speakers, that it was intended to bring in a Bill to regularise the board, and I was asked what I meant by &ldquo;regularise.&rdquo;  It was started 15 years ago as a private company.  The Minister for Agriculture subscribed all the shares.  As far as I remember, the total share capital is £1, but, anyway, the Minister for Agriculture owns that private company.  It was, of course, considered at that time that it was only a temporary measure, but since that, as I pointed out yesterday, the new duties were cast upon the Dairy Disposals Company of taking over failing co-operatives, which was not one of its first duties at all, and, later still, the development of new areas.  It is thought that it must go on for some time, probably for a long time.  You may get co-operatives to take over some of the groups.  For instance, <Col N="1530" /> negotiations have been proceeding in connection with one of the Cork groups for some time.  The difference is on price.  The Dairy Disposals Company is, I believe, reasonable in the price they are asking for that concern.  The co-operative society, admittedly, have offered a very good price, but the gap has not been bridged.  At any rate, it shows that the Dairy Disposals Board is prepared to sell, but they think that they should get value for what they are selling and as soon as they get that they will sell.  There may be other groups in Cork where sale will take place in the near future, or some time in the future, but as you come down to areas that are recently developed in Kerry or areas that are recently reorganised in Clare, it may be a long time before you will get co-operative societies to undertake to buy those creameries, and for that reason I believe the Dairy Disposals Company will be necessary for a long time to come and we must bring in this Bill to regularise the position of the company.</P>
    <P>I explained yesterday also that at present they are operating as four separate companies.  Some of the business is operated by the Dairy Disposals Company, some by the Newmarket Dairy Company, some by the Condensed Milk Company, and some by the Toffee Company.  It is proposed in the new legislation to transfer all the business to one company and to lay down certain principles, and so on, governing the company.  At that stage, naturally, the Dáil will have to get a very full account of the whole working of the company from the beginning up to the present time.  In the Department of Agriculture, working with the Dairy Disposals Company, we are preparing this Bill to regularise the position, and we are also getting the accounts prepared, because it is obvious that we cannot bring that Bill here without giving the Dáil a full account of everything.  In the meantime, if possible, I would be prepared to issue more detailed figures than I gave to the Dáil yesterday.  As I said already, the 1942 balance sheet is not yet ready, but I can get the 1941 balance sheet and, as soon as possible, <Col N="1531" /> issue some figures that will make it plain to Deputies how the company stands.  I do not think it would be wise now to give any figures for any individual group, and that will not be necessary.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  The totals all round, I think, should be quite sufficient. Deputy Hughes asked a question yesterday in regard to a figure of £236,000 which has been paid back.  Of the capital advanced by the State, the company has paid back £236,000.  He asked me if it included any capital sums repaid by co-operatives.  I said I would have to look it up to see if anything like that took place in the early history of the company, because I was quite sure that, for the last ten or 12 years, the money was coming in each year only at the rate of roughly one-eight of the purchase money.</P>
      <P>I find that, even from the beginning, the money came in almost in all cases in that way from the co-operatives, that is, when a co-operative purchases a creamery or a group of creameries from the Dairy Disposals Board, when they agree on the price, they are given eight years to pay.  They pay one-eight of the purchase price plus interest for eight years to come. Usually, but not in all cases&mdash;it is their own business&mdash;they in turn levy this off the suppliers at so much per cow and in that way it is paid over the eight years.  That is how that money is coming in.  £236,000 has been repaid in that way to the end of 1941.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I was asked about policy.  The policy is in no way changed; circumstances have changed.  The policy is to see that these creameries are given back to the co-operatives.  Circumstances certainly have changed.  For instance, if this Bill goes through and if we take over those units that are dealt with in this Bill, there will be, to some extent, the same procedure as in 1927, that is, some of them will go over immediately to the co-operatives without being held at all by the Dairy Disposals Board; some of them, of <Col N="1532" /> course, will go to units at present held by the Dairy Disposals Board and some of them, where reorganisation is necessary, as it is in one particular area, may be held for some time by the Dairy Disposals Board until reorganisation is complete.  That is the sort of thing that happened in 1927.  The same thing will happen now. That would show that, as far as policy is concerned, there is no change whatever. The policy is to see that all the groups at present held by the Dairy Disposals Board will go to the co-operative societies, but when or how is a different matter.</P>
    <P>I have already explained that it may be a long time before some of these groups go back to co-operatives.  It may be quite a long time.  In the meantime, while they are there, it may happen, if some co-operative falls on evil days through one cause or another, that the board may be asked to take it over or there may be some new area where it is necessary to develop the creamery industry.  I do not think there are many areas left, but there may be some new area which they may think it well to develop. All that, of course, will again postpone the end of their existence.  As a proof that the policy is not changed, I have mentioned that negotiations have been going on for the purchase of one group in North Cork, and the only difference between the two parties is in regard to price.</P>
    <P>I was asked also by some of the Deputies here whether it was a fact that the Dairy Disposals Board was demanding a plebiscite of the suppliers before a group would be taken over by a co-operative society and, if so, why.  I do not think there is going to be a plebiscite exactly, but I think, on the other hand, that the Dairy Disposals Board must satisfy itself that there is a genuine desire amongst the suppliers to get the group taken over by a co-operative society.  They would be very wrong to make a bargain with, say, a half-dozen people who were purporting or pretending to act for a co-operative society and who could afterwards be regarded more as interested persons than members of a co-operative society.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1533" /> The board is appointed by me because the Minister for Agriculture is the only shareholder, but the arrangement is that, first of all, they are under an obligation to get sanction from the Minister for Agriculture for any capital expenditure.  Apart from that, however, in the ordinary everyday working of the business, they carry on there as an ordinary business board and they are not interfered with in any way by the Department of Agriculture or by the Minister.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan said that it appeared to him that the Minister had a hand in the working of that company because, not only did they see how the cat jumped but, evidently, they were able to act before the cat jumped in many cases.  That certainly displays great sagacity on their part, and if they have such intelligence as that, I can only attribute it to their early training in their early environment.</P>
    <P>Section 5 was raised by Deputy Dockrell and also, I think, by Deputy Benson.  That section, or a similar section, has been inserted in many Bills that went through this House recently. It is merely to provide that before the Dairy Disposals Board will pay a proprietor whatever is due to him for his creameries, if he gets a demand, say, from the Revenue Commissioners for income-tax or from the Land Commission for land annuities, they will pay these Government Departments whatever is due to them and deduct it from the price paid to the person concerned. That is a general provision and I do not know that we can find any great fault with it because the Government does claim priority in such cases.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon in his speech also referred to the position of butter supplies. I suppose I should be gratified really that the worst that Deputy Dillon could urge against me was his futile misrepresentation that I was responsible for the shortage of butter in the country.  As a matter of fact, supplies of butter have decreased by less than 10 per cent. since the period before the war.  Before the war, we exported quite a lot of butter but even now, though our supplies, as I say, have decreased by less than 10 per <Col N="1534" /> cent., and even though there is now no export of butter, we find that butter is scarce.  The obvious reason is that other fats such as margarine are not available.  As I say that sort of futile misrepresentation does no good to anybody. I could claim as against that that there is more butter in the country than there was in 1931 before I took office, but I do not see what good it is going to do to anybody.  It would not result in giving anybody in the city more than a ½ lb. of butter per week, but it is a fact nevertheless.</P>
    <P>The next question raised by a number of Deputies was the matter of provision for employees.  First of all, the number of employees has been very much exaggerated.  It is nothing like the 200, 300 or 400 mentioned by some speakers; the number is actually between 60 and 70.  Secondly, all employees will not be dismissed automatically. In fact, every effort will be made to have them retained in employment.  I do not agree with Deputy Keyes that if we succeed in keeping all these men on, then our work will be for nothing.  After all, if we can persuade a co-operative creamery to keep the men with the business they take over, even though that may mean for the time being that there will be some men redundant in the service, perhaps in the course of a year or two somebody may fall out of the service at some other point.  In other words, they may have only to carry these redundant men for a short time.  Certainly we shall try to persuade those who are taking over the concerns to take the employees with them.  There was no provision in the 1927 Act for employees.  There was an undertaking&mdash;I do not know whether I should call it an undertaking&mdash;but at any rate some compensation was given to employees under the 1927 Act. I quite agree that no compensation will make up for loss of employment. Our aim should be to see that the employment is continued, but where that is impossible we should do something about compensation.</P>
    <P>It is not, however, an easy matter to provide for that in a Bill.  In fact, I should object strongly to putting it into the Bill.  It was tried before, not <Col N="1535" /> in my Department, but in other Departments, and it led to endless trouble.  If we were to provide in the Bill that an employee of a creamery must be guaranteed employment by the person taking over the creamery, then that man would have a legal right to be taken over and he could demand what he liked.  It is very hard to deal with that by way of legislation, but I shall certainly think over the matter and I shall have something more definite to say at a later stage. I want to have the question investigated to see how far we can go, but it does appear to me, without going into the thing very minutely or without going into every individual unit, that we can safely say that the great majority of the employees will be taken over.  I shall leave it at that for the moment, but at a later stage I may be in a position to say something more.</P>
    <P>Deputy Murphy said it was unfair that we were providing for owners by compensating them, while we were doing nothing for employees.  It is very easy to see what you can do for the owners and to provide for that in the Bill, but it is much harder to state what you can do for the employees.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If you were to do it by compensation I agree that it might not be, but I want to see if we can do it by giving them re-employment.  No compensation&mdash;that is, no reasonable compensation&mdash;is going to be satisfactory. I have seen a circular which has been sent out which, I think, is unreasonable in that it is asking too much, because after all if a man has worked for 25 years for a creamery anywhere else, that does not entitle him to assume that he should not be obliged to look for work for the rest of his life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We cannot give a guarantee to suppliers either, because, naturally, if we are going to reorganise, some suppliers will be inconvenienced.  They will have to go further with their milk.  We are, therefore, not as kind to the suppliers as we are to the owners.  We are compensating the owners but we cannot <Col N="1536" /> compensate the supplier who has to go further with his milk.  He has to put up with it.  Apart from the question of the employees, the only Deputy who thought that the Bill did not go far enough was Deputy Ted O'Sullivan. He thought that we should take power to compel the co-operatives to develop their territories by erecting auxiliaries in neglected districts.  That, again, would be a terribly difficult thing to put into the Bill.  At any rate, it can be more appropriately dealt with on the Co-operative Bill which will have to come along later.  To complete all this scheme, we shall have to regularise the Dairy Disposals Board and to bring in a Bill to regularise the co-operative creameries.  The matter raised by the Deputy can be dealt with more satisfactorily on that Bill. Possibly something can be done to give the co-operatives some inducement at any rate to develop those areas. Deputy Keyes referred to certain creameries, and said they had an advantage over all others in supplying milk to the city.  I do not know why he should say &ldquo;under the Government scheme&rdquo;, because the point there is that the creameries that are registered under the Milk and Dairies Act can supply milk to Dublin, while unregistered creameries cannot.  I am quite sure that when that Act was going through the Dáil no member on the Labour Benches would have advocated that there should have been any exception given in that way to other creameries; in other words, that any creameries that were going to supply milk to a city or town should be made to turn out clean milk for human consumption.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelJKeyes" hpid="Mr. Keyes Mr. Keyes">

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Unless the Minister has anything to say on the subject of the married pension which was discussed here on the Second Stage, I am opposed to the passing of this Resolution. If a man were in receipt of unemployment assistance and had a wife and five children, he would receive, in addition to his basic allowance, a payment of 12/6 per week and also food allowances averaging 14/- per week.  He would receive 12/6 in cash and 14/- in bread, milk and butter&mdash;a total of 26/6, in addition to his basic unemployment assistance allowance. We are here making provision for men who are injured in the service of the State as soldiers serving to defend all that we have here, and this Bill provides that if an officer is injured and suffers 100 per cent. disablement, that is, if he is completely unable in a permament way to provide for his own subsistence and that of his family, he gets a basic payment for himself, if <Col N="1539" /> he is single man, and he gets £30 a year, if he is a married man, to keep his wife and any family he may have. If he is a private or non-commissioned officer, he gets 10/- a week, in addition to his basic rate, as a married pension to keep his wife and family.</P>
      <P>A Bill which approaches the debt which this country will owe to men who give their ability to earn their own living to the extent of 100 per cent.  and who find themselves in a condition of 100 per cent. disablement from the angle of telling these men: &ldquo;We will give you a basic amount for yourself, and, if you have a family, we will give you 10/- a week,&rdquo; is an insult to all we have been working for in the past.  It is utterly out of keeping with the way in which the ordinary people look on the Army and on the services which they realise the Army are prepared to render to them; it is utterly out of keeping with the whole outlook of our people on social conditions for the future; and it is entirely out of step with what other people, caught up in much more difficult circumstances throughout the world to-day, are thinking. I want to put that simple position at this stage.</P>
      <P>The Government have repeatedly indicated with regard to people in receipt of unemployment assistance that they give them a certain amount which is not intended to keep them entirely in comfort, and yet a man on unemployment assistance would get 26/6 per week to keep a wife and five children, while we offer 10/- a week to a 100 per cent. disabled Army soldier or sergeant. Apart altogether from decently providing for the wife and children of a man who gives all his physical and perhaps his mental capacity in the service of the country, there is the question of justice in the mind of the man who is reduced to these conditions simply because he serves his country. How can we think that we are in any reasonable or adequate way providing for the case of an unfortunate man of that type, when, on top of the physical incapacity and the suffering arising from it, we put the mental torment of seeing his wife and family so inadequately provided for?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1540" /> I do not think any section of the House will agree that the Bill adequately provides for them, and I again ask the Minister if that is not such a blot on the Bill that the Bill is not worth passing, for I am perfectly satisfied that there is no claim implied in any section of it that cannot and could not wait until this Parliament gets clear in its mind as to what is the necessary adequate provision which should be made for the wife and children of a man who suffers disablement as a result of service in the Army in defence of the country in present circumstances.  Unless the Minister can indicate that he proposes radically to change that position, I am definitely opposed to the passing of the Resolution, and to the voting of any money for any of the purposes in the Bill, because from the point of view of the Army man and the point of view of our outlook on social matters generally, this is the overriding consideration.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>It is very refreshing, to me at any rate, to hear Deputy Mulcahy talking in the tone in which he has been talking here to-day, because he did not talk in that tone when he was a member of a Government himself, and when the people, about whom he is talking so reverently to-day, were receiving only half the amount that I am proposing to give them.  It makes me feel that the Deputy might be concerned with something more than the interests of the people about whom he is talking, and that it might be possible that the prospect of an election in the near future might have something to do with what he has been saying now. However, I want to point out to the Deputy that when he was a member of the former Government the rates were exactly half the rates that I am now proposing to give to these people.  At that time the rate for a married person was 5/-, which I am now increasing to 10/-.  The rate for an officer, at that time, was £20, which I am now increasing to £30, and the rate for private soldiers, who were injured or incapacitated as the result of disease or injury has been increased from 26/- to 42/-.  As far as I am concerned, I <Col N="1541" /> am not prepared, at this stage, to go any further than I have gone.  I think that this Bill is a generous gesture. It may be that, at some later stage, some other Government&mdash;possibly Deputy Mulcahy's National Government, which, presumably, is to include all the best brains in the House&mdash;may be able to do something more.  If that should happen, then I hope that Deputy Mulcahy will honour the statements that he is making now, but so far as I am concerned, this is the best that I can do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no answer to give the Minister with regard to my past or my present, other than the one I gave on the Second Reading, and I am quite prepared to have the Minister say that I am a hypocrite and a humbug.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not said that.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>No, the Minister has not said that, but I am quite prepared to hear him say it.  The real point is that I consider it to be my duty to stand up here and ask whether the members of this House&mdash;even the members of the Fianna Fáil Party who say &ldquo;hear, hear&rdquo; to the Minister's remarks&mdash;will stand up in an Irish Parliament and defend the addition of 10/- a week to the basic pension that is payable to a single man without making any distinction in the case of a married man with a family.  You give a basic rate for a single man, but in the case of a married man you are proposing, under this Bill, to give an additional 10/- a week to enable him to keep his wife and family.  I think that Parliament has a duty to say what is the standard that it considers the wife and children of a person who has given his complete physical capacity in the service of this country should be, and I would ask whether there are any members in this House who have any opinions on that matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>The point at issue, Sir, is that it is considered sufficient to give a married man 10/- a week&mdash;a man who has suffered 100 per cent. disability in the service of his country&mdash;to enable him to maintain his <Col N="1542" /> wife and children, whereas the man who did nothing at all for his country &mdash;the person in receipt of unemployment assistance, for instance&mdash;has an allowance of 26/6.  All you have to do is to ask yourself whether that is equitable or not, and do not mind what some other Government did.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Deputy aware that the combined figure will be 52/-?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, I will grant you the 15/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I said that the combined figure amounts to 52/-.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well; I shall take the Minister's figure, but are you satisfied to give only that amount to the man who served his country, while giving 26/6 to the fellow who did nothing except scratch himself on a wall for the last two or three years and who did not go into the Army to serve his country?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Deputy know whether or not that man was fit for service?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>All right, but let us take the case of the fellow who was fit for service.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps, such a man might have offered his services, but might have been found to be unfit, and the Deputy is not aware whether he did or not.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Accordingly, then, that is the policy: the man who offered his services to the country will not get this, whereas others, who did nothing for their country, can draw this amount of money.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to know, Sir, whether this House calls itself an Irish Parliament, and whether it has appealed to the young men of this country to join our Defence Forces in order to defend this country against the serious military dangers which, from time to time, the Government tell us are in front of us.  Did they tell these young men that if, in the service of the country, they lost their <Col N="1543" /> physical capacity, their wives and families would be looked after, and that there would be an addition, to the basic provision of 10/- a week, to enable such a man to keep his wife and family?  For goodness sake, cannot we approach these matters in a serious way?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to.  That is what I am anxious about, but I do not think we are doing it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with that, particularly when we have had no case made from the Government side as to what they have based this figure of 10/- on, or £30 for an officer.  Even if the Minister does refer to the past, I think it should be borne in mind that he is now putting the married pensioner in the same position as a married pensioner stood under the 1923 Bill.  In that connection, it must also be remembered that the cost-of-living figure for all items, in October, 1923, was 186, whereas, in November, 1942, the figure was 273&mdash;an increase of almost 50 per cent., and an increase of one-third in the matter of food alone.  These, however, are matters which refer to the past, but I think that when we have a Bill such as this before us&mdash;a Bill which purports to indicate a standard of adequacy for the maintenance of the families of men in the Defence Forces who lose their capacity to earn their own living&mdash;it is a matter that we ought to discuss in this House, and discuss it in relation to the conditions that exist to-day and that may exist to-morrow.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely, the Minister must admit that if he is only allowing 10/- for a married man with, perhaps, four or five children, he cannot be having any regard at all for the family. I agree with Deputy Mulcahy that, undoubtedly, it is time for us to decide as to what regard we have for the family.  If those people go out and risk their lives in the service of their country, and come back 100 per cent. incapacitated, I think it is scandalous that this House should offer them 10/- a week in addition to what they have <Col N="1544" /> got.  I think the Minister should reconsider the matter and see what can be done.  I think the time has arrived when we must state how much we think the family should have to maintain it in decent comfort.  If we do not consider the family, then we cannot talk about considering anything else in this country.  I think the Minister should reconsider this matter and see what further provision can be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to know whether the Deputies to whom we have been listening will, as usual, when the Budget is introduced, go into the Lobby and vote against it as an intolerable burden?  Will they, as usual, when every item is discussed, go into the Lobby and vote against it, saying that there is not enough money to meet it?  That is the inconsistency to which I object.  I was rather amazed to see members of the Labour Party going into the Lobby to vote against income-tax, which would be used to meet the cost of social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If this is the attitude of the Government and of the Government Party, then I will vote against spending £8,000,000 on the Army, because there is nothing worth defending in a country that can only offer this sum to the unfortunate wives and children of soldiers who were completely disabled in the service of their country.  It is nonsense and sheer futility to be spending £8,000,000 on the Army in those circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>I have as much sympathy with those men as the Deputy, but the L.D.F. and the L.S.F. are running the same risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Fianna Fáil Party support the Minister on this particular policy?  Am I to take it that my colleague from Athlone-Longford agrees that that is an adequate amount to pay?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the attitude towards the Budget that annoys me.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Never mind the Budget.  Is that amount enough?  Is that the value which the Government puts on those services, and will the <Col N="1545" /> Deputy support the Government on that matter?  Does the Deputy or the Government expect the youth of the country to risk their lives in its defence if this is all they are to get in the event of complete disablement?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesVictory" hpid="Mr. Victory Mr. Victory">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Victory</NameTxt>
      <P>We have gone much further than any Government in that regard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DonnchadhOBriain" hpid="Donnchadh O Briain Donnchadh O Briain">
      <NameTxt>Donnchadh O Briain</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest in regard to this matter that you cannot put a financial value on a limb lost or on health lost owing to services given to the nation.  But I do congratulate the Minister on having improved very considerably on the provisions which were in operation in cases of that kind up to the present.  We might all agree that he should do better, if it were possible but I assume that he has consulted with the Government and that they consider they have gone as far as they can go in dealing with cases of this kind.  It is very satisfactory that he has improved considerably on the rates that were previously available for men who gave their services in safeguarding the freedom which the country has won.  The Minister is to be congratulated on that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I quite agree that it would be difficult to fix the value of a limb, but we are not asking the House to do that.  We are asking the House to consider what it takes to keep a wife and what it takes to maintain a child.  We are asking the House whether they are prepared to make adequate provision for the maintenance of the wives and children of men who, in the military service of this country, completely lost their ability to maintain themselves or their families.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree with Deputy O Briain that the Minister may have gone as far as he thought fit in regard to this matter, but that does not justify his attitude or the attitude of the Government.  If a man who is 100 per cent. disabled has a wife and child, or two children, is this the value which the Government puts on that mother and children?  We want to hear from the Minister a declaration as to what he thinks about the family.  I am not <Col N="1546" /> concerned about how those people were treated in the past; if they were treated badly in the past, that does not justify the present attitude.  We want to hear what is the value to the nation of a mother and family, and God knows we have had a very poor appreciation of them so far in other spheres of life in this country.  If a man who has a wife and three or four children is completely disabled owing to his services to the country, is it right that we &mdash;who cannot exist on less than £480 a year&mdash;should say that his wife and children can get only 10/- a week from the community?  I, for one, will stand four-square against that proposal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to remind the House of Article 41 of the Constitution, which says:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;The State recognises the Family as the natural primary and fundamental unit group of Society, and as a moral institution possessing inalienable and imprescriptible rights, antecedent and superior to all positive law.  The State, therefore, guarantees to protect the Family in its constitution and authority, as the necessary basis of social order and as indispensable to the welfare of the Nation and the State.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>If the head of the house, by reason of his services to the State, is unable to protect the family and is unable to maintain it, is it not the responsibility of this House to maintain it and to make the necessary provision for it, particularly when the Constitution goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In particular, the State recognises that by her life within the home, woman gives to the State a support without which the common good cannot be achieved.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are dealing with a case in which the man is utterly unable to make any provision for the house by reason of the fact that he is incapacitated, and probably requires greater attention from his wife than if he had his full strength and health.  He is not able to look after his home, and the woman has, by her life within the home, to give to the State that support without which the common good cannot be <Col N="1547" /> achieved.  The Constitution goes on to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The State shall, therefore, endeavour to ensure that mothers shall not be obliged by economic necessity to engage in labour to the neglect of their duties in the home.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>This Bill provides for a man a basic rate, whether he is single or married. The woman, whose position in the State is shown in this Constitution, has to look after the home and a disabled husband, and the family has to be maintained and protected.  When the head of the house is incapable of doing that, it is the duty of the State to see that that protection and maintenance are given.  A sum of 10/- a week will not do it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider this matter. From the remarks which have been made, it would appear that arguments will be based on the manner in which those people were treated by a previous Government.  Surely that is not the basis to go on now?  If we are to have any regard at all for the Constitution, this is the time for the Minister and the Government to take their courage in their hands and declare what the family, the mothers and children, are worth to this country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not wait until now to make an effort to improve the conditions of the Army.  I started when this emergency began.  I had not to be goaded either by Deputy Mulcahy or Deputy Hickey, or by any Deputy of my own Party, to do the things which I have done in this Bill.  I started out right away when the emergency began, and when I saw what the position was, to make an effort to improve conditions. I hold that I have made that effort and made it fairly successfully&mdash; not to the degree that I would like to have made it, but still fairly successfully. Now, advances in life, in business, or even in the Army, cannot be made by jumping over a wide gap, and the Deputies who have spoken know that as well as I know it.  I have made this advance and, as I said a few minutes ago, it can be improved <Col N="1548" /> upon and it may be improved upon. When that time comes I will be just as prepared as Deputy Mulcahy to support that improvement.  The improvement that I am putting forward now could not be secured by the Deputy when he occupied a Ministerial position at the time his Party was in office.</P>
      <P>I am not prepared to take this Bill back and re-discuss it with my colleagues.  I have discussed it with them for quite a considerable time.  It is very easy at a time like this for Deputy Mulcahy to talk about the standard of living.  I hold that I am improving the standard that exists and I am improving it far in advance of the standard that existed during the period of office of a former Government. While I am not holding that it could not be advanced still further, I am emphasising that I have done all that could possibly be done at the present time.  So far as discussions with my colleagues are concerned, knowing what the conditions are, I am not prepared to take this Bill back to them for further consideration.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is the attitude of the Minister, then in my opinion this Bill should not be approved by the House.  How are we going to treat the families of men who are prepared to give their all in the defence of the lives and liberties of the people of this country?  If this is all that can be paid to the dependents of men who have devoted themselves to the service of the country, then, unless it reviews the whole situation, I say that the country that would treat them in such a fashion is not worth defending.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Next door to us a country is engaged in an appalling and costly war.  So far as I can see, the soldier in the British Army&mdash;take an Irishman, one of the very many who have joined the British Army&mdash;who gets totally disabled in military service will get, in addition to his basic rate, 9/2 a week for his wife, 7/1 for the first child and 5/5 for each subsequent child.  An Irishman in the British Army who loses his capacity to provide for his <Col N="1549" /> family would, in addition to his basic rate, get at least 37/11 a week.  The British are bearing the cost of a huge war and they have to bear the cost of a very large number of casualties.  We have escaped the major destructive cost of war.  Our casualties are not likely, no matter what the circumstances may be, to bear comparison with the casualties Britain will have to face, yet we are offering 10/- a week as against 37/11, or 26/6 if he were simply a man depending on unemployment assistance here.</P>
    <P>A lot has been said about some aspects of the past, and I should like to recall certain things.  When the Dáil was first being set up, on the 21st January, 1919, it was declared: &ldquo;In return for willing service, we, in the name of the Republic, declare the right of every citizen to an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour.&rdquo;&ldquo;In return for willing service&rdquo;&mdash;here we are dealing with willing service given to the extent of surrendering 100 per cent. of a man's capacity and all we offer his wife and family, as &ldquo;an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour&rdquo;, is 10/- a week.  &ldquo;It shall be the first duty of the Government to make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of the children, to secure that no child shall suffer hunger or cold from lack of food, clothing or shelter, but that all shall be provided with the means and facilities requisite for their proper education and training as citizens of a free and Gaelic Ireland.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>A man with a wife and family could not possibly make provision for the physical, mental and spiritual well-being of his dependents on 10/- a week; he would be compelled to go to the poor law authorities for additional assistance.  That is the kind of Ireland we have now.  So far as we can understand from the Minister, the position now is that an Irish Parliament, with a Fianna Fáil majority, is saying that that is the kind of Ireland we have and that is the type of provision that will be made for those who are giving all they possess to the service of the nation.</P>

      <P>In reply to the Minister, I should like to say that before ever there was talk of war I took my stand on what the children of the nation and their mothers are naturally entitled to.  I am not concerned with any criticism of the Minister.  I am concerned solely with getting an opportunity to declare, within the terms of our Constitution, what the family unit is and how it should be treated. If, we have a proper conception of a Christian order in this country we should realise that 10/- is insufficient to enable a married man to keep a wife and children in reasonable comfort. That is not in keeping with our Christian ideals.  I say we are ignoring the family unit if we treat the people in the way here proposed.  I am not concerned with what has happened since the war started.  I proclaimed my views in relation to the family unit and a proper standard of <Col N="1551" /> life long before the war was thought of.</P>

      <P>It would be well worth while if the Minister would say everything that he has in his mind, because while there may be hypocrites in the House, and while things might have been done in the past that were not done, the important point is that if the majority here are of the same mind as the Minister we are going to decide that all that the wife and family of a completely disabled soldier can get is 10/- of a pension.  It is important that we should fix our minds on that, no matter what purpose we have in our minds in discussing it or the temper in which we discuss things here.  While the Minister and I may squabble for a particular reason over it, we should remember that the people have sent us here to carry on their business. This House is standing over the liberties of freedom of the people, it has called the Army together, and is paying the Army.  It thinks it worth while to pay the Army to defend something here.  This House has the responsibility and duty, even though there may be hypocrites and squabblers in it, to fix an adequate standard of provision&mdash;I will not say compensation&mdash;for the wives and children of soldiers who, because of service in the Army, may be reduced to the condition in which they cannot provide for their wives and children.</P>

      <P>Governments have a difficulty in raising money to meet all these charges.  When the Budget is introduced to make provision for these charges, it is fiercely opposed by large numbers of Deputies.  As the Minister has pointed out, when it comes to the point of making those payments, the general attitude of those same Deputies is that the payments are entirely insufficient. That kind of attitude on the part of Deputies causes confusion amongst the community.  The Minister has to decide what exactly we can afford to pay.  In proportion to what industrial and agricultural workers get, I think that the offer that is being made here is reasonable.  I think there is a good deal of insincerity in this attack.  I would not like to say that it is due entirely to the fact that a general election is due to come off.  At any rate, there is a good deal of insincerity in this, with the result that the community is being somewhat misled as to what this country can afford.  The charges generally made against Fianna Fáil&mdash;in fact the charge against us&mdash;is that we are a most extravagant body of people, that we throw money about, <Col N="1554" /> and crush those from whom we have to collect taxation.  The money is collected from everybody.  People have to pay taxes either directly or indirectly. I do not know that we have ever collected or made extravagant demands on the people.  We have collected what we thought it possible to get in order to try to keep the people in employment.</P>
      <P>I think that the attitude of those who are opposing this Money Resolution will not appeal to the community. Whenever proposals are brought forward to raise taxation, Deputy Mulcahy always joins in the well-trained chorus which proclaims to the country that Fianna Fáil are robbing the taxpayers and robbing the whole community, that they are extravagant and are throwing money around.  We are trying to do now what he and his Party failed to do during the prosperous times that we are so often told about.  When the country was flowing with milk and honey, what, in the name of God, did they do?  There was not even a labourer's cottage built, or anything of that kind.  They now have the impertinence to turn and make this attack.</P>

I think there is no such comparison possible.  If this were examined by an expert, I am sure he would be quite satisfied that it was extraordinary that Fianna Fáil did collect all the money and managed to pay out so much.  Consequently, I think such an attack as this is unreasonable.</P>

      <P>May I point out to the Minister that when a young man leaves this country and joins the British Army, there is a feeling of resentment against him.  We must <Col N="1555" /> remember that, if he does that and becomes disabled, and has a wife and family, his allowance for himself and his wife and, say, five children is 37/11. In this case it is 10/-, when a lad joins the Irish Army at home.  The case I am making is that that difference is too great.  No matter what the British army did 20 or 30 years ago, it is the situation that arises to-day that counts, and it is immaterial what Cumann na nGaedheal did.  We all know&mdash;or at least I know&mdash;that they did little, so far as that was concerned.  That is no reason why, if they were in office to-day, they should continue to be wrong.  Apparently, Deputy O Briain thinks that, because Fianna Fáil has done something better, they should be congratulated.</P>

      <P>The big question is that this Dáil, if it passes this Bill, considers that that allowance for the wife and family is ample, and that we are passing it here at this stage requires very careful consideration.  It will take more than an election stunt to defend it in the country.  I do not care if every single member of the Army voted for the Party.  It would not make any difference, as there are not 100,000 in it and they are not all married.  I do not see how the Minister or anybody else can say that it is an election stunt.  That is just one too much.  It is equivalent to the insolent cheek of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, when he thinks he will get away with everything.  It will win in the House, but it will not win down the country and will not meet the justice of the case.</P>

I hope he was here in the House when I said that I would vote against spending £8,000,000 on an Army if this is all we have to defend and if this is the standard of outlook on our responsibility to the wives and children of disabled soldiers &mdash;that they will get a married allowance of only 10/- per week for the wife and family.  The Minister has tried to make the plea that the basic allowance is going to be 42/-.  I would like anybody here to tell us, given a man who has lost all his capacity to serve himself or to earn his living, and who has to provide for his keep and his attendance and food, how much he will have left out of 42/- a week to spread around his wife and family.  Then Deputy O'Reilly suggests that it is impertinence on our part to come here and criticise the granting of 10/- as a married allowance to keep a wife and family.  Well, at any rate, I have courage enough to stand up here in an Irish Parliament to say that it is a shameful proposition.

      <P>To judge from the attitude of the Government in this regard, one would imagine that they were being asked to lay out some fantastic sum.  Certainly, the point where I find myself in entire agreement with Deputy Mulcahy is that, where a man is suffering from total disability and has a large family dependent upon him, he is going to be given 10/ a week and told to keep them on that.  The number of totally disabled soldiers who will have large families is comparatively small.  It is not as if we were asking here that the rates of pay for the Irish Army should be raised substantially, it is not as if we were making a proposal which would cost £2,000,000 or £3,000,000.  All that the Minister is being asked to do is to face this dilemma&mdash;suppose you have a totally disabled soldier who has two children and you give him 10/&mdash;&mdash;</P>

Surely, every Deputy in this House agrees that the number of cases which will arise of disabled men with large families will be trivial? How can we maintain that we stand for certain fundamental principles in this country and at the same time renege them when they come before us?  There is no use in paying lip service to the Christian theory that a man has a fundamental right to marry and rear a family if, the moment the occasion presents itself to give practical effect to that theory, we all say that it would cost too much.  After all, that is the very thing for which hundreds of modern thinkers have condemned the Victorians&mdash;that they were hypocritical, that they gave up a theory.  They were prepared to say that they acknowledged the right of rich and poor alike to marry and rear families, but they stopped there and made no attempt at all to render it possible for the poor to raise families. Will Deputy O'Reilly or any Deputy say that he considers 10/- a fair grant to a man with a wife and one child?</P>

      <P>Such a man has already made great sacrifices and is serving as a soldier, at the lowest rate of pay of a common labourer in this country, out of patriotism.  That is what we are paying the soldiers of this State, and that is probably as much as we can afford to pay them.  It is notorious, not only in this country but in every country, that a soldier's pay is out of all proportion to the pay of a man who stays at home.  Yet you do find a very large body of men who will join a voluntary army such as we have and who are prepared to make a very substantial sacrifice.  These are the persons we are dealing with.  We are dealing with people who are in no sense beholden to us, but to whom we are greatly beholden.  We say to them: &ldquo;If you become entirely incapacitated, we will give you 42/- per week.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What Deputy will take 42/- per week to surrender his entire physical capacity and become an invalid all his life, never able to do a hand's turn again? Is it a princely dole?  Is there any man at this moment who will consent to be permanently disabled in exchange for a life pension of 42/- per week?  I do not think so.  In giving such a man 42/- per week we are not doing something generous.  We are not holding out a temptation to him to go and get himself disabled.  We are not offering something that any one of us would be prepared to accept.  We are offering something far less but, possibly, as much as our country can afford at the moment.  If there were a large number of men permanently disabled after this war period is over and the State was fairly prosperous, I think that, post-war, most people in the House would be anxious to give to those permanently disabled men something better than 42/- per week.  I am not criticising the Minister for being unable to find more at present for the disabled men, because I know he is sympathetic and anxious to interest himself in the welfare of the men in the Army.  I know that he has his own difficulties.  I know that he often has to fight the corner of the men in the Army and be confronted with other Departments of State that take a different view and that want to economise. He has to carry the Executive <Col N="1559" /> Council with him.  Sometimes he is not able to get from the Government consent for as generous a proposal as he would like to bring before the House. Therefore, for the present in any case, let us take 42/- as reasonable and equitable for a totally disabled man, but nothing generous and nothing extravagant. In all the circumstances, however, it is perhaps for the time being just.  But then we come to that man and say to him: &ldquo;If you have a wife and child&mdash;10/-.&rdquo;  Probably for a wife and one child that would be reasonable, but no more than that. How, in justice, can we conceivably go to a man who has a wife and five children and say to him: &ldquo;You also must be content with 10/-; you must spread the provision for a wife and one child over a wife and five or six children&rdquo;?  The thing cannot be done. We do not say that to people in receipt of unemployment assistance, we do not say it to people in receipt of outdoor relief, we do not say it to people in receipt of unemployment insurance, we do not say it to any class of persons in receipt of an allowance which we all recognise is the limit they can expect to receive inasmuch as they are unable to work themselves for the purpose of adding to it.</P>
    <P>There is no proposal here to make it necessary to impose vast taxation on the people.  All that the Government are asked to do is to invite Dáil Eireann to give practical effect to a principle which has been enunciated in the Constitution&mdash;their Constitution.</P>

      <P>The issue was raised that the Constitution guarantees to every citizen the right to raise a Christian <Col N="1560" /> family.  Let no citizen plead that clap-trap in defence of his fundamental rights.  I quite agree that this Bill is a monument and a warning to the people against the clap-trap of that instrument.  Where is it implemented here?  Ten shillings a week for a wife and one child; 10/- a week for a wife and six children.</P>

      <P>Every time the Deputy interrupts he gets something he does not expect.  Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Victory invoked the Constitution. All that we are asking is that the pious clap-trap in the Constitution will be given effect to, and, if it is given effect to, then there was virtue in the Constitution that I did not know of. But if the thesis is maintained here that the same allowance is adequate for a man and a wife and one child and for a man, a wife and six children, clap-trap it was.</P>
      <P>The sum involved is small, and I invite the Minister, instead of making this a great issue of principle, to come part of the way to meet it.  There is no one in the House who does not sympathise with his difficulties. Possibly, if we knew his mind, a great deal of what we are saying commands his sympathy.  Might I recommend to the Minister for Defence the prudent and democratic attitude of the Minister for Justice?  There were occasions when the Minister for Justice felt that certain courses were desirable, but also possibly felt that he was unable to persuade all his colleagues in the Cabinet to take the same view, and he allowed the strong feeling of Dáil Eireann to support him in order to achieve what he believed to be the ideal.</P>

      <P>I understand the Minister's difficulty&mdash;that the Minister may sometimes find himself threatened with financial chaos if he persists in claiming more generous treatment for those for whom he is earnestly solicitous. I suggest that, instead of sticking <Col N="1561" /> his heels in the ground, he should give some evidence that he is sympathetic to the point of view put forward by Deputy Mulcahy and various other Deputies, and, possibly, between this and the conclusion of the Committee Stage of the Bill, point out to the Minister for Finance that the whole House expects something a little better than has been adumbrated here.  I have no doubt that, if the Minister gives a sign in that direction, the stony heart of Deputy O Briain and the flinty interior of Deputy Victory and Deputy O'Reilly will begin to soften a little, and he may find that they will go with him to the Minister for Finance and say: &ldquo;We cannot stand over this proposal; it is not just; we are good Party men, and we want to vote with the Minister, but he must give us something we can vote for.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The principle here involved is: is it equity to grant a man 10/-, if he is totally disabled and has a wife and one child, and also to grant 10/- to a totally disabled man who has a wife and six children?  If there are 2,000 such cases when the whole bill is totted up, I shall be surprised.  If there were 10,000 such cases, I still say we should stand on the principle and do what is right.  I urge the Minister to give way to what I feel fairly sure is his own inclination and to make renewed representations to the Minister for Finance that the money must be made available; to recognise the different liability of the man with one child and the man with six.  If he does make these representations now, inasmuch as the Taoiseach intends to speak at no far distant date on the principle of family allowances, I think he will find that that shrewd old campaigner will not wish to appear before this House in an inconsistent position, refusing to the soldier, who has given his all, that which he intends to provide for everybody else in the State. I am only asking for the soldier the same as I ask for every citizen in the State and that is, the recognition of the special burden he has to bear if he is a responsible parent of a large family.  Do not let it be said in this day of the year that Dáil Eireann has laid down that it is not interested in the family commitments of the servants <Col N="1562" /> of the State.  Rather let us go on record as saying that in so far as finance will permit we will give effect to the principle that a man, whether he be rich or poor, shall be entitled and enabled, in the community to which we belong, not only to marry but to provide for the children with whom God has blest his marriage.</P>

First and foremost, we are asking for some recognition that it is inadequate.  Then, if we cannot get that, we are asking for some explanation, in view of the fact that a man on unemployment assistance will get his basic amount plus 26/6, and an Irishman serving in the British Army will get his basic pay plus 37/11.  We are putting that 37/11 against the 10/- which this Bill provides.</P>

      <P>If it is a question of economy, the Minister is beginning in the wrong place.  People who have become disabled in the service of the country should be treated more generously than it is proposed to treat these people under this Bill.  A soldier and his wife and family should not be allowed to starve because he has been wounded or is suffering from any disability.  I have one case in mind concerning which I have been in communication with the Minister.  It is a case of a man who is not allowed anything at all.  I refer to the case of <Col N="1564" /> Acting Corporal John J. McMahon, 59463.  He was committed to Monaghan Mental Hospital by the doctor at the Curragh, on the 17th August.  He was discharged within a month by the Medical Superintendent of Monaghan Mental Hospital, and I believe a solicitor in Belturbet has a certificate from that gentleman stating that he found no mental disorder.  He offered to take up his position in the Army again, as he was returned as fit by the Medical Superintendent of Monaghan Mental Hospital, but the Army authorities refused to take him back.  They may have some reason and I do not want to question their right to refuse to take him back, but I do think that the Minister or somebody responsible should consider the question of granting this man a pension, be it small or large.</P>

I believe a clergyman interviewed the Minister on his behalf and got a rather strange reply.  If my information is correct, the Minister said the best thing for this man to do was to go to law.  Why should he have to go to law for his right if he was discharged from the Army?  Whether he is still suffering from disability, mental or otherwise, or not, whether he is perfectly recovered and fit and has been refused to be taken back, or not, would he not be entitled to be dealt with in a more generous and fairer manner than this?  I would like the Minister to give us some information on that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very much surprised at the attitude of the Fianna Fáil members here this evening.  As has been pointed out by several Deputies &mdash;Deputy Mulcahy, Deputy MacEoin and Deputy Dillon&mdash;we have very high taxation and all we are asking the Government to do now is to give consideration to men who have made sacrifices for the country.  This country is allowed to live by the sacrifices made by those who are totally disabled.  If those sacrifices were not made, it is possible that this House would not be allowed to live. Therefore, we should consider these men.  It might be said that the former Government had not done it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it did not do it, it was because it had a lot of other important work to do as well, but even with the big amount of work which had to be carried out in order to save the country, the taxation at that time was only just half what it is at the present day. All that is asked of this House is to give fair consideration to the people affected by this Bill.  As Deputy Dillon has pointed out, you will not have a big number of men totally disabled in an Army such as we have at present, but men who have made a sacrifice in order to serve the country should certainly get better consideration than they are getting under this Bill.  We appeal to the Government to increase these allowances, and I think there will not be a single Deputy of <Col N="1566" /> the 130 odd that we have in the House who will oppose that proposal.  As Deputy Dillon has stated, the Minister should make a stand before the Executive Council, and see that these cases will be met in a fair way.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to put this one point to the Minister.  I cannot see for the life of me how he can defend a proposal under which a uniform allowance is given to a married man with only a wife, a married man with a wife and a child, and a married man with a wife and ten children.  It does not matter what number of children there is in the family.  There is an important moral question involved in that arrangement, and I think that the Minister would be well advised to reconsider the matter.  The threat to hold up the Bill for an indefinite period is a serious threat, but it would be much better to have a just Bill than a bad Bill.  I am certainly anxious to see the Bill passed, and I should not like to do anything that would hold it up, because I know that there are a number of serious cases in a bad way owing to the delay in introducing the Bill. In this question, however, as I say, there is a big principle involved.  In passing, I should like to remind the Minister and the Government that it was a question that was raised by me not to-day, nor even ten years ago, but prior to that.  The proposal to fix the same allowance for a man who has a wife, a man who has a wife and one child, and a man who has a wife and ten children, is in my opinion indefensible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In the British Army and in every other Army there is a graded scale under which so much is allowed for each child.  The number in the family is immaterial, the graded scale applies in every case.  It has been very properly pointed out that the amount involved cannot be very much but you will be giving effect to a very important principle and you will be maintaining the moral code in a very positive way.  If the principle which it is proposed to operate under this Bill were to be adopted in respect of other Departments, I think you would reach a stage when the principles of Marie <Col N="1567" /> Stopes would be adopted all over the country.  That cannot be tolerated at all.</P>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I cannot allow Deputy MacEoin to get away with the suggestion that I am defending the allowance of 10/- as adequate.  Goodness knows, I know the value of 10/- as much as any Deputy in the House, but what I want to point out to Deputy MacEoin is that this proposal doubles the amount which I found existing when I took over this administration.  I thought I was doing a fair job by doubling the amount.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Everybody will give the Minister credit for that, but the Minister must admit that it is obviously inadequate to allow a person 10/- when he is married, and to take no cognisance of the degree of liability which may devolve upon him subsequently by reason of that marriage.  If a man is married and has to maintain only a wife, that is an entirely different financial proposition from having to maintain a wife and five children.  The relevant section of the Bill makes no provision for that elastic responsibility. It may not be very great in the case of a man who has merely a wife to maintain but it may be a very serious responsibility if he has five or six children plus a wife.  Would the Minister undertake between now and the time that this Bill reaches the Seanad to re-examine the matter with a view to having better provision made for the case of those who have large families to maintain and for whom an allowance of 10/- per week is totally inadequate? After all, our liability is just an emergency liability.  If we can come through this emergency with only the responsibility for the payment of such pensions as arise out of death and disability, the liability on posterity will not be very heavy.  Nobody will grudge pensions to those who happen to meet with wounds or other disability during the emergency.  Other countries will probably have to mortgage the earnings of the next three or four generations for the payment of heir share in the Armageddon which now in full swing about us.  Our <Col N="1568" /> liability in this matter may not be very great, and while admitting that the Minister has moved in the matter, I would ask him, between now and the time the Bill goes to the Seanad, to reconsider the relevant section with a view to increasing the allowance where the number of children in a family would justify such an increase over 10/-.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to say that there has been ample time to consider this Bill since the matter was discussed on Second Reading.  This is the House which appeals to the young men of the country to join the Defence Forces for the emergency and I am not going to agree to any section of this Bill passing through the House until a point that is so fundamental as the point we are discussing now is definitely recognised and, if it has to be reconsidered, the result of that reconsideration brought before this House by way of an amendment.  To say &ldquo;we will give you this measure but will you see to this point before it goes to the Seanad&rdquo; is not the way to treat a matter that is so important as this. This is a fundamental question.  We are deciding here what is an adequate provision for the wives and children of men who surrendered all their prospects for the defence of this country. I think it is a matter that should be looked fairly in the face by the House and a decision should be definitely taken on the merits after a full review of the circumstances.  We should not leave the matter to be dealt with in some back Government office or some Ministerial office to be considered on its way to the Seanad.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>I also join in the appeal to the Government to reconsider their decision in this matter.  I think that neither of the Governments <Col N="1569" /> we have had in the country has done justice to the Irish Army.  When we consider what the country owes to the Army we must admit that no money would compensate those men who fall by the wayside.  We find all over the country that the most neglected men are almost always ex-soldiers of our little Army of 15 or 20 years ago.  They seem to be nobody's children.  Having served their country, their country has no use for them.  No matter what Government is in power, justice should be done to ex-members of the Irish Army.  As Deputy Dillon pointed out, there is a gross injustice in allowing a disabled soldier with a wife and six children only the same amount as a disabled soldier with a wife and one child.  That is an injustice over which we should not stand.  I ask the Minister to have the matter reconsidered by the Government and to press this aspect of the case upon them.  All sides of the House should agree to do something decent for the Irish soldier. Is it any wonder that so many of our young soldiers should be deserting, crossing the Border and joining the British Army?  I am told that certain stores in Belfast are packed with Irish uniforms&mdash;the uniforms of Irish soldiers who joined the British Army, where they will get better treatment, although they will have to take greater risks.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It is regrettable to think that, when this emergency is over, the man who served in a foreign army and who was disabled will get a larger allowance than the man who served his own country and was disabled in so doing.  The Irish soldier who risked his life at home will get a niggardly pittance as compared with the man who served in a foreign army.  It is extraordinary that we can find money for so many <Col N="1570" /> nonsensical things and that, when it comes to compensating the Irish soldier, we must be content to throw him on the scrap heap.  I do not press this matter as a political opponent of the Government.  I do so because, as one of the soldiers of the Irish Army at the beginning.  I found that the private soldier had a grievance.  The higher officers had, perhaps, something less to complain of but the ordinary private soldier felt that he would be left derelict when the struggle was over.  When this emergency is over, if the private soldier be thrown on the scrap heap, nobody can blame him if, finding his wife and children hungry, he insists on rising up and making himself heard. Now is the time to do justice not only to these men but to the whole country. That will bring concord and harmony because these men will feel that they have been fairly treated.  They are ready to give their lives, if need be, and it is up to us to deal with them generously.  When we see so many men standing aside and refusing to give any service, we must consider what they will say when the emergency is over.  If the Irish soldiers are thrown on the scrap heap, these people will say: &ldquo;We were the wise fellows.&rdquo;  We should see that they will not be in a position to say that, and that they will be shown to have acted in an unnational way.</P>

      <P>I object to the House passing this section.  Sub-section (2) says that:&mdash;</P>
      <P>this Act shall be construed as one with the Acts recorded in sub-section (1). I do not think this measure should be joined to any group of Acts dealing with Army pensions on the one fundamental point which we discussed on the Money Resolution.  It is scarcely worth while mentioning anything else when there is that fundamental defect in the Bill and it is because of that fundamental defect that I do not think any section of this Bill should pass. The Minister has made certain references to the effect that this Bill is better than the 1927 Act.  I dealt with that matter on Second Reading.</P>

      <P>I oppose this section.  This section proposes to extend the terms of this Bill to&mdash;amongst others &mdash; the men who joined the Army during the emergency.  The Taoiseach and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, and a lot of other Ministers have gone through the country from time to time calling on the young men of the country to join the Army and help to defend this <Col N="1575" /> country's liberty and resources.  They have argued the case very strongly. They have talked about the duty and the national responsibility there is on the young men to defend the people of this country and their rights and liberties.  On the Second Reading of this Bill I pointed out the fundamental defects, and asked, in view of some of the remarks of the Minister, that the Taoiseach or the Minister for Finance should be here to discuss the point that was then raised, and that has since been discussed here.  I again say that it is fundamental to the whole matter we are discussing.  The matter was put very clearly and simply from various benches in the House during the discussion on the Financial Resolution. The Taoiseach and the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence and other Ministers have come into the House and voted for the principle&mdash;or the lack of principle&mdash;in this Bill, but we cannot get them here now to listen to what is to be said from the various benches on behalf of the wives and families of men whom they have called to the Army, and who may be completely disabled on Army service.  I think it is a very regrettable way to deal with a very important matter, a matter which is fundamental not only with regard to our attitude to the Army, but with regard to our whole outlook on society here, because, if the State cannot adequately sustain the wives and children of people who are completely disabled in its service, what other wives or what other children <Col N="1576" /> do we expect will be maintained in this State?</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Well, Sir, I suppose from the time it began until it ends we will still have Ministers going around the country making this appeal, and, if the section is intended to extend the time during which Ministers will make appeals to people to join the Army, then I think it is nearly time they realised that all they are offering to those men is that, when they are completely disabled and unable to provide either for themselves or for their wives, the State will give them 10/- in addition to their own basic allowance. Again, I object to this section being passed, because I think there is something fundamentally rotten at the core of the whole Bill.</P>

      <P>I do not think it is necessary for me to say very much on this section, because the provisions are quite clear.  Under the 1927 Act a disease to be pensionable had to be contracted before the 30th day of September, 1924.  Sub-section (1) (a) of Section 3 makes a disease due to service and contracted during the emergency period pensionable.  Sub-section (1) (b) applies to the married personnel and gives the conditions necessary for a married pension in addition to the disability pension. Sub-section (2) fixes the date from which the disability pension granted under a previous sub-section will be payable.  Sub-section (3) sets out the date by which application for a disability pension must be made.  Sub-section (4) makes it clear that under Section 10 (1) of the 1927 Act a disease to be pensionable had to be 80 per cent. on the date of examination by the Army Pensions Board, but Section 7 of the 1937 Act gave until the 31st July, 1938, in order to reach the required 80 per cent.  This sub-section repeals Section 7 of the 1937 Act.  Sub-section (5) increases the scale of pensions, including married pensions, for disablement due to wounds and disease contracted during the emergency period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I have already pointed out that in October, 1923, the cost-of-living index figure for all items was 186 and in November, 1942, it had reached 273; that is, it had gone up by nearly 50 per cent.  When we take food alone, in 1923 it was 190 and by November, 1942, it had gone up to 250, an increase of nearly one-third.  I commented the other night on the 1927 Act.  I have no further comment to make on it.  I have no comment to make on the 1923 Act, except this, that at a time when the cost of living for all items has gone up by nearly 50 per cent., and for food alone by one-third, the Minister has not only gone back to the 1923 Act, but is not even doing as well as it.  Under the 1923 Act, if an officer was 100 per cent. disabled he became entitled to a pension of £200 a year.  This section contemplates that an officer who is permanently disabled in the present emergency may only get £120 a year.  The Minister, in his explanation of the section, did not say why an officer, if he is 100 per cent. disabled, should get £80 a year less than he would have got under the 1923 Act.  Neither did he say if he had given any consideration at all to the difference in the cost of living as between 1923 and 1942.  As regards the amount set down as the marriage <Col N="1579" /> allowance to be paid in respect of the wife and family, in addition to the officer's basic allowance, the Minister has made no attempt to explain what inquiries he made to satisfy himself that he was doing justice to an officer and his family by providing only £30 for a married pension, or in the case of a man 100 per cent. disabled, he was showing any sense of justice for the man's wife and family by simply adding 10/- to the 42/- for the married pension. The Minister is creating a situation whereby he cannot assure himself that such a man will not have to go on poor relief if his family are to be kept in health and in clothing, and if the children's education is to be looked after.  To the disability that such a man is labouring under, you are adding the shocking torment of mind that he is at home unable to work, spending all his day looking at his wife and family inadequately provided for.  If there is any class in the State, facing the new world of tomorrow or the difficult world of to-day, that we should see is properly looked after, it is the class composed of the families of men who have given all their faculties in the service of the State and have become disabled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have seen the terrible disaster of war come on other countries of the world.  Responsible people in those countries, in looking back over the past years, have come to the conclusion that it was their neglect of the unemployment problem, and the conditions arising from it, that brought about the present war.  They have determined that, when peace comes, they will be energetic and careful to use all their resources and power of organisation to see that unemployment will not be a menace to their family life, and, therefore, a menace to their national and international peace.  Here we have built up an Army.  We are collecting millions of pounds from the people and are borrowing millions more to keep that Army to defend us against the impact of war.  We also ought to show that we are prepared to defend ourselves against the type of thing that has brought other countries into war&mdash;the conditions resulting from unemployment.  We should <Col N="1580" /> be seeking in that direction for a challenge to stir our energies, our abilities, and our capacity for organisation &mdash;to use all our resources so as to prevent the misery to family life that unemployment brought about in other countries.  It is difficult, apparently, for us to set ourselves that challenge. We can, however, find a nucleus there that will direct our minds and be a challenge to us to use all our resources and guide us to the broader path later on.  Are we prepared to ask ourselves to-day: Is this State ready to make adequate provision for the wives and children of men who are permanently disabled, so that the men will be maintained in a certain degree of comfort and peace of mind, with the assurance that their wives will be able to look after the home and family, that the children will get education and be maintained with the necessary food and clothing to secure their health, that they can feel that, so far from being paupers indebted to maintenance by the State, they are the children of fathers who have given their all, up almost to the very threshold of their lives, in order that the liberties and resources of this State may be able to be used for the benefit of the people as a whole?  I do not think the House can avoid facing that issue and giving it a lot more consideration than it has given it so far.  It is regrettable, in a discussion of this matter, that it should come to be argued about by way of question and answer.  I submit with all earnestness to the House that the position we have before us in this Bill cannot stand.  Deputies have said that we cannot afford to do more, that we will complain about the bills that will be submitted if we increase these amounts.  I say that we cannot afford not to provide for the wives and children that I speak of.</P>

      <P>Deputy Mulcahy has completely misinformed himself on the question of officers' pensions.  I do not suggest that he has been deliberately trying to misinform the House, but it is possible that people who heard him speak, and have left the House, would go away believing that he had stated something that was a fact.  Either the <Col N="1581" /> Deputy has not read the Bill carefully, or for some other reason he has made those statements.  If he read the Bill carefully he would see that 60 per cent. of the annual pay at the date of discharge, or the sum of £120 per annum, whichever is the greater&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that that implies that £120 may be the greater, and, if £120 is the greater in any particular case, that is £80 less than that officer would have got under the 1923 Act.</P>

      <P>Sixty per cent. of the pay of an officer here could reach the sum of £480.  I do not know whether or not that is news to the Deputy, but that is the fact.  I cannot understand why the Deputy should get up and make the statements which he has made if in fact he knows what I am telling him now to be true.  I hope his information in regard to the Bill generally is better than that.  The rates here are the minimum rates, not the maximum rates, and any officer who is injured or becomes disabled through disease will receive those amounts, according to his rank.  The Second Lieutenant&mdash;that is the lowest grade in the rankings&mdash;receives about 85 per cent. of his actual pay.</P>
      <P>Deputy Mulcahy also said that I made no effort to defend the position in respect of married pensions.  I might just as well ask what defence did Deputy Mulcahy ever make of the £20 figure that was operating in his time, and that I have gone out of my way to increase to £30.  I do not have to defend an increase.  I am telling the Deputy that I have increased to £30 10s. a sum which, under the 1927 Act, was £20 5s.  I do not have to defend that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I can see quite clearly what the Deputy is endeavouring to do.  He is endeavouring to raise a question as to <Col N="1582" /> what is the standard rate for a family, or the cost of living, or something like that.  He will have ample opportunity to bring that in on many other occasions. When the Minister for Finance was discussing the questions that he had to discuss on the Vote on Account. I do not know whether the Deputy took advantage of the presence of the Minister for Finance to raise all the questions which he seems to have gone out of his way to raise on this particular Bill.  The question of what is or what should be the standard rate for a family can be discussed on the motion on family allowances which will be coming after this.</P>

I am confining myself entirely to the question as to what this House considers an adequate provision for the wife and family of a soldier who becomes completely disabled in the service of the country. The Minister suggested that under this Bill a Second-Lieutenant would be better off than under the 1923 Act, but it would help us to be clear on that if he gave us the figures as to what the scale of pension would be for a Second-Lieutenant under this section here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Under the 1923 Act it would be £200 When I see this statement here: &ldquo;Officers: degree of disability: 100 per cent; scale of pension: 60 per cent. of annual pay at the date of discharge, or the sum of £120 per annum whichever <Col N="1583" /> is the greater&rdquo;, the Minister must excuse me if I interpret that as meaning that there may be cases where £120 will be greater than 60 per cent. of the annual pay at the date of discharge. The sentence can mean nothing else.  It is arising out of the plain suggestion in that sentence that I say that cases may arise here in which an officer would get less than he would get under the 1923 Act, even though the cost of living has substantially increased.</P>
    <P>There is no other point in this section, or in any of the sections, worth talking about except the main point that, if we pass this section here, this Parliament is giving it as a definite expression of opinion that 10/- a week is adequate to give to a man who is completely incapacitated, by reason of military service, from earning his own living or contributing to the income of his family.  Again, I ask the Minister how he came to that decision, when a man who has the whole of his ability, the whole of his health, and who is on <Col N="1584" /> unemployment assistance will get, if he has a wife and five children, 12/6 additional payment in cash, and 14/- worth of milk and bread and butter; that is, in addition to his basic allowance, if he has a wife and five children and if he is receiving unemployment assistance himself, he will get cash and goods to the value of 26/6, and, if he is an Irishman who has joined the British Army, in addition to his basic pension, if he is completely disabled he will get at least 37/11.  Those are the last British figures that I have seen, and already it has been pointed out during a Parliamentary discussion in Great Britain that, where you have a man who has sacrificed all his power to provide for himself and his family in the interests of his country, they owe him more than mere subsistence, that they owe him some additional provision which will give him some mental comfort&mdash;the mental satisfaction that at any rate his wife and children are being provided for.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This section brings in the Army nursing service.  Heretofore, the Army nursing service were not included for the purpose of wounds or disability pensions.  They were covered for service but not for wounds or disability.  This section proposes to bring them in and to give them rights under the wounds and disability section. Sub-section (3) fixes the date of the commencement of the pension and sub-section (4) fixes the period within which the applications for pensions have to be made.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not think there is any section of people more competent to advise the Minister on the main point that we have been discussing here, that is, the inadequacy of the provision made for the wives and children of disabled soldiers, than the nursing staff that are provided for in this section.  They know what it is to deal with disabled men.  They know what the care of disabled men involves. They can easily understand what it takes to maintain a wife.  They have some understanding, I am sure, of what the maintenance of a child involves.  I have no objection to the type of provision that is made here and it is good to see it made but I do not think there is any member of the nursing staff who cannot afford to wait until consideration is given to the much more urgent case of the wife and children of a disabled man.  I do not know whether the nursing staff have recently benefited under, say, any of these bonus orders.  There probably would be a case for that when the increase in the cost of living within the last 12 months is considered.  There has been an increase in the cost of living from 237 in 1941 to 273 in 1942. I do not know whether they have got the benefit of a bonus or not, but I think I read recently that the women in the textile industry have received a bonus of an additional 5/-.  The fact that the ordinary woman with a basic salary is, by reason of even the temporary changes here, judged to be due an increase of 5/- in her present wages, is, I think, a rather pointed comment on the provision which this Bill makes &mdash;10/- to keep the wife and family of a disabled man.  Therefore, I oppose this section because I think the nursing staff can afford to wait.  I think the very fact that they are asked to wait and the fact that they would be willing to wait may help the Minister to realise the importance of the other point.  If he would address himself to the nursing staff on the question of what would be an adequate amount to maintain the wife and family of a disabled man, he might get a lot of very good advice and assistance in arriving at a decision.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>What does the section as amended do?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>The 1927 Act provided only for widows and orphans of personnel dying after 1st October, 1924. This section extends the provision to cover other dependents but only during the emergency period.  Section 14 (2) of the 1927 Act dealt only with the widows and orphans of persons dying from disease contracted before 30th September, 1924.  Sub-section (2) of this section extends the period to the emergency period and also provides for dependents other than widows and orphans.  Section 14 (2) (d) of the 1927 Act grants widows' and orphans' allowances where a person with a disability (disease) pension plus a married pension dies from the disease in respect of which he had a pension.  Sub-section (2) of this section extends the provision to the widows and orphans of those who get a disease pension of 80 per cent. or over in respect of the emergency period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next sub-section extends the provisions to dependents other than widows and orphans.  Section 15 (2) of the 1927 Act grants widows' and orphans' allowances where a person with a wound pension plus a married pension dies from the wound in respect of which he had a pension.  Sub-section (4) of Section 5 ensures that the same provision will operate in respect of those who die with a wound pension <Col N="1589" /> plus a married pension.  Sub-section (5) of the section describes the other dependents now covered, provides one of more allowances for total dependence, and provides one allowance for one main dependent.  A person totally or mainly dependent on more than one officer or soldier can receive only the maximum allowance provided.  The maximum allowance for the dependent of an officer is £52 per annum and £26 per annum in the case of a soldier. Sub-section (6) fixes the date for the commencement of the allowance, sub-section (7) fixes the period for application and sub-section (8) restricts the extension to dependents, other than widows and orphans, to the emergency period.  The amendment, as I have already stated, is merely a drafting amendment to ensure that the widows of officers who die from disease during the emergency will be entitled to widows' and children's allowances.</P>

Could he provide for the dependents of that man under this Bill?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that you were held up before, but, seeing that you are providing compensation for widows in this section, it is not too much to ask that some provision should be made for a case of this kind.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am allowing for that. He was travelling home on week-end leave, and was to return on Monday morning.  He found that he would have five hours longer in Cork by travelling by military lorry instead of by train.  I think that there is a moral obligation on the part of the State towards this man's wife and five young children, and that we should avail of this opportunity to discharge the obligation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sorry to have to disagree with the Deputy.  I do not think this is an occasion on which we should provide for dependents of people who deliberately refuse to comply with, or disobey, the ordinary regulations of the Army.  Unfortunately for himself, this man had no right to travel in this lorry.  He did so at his own risk, and at the risk of his dependents.  To bring in a provision to legalise such action would be disastrous.  It would be to invite resort to all sorts of illegalities by soldiers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not arguing against the Minister in that respect. But here is a man whose widow and five children are to be left without provision simply because he availed of a lorry coming to Cork instead of travelling by train.  Surely, legislation will not take away the right to give that widow some compensation for the loss of her husband.  I am not condoning the irregularity committed by the soldier.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>I may have used the word &ldquo;disastrous&rdquo; loosely, but it would be a bad thing to legalise that type of conduct.  There is a strict rule in the Army&mdash;Deputies would be the first to raise a query if the rule were broken&mdash;whereby persons are not allowed to travel on Army lorries unless they are on duty.  We know what human frailty is.  Soldiers who know that a lorry is about to set off in a certain direction will wait up the road for it and try to make arrangements with the driver to get a &ldquo;lift&rdquo; and thus save their railway fares.  It would not be a good thing for me, or for any Minister for Defence, to legalise action of that kind.</P>

      <P>Here, again, provision is made for a certain class of dependents.  I suggest to the Minister that, arising out of their own experience of facts and difficulties, these would be one of the first of the various classes who would say that people who ought to be considered before them are the wives and children of people still alive who gave all their capacity in the service of their country.  I suggest that they are a class to whom the Minister might refer and find out some estimate of what would be required to keep the wife and children of a completely disabled <Col N="1592" /> soldier.  I have no hesitation in saying that people with their experience would be the first to urge that absence of proper provision for the wives and families of completely disabled men was a fundamental blemish on this Bill and who would say that they would be prepared to wait until the Government had thought that matter over and would advise the Government if they wanted to know what adequate provision for a wife and children should be in such circumstances.</P>

      <P>It is most regrettable that this issue was not brought under the notice of another body where the Minister might have been induced to take a more liberal and more generous line.  I do not accuse the Minister of being hard-hearted.  I suspect that he is merely bowing to the dictatorial attitude of the Department of Finance. I could quote something in support of that, but I do not wish to do so in this House.  If it is the intention of the Government, as they say, to bring in a scheme of family allowances during their official lifetime, surely the attitude of the Minister in opposing the suggestions of Deputy Mulcahy is quite in conflict with that intention.</P>

It reduces the degree of disablement. Under sub-section (1) (a), if the person's degree of disablement is found to be less than 80 per cent., and not less than 50 per cent., there may be granted to such person a final pension of 15/- a <Col N="1595" /> week.  Under sub-section (1) (b) if the person's degree of disablement is found to be not less than 80 per cent., on the date of examination, but is subsequently found, on any periodical reexamination, to have dropped below 80 per cent., but not less than 50 per cent., there may be granted to such person a final pension of £1 per week.</P>

    <Speaker pid="OscarTraynor" hpid="Mr. Traynor Mr. Traynor">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Traynor</NameTxt>
      <P>This section applies to every person who is in possession of a military service certificate in respect of Easter Week, 1916, or who is in receipt of a disability pension in respect of wounds or injuries received or disability contracted during that particular week, provided that the person is incapable of self-support by reason of age or permanent infirmity of mind or body and that his or her yearly means from all sources do not exceed a certain sum.  For a single man or woman that sum is £78 a year; if married, £97 10s. Od.; and for each child the sum is raised by £10 8s. Od. a year.  In other words, a single person, totally destitute, will receive £78 a year and, if married, £97 10s. Od; with <Col N="1597" /> £10 8s. Od. added in respect of each child.  On the other hand, if the person be not totally destitute but in receipt of a service or a disability pension, his means will be brought up to the scale of allowances mentioned.  It will thus be seen that every person qualifying under this provision will be entitled to, from all sources, if single, 30/- a week: if married, 37/6 a week and an additional sum of 4/- a week in respect of each child.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Here we have an extraordinary position.  We are asked to accept the principle that a special allowance will be given to a child.  The men and women of Easter Week faced realities and, I am sure, are ready to face realities to-day.  They would be the first to tell the Minister that the children and wives of men who are completely disabled should be adequately provided for.  When the 1934 Act was being discussed in this House, I opposed it and then, when it was passed by a majority vote, I appealed to the House to realise that there were men who had served in 1916 and were in very poor circumstances. I pleaded that, if various classes of people were being catered for, that very small remnant should be catered for.  The attitude of the Government at that particular time was that they could not do so; but, happily, during the transit of the 1934 Act from this House to the Seanad, the Government mind changed on the matter and certain provisions were made for them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>People who went out in 1916 asserted that the Irish Republic was entitled to and claimed the allegiance of every Irish man and woman.  It guaranteed certain things and it declared itself resolved &ldquo;to pursue the happiness and prosperity of the whole nation and of all its parts, cherishing all the children of the nation equally&rdquo;.  It called on the Irish people, as a whole: &ldquo;In this supreme hour, the Irish nation must, by its policy and discipline and by the readiness of its children to sacrifice themselves for the common good, prove itself worthy of the august destiny to which it is called.&rdquo;  A couple of years ago&mdash;on what the Minister called the abstruse question which he alleged I was dealing with <Col N="1598" /> to-night&mdash;I asked the House what they considered was the &ldquo;august destiny&rdquo; to which this refers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That &ldquo;august destiny&rdquo; is not at issue.  What arises is whether or not certain concessions should be made to the survivors of 1916.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Here again you have a class that would deliberately and definitely wait and ask to have the Government provide for the children as well as the wives of men who may be permanently disabled under present circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>That is not relevant.  It is a question of a concession for a particular class.  The same speech cannot, obviously, be relevant to every section.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Here again is a class that can afford to wait and would be willing to wait.  I am opposed to the passing of this section until the Government reconsiders the fundamental question that we have been discussing here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad that the Minister has agreed that the people of Easter Week should get this recognition, and I am glad that the principle which we have been arguing all the evening has been accepted in that respect.  I feel that the section should have been extended to cover people who contracted disease between the years 1924 and 1939.  There is a large number of these, but not a number that would be of any great financial burden on the State.  They are suffering very severely themselves.</P>
      <P>I suggest to the Minister that the whole matter of this section and of all the sections of the Act should be reconsidered. This piecemeal legislation is not good.  If this section, when it applies to the people of 1916, is a token of what the Minister would be prepared to do for those who contracted disease and received injuries in the period 1924 to 1939, it is a good principle to accept; and, as far as I am concerned, the Minister is to be congratulated upon this particular section, where he accepts the principle, and I would suggest to him that he extend it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I asked the Minister for Lands to-day if it was his intention to proceed with the acquisition of the lands of Killeendowd, the property of Mr. George W.K. Gilliland, Barry House, Colehill, County Longford, upon whom notice of intention to acquire was served as far back as 12th January, 1938.  The Minister, in the course of his reply, said that such a notice was served, pursuant to Section 23 of the Land Act of 1927, that the Land Commission had not taken further steps in the matter, and the case, with many others, was now governed by the emergency restrictions, which prevented the undertaking of fresh commitments, except in special circumstances.  He then went on to say:&mdash;&ldquo;There is no question of withdrawing proceedings which have not yet been instituted, or of communicating further with the owner at present.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make it perfectly clear that I advocate, have advocated, and will continue to advocate the acquisition of this holding.  It is suitable for the purpose, and could be divided amongst a great number of people in the way of allotments for some and of new holdings for landless men and others. I want the Minister to say that he will acquire it now or, if not, that he will be fair to the owner and occupier by telling him that he does not propose to acquire it.  The Minister says that proceedings were not instituted.  I respectfully submit that statement is incorrect.  The serving of notice of intention to acquire a holding on the owner means the initiation of proceedings for acquisition.  The owner cannot <Col N="1601" /> appeal so far as that notice is concerned. It is only when further steps are taken that he can appeal.  Therefore, I submit that in this particular case this man has been treated unfairly, and neither the Government nor anybody else has the right to treat a citizen of the State unfairly.  The owner in this case, as well as the applicants and others expecting some of this land, have been, I think, treated unfairly.  Speaking here on behalf of the majority of the applicants for parcels and plots of land on this holding, I want the Minister to say (1) that it is his intention to proceed with its acquisition, (2) that the serving of the notice on the owner was the first step in the institution of proceedings for its acquisition, and (3) that the holding is not exempt under the Emergency Powers Order.  If the Minister does that he will be doing a good day's work and will be serving the interests of a very large number of people who are anxious to till that land as their own.</P>
    <P>This land has been set in parcels. I hold that the tillage on it is not being as well done by the present owner and those to whom part of it has been set as it would be if it were divided and given out by way of permanent allotments to the applicants for it.  In the present emergency, and especially when the owner is willing, I submit that its acquisition should take place.  The question of price, of course, would arise, but that could be settled afterwards.  That is not a matter for the Deputy for the constituency or the Government either.  It is one for the Land Commission and their valuers.  What I resent in connection with this case is that, prior to the 1934 General Election, Land Commission inspectors&mdash;of course the usual resolutions were passed by the local Fianna Fáil club&mdash;came down and inspected the lands.  The same thing happened in connection with the 1937 and the 1938 General Elections.  On the 12th January, 1938, this notice of intention to acquire was served.  Therefore, I hold political use was made of this farm.  One would be inclined to say that the present is an opportune time to send down a fresh batch of <Col N="1602" /> inspectors.  The Minister, in my view, has put the case in an unfair way in the last paragraph of his written answer to the question where he says: &ldquo;There is no question of withdrawing proceedings which have not yet been instituted, or of communicating further with the owner at present.&rdquo;  I submit that once notice of intention to acquire land is served the land is no longer the property of an owner.  He cannot do anything with it.  In fairness, therefore, to the owner, if the Government are not going to allow the Land Commission to proceed with the acquisition of this land, that notice should be withdrawn.  I want the Minister to do either one or other of these two things.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig) Thomas Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Lands (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy MacEoin is not correct in saying that this land was under consideration for acquisition at any time in connection with a general election.  There is no record in the official file of anything in connection with these lands until 1935 when representations were made regarding them.  In 1937 an inspection was made, and in 1938 the notice, to which the Deputy has referred, was published.  A legal decision held up all acquisition proceedings by the Land Commission from the year 1938 to 1939.  It was then found necessary to introduce amending legislation.  This legislation could not be brought into effect as the rules of court were not available until well on in 1940, so that even if there had been no emergency situation, nothing could have been done either with these or any other lands held up by reason of this legal decision until towards the end of 1940.  The emergency, however, having arisen, a decision was come to late in 1939 and again in 1940 restricting the proceedings of the Land Commission on the basis that commitments that had been entered into, and where proceedings had been initiated, should be continued but that in all other cases matters should be held up for the present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Technically, proceedings, as the answer to the question points out, had not been instituted in this case.  They would not have been instituted until the legal notices prescribed by the <Col N="1603" /> Land Acts had been published.  The communication issued to the owner was simply an intimation that the Land Commission, after inspecting the lands, had decided to proceed with their acquisition and to issue the statutory notices in due course.  The notices were not issued.  I do not think there is any disability, therefore, upon the owner, and as regards the claimants for the land, they are in the same position as others. This is not the only estate&mdash;the House knows there are a great many estates, probably hundreds and very many thousands of acres of land&mdash;in this position. It is precisely because we have that difficulty&mdash;of being unable to select particular cases without opening all the cases which remain on hands to be taken up when circumstances improve&mdash;that this case has to remain over.  Even if the cases were, by a Government decision, to be reopened the Land Commission at the present time has not the staff to deal with them.  The Land Commission has more than enough work on hands to keep the present staff occupied for a very considerable time.</P>
    <P>Until that situation is altered, until the Land Commission gets back its full staff and has had an opportunity to clear off all the work that is in the hands of inspectors at the present time, and which is coming into their hands in those cases where proceedings are at present going on, it would be useless even to pretend that we can deal in any reasonable time with cases such as that which the Deputy has in mind.  I regret that I cannot hold out any promise, therefore, to deal with this matter.  The whole situation regarding the Land Commission activities is under review; but, as I mentioned to-day, we have these physical difficulties which render it impossible for us to deal with all these cases.  They will have to remain over, I fear, until conditions improve very substantially.</P>

      <P>Is the man free, then, to sell?  This is leaving him suspended in mid-air.  There are two questions I would like to put to the Minister. Firstly, was the decision to stop proceeding with the acquisition of lands made by the Government? <Col N="1604" /> Secondly, if they decided not to proceed with the acquisition, surely they should say so and leave the person free to resume&mdash;that is, they should withdraw the notice and let the man resume full ownership and his full rights to free sale.</P>

      <P>I do not agree with the Deputy that there has been any interference and I am sure that, if the owner consults his legal representative, he will be so informed.  There is no interference whatever with him in the ownership of his land, nor would there be even if things had gone further than they have gone.  Technically, as I have said, proceedings have not been instituted, but we are not in a position to withdraw the notice that has been given, without having regard to all other similar cases.  In the same manner as we cannot proceed in one case in an arbitrary way, without having regard to all the other cases, so we cannot withdraw notices in one case without having regard to the reactions in the other cases.  Deputy MacEoin himself sometimes has to make a decision as to whether, in the long run, a matter ought to be dropped or proceeded with, and he has made the impression that he is strongly in favour of going ahead with the acquisition in this case.</P>

      <P>Yes.  At the same time, I wish to have this made clear. I want the Minister to go ahead with it.  If, however, he is not prepared to do that, I want him to say, in fair play, that he is not going ahead with it and withdraw the notice.  The Minister says he cannot withdraw the notice.  He says at one stage that proceedings have not been initiated.  Of course they have been initiated&mdash;the very moment that notice is served; and that they have been initiated is proved by the fact that the Land Commission will not withdraw the notice. In fair play to the owner and to the owners of other land, I think that, where the Land Commission have decided not to proceed with the acquisition of land, under the orders of the Government, they should let the land revert to its original situation.</P>
      <P>The Dáil adjourned at 9.30 p.m. until 3 p.m. on Wednesday, 7th April.</P>
