    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs whether he will state the circumstances in which the S.S. <i>Irish Oak</i> was torpedoed and sunk, and to what navy the submarine which attacked the ship in daylight belonged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach) Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>Minister for External Affairs (The Taoiseach)</NameTxt>
      <P>The circumstances of the sinking of the S.S. <i>Irish Oak</i> were stated in the announcement by Irish Shipping, Limited, published in the Press of the 21st May.</P>
      <P>As was stated in the announcement, the attacking submarine was not seen by any member of the crew.  There is, therefore, no proof as to its nationality.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to ask two supplementary questions.  Was the submarine which torpedoed this ship seen on the surface by members of the crew at 5.30 on Friday evening, before the ship was torpedoed, and did it follow the ship through the night and torpedo it, without notice, at ten minutes past eight on Saturday morning? Secondly, after firing the first torpedo into the ship, and after the crew had taken to the boats, did the attacking submarine return and fire a second torpedo into the ship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to the question as to whether the submarine that fired the torpedo&mdash;assuming that it was a submarine -that fired the torpedo&mdash;had been seen the previous <Col N="538" /> day and followed the ship, that is not my information.  My information is that a submarine was seen on the previous day, which was identified, not by any markings but by its general contour or silhouette, as a German submarine.  That was seen some time between 2.30 and 5.30 on the previous day.  That submarine was not seen after that.  Therefore, it is not possible to establish any connection between that particular submarine and the one which fired the torpedo.  There are more submarines than one, of course, and it would be very difficult to establish, without direct proof, the connection that the Deputy is trying to establish.  One cannot say that it was that particular submarine which followed the ship during the night, as it was lost sight of about 5.30 or 6 o'clock.  You cannot say it followed the ship during the night or that it was that particular submarine that fired the torpedo.  With regard to the second question, I have no information further than that a first torpedo was fired and struck the ship forward on the port side; and that, after the crew had taken to the boats, a second torpedo was fired.  The first torpedo was fired at 8.40 a.m. and the ship sank finally at 10 a.m.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that the master of the ship has been examined and has certified to the representatives of the Minister for External Affairs that he is not in a position to identify or to express an opinion, as to the nationality of the submarine that sank the ship?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The information which I have given to the Deputy and to the House is the information I got from the officers of my Department&mdash; the Department of External Affairs. May I say quite definitely that the captain was not able to identify the particular submarine which fired the torpedo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it established that this ship was out of convoy when it <Col N="539" /> was attacked?  I ask that for more reasons than one.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am glad to hear that. Those who are trying to cause trouble outside are stating that the ship was in convoy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It was not.  The firing of a torpedo at that ship was a wanton and inexcusable act.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There was no possibility of mistake.  The conditions of visibility were good, and the neutral markings on the ship were perfectly clear.  No warning was given, and the first intimation that there was a submarine about, or that there was danger, was the explosion of the torpedo. We must regard it as an act of Providence that any of the crew was saved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Everett</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="JohnJamesCole" hpid="Mr. Cole Mr. Cole">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cole</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state the estimated total annual cost to the taxpayers and the ratepayers of the steps which have been taken by the Government to make Eire an Irish-speaking State, including (a) the annual cost of teaching the Irish language in primary and secondary schools and universities; (b) the annual cost of translating and printing official documents in the Irish language; (c) the various annual grants in aid of the Irish language; and (d) other annual expenditures in the revival of the Irish language.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>As the answer consists mainly of tabular statements, I propose to circulate it with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the answer:</P>
      <P>It is estimated that in the financial year 1941-42 contributions amounting in the aggregate to £25,500, were provided by rating authorities out of rates towards the cost of the teaching of Irish under vocational education schemes of vocational education committees.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The provision included in the Estimates for Public Services for the financial year 1942-43 is set out in the subjoined tables, under heads indicating <Col N="541" /> the different categories of expenditure which contributes to the advancement of the Irish language.  It amounts in the aggregate to the sum of £319,993. It will be observed that the expenditure under heads II and III is, in the <Col N="542" /> main, not specifically directed to the development of Irish as a spoken language, and is of a kind which would probably be incurred irrespective of policy directed towards the restoration of the language.</P>

    <Title>Ceisteanna&mdash;Questions.   Oral Answers. - Shirt Prices.</Title>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he has now inquired into the costings of manufacturers to whom utility shirting print has been allocated by him; whether he has satisfied himself that a retail price of 14/11 each, a wholesale to retail price of 126/-dozen, and a factory to wholesale price of 108/- dozen are justified for utility tunic shirts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>From the form in which the Deputy has put his question it would appear <Col N="545" /> that he is not aware of the methods of price control which have been adopted in regard to clothing.</P>
      <P>The Deputy appears to be under the impression that specific prices have been fixed for classes of shirts and that these specific prices would be uniform as between different manufacturers. This impression is incorrect.  In the case of shirts, the majority of the larger manufacturers determine their own prices in accordance with arrangements entered into with my Department for the control of prices and profits.  These arrangements limit the rate of gross profit to be taken by any manufacturer, but the actual manufacturers' prices for the articles produced are not fixed by me.  It will be obvious that with the variety of firms that exist in the shirt industry, there is a wide disparity of cost as between one firm and another and there is consequently a wide variety in manufacturers' prices.</P>
      <P>Under the Order made by me on the 21st instant wholesalers' and retailers' margins on shirts are limited to maximum percentages.  Where the manufacturer's price for shirts of any particular kind is 108/- per dozen, the price mentioned in the Deputy's question, the wholesale and retail prices set out would be well within the maximum prices calculated in accordance with the provisions of the new Order.</P>
      <P>As I intimated to the Deputy when dealing with this matter a week ago, I will be prepared to have investigations made into the specific prices charged by any firm of manufacturers, if he will give me the name of the firm which he has in mind and if I find that these prices are inconsistent with the price arrangements entered into by that firm, I will be prepared to take any additional measures necessary to enforce control.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister consider that a price of 108/- per dozen from manufacturer to wholesaler is justified under the terms of his new Order in view of the circumstance that the shirts for which this price is being charged cost the manufacturer 66/- per dozen to produce?  Does he consider it is a proper use of the utility shirting, for <Col N="546" /> the distribution of which he has taken responsibility, that it should be converted into tunic shirts which cost the manufacturer 66/- per dozen to produce, which are sold by the manufacturer at 108/- per dozen to the wholesaler, at 126/- by the wholesaler to the retailer, and at 14/11 each by the retailer to the consumer?  If the Minister does not think these are proper margins on the original cost price of 66/- per dozen, would he cause an inquiry to be made in the trade, and will he take all such steps as may be necessary to prevent an exploitation of the public of this character?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of any manufacturer who is charging this price.  If the Deputy is, why will he not name him?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I name each several shirt manufacturer in Dublin and I declare that certainly up to last Saturday week each several shirt manufacturer operating in the Dublin area, using the utility cloth distributed under the Minister's aegis, was charging this price.  I name them or I name any one of them at the Minister's choosing&mdash;the shirt-manufacturers operating in the City of Dublin. I state positively that the shirts cost 66/- per dozen to produce.  I state positively that each and all of them were charging 108/- per dozen to the wholesaler and the wholesaler 126/- to the retailer.  Now will the Minister answer?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy has obviously got the wrong end of some story.  If he will refer to the answer I have just read out, he will see that the system of price control does not include the fixation of specific prices for shirts.  The system of price control is on a different basis.  If he will go to the trouble of reading the reply I have given, he will find that his information is obviously inaccurate, and perhaps he will then go to the trouble of finding out what the position is.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I appreciate what the Minister said, that his system of price control takes cognisance of the general margin of profit and limits it.  I ask if, in this specific case, he will use all <Col N="547" /> such other machinery as is available to him to control a specific case of gross exploitation by the producer of the consumer.  Has not the Minister price control machinery in his Department, or in the Department of Industry and Commerce, which enables him to investigate a specific case of overcharging?</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The accounts of the manufacturers have been and are being examined.  Each of them was working to a fixed profit margin and in no case is the margin anything like that suggested by the Deputy.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Might I say that the abuse I allege only took place in the course of the last three weeks and no account could possibly show that to the Minister as yet?  The evil ought to be put an end to.  The evil I allege is happening now.</P>

    <P>Mrs. Howard was given the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act on both charges; Mr. Wyles was fined £1 on each charge, and Mr. Webster was fined £2 in respect of his failure to keep the prescribed sugar records and given the benefit of the Probation of Offenders Act in respect of his failure to keep the prescribed record in relation to tea.</P>

      <P>The Limerick-Foynes bus service is maintained at a loss averaging recently about £7 a week. I am aware that the public generally are excluded from the use of the service. The service is provided primarily for the benefit of the State staff employed at the Shannon Airport (Foynes) who are unable to obtain living accommodation at or near Foynes.  Certain other persons associated with the operation of the airport, such as the staffs of the air transport companies, are also permitted to use the bus.  Having regard to the requirements of the persons for whom the service is designed, and for whom it is already on many occasions inadequate, it is not possible to make it available to the general public.</P>

      <P>I would refer the Deputy to the reply I gave him to his question in regard to this bridge on the 8th April last.  The county councils concerned have passed resolutions requesting that at least 75 per cent. of the cost of the work should be contributed by the Road Fund. The cost of the reconstruction of the bridge, including the preparation of plans, will be a charge on the local bodies concerned, subject to whatever contribution it may be found possible to make from the Road Fund.  In the present condition of that fund it would be quite improper for the Minister for Local Government and Public Health <Col N="551" /> to give any undertaking which would impose an indefinite and unascertainable liability upon it.  Therefore I cannot make any statement at this stage as to the amount of such contribution.

      <P>It is not a matter for the Minister.  He has to say whether he will approve or disapprove, but the attention of the secretary of this parish council was drawn to the rule. He was told it was a matter for the Rules Committee and that he could address any request of that kind to the secretary of the committee, or that, if it were a matter for the emergency only, it could be done through the Circuit Court judge under the Emergency Powers Act.  Either of these courses is open to him, and then it will be a matter for the Minister to say whether or not he will agree.</P>

I think every solicitor knows all about the Rules Committee, and matters of the kind mentioned by the Deputy have to be referred to them.  If this arises out of the emergency conditions, there is power granted to the Circuit Court judge to recommend changes of the sittings, if he wishes to do so.  If <Col N="558" /> the change is to be of a temporary nature, it is referred to the judge, but if it is intended to be a permanent change, the application is made to the secretary of the Rules Committee.

      <P>I am aware that Private James Crosby died on the 18th October, 1941, while on service with the Defence Forces.  On the morning when he reported ill he was examined by two Army medical officers but, since no evidence of any definite disability was discovered, he returned to his billet where, shortly afterwards, he got a sudden seizure and died before medical aid could reach him.</P>
      <P>I am advised that a post-mortem which was carried out showed that death was due to a clot of blood in the main artery of the lungs.  I understand that such disability is practically impossible to discover from an ordinary clinical examination and that it is a frequent cause of sudden death.</P>

      <P>Does the Parliamentary Secretary consider that that is fair treatment for the widow and orphans of that soldier, who was serving his country at that particular time?  I asked the Minister if he was not satisfied that this man's death was due to the hardships imposed upon him the previous day, and I want an answer on that point.  There is no question about it that the soldier suffered these hardships the previous day and his death was due to these hardships.  This man has served from 1920.</P>

      <P>Parliamentary institutions are being attacked pretty widely in the world to-day, and I must confess when I have had to defend these institutions I have found it difficult to maintain that our method of legislating is the most expeditious method, and I have been constrained to say that, while it is true that in the matter of legislative procedure it might be possible to reform our procedure so as to make it more efficacious and more expeditious, I have always held that no person should willingly throw away that defence of personal liberty with which Parliamentary institutions provide us. In that connection, I have often told the story of an important function, in connection with the visit of a very important personage to the island of Fiji, when somebody wanted to interrupt the ceremonials in order to ask the governor a question on some rather trivial matter.  The governor felt that that was not the proper place or time to raise that matter, and it was said to him: &ldquo;But, Sir, if you do not deal with it now a question may be raised in Parliament about it.&rdquo;  Now, it seems to me that when, in connection with a remote island, 15,000 miles away from the central government of a great Empire, a question could be raised in Parliament dealing with even trivial matters, that is a guarantee of the preservation of native rights, even in the middle of the jungle, as a result of these parliamentary institutions.  The most insignificant person, if he has no money and cannot get to the courts, or if he feels that he has any legitimate grievance, knows that he can come to any one of us and have a question raised in Parliament: that we can pursue that question in Parliament and force the responsible Minister to search his Department and cause the Department to defend itself in the House. That is an immense instrument of human liberty and, indeed, of justice, and I urge on this House most strongly to assent to no amendment of the Standing Orders which will in any way limit Deputies' rights to put Parliamentary <Col N="566" /> questions in the House.  I apprehend that if this is permitted, we shall gradually start chiselling away this right, which is naturally an embarrassment to any Executive.  The whole tendency of the Executive is to circumscribe this right.</P>

      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>
      <P>Owing to the Dáil meeting rarely, a few years ago, at the request of some Deputies, of whom I think Deputy Dillon was one, the Chair did allow questions to continue to 4 o'clock.  Perhaps it would be no harm to say that, largely at the suggestion of the Ceann Comhairle, 4 is put in instead of 3.45, which was suggested in order to give ample time to Deputies.  It has never gone beyond 4 o'clock.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>In my judgment, the question of the restraint of the right of Deputies to put questions is a matter which ought to be left in the hands of the Ceann Comhairle, because his office commands the respect of every Deputy in the House, and every Deputy feels&mdash;even the most defenceless or most isolated Deputy&mdash;that he has in the Ceann Comhairle his best defence against an Executive or any other body who might try to silence him.  I think that the proper method of dealing with the limitation of time for Parliamentary question and answer would be to leave the matter in the hands of the Ceann Comhairle and I emphasise again that any form of rigidity designed to squeeze out an individual Deputy, whose only recourse is by way of Parliamentary question and answer, is a retrograde step.  If <Col N="567" /> the Ceann Comhairle says that this is largely to extend time rather than restrict it, then I shall withdraw my opposition, but I would suggest to the House that at some stage we ought to re-examine this Standing Order and leave that question of the limitation of Parliamentary time in the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle, albeit he may dislike having to accept responsibility for such a discretion.  It seems to me that that would be the proper method and it would be a protection for any Deputy against an Executive or a powerful Opposition who might try to limit that time, because the more we are stripped of rights of this kind in connection with Parliamentary government, the more doubtful it becomes if Parliamentary democracy is the best method.  So long as you have the method of Parliamentary question, and the right to cross-examine a Minister before the people, there can be no doubt in the minds of rational men that Parliamentary government is a good thing, and therefore the House should bear in mind that this matter of the limitation of time for Parliamentary questions and answers should be vested in the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate upon the Estimate for the Department of Industry and Commerce, Deputy Davin made what purported to be a considered statement of policy on behalf of the Labour Party on the matter of public transport services, with particular reference to the part which the railway companies play in serving transport needs.  The formality with which Deputy Davin raised the issue, the special notice that he gave of his intention to do so, the motion which he put upon the Paper, all indicated that this was a <i>tour de force.</i> on behalf of the Labour Party&mdash;an effort to prove to the House and to the country that, at least in respect of this one matter of public transport, they were capable of producing a constructive policy.  Unfortunately, however, Deputy Davin's performance fell far below what we were led to expect.  This constructive statement upon transport policy&mdash;a statement which the Deputy assured us in advance would be a constructive statement&mdash;was confined to a very vague suggestion of nationalisation.  Deputy Davin did not attempt to indicate even what should be nationalised.  I know that there is in the minds of the Labour Party an unbounded faith in the efficacy of slogans, and, presumably, Deputy Davin thought that his announcement of a new slogan, or his resurrection of an old slogan, in relation to public transport was a constructive effort of no mean magnitude. As we have the Labour Party committed to one positive idea, however vague, I think that we should urge them to go a bit further and state precisely what they mean.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin told us that his statement was official, that he was announcing Labour Party policy, and that his was a constructive attempt to deal with an important issue of national concern.  Apart from his vague suggestion that something should be nationalised, we learned nothing from him.  He did not even attempt to indicate which of the transport organisations of the country should be brought under national control, whether all of them should be brought under national control; <Col N="569" /> whether his proposal was limited to the Great Southern Railways Company, or whether it included the Dublin transport service.  He ignored completely the problems which we all know exist in applying any system of national control to those transport services which operate on both sides of the Border.  No doubt, mere difficulties of that kind can be ignored by a Party which can take other things within their sweep as easily as can the Labour Party, but, as we were offered what was described as a constructive effort to deal with our transport difficulties, we should have been told how this particular problem of nationalising the cross-Border services should be faced.</P>
    <P>It was evident from Deputy Davin's remarks that he had failed completely to understand the essential facts of the railway position and of our transport problems.  Having thrown out his vague suggestion of nationalisation, he proceeded to deal with a number of insignificant details which had no relation to transport policy at all and he gave no indication of any attempt on his part or on the part of his Party to face up to what are the realities of the transport problem or the realities of the position of the Great Southern Railways Company.  Deputy Davin confined his remarks entirely to the affairs of the Great Southern Railways Company.  It is quite clear from the facts, as we know them, that the position of the Great Southern Railways Company is such that any measures to remedy it will be beyond the capacity of private industrial enterprise.  The measures necessary to ensure the survival of that organisation cannot be initiated by private enterprise.  It may even be doubtful if these measures can, in fact, be initiated by national enterprise, either.  The outstanding facts, to which Deputy Davin failed to refer, except in so far as he quoted extracts from a speech made at the annual meeting of the company by the chairman of the company, are that the railway system under the control of the Great Southern Railways Company was designed to serve a transport problem vastly different from that which exists <Col N="570" /> to-day, that its organisation and equipment are obsolescent and that there must be a vast reorganisation in its method of working and a complete modernising of its equipment if it is to survive at all.  The carrying out of these reforms could, no doubt, be undertaken by a national control board or any such organisation as Deputy Davin has in mind.  They could, conceivably, be undertaken by the present company if it had the resources.  The reason why I referred to the impossibility of these reforms being carried out by the present company is that, as conditions now stand, it cannot obtain the resources necessary for the purpose. When Deputy Davin comes here to make a statement upon transport policy and fails to advert to the obvious, outstanding features of the problem, he merely indicates the complete inability of his Party to deal with facts at all.  No doubt, that Party may delude a number of people into the belief that they are thinking constructively when they throw out a vague suggestion of nationalisation but, to those who know anything about the matter, they merely reveal their bankruptcy of ideas.</P>
    <P>Nationalisation would be a good policy if it helped to effect the changes necessary.  I have stated my belief that, in present circumstances, private enterprise will be inadequate for this purpose.  The capital invested by private investors in the Great Southern Railways Company, represented, as it is, by closed branch lines, a general system ill-designed to serve present-day transport needs and rolling stock which will, in large part, have to be scrapped and replaced, is already, in large measure, lost.  The fact that a large portion of that capital had to be regarded as lost was the basis of the legislation enacted some ten years ago to reduce the nominal value of the company's stocks. Clearly, under the circumstances which now exist and which can be contemplated in the future, private investors will not provide the vast sums required for the reorganisation and re-equipment of the Great Southern Railways Company's services on the lines which the Government has in <Col N="571" /> mind.  Deputy Davin made a completely unwarranted attack on Mr. Reynolds, the chairman of the company. Mr. Reynolds, in his speech at the annual meeting of the company, was facing facts.  The Labour Party's inclination to run away from facts was demonstrated again by Deputy Davin here last week.  Deputy Davin misinterpreted the realistic review of the company's position which Mr. Reynolds gave to the annual meeting of the shareholders as an indication that the company was doomed.  He failed to realise that the preliminary to any serious attempt to effect the changes which will mean a survival of the undertaking must be a facing up to the facts of the situation.  What Mr. Reynolds was trying to do, and what he succeeded in doing, outside the ranks of the Labour Party, was to get the facts made known to the people whose livelihood is involved in the maintenance of the company as well as to the general public.</P>
    <P>The first step in the vast task of reconstruction which faces this undertaking is a clear statement of the facts of the situation.  These facts disclose a serious state of affairs&mdash;a state of affairs which cannot be remedied by mere tinkering.  Clearly, if this House is, at any time, to be called upon to pass legislation to deal with this matter, it must appreciate the seriousness of the state of affairs which exists.  No doubt, the situation of the Great Southern Railways Company and other large transport undertakings was equally serious some ten or 11 years ago when the present Government came into office.  In 1932, the railway system of this country was on the point of complete collapse.  We made an attempt to save it by the legislation enacted in 1933 and 1934.  That legislation served its purpose.  The collapse which was then imminent did not take place but it is now clear, as a result of the experience of the past ten years, that the difficulties which beset the railway organisations of the country were of much deeper root than they then appeared to be.  Although the action of the Government in 1933 did keep the railways going until now and although their services are still <Col N="572" /> available to meet the essential needs of transport in present circumstances, it is clear that we must now be prepared to apply more fundamental treatment to the whole problem.  I think that the incapacity of Deputy Davin, as disclosed in the speech he made here last week, and of the Party of which he is a member, to deal with the realities of the situation, and their inclination to hedge themselves round with vague and general phrases, is an indication that they are not going to be of any use to the country in tackling this problem.</P>

      <P>I may say that in the recent negotiations in which I was personally involved resulting from the stoppage of work in the railway company's shops, the general attitude of the union's representatives was one of anxiety that Mr. Reynolds should take a personal part in the negotiations.  He was unable to do so by reason of illness and, quite willingly, the union's representatives agreed that the negotiations should be delayed until he was in a position to resume duty.  I may say also that shortly after his resumption of duty a settlement of the differences existing was effected and the workers returned to duty.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Perhaps the Deputy does; I do not.  However, the position is, as I think the employees of the railway company must know, that the whole organisation upon which they are dependent for a livelihood is in jeopardy.  There is no useful purpose to be served by concealing that fact from them.  That organisation cannot be carried on indefinitely at a loss.  It is making a loss and it will continue to make losses unless the general reorganisation which the Government contemplates and to which Mr. Reynolds referred at the annual meeting is successfully carried out.  I cannot even guarantee that the efforts to accomplish that reorganisation will be successful but I can guarantee they will be made.  Clearly, the service cannot be saved at all without the full cooperation of the employees of the company. The heavy wage bill which the company is meeting must represent value received by it.  If the organisation cannot be put on a paying basis then clearly the livelihoods of the workers who are at present in its service are in jeopardy.  They will remain in jeopardy until the successful reorganisation which the Government and Mr. Reynolds contemplate has been given effect to.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The present financial position of the company is very serious.  Apart altogether from the major issues of policy to which Deputy Davin referred, I want to direct the attention of the House to the conditions created by the present emergency for that company. The rates charged for traffic have not been increased since the beginning of the war.  With the rising cost of operation, and the heavy additional expenditure involved for the company in consequence of the bonus Orders made for its employees, it is clear that a higher revenue must be secured.  The anticipated revenue of the company <Col N="575" /> for the present year will not meet its working cost.  Clearly, therefore, powers must be given to the company to increase its rates to such an extent and in such a manner as will enable greater revenue to be earned.  It is obvious to people who are familiar with our transport problem that, in respect of some traffic, higher rates cannot be imposed, because the imposition of higher rates would not result in higher earnings, but to whatever extent it is possible to modify the exceptional rates now in existence so as to secure a greater revenue for the company, in order to meet the wages of employees and the cost of operation, the necessary powers will have to be conferred.</P>
    <P>On the general question of railway policy, I merely want to say that I recognise that the efforts made, wholehearted though they were, to save the railways of the country by the legislation of earlier years, have proved insufficient. It is clear that we must go further than that.  I think that we should not wait until after the end of the war to begin the process of reorganisation. It is necessary, in my opinion, that the process of reorganisation should be begun earlier.  As Mr. Reynolds intimated to the company at the annual meeting, reorganisation proposals are at present being worked out and will in due course be completed. If it should be my function, they will then be prepared in the form of legislation for submission to the Dáil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Library is the right place for it.  Deputy Dockrell referred to the question of post-war policy. He asked that some indication should be given of what the post-war policy was to be, so that traders could establish contacts with manufacturers and exporters in other countries and make their plans in the light of anticipated circumstances here.  I am sure that Deputy Dockrell and other Deputies appreciate the difficulty of prescribing a policy for the post-war period in any detail at present.  The post-war conditions, in relation to which that policy will have to be prepared, cannot at present be visualised.</P>
      <P>Upon the outcome of hostilities, upon the course of events which will lead to the cessation of hostilities, will depend the shape of the post-war world.  None of us can at present attempt to forecast what form it will take, what international relations in that period will be, or in what circumstances international trade will be carried on.  It seemed to me, however, that Deputy Dockrell was looking more for information as to the prospective tariff policy of the Government than as to its post-war industrial programme.  During the war, because of the circumstances created by the war, a very large number of tariffs and other restrictions upon imports have been suspended. I ask Deputies to note the word &ldquo;suspended&rdquo;.  They have not been removed.  By Emergency Powers Orders of limited duration they have been put out of operation.  On the expiration of the period mentioned in each Order they will automatically come back into operation again.  It will then be for the Government responsible for national affairs at the time to decide whether it is desirable to continue them, to modify them, or to remove them.  I may say I am convinced that, unless we restart our industrialisation drive as early as possible after the conclusion of hostilities, we will condemn ourselves to another period of stagnation and retrogression from which it may take us a long time to recover.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="577" /> Deputy Dockrell gave us an example of the point he wanted to raise.  He gave as an illustration the position in respect of fabricated steel. He said steel cannot be obtained now, and he asked if it can be obtained at the end of the war, will we import it fabricated for use or in its raw state for fabrication here.  In my opinion, there is no possibility of the Government considering the importation of fabricated steel or other fabricated articles which could be adapted for use, fabricated in the form required, by our own workers in this country.  It is my belief also that, unless we start off on that basis, we will lose ground very rapidly, ground which we may not be able to recover. Clearly, therefore, in so far as I can meet Deputy Dockrell's request for information concerning post-war policy at all, I must indicate that, in general principle, if the people of the country and the House follow the advice of the present Government, it will be similar to that operated before the war.  It will be designed to secure that the maximum degree of manufacture will be carried out in this country by our own workers, and that we should limit our imports to the raw materials which cannot be provided from our own resources.  I recognise that abnormal conditions will prevail for a long time after the conclusion of the war, and that we may not be able to get the materials we require in the form that we require them, but I think it is far more likely that we will get unfabricated material than fabricated material, because the productive capacity of the main industrial countries will have been seriously impaired, and their own requirements will probably involve the full utilisation of whatever productive capacity remains to them.</P>
    <P>There is one other point with which I want to deal before I conclude. Deputy Dillon raised again this old issue which he has raised on previous occasions, the maintenance of restrictions upon the importation of certain goods since the outbreak of the war.  I know that Deputy Dillon is unable to distinguish in his own mind between the maintenance of legal restrictions upon imports and the refusal to take <Col N="578" /> goods which are available.  He appears to think, in so far as we have maintained quotas in operation, or licensing systems in respect of the import of certain goods, that that meant we were refusing goods.  That has never happened. While a very large number of quota Orders and tariff Orders has been suspended, others have been retained. They have been retained for a good reason.  They have been retained because the Government believes that their retention will facilitate rather than impede us in getting supplies at the present time.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It did.  In fact, in respect of some classes of goods from which all forms of control were removed, we had to reimpose them in order to confine the in-flow of the goods concerned to the traders who normally engage in the handling of those goods.  Those restrictions were designed to eliminate the speculators who always emerge in times of scarcity for the purpose of trading, to their own profit, in the goods that are scarce.  The maintenance of those restrictions upon import was designed to secure that the limited supply available would be diverted into the channels of legitimate trade, and not become merely the raw materials of another black market.  Deputy Dillon, I know, has always failed to appreciate that fact.  He never has been able to understand that the Government's policy is based upon the intelligent application of principles to certain circumstances, rather than on vague generally-worded <i>cliches</i> such as he resorts to, and consequently he cannot face up to those realities at all.  It is untrue to say that any substantial quantity of goods has been lost to this country by reason of the maintenance of those restrictions.  It is far more true to say that the importation of available supplies was greatly facilitated <Col N="579" /> by them.  As the House is well aware, in respect of the most essential goods, we had in fact to set up special central purchasing organisations in order to explore fully the possibilities of external markets, and of preventing prices being driven up against ourselves through competitive buying for limited supplies by one Irish trader against another.  However, I think it is a useless task to try to teach Deputy Dillon sense, and I will not continue it further.</P>
      <P>Those were the main points raised in the discussion, and I do not propose to say anything more.  While, in moving the Estimate, I dealt with all the subsidiary Estimates for the Department, I do not think any point was raised concerning those subsidiary Estimates which requires a reply from me at this stage.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a leading question which I could not answer by a &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or &ldquo;no&rdquo;.  In the preparation of proposals for legislation relating to transport the Government will naturally take into full account the representations made by persons who are familiar with the operation of transport services.  Mr. Reynolds, as the Government nominee upon the Board of the Great Southern Railways Company, will, of course, have special influence in the determination of policy.  The directors of the Great Northern Railway Company are also formulating their views and, similarly, the directors of other transport concerns will have an opportunity of submitting any ideas that they wish to have considered.  All transport interests in the country will in fact be given full opportunity of having their representations taken into account before final decisions upon details of legislation are made.  When the legislation comes to the Dáil, the Government bringing it will take full responsibility for it and will not try to pass that responsibility on to any individual whatsoever.</P>

In so far as there is a loss being sustained, clearly the added traffic being carried involves reconsideration of the subsidy.

      <P>It has been brought to my notice that they are being disqualified from the receipt of unemployment assistance and unemployment insurance benefit if they refuse to take a direction from the manager of the local labour exchange to walk seven miles to, and seven miles from, their work.  I think that is an outrageous type of regulation to have in operation.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to get from the Deputy the circumstances of that kind of case, because I can hardly believe that any unemployment assistance officer would deem work which was seven miles away from the residence of an applicant to be reasonably available to him, except in special circumstances.  In any event, an applicant has the right of appeal to the court of referees, and, in many cases, the court of referees has ruled in favour of applicants in present circumstances. It is clear, of course, that all conditions must be taken into account, including, perhaps, the difficulty of obtaining cycle tyres or other purely emergency conditions.  As the Deputy knows, the law is that an applicant is entitled to refuse work which is too far away from his home, having regard to the circumstances of the area in which he lives, his physical condition, and all other relevant circumstances.</P>

      <P>I have personal knowledge of a case which occurred quite recently.  It was an outrageous case. I did not believe the story when I was told it, but I happen to know the man concerned personally.  It occurred in my native parish.  As I say, I know the man, and I know the circumstances, and I am raising the matter to get the point of view of the Minister.  The Minister must realise that it is an unreasonable labour exchange regulation to compel people who are willing to engage in turf-cutting operations to travel on foot seven miles to their work and seven miles home.  This man was told that he would have to take up work which was seven miles away from his home.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>To show that the man was not a shirker, he went there.  It was a wet morning, and all he had was one hour's work, and then had to walk home seven miles.  I am sure that the Minister will see reason in this matter. What I am trying to get from him is a rule for the guidance of labour exchange managers.  The regulation to which I referred should not, I suggest, be operated when, say, distances of from three to five miles have to be travelled.  I have been asked to impress on the Minister the necessity for issuing an instruction that a regulation of the kind in force should not be operated to the disadvantage of workers where the distance to be travelled is over three miles, and where workers are unable to get cycle tyres to carry them to their work, or other proper transport.  If transport were provided by the Department to carry a group of people seven miles to their work, I would not have raised this matter.</P>
      <P>I am sure the Minister has had cases of this kind brought to his notice.  I remember that Deputy Norton referred to one case in Athy area, where the labour exchange officials declined to pay unemployment insurance benefit to a person who would have to travel over five miles to work.  There should be some fixed reasonable distance agreed upon.  I am raising this case, which may be an exceptional one, where I consider the Department acted unreasonably, for the purpose of getting the Minister to look into the matter, and to issue some instructions dealing with the position of men who refuse to take work where the distance to be travelled is unreasonable, so that they will not be deprived of the right to receive payment of unemployment benefit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy, I am sure, is aware of the limit put on my functions by the Act itself.  Determination of the question whether an applicant is unable to obtain work is, in the first instance, a matter for the unemployment assistance officers, and, on appeal <Col N="592" /> for the court of referees.  I have no function in relation to individual cases.  In my opinion a person who had to walk seven miles to work would be entitled to refuse it, and still be eligible to draw unemployment assistance.  I am, however, expressing that as a personal opinion.  I feel certain that unemployment assistance officers and courts of referees through the country share that opinion. I cannot say if there might not be exceptional circumstances in the case referred to and that the unemployment assistance officers, or the court of referees, might be aware of the fact that the individual had a bicycle which had temporarily disappeared, or that there were some other circumstances which they were entitled to take into account including the employment record of the applicant.  In the case that the Deputy refers to, where the applicant was seeking work and anxious to get it, I think it would be an unreasonable thing to ask him to walk seven miles there and back every day, and if he declined to do so, that would not, I think, debar him from unemployment assistance.  The decision, however, in individual cases is made not by me but by the unemployment assistance officers and the courts of referees.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am sure the Deputy is familiar with the circumstances under which that limitation was imposed <Col N="594" /> in the original Unemployment Assistance Act.  I am not sure if the Chair will hold that we are in order in discussing the provisions of such legislation now, but it was felt, when the Unemployment Assistance Act was being introduced, that if it made provision for the payment of unemployment assistance to all single women who could prove unemployment, a very large number would come on the register, who would not need State assistance, and the total cost of the scheme would be expanded enormously. It was, therefore, decided to confine unemployment assistance in respect to women to those who had been in employment, and who could prove from the records that they were of the type which normally followed industrial employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not asking that that should be changed.  I am dealing now with the very cases the Minister said he meant to cover.  When they get employment after drawing the dole for a couple of months and are again thrown on the unemployed list, the 52 stamps to their credit for the period previous to drawing the dole will not stand for the second period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They must have a recent history of industrial employment. It is a well-known fact that girls leave employment for other reasons than inability to continue. They leave in order to be married, or in the hope of being married, or for a variety of reasons.  It is only to those who are regularly and normally dependent on industrial employment for a livelihood that the scheme applies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>I suggest that the Minister consult the local managers of labour exchanges or the chairmen of the courts of referees.  They are continually talking about that disability of the Act in those particular cases.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JohnMcCann" hpid="Mr. McCann Mr. McCann">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McCann</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one point I would like to raise in connection with the cessation of unemployment insurance. I wonder if it could be arranged that, when unemployment insurance ceases, the unemployment assistance certificate could be issued <Col N="595" /> immediately, so that payment would be made on that day.  At the moment, there is a great deal of overlapping, and three or four weeks may elapse between the time a man would have ceased to draw unemployment insurance and the time he receives the unemployment assistance payments.  In the meantime, he has to go to the local relief office, he is thrown on the Dublin Board of Assistance, and when his unemployment assistance payments come through he has to repay what he drew from the relief office, and it goes back into the Unemployment Assistance Fund.  I think the Minister will agree that there is a great deal of overlapping.  There is a double cost of administration and, apart from the trouble and indignity which the individual suffers in some cases, if it could possibly be arranged that, when unemployment insurance ceases, the unemployment assistance certificate would become operative immediately, there would be a saving in cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Normally, the concern of the officers of my Department would be to see that there was no undue delay in the disposal of cases; but it is as much the function of the Department to see that persons who are not entitled do not benefit as it is to see that those who are entitled do get the benefit.  I take it that that is a very important function.  The Labour Party Deputies are sometimes inclined to minimise the dangers to the development of the social services, arising out of the knowledge amongst the public that abuses of them are practised.  If there is to be a proper public attitude to social services, it is necessary to ensure that abuses are minimised.  It is, therefore, necessary for the officers of my Department administering the Unemployment Assistance Act to take regular and periodic steps to ensure that nobody is receiving unemployment assistance but those entitled to do so under the terms of the Act.  That occasions delay, but it is the duty of the officers, and it is my concern, to see that that delay is cut to the minimum in individual cases, so that hardship will be avoided for the applicant.</P>

      <P>In the application of the Employment Period Order to land valuations, there is a clause whereby anybody over £2 valuation on land is not entitled to receive unemployment assistance during the currency of the Period Order.  In some cases, although the valuation is in the name of one person, it may actually be a valuation on land which is owned by two, it may be a joint tenancy or a tenancy in common; but the unemployment assistance officers always credit the full amount of the valuation to the man whose name appears in the rating authorities' books.  Very often hardship is caused thereby, and I would like the Minister to bring that to the attention of the Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister still satisfied that the means test is applied correctly in these unemployment assistance cases?  That is one of the cases that could be made for recasting social services.  I know unemployed men who sometimes have to go to two or three Departments of State in a week to get their benefits. I think that Deputy McCann mentioned, in supporting me some time ago, that it was terrible to think that unemployed men should try to exist on 10/6 a week.  It is most inhuman to expect men of 50 or 55, who have been cast off from employment, to exist and provide food, clothing and shelter for themselves on 10/6 plus a voucher, which is value for 1/9 or 1/10.  It is time that this House, whoever the Government may be, should seriously consider its attitude towards people of that kind.</P>

      <P>The Minister has emergency powers, and these people have not got any increase on the 10/6 since the war started.  Take a person outside the city areas, who is getting only 6/-a week.  I have known such cases and have communicated with the Minister on the case of a man with four dependent children.  He went across to England to work, at the age of 66, and was sent back.  Then his son went across and, because he sent him £2 a fortnight, he was cut off.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <P>If the Minister looks up the files, he will find the case of a man with ten children, four of whom were in the Army or Navy or were married and settled down.  One of the others&mdash;the seventh son&mdash;went across to England and sent £3 in a fortnight to his mother and father, who were drawing the dole.  Because of that, they were cut off the dole.  I have written letters to the Department regarding it. It is unfair that, when such a man's son goes across to England, and helps his mother and father, they should be denied their right to get even the 29/-a week, which they were getting.  I could quote a case for the Minister of a man who went across at the age of 66 and, because he was getting 8/- a week pension, he was only allowed 1/6, or something like that, from the labour exchange, through the working of the means test.  I suggest to the Minister that we cannot stand here in this House and say that we are legislating in a Christian manner, while we are penalising these citizens in that way. Deputy McCann gave cases of men in hostels.  I know cases in hostels in Cork City, where they are being supported and where they are getting only 10/6 a week to feed and clothe themselves. You cannot get a bed in a Salvation Army Hostel with a cup of tea in the morning for less than 10d. a night.  What has a man left to keep clothes on him after that?  Some of these men have given service up to 50 <Col N="599" /> or 55 in industry, but they are not wanted any longer and they are thrown on the scrap-heap, with the 10/6 per week.</P>

      <P>There is the whole difficulty. If you have to apply a means test, you will come up continually against these cases of hardship outlined by Deputies. I do not often sympathise with the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but I sympathise with him in his difficulties in administering the question of the means test.  I think a means test is an obnoxious and detestable thing in all circumstances.  I say quite deliberately that I do not believe <Col N="600" /> that there is any Minister who can satisfactorily administer a means test, because it involves this detestable inquisition into the most intimate domestic details of a respectable man's family affairs.  But, if you charge public servants with protecting public funds and seeing that no penny of public money is given to a citizen of this State except on the conditions laid down by Oireachtas Eireann, you cannot blame these public servants if, in the discharge of their duty, they conscientiously make the inquiries necessary to establish whether that money is handled in accordance with the terms laid down by the Oireachtas. There is no use in blaming them for putting into effect the legislation that we have passed.  If you have a means test, the persons charged with the administration of it must make inquiries.</P>
      <P>We know that public servants, when they come in contact with the public, will find that possibly 70 or 80 per cent. of the public will answer truly the interrogatories put to them.  But there is a minority of cute boys who will do all they can to pull the wool over the eyes of public servants.  How is a public servant in any individual case to know whether he is dealing with one of the 70 per cent. of honest persons or with one of the 30 per cent. of dishonest persons?  He is obliged to protect the public funds and must answer to the Comptroller and Auditor-General if he fails.  If he allows one single man to get from him public money that, under the terms of the legislation passed by this House, the man was not meant to get, that case will be mentioned by the Comptroller and Auditor-General to the Committee of Public Accounts and the officer who permitted the money to be paid irregularly will be called upon to account to the Committee of Public Accounts for his failure to correctly discern the truth of the person's circumstances before the payment was made.  In these circumstances, you are bound to have what I agree with Deputy Hickey is a detestable system of interrogation and inquisition.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If you want to abolish the means test, yes.  I am trying to explain that, having a means test, we ought to be slow to stigmatise too harshly public servants who appear to be unduly harsh, but who are merely forced into what is to them extremely disagreeable work.  They are merely carrying out what we stipulated for them.  I have no doubt that the Minister and his Department would sooner go open-handedly to the assistance of persons whom Deputy Hickey describes, and to whose assistance all of us would wish to go.  It is pitiable that a man, who through no fault of his own is unemployed, has to see his children hungry.  But public servants are not heartless bloodhounds.  I have no doubt that, to them, the task of declining assistance in these cases of apparent hardship is a nightmare, and that it would be much easier for them to administer these eleemosynary schemes if no means test were annexed to them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to make this concrete suggestion for the equitable amendment of the existing means test.  The means test applies to a great deal of legislation, to old age pensions, blind persons, widows and orphans pensions, unemployment assistance, and a variety of other eleemosynary schemes of that kind.  The Minister is responsible only for the application of the means test in regard to unemployment assistance. But there is a common rule accepted by all parties that they assess whatever income the beneficiary actually has without adverting carefully to the source from which he gets it, and the circumstances under which he gets it. I suggest to the Minister that a correct application of the means test, and still as equitable an application of the means test as is possible, would be to say that only those means to which the beneficiary has a legal right should be taken into consideration.  I think it is entirely wrong, if a man has a family of children, some of whom go abroad and send home to the parents £1 this week, £5 next week, and 10/- the following week, that that should be taken into consideration for the purpose of assessing the beneficiary's means.  Far from barring children or relatives from supporting their own people or families <Col N="602" /> we ought to encourage them to send home as much as possible to help their parents to maintain their younger brothers and sisters, and say that it will not interfere with their rights under the social services here.  We ought to encourage neighbours or friends who are in a position to help voluntarily other people, by telling them that, no matter what they send, we will not concern ourselves with it, that the right of the beneficiary to receive statutory benefit will continue. But, if you have a means test and it emerges that a person has become a beneficiary under a will or an irrevocable deed under which he is entitled to claim by law a weekly income of 10/-or 15/-, how can you ignore that, if we of Oireachtas Eireann have imposed a means test?</P>
    <P>Personally, I would be in favour of abolishing all means tests.  I admit that that would give rise to inequalities. But, bearing in mind the disadvantages of abolishing all means tests in connection with social services and the disadvantages and the inevitable hardships that must arise in border-line cases if you are to administer any means test, I would prefer to endure the inconveniences and even the evils which might arise as a result of there being no means test.  We have to debate this Estimate on the assumption that there is a means test and, therefore. I suggest an equitable amendment of the present system of administration. I would urge that you should ignore the fortuitous income of a claimant under the social services, and that you should withhold benefit only where it was clearly brought home to the mind of the Minister that the person had a claim enforceable by law to the income in respect of which he was credited for the purpose of abating the sum which he would otherwise receive under the social service under review.</P>
    <P>There are two other matters which I want to raise.  They are related, not to unemployment assistance, but to the administration of the Employment Office.  In doing that I want to speak of things as I know them.  I want to pay a tribute to the Minister and his Department for the courteous forbearance with which they examine <Col N="603" /> every individual case brought to their notice.  It has often been a source of amazement to me how the Minister, with the immense number of communications which he must receive in connection with these cases, can find time to give attention to individual representations made on behalf of individuals desiring to get away to Great Britain for work.  Any case I have ever brought to the Department has been fully investigated, and I felt that the man got a fair run for his money.  But, I do not think it is right that those individuals who get in touch with T.D.'s should, in fact, get a better run for their money than the average run of the mill.  Therefore, I press upon the Minister the necessity for simplifying the ritual which has to be gone through if a man wants to go to Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I find that the strangest inequalities arise, in which a boy living in a house on the side of the road will be released to go to England without any trouble, while his neighbour in exactly similar circumstances is prevented on the ground that he is an agricultural labourer and that the Minister will not give permission to agricultural labourers to go to England.  That arises from the attempt of the Department to administer the Minister's regulation relating to the export of agricultural labour and it seems to me that the thing has broken down absurdly.  Any boy who can produce a national health insurance card, or who can manufacture evidence that he has been working in a job here, gets away on the ground that he is not an agricultural labourer, while some fellow who has not the cuteness to do that finds himself irrevocably prevented from going.  Note this well, that if his name once gets on the record, if a file is once opened for him in the Department in which he has been found to be an agricultural labourer, all the King's horses and all the King's men will not get him going.</P>
    <P>I have made several efforts to understand what the exact nature of the regulations is, but I cannot get clear in my mind what the conditions are.  I recently had a case of a man from Inniskeen, in the Dundalk area, who <Col N="604" /> said he had spent the greater part of his life as a docker on the Liverpool quays.  He came home and worked for a while on his brother's place, knocking around and giving a helping hand here and there.  He wanted to go back to Liverpool and resume his career as a docker, but he was informed that as he was an agricultural labourer he would not be allowed go.  I have seen other cases of boys and girls going to the labour exchanges to which a letter, secured from an employer in England and stamped in the labour exchange in England, had been forwarded.  I am thinking of one case in the Castlerea Labour Exchange in County Roscommon. When the persons who wanted to go to England went to Castlerea, they were told the letter was there, but that the exchange would not stamp it and that they ought to get a letter from a T.D.  What the meaning of that was I could not make out.</P>
    <P>I thought the first person who said that to me had invented it and I rather discounted it, but shortly afterwards other boys and girls came to me who had been told that they ought to get a letter from a T.D.  What effect a letter from a T.D. could have in changing their status I cannot imagine.  I gave one girl a letter setting out her circumstances as I knew them.  It was the case of a girl under 22 whose father was in England.  I was in a position to say that the father had come to me before he went and said that he desired the girl to go and that he would look after her there. I do not know what the issue of that case was, but why on earth should they have to get a letter from a T.D.? Deputy Mícheál Cleary, who has an office in Ballaghaderreen, Deputy O'Rourke, a representative of County Roscommon living near that area, and I, who reside in Ballaghaderreen, were the only three people to whom any person attending Castlerea Exchange could reasonably have access, although of course they might have written to the Minister for Justice or Deputy Brennan, but what a T.D. was supposed to say in the letter, I could not find out, and none of them could tell me, so that in connection with this whole business of getting away to England if you want to work there, I <Col N="605" /> am obliged to say that the regulations seem to be extremely confusing, more especially when you bear in mind that having succeeded in getting a travel permit from the authorities in Eire, the person in question has then to get a visa from the visa authorities in Great Britain.</P>
    <P>I understand that this business about the letter coming from the labour exchange in England to the exchange in Eire is really not anything of our doing, but that it is imposed on us by the British authorities. They require that regulation because they will not allow anybody in to work in England who has not got authority to go there from the British labour exchanges, but the regulations relating to refusal to allow certain classes of persons to go to England is a matter purely of our own doing.  I have also had cases of boys who were 21½ years who will not be allowed to go on the ground that they are under 22.  I recognise that, no matter what age is fixed, there will be that difficulty of the border-line case, but why did we light on the age of 22?  Any one who lives in the West of Ireland and is familiar with conditions of migratory labour well knows that boys going to labour in England, particularly if they are going to farms on which their fathers used to labour in the past, normally began going when they were 18 or 19 years.  What is the point of imposing this restriction on boys of 20, 21 and 22 going to work there?</P>
    <P>It is true that a good many fellows will go to England attracted by the high wages, but might it not be a reasonable qualification of the regulations that nobody under 22 would be allowed to go without his or her parents' consent?  Personally, I think it is an unreasonable restriction to prohibit a man of over 21 from going to Great Britain, if he wants to. Might I suggest to the Minister that a more reasonable system would be to provide that no person under 16 would be allowed to go at all; that no person between 16 and 21 would be allowed to go without the written consent of his or her parents; and that, all other things being equal, anybody over 21 would be allowed to go?  In regard to <Col N="606" /> this business of the necessity for conserving agricultural labour, I recognise the difficulty, but, in all conscience, I ask the House, if the community wants to keep a man here at home to do essential work, are we entitled to impose upon him a minimum wage of 36/-per week, when by crossing the Irish Sea or the Border into Northern Ireland he could readily earn up to £5 per week?  What equity or justice is there in that?  If we are going to force people to stay in this country to do essential work for the community, the community ought to take steps to subsidise their wages to bring them into closer conformity with the rate of pay they could earn if they were allowed to go abroad.</P>
    <P>Lastly, I want to put this case to the Minister.  I have had letters from men who appeared to have exceptional tradesmen's qualifications and who could not get work.  Are we to assume that if a man who has that kind of qualification writes to the Department of Industry and Commerce, that Department will undertake to help him to get work in this country?  I have known cases where men were not anxious to get away; they preferred to work at home, but they could not get a job at home.  These people were living in country towns and there was no demand for their services, no work of the kind they were capable of doing. Does the Department of Industry and Commerce undertake, in cases of that kind, to find suitable employment for these men, albeit in another part of the country, and, if so, what is the procedure to be pursued by persons in those circumstances?</P>
    <P>I have made two or three concrete suggestions and I have made one complaint&mdash;that is, the allegation that the manager of the Castlerea Labour Exchange asked individuals to get a letter from a T.D.  Maybe there is nothing in that; maybe what the labour exchange manager said was &ldquo;Get a letter from a responsible person in order to certify as to your circumstances&rdquo;.  If that was the nature of the request, then there could be no objection to it; that would be a perfectly legitimate form of inquiry to help in the administration of the Act <Col N="607" /> and there is nothing to be criticised or condemned.  But if, on the other hand, there was any implication that without the influence of a certain political Party an individual would not get the same consideration as he would get if he had such influence, then that is quite another cup of tea and it is a matter that would require very close examination.</P>
    <P>I am not quite satisfied that, in the area to which I refer, that interpretation was not put on the advice that was given.  I am not satisfied that a great many young persons did not interpret that counsel to mean that they would be well advised to get a letter from this or that T.D.  I know that at the time in question some Government T.D.'s were saying on public platforms that they would be glad to help all and sundry to get away to England if they wanted to go. It may have been the purest coincidence.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister shocked by the suggestion that Government Deputies said they would be glad to help their constituents to get to England if they wanted to go there? Why, one Deputy was greatly admired for saying it.  If the Minister has the slightest doubt on the matter, will he cause inquiries to be made in County Mayo?  If he does, I do not think they would tell him in any spirit of resentment&mdash;rather would they be prepared to tell him with admiration&mdash;that here was a Deputy who was busying himself about the welfare of his constituents.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If there was any connection between <Col N="608" /> those two things, the statement of Government Deputies on public platforms and the counsel given to individual applicants at the Castlerea Labour Exchange, it is a matter for close examination.  If, on the other hand, the manager of the labour exchange was merely seeking local reports as to the suitability of an applicant, that was a reasonable thing to do; but I think it would be well if the labour exchange people would amend the form of their suggestions.  They might say that if they got a letter from the parish priest or the local sergeant of the Guards, it would help.</P>

These people are defenceless and they require protection.

I should like the Minister to give us some information regarding the working of the special register of agricultural and turf workers.  The Estimate provides for an increase of £56,000 under sub-head J (2).  What is the total number of persons whose names are included on the most recent register?  Of that total number will he say the number of married men and single men whose names are included on the register?  In the case of a married man whose name is included on the register does the Minister reserve to himself, under the regulations made by his Department, the right to order a married man to travel a long distance to take up agricultural work or turf-cutting operations and, if so, is that being done under cover of an arrangement whereby the man concerned gets 5/- a week for having his name placed on that register?  Are the regulations applied to married men whose names are on the register in the same way as they are applied to single men?  In any case, I should like to have some information from the Minister as to the total number on the register, and some explanation of the increase of £56,000 provided under sub-head J (2).</P>

They get an extra 5/- over and above the standard rate of unemployment assistance.

      <P>No.  So far as the determination of the means of applicants for unemployment assistance is concerned, the rules under which the Department operates are laid down in the statute.  It is true that there is set up under the Statute an authority to apply these rules.  The appropriate officers, who are, in fact, officers of the Department of Finance, assess the means in the first instance.  The applicant has the right of appeal, from the decision of these officers, to the Appeals Committee.  That committee has made certain decisions.  It is not true that every source of income of an applicant for unemployment assistance is included as means.  While it would be impracticable to limit the definition of means to any means to which a person is legally entitled, the practice has been to confine the calculation of means to income of which an applicant is reasonably certain.  Casual contributions from relatives or other sources are not taken into account.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  Deputy Hickey referred to the case of a family with members over in England contributing to the cost of maintaining the family.  I should be glad to have particulars of this case, and if the position is precisely as the Deputy stated, then the attitude which has been adopted appears to be contrary, not merely to my instructions but to the rules of the Appeals Committee.  The Deputy may take it that casual contributions received by families are not taken into account in assessing means.  The means have to be assessed in advance, and they are not varied from week to week. <Col N="612" /> There is a determination of means for the purpose of marking the qualifications of the applicants, and it may be years before a person's means would be re-assessed.  The consideration there is that there may be a change in the person's position.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHickey" hpid="Mr. Hickey Mr. Hickey">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hickey</NameTxt>
      <P>My point is that if he gets, say, £20 in the first three months of the year, £10 in the second three months, and so on, making an average of £1 a week, or £51 for the whole year, he gets nothing at all.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy is misinformed. I do not want to say that that has not happened in an individual case, but so far as I recollect, at any rate, the application of the rules in connection with a decision by the Appeals Committee is done in a different manner.  So far as the emigrants are concerned, the rules made by the Government preclude the emigration of persons under 22 years of age except in special circumstances.  Now, it may be that in order to determine whether special circumstances exist in the case of an applicant under 22 years of age the local officer of the Department would advise the applicant to produce evidence from a responsible person in the locality that such special circumstances did exist.  That is the only circumstance I can contemplate under which a letter from a Deputy might be requested.  The normal practice is to require support for the applicant's own statement of his means from a parish priest, a Civic <Col N="613" /> Guard or some other responsible person. On the basis, then, of the special circumstances being shown to exist, travel facilities are given or are not given, as the case may be.</P>
      <P>The decision to restrict the emigration of persons under 22 years of age was arrived at on many grounds.  It was felt that in the case of young men it could not be said that there was no work available for them.  The Army, for instance, is willing to take all the recruits it can get, if they are physically fit, and the Construction Corp is also looking for recruits.  Where a person shows that he has been rejected for the Army on medical grounds, or that he has served a period in the Army and was discharged under circumstances not due to his own fault, then it would be held that special circumstances existed and facilities would be given to him if required.  In the case of agricultural workers it is, of course, necessary to determine the circumstances of individual applicants in relation to the known facts.  Some manage successfully to conceal the facts and obtain facilities to which they are not entitled on that account. The decision to restrict the emigration of such people was due to the difficulties of the current year in maintaining the full labour needs of these industries, and that decision coincided with the establishment of the special register to which I have referred.  The person who is debarred from emigrating on the ground that he is an agricultural worker or a turf worker can secure for himself, if he so wishes, the benefits of membership of the special register.  It has to be assumed that such a person, since he is quite willing to travel to another country to work, should be willing also to travel to places in his own country to work, and if he is on the special register here he will get the benefits to which I have referred, as well as being reasonably certain of procuring employment.  I do not know if there was any other point raised upon the Vote, which is a matter of administration, that I need refer to at this stage.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Dáil passed an Act which established a board and it gave that board certain functions and powers.  The Minister is not responsible for the manner in which the board discharges these functions or uses these <Col N="617" /> powers.  On occasion, there may be special Votes to enable the board to carry out the financing of particular schemes.  If and when such grants are sought, then the content of these schemes will be open to discussion here but the general policy of the board is a matter for the board to determine in accordance with the guiding principles laid down in the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If my recollection serves, when that Bill was being passed and when autonomy was being conferred on this board, it was emphasised that, annually, there would be an Estimate for the board in connection with which we should have a review of the activities of the board so as to enable us to determine whether their activities during the preceding 12 months were such as would justify us in giving a grant-in-aid for the next 12 months.  I suggest that one thing the board might do, in addition to their routine work, would be to make some provision for those of our tourists who come from home. I do not want to criticise adversely the efforts of the board to make our resorts more attractive to the foreign visitor. The board is perfectly right to try to improve hotel facilities and to provide additional attractions at our resorts so as to induce persons from abroad to spend their holidays here.  But, in addition to that work, the board might very well consider the claims of the slum children in this city, Cork and other cities.  I am particularly thinking of the slum children in the City of Dublin.  The limit of their tourism will not bring them far beyond Bray to the south, or Portmarnock to the north. They cannot afford to go much further. There we have one of the finest coastlines in the world.  If those were in any other country&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It took a long time to dig that out of you.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is time it was published <Col N="618" /> to Dáil Eireann.  May I proceed now to dig more information out of the Minister?  I am glad to hear that Portmarnock is to be attended to.  All we have to Portmarnock is a railway but, from Dublin to Dalkey, we have also the tram and there is a long seacoast from Merrion, by Seapoint and Blackrock, to Killiney, ready for development for the accommodation of the poor children of this city.  I make no apology for repeating for the third or fourth time in this House that, in New York, you have the great beach scheme of Mr. Moses, the Park Commissioner of the city.  In Sydney, the beaches, which have been developed by the municipality, are the talk of the whole world.  I have been on both and I say quite deliberately that we have resources here, along the coast between here and Bray, which, if developed, would provide amenities which would compare favourably with anything achieved by Commissioner Moses or the municipality of the City of Sydney. The development of these amenities is a work the preliminaries of which could conveniently be put in hand at the present time because they would involve a large amount of manual labour without the necessity for the importation of foreign raw material.  On various Votes, I have directed the attention of various Ministers, including the Minister for Finance when he was Minister for Local Government, to the desirability of getting ahead with this work.  Why cannot we get ahead with it?  Why will not the Minister urge on the Irish Tourist Board to get ahead with it?  It is extremely difficult to foresee, with any degree of certainty, the type of tourist traffic we may expect from abroad post-war.  It would be more profitable to be making preparations now for the class of tourists we know are available at the moment and will be available for a considerable time in the future&mdash;the residents of our own city&mdash;than for the tourist from abroad.  Post-war travel may be extremely restricted for a considerable time.  I do not know whether people will come to this country for many a long day after the war is over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the time comes for the resumption of free travel and the desire to <Col N="619" /> travel for amusement returns to the world, we may find ourselves with a class of tourist quite different from those we have in view and for whom such plans as are at present in contemplation by the Irish Tourist Board are designed.  I would plead for a development scheme now which would provide not only great amenities, but would confer great benefits from the point of view of public health, schemes the essential requirements of which can be exactly forecast, schemes which can be undertaken forthwith because the necessary raw materials are available within our own territory.</P>
    <P>Why does the Minister seem to resent that?  Will he say, in justifying this allocation of money for the Irish Tourist Board, that he will direct their attention to the desirability of pressing forward with such schemes in the immediate vicinity of our cities, designed not for remote tourists, but for those whose circumstances constrain them to seek facilities not far from home?  If he does that we can vote this money with a clear conscience.  I am hoping that the Minister will indicate to the Tourist Board that it is the wish of the Oireachtas that such schemes should be pressed ahead.  Why cannot the Minister do that?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister in refusing to give any information, while asking the House for this Estimate, is not treating either himself or the House fairly, and he is certainly not treating the Tourist Board in the way it deserves to be treated.  It is known to me, at any rate, that a number of schemes have been presented to the Minister by the Irish Tourist Board for his approval, and that fact should be indicated by the Minister here without there being any necessity to drag the information out of him.  I understand that the details of schemes such as the Tramore scheme and the Portmarnock Strand development scheme had to be submitted by the Tourist Board to the Minister for his approval. If that is a fact, I think the House is entitled to hear from the Minister a little more about the schemes and the conditions on which they are to be <Col N="620" /> carried out, the conditions under which the land has been acquired, and the price paid for it.  The House and the country are entitled to have that information first-hand from the Minister, who is responsible for sanctioning these schemes.</P>
      <P>I know, for instance, and I raised the matter in another place, that the members of the Construction Corps have been employed in carrying out work of this kind in Tramore, and, presumably, it is intended to employ them also on the work at Portmarnock Strand.  When the Construction Corps was first formed, it was agreed generally by all Parties, across the floor of the House, I think&mdash;certainly it was mentioned at the Defence Conference&mdash;that members of the Construction Corps would not be employed on any work for which civilian labour was available, or on any State schemes or other schemes for which money was provided by the Minister for Finance.  Will the Minister say, in the case of the Portmarnock Strand development scheme, whether all the work will be carried out by members of the Construction Corps, and if so, the conditions under which members of the Corps will be employed on the work; whether there will be an appropriation-in-aid provided for the Department of Defence, the Department of Industry and Commerce, or under this particular Vote?  I would be concerned to know what is the intention in regard to the employment of members of the Construction Corps on the Portmarnock development scheme, because it is quite obvious that civilian labour is available within reasonable distance of that area.  I believe that such was not the case on the Tramore scheme, which was carried out by the Tourist Board.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As far as I know, the Tourist Board is doing very valuable national work and it is only right that the Minister should take advantage of an occasion of this kind to advertise to the people of this and other countries, the activities of the Tourist Board and to indicate, if he has any information on the point, what are the post-war development schemes of the Tourist Board.  I differ to some extent from Deputy Dillon as to the probability of <Col N="621" /> tourists coming to this country from abroad after the war.  At present we have a weekly influx of tourists, if you like to call them such, from the Six Counties, tourists who are gobbling up all the bacon and butter that they can get in the hotels of this city and leaving ordinary members of the community short of these commodities. It is well known that these tourists from the Six Counties during the past six or 12 months have got more of the butter produced in our creameries than ordinary members of the community here.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not know whether we would have such an influx of tourists from the Six Counties if the times were normal, but it is reasonable to expect that many tourists will be coming into this country after the war is over or when the emergency comes to an end.  In any event, perhaps the Minister in fairness to the chairman and members of the Tourist Board who have been doing a great deal of planning and carrying out a good deal of work, would give a little more information, because he gave us no information in his opening statement about their activities, and if possible give some indication of the post-war programme.  It is due to the members of the House who are asked to vote this money that some information of that kind should be gven.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Tourist Board was set up by an Act of the Dáil.  It has got certain powers and functions conferred on it by that Act, and it must be quite clear that it is the board, and not the Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is responsible for the exercise of these powers and the discharge of these functions.  If Deputies desire that that particular type of machinery should work efficiently and should be established in relation to other activities as well, they must be prepared to accept the position that the Minister for Industry and Commerce is not responsible and cannot be questioned concerning the details of the board's activities.  Deputy Dillon <Col N="622" /> suggested that the Tourist Board should be asked to undertake a development policy for resorts available to the inhabitants of this country. That is what the Tourist Board was set up for.  The Tourist Board was established for that precise purpose.  It was given certain powers and certain funds to be utilised for the development of holiday resorts of the country. It is not necessary for me to tell the board it has power to proceed with such works.  Deputy Dillon asked why I should resent his asking me to do that. I have a very unhappy recollection of the opposition offered by Deputy Dillon and his colleagues to the enactment of the Bill in 1939 and the many proposals then made that the scheme should be put into cold-storage for the duration of the war.</P>
      <P>I had to resist these proposals.  I felt that, while the activities of the board during the war period might be somewhat different from those originally contemplated, if a great deal of the preliminary work involved in the acquisition of land, the construction of roads, the clearing of sites and the removal of unsightly obstructions, were undertaken, the board could then emerge from the war period with a complete plan for holiday resort development, to exploit the amenities of the country.  A great part of the Act which was passed in 1939 has been inoperative&mdash;we had to make it inoperative because of the difficulties created by the war&mdash;but this business of planning resort development has not been merely proceeded with but the board has been specially urged by the Government to proceed with the utmost rapidity with the completion of plans for the development of holiday resorts in various parts of the country, to get those plans as far forward as possible, to have all legal difficulties removed, to have the land acquired where land has to be acquired, to have the necessary preparations made as far as possible, and to have the constructional work which is practicable under present circumstances, and with available materials, completed.  That has been done.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Portmarnock development, to <Col N="623" /> which reference has been made and which it is hoped will be proceeded with in the near future, is only the first stage of a much larger scheme of development which is not practicable in present circumstances.  Similar projects are in contemplation for other centres which are suitable for development for holiday resorts, and the board is in full activity at the moment in the preparation of plans for that purpose.  Plans prepared by the board are submitted for approval.  Now, let me be quite clear that the approval does not involve, on the part of the Minister for Industry and Commerce or his Department, examination of the details of the engineering or architectural aspects of the proposals.  The board, which is composed of competent persons, is in a position to employ competent technical advice, and it is assumed that the preparation of plans by the board is as efficiently done as it could be done.  We have to take account of the financial aspects of those proposals.  It is clear that, while the board would normally proceed upon the basis of recovering the capital expenditure incurred by it in the development of the resorts, and making each of its schemes a profit-earning one, it could not do that altogether if it proceeds on the lines I have indicated, that is, doing in advance of the time such work as land acquisition or preliminary development work, and some definite arrangements must be made to enable the board to offset the increased expenditure arising on that account, and to ensure that it will not be chargeable against the scheme as a whole.  The board can embark upon certain schemes which will be financed out of State funds.  It has been endowed with special capital sums to enable it to do its job, but, in the main, it is hoped that all the resort development schemes on which it embarks will prove to be profitable to the board.</P>
    <P>It is clear that, in the case, say, of the Tramore scheme, which involved the development of a large part of the waterfront at Tramore, the board could reasonably hope that all the land which is acquired in the immediate vicinity of the scheme will ultimately <Col N="624" /> appreciate in value, and that when sold by the board it will provide more than sufficient to cover, not merely the initial outlay on land, but the initial cost of the works which resulted in the appreciation of the value of the land. That is the principle on which the board operates.  Normally, it is thought that that principle will prove to be sound.  The intervention of the circumstances of the emergency, however, has created a situation in which the period during which it could have hoped to recover this expenditure is prolonged. A certain proportion of the expenditure will be unremunerative, in the sense that it would not be undertaken at all if purely commercial standards were applied&mdash;that is expenditure on developments which are being undertaken under pressure from the Government in view of the Government's anxiety to have causes of delay affecting the post-war development of those plans removed now, if possible.  The Minister for Finance is responsible for the financial provisions for the Tourist Board.  That falls within the Estimate for his Department.  This Grant-in-Aid to the board is made in accordance with the provisions of the Act to meet the administrative expenses of the organisation.</P>

      <P>I cannot answer that question.  The board has been asked to prepare schemes for every holiday resort in the country.  I do not say that it will be possible to cover every one of them.  There will be some of them which should get priority over others, but we have placed no limit on the capital involved in the schemes to be prepared.  We may at any time decide to proceed with certain schemes instead of others, having regard to the employment situation or other Government projects, but our anxiety is to have those schemes ready in all detail, and to have all the necessary preliminary steps taken to ensure that there will be no delay in proceeding with any of them when the time comes.</P>

      <P>That has nothing to do with me or with the Tourist Board.  It is a matter for the Minister for Defence; he is responsible for the circumstances in which the Construction Corps is employed.  He agreed to the request of the Tourist Board to utilise the construction Corps for the Tramore scheme, because the arrangement made by the board contemplated the employment of all available labour in the area.  The completion of the scheme, therefore, involved the bringing in of workers from other areas and the temporary housing of them there. It was decided to utilise the Construction Corps.  I cannot attempt to give any forecast as to what the circumstances will be at Portmarnock at the time when the construction work is to be done, but the undertaking given by the Government that the Construction Corps would never be employed in such a manner as to deprive other workers of the opportunity of work still holds good.</P>

The cost of that scheme is defrayed from Government funds, but it is a matter for the local authority itself whether or not to operate the scheme, or to whom it will apply.  It has nothing whatever to do with this Vote.  The vouchers which are given as a result of this Vote to persons in receipt of unemployment assistance are those who come under the national health insurance or widows' and orphans' pensions.

      <P>No.  The only persons who are in receipt of disablement benefit who are entitled to food vouchers are those who are resident in urban areas and who are in necessitous circumstances.  Not every person who is entitled to disablement benefit gets the food voucher.  There must be evidence of necessitous circumstances.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I understood that there was a period during which a considerable class of persons who should have come under D did not in fact get the vouchers.  It was then discovered an <Col N="629" /> error had been made, and the issue of the vouchers to that class of persons was embarked on.  Perhaps the Minister would inquire into that.  I was wondering what the reason for this was.  I was led to believe it was due to some misunderstanding between the National Health Insurance Society and the officers of the Minister's Department. I assume the misunderstanding has been cleared up now, but I would be glad to know from the Minister that he also is satisfied that no misunderstanding exists.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We are giving, I think, £200,000 by way of grant to the local authorities to enable them to cover the areas that cannot be covered.  One of the reasons, of course, why it was decided not to apply the food voucher scheme to rural areas was the fact that it could not be made to work along the same lines.  In the city the person who gets a voucher can get supplies of milk, bread and butter from the shop convenient to his home.  We could not guarantee to the person in the rural area that there was anybody there who was ordinarily trading, say, in milk, who would be prepared to give supplies for the vouchers.  For that reason, the arrangement was made with the local authorities.  So far as unemployment assistance beneficiaries are concerned, they get increased <Col N="630" /> benefits in cash rather than by means of the food voucher.</P>

I would appeal to the Minister to consider this matter sympathetically.  I do not see any administrative difficulty in extending the scheme to persons living in the small towns and villages.</P>

It has been stated in the Press &mdash;but when speaking to Deputy Smith, Parliamentary Secretary, on this matter I could not get him to say that the statement which appeared in the Press was officially correct&mdash;that an allowance of eight gallons of petrol would be given to each candidate after the date of nomination.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It has been decided to make an allowance of petrol to each candidate who is nominated for the election.  I mean each candidate who <Col N="632" /> is in fact nominated for a constituency, not each person who is at present a prospective candidate for a constituency. That allowance will be eight gallons of petrol.  In addition, of course, the major political Parties are receiving at the present time special allowances of petrol as well as permits for cars to enable them to undertake the organisation work that is associated with election preparations by political Parties.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>These allowances vary, I think, from the case of the Fine Gael Party, which gets the largest allowance, to the smaller Parties that are not represented here at the moment, that are also contesting the election. I could not state from memory what the allowances are.  I did not know this question was going to be raised or I would have got the information.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not get the notice until now.  There is a number of cars for which permits are granted to each of the Parties and an allowance was granted for the month of May, and a similar allowance will be granted for the ensuing month to these Parties.  Now, that allowance given to the Parties as such is over and above the allowance given to each candidate as such.  The candidate's allowance will be an individual matter for himself, representing a permit to purchase a stated quantity of petrol, which he can use either in his own car if he applies for a permit for his car and pays the tax on it, or use in a hired car if he prefers to do it in that particular way.  It is true that the allowance of eight gallons which is being allowed is not very large, but I do not think the supply position would justify a larger allocation at the present time.  It is related to the standard monthly allowance for doctors and other persons who have still got the privilege of using private cars for professional purposes.  The amount of travelling that a candidate can do on it will be very restricted, but it is the <Col N="633" /> best, I think, that the supply position would justify.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will understand that the Department cannot deal with people who are merely prospective candidates.  If I were to announce now that the eight gallons would be available for anybody who announced that he was going to be a candidate at the election, it is quite probable you would have 100,000 candidates at the end of the week.  No Party would desire that. No one can be regarded as a candidate until his nomination paper and deposit have been lodged with the returning officer.  When that has been done, the candidate will become entitled to the allowance.  That is the only fair method of distribution. Allocations to Parties have been on the basis of the size of Parties.  I felt that it would not be possible to make a flat rate of allocation having regard to the fact that some groups&mdash;I am not referring to the groups that at present are represented in the House&mdash;will obviously have a much smaller number of candidates and much smaller organisations than the larger and longer established Parties in the House.  I may say that the Fianna Fáil Party is getting the smallest allowance of all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Deputies are aware that the purpose of the Appropriation Bill is to authorise the issue from the Central Fund of the balance of the amount granted in respect of those Supply Services which have already been considered in detail by the Dáil.  The Bill is, therefore, complementary to the Central Fund Act, 1943, which authorised the issue from the Central Fund of the propertion (£13,820,000) of the total of the Estimates for the current financial year which had been granted on account by the Dáil: the further release from the Central Fund provided for in Section 1 of the Bill will make available the balance of the total amount already granted for the public services for the current financial year.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Bill also provides for the <Col N="636" /> appropriation to the proper Supply Services and purposes the sums granted on account, or in the case of those Estimates which have been considered in detail and approved by the Dáil, the full amount voted for the current financial year.  Provision is also made for the formal appropriation of such of the supplementary and additional grants for 1942-43 as were voted after the Appropriation Act, 1942, had been passed.</P>
    <P>As to individual sections and schedules, Section 1 provides for the issue from the Central Fund of the sum of £9,551,899 which together with the sum of £13,820,000 authorised to be issued from the Central Fund under the Central Fund Act, 1943, represents the total amount estimated to be required from the Central Fund to make good the grants voted for the supply services for the current financial year. So far the Estimates (including two Supplementary Estimates) for only 29 Supply Services have been considered in detail and the sum of £9,551,899 mentioned in the section represents the total of the amounts granted to complete the sums necessary to defray the cost of these 29 services during the current financial year.</P>
    <P>Section 2, sub-section (1), empowers the Minister for Finance to borrow up to £9,551,899, that is, the amount mentioned in Section 1, and to issue any such securities as he thinks fit for the purpose of such borrowing.  It also provides that the Bank of Ireland may advance to the Minister any sum or sums not exceeding in the whole £9,551,899.</P>
    <P>The purpose of Section 3 is specifically to appropriate to the various services set out in Schedule B annexed to the Bill the total amounts granted for the Supply Services since the passage of the Appropriation Act, 1942.  The grants making up the total as set forth in Schedule A are:&mdash;</P>

    <P>Sub-section (2) of this section provides the necessary authority for the utilisation of certain Departmental receipts as Appropriations-in-Aid of the grants for the specific services mentioned in the Schedule.</P>
    <P>Schedule A gives particulars of the issues out of the Central Fund provided for by the Central Fund Act, 1943, and the present Bill.</P>
    <P>Schedule B sets out in detail the specific services to which the sums so granted are to be appropriated.  Part I, of this Schedule is, in effect, an extension of Part III of Schedule B of the Appropriation Act, 1942, since it shows the additional grants for 1942-43 provided to meet Supplementary and additional Estimates approved by Dáil Eireann subsequent to the passing of the Appropriation Act, 1942.  Part II of Schedule B forms the basis of the audit of the Appropriation accounts for the current financial year which will be carried out by the Comptroller and Auditor-General.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to raise a few matters on this Bill.  First of all, everybody must notice the extent of the bill presented to us for the year, and must ask what value are we getting for it.  I am satisfied that within the next fortnight or three weeks the Government Party will be at the crossroads trying to defend this Bill to the people to whom they are responsible.  I do not wish to raise any controversial issue now, except that I want official notice to be taken of the figures announced by the Minister.  There are many questions that I would like to ask the Government, and first of all the Department of Defence.  I put down a question to the Minister for Defence to-day asking him if he was aware that Private James Crosby, of Lower Water Street, Longford, who served in the National Army, died on active service on the 17th October, <Col N="638" /> 1941.  The Minister for Defence did not answer any of the points upon which information was sought.  I asked the Minister if he was aware that this soldier became sick one morning, and I suggested that his illness was due to hardship that he had undergone the previous day.  I asked the Minister if there had been any investigation as to whether this soldier's death was or was not due to such hardship.  The Minister did not answer.  I also asked what provision had been made for the widow and four orphans of a soldier who had served his country, and I got the brazen reply that this Party had voted against a certain Act, and, therefore, had held up payment in such cases to widows and children of soldiers.  It is a well known fact, and the country appreciates it to the full, that when Deputy Mulcahy and others voted against that Bill they did so because the provision was not made for widows and children which we felt the Government should make.  For a Minister of State to make such a reply on a very well settled question is a very grave reflection on the mentality of those who occupy the Government Front Benches.  I want to stress this point, that where men of the calibre of this soldier about whom I inquired, enter the Defence Forces to serve their country, and owing to the hardship imposed upon them they lose their lives, the State should become the guardian of the widows and orphans, or whatever other dependents they have.  I feel that the Government have been lacking in ordinary justice when they throw the onus in such cases over on somebody else.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want also to deal with another case. I would prefer somebody else to do so, but as I am the only person who knows the facts I wish to bring it before the Dáil.  A man was driving cattle home from a fair in Edgeworthstown when he was struck by an Army car and killed.  One of the cattle was also killed. A coroner's inquest was held, and adjourned pending directions from the Attorney-General&mdash;otherwise the State. The solicitor acting for the deceased man informed the Minister for Defence that he represented the family.  The Attorney-General directed that no action should be taken in the case, and <Col N="639" /> not only that, but it was intimated that the Minister for Defence or the Minister for Finance would not pay one-halfpenny towards defraying the funeral expenses.</P>
    <P>That may be good finance, and may be in accordance with the strict regulations made by the Department of Finance but it was the most uncharitable and most unchristian act ever committed in the history of any country.  I am perfectly satisfied that under any of the so-called non-Christian Governments, if an enemy were found dead on the field, these Governments would, at least, accord him the honours of war or expend the amount necessary to bury him decently.  This Government, for what reasons I do not know, cannot see fit to make a contribution in that particular case.  If the Minister wants the particular details, I will send them to him.  I have already sent them to the Minister for Defence, whose answer was that there is no fund available to defray the cost.</P>
    <P>When you consider the enormity of the expenditure that is imposed on the people of the country and the promises that were made by this Government when they came into office, you begin to wonder if there is any public decency left.  You ask yourself the question: &ldquo;If a Government of this country can get things by promising and not fulfilling, where does justice end, and at what stage should the Attorney-General take people up for offences against justice and prosecute them for having made statements and obtained goods under false pretences?&rdquo; I would much rather not have to speak at this particular point at all, but I ask the Minister for Finance to see that, where a soldier dies in the service of the country, at least he will not leave his widow and orphans to depend on charity, with nothing to sustain them in their struggle for life.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>It is quite clear that there is no use in discussing anything on this Appropriation Bill but a matter of urgency which needs immediate action.  On three separate occasions, I have asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health as to <Col N="640" /> whether he is aware that the phytic acid content of 100 per cent. flour at present being used in bread is resulting in an immense increase in rickets in children.  At first, the Minister said that he had no evidence that my contention was true.  Then I asked the Parliamentary Secretary if he had received from the Dietetic Council set up by the medical profession, conclusive evidence that the facts I had adumbrated were true.  The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Local Government and Public Health said he had received no such communication.</P>
      <P>In fact, I know that the full information was supplied to the Minister in April, 1942, and that, on April 24th, 1942, the Minister acknowledged having received the communication.  The medical adviser to the Minister met the secretary of the Dietetic Council and was furnished by him with a full digest of all the relative material, and with the whole of the report of Dr. McCanice of Cambridge.  That conclusive report establishes beyond doubt that the 100 per cent. extraction of wheaten flour does contain phytic acid in appreciable quantity, and that the presence of phytic acid in the diet of an individual results in a considerable destruction of calcium&mdash;or, technically, a prevention of calcium metabolism&mdash; and also that the inadequacy of calcium metabolism results in an increase in the incidence of rickets in children. It establishes that the easiest way to correct this is to reduce the flour extraction to 90 per cent.&mdash;because the phytic acid occurs mainly in the last 10 per cent. extraction from the wheat &mdash;or, if the circumstances demand that you should maintain 100 per cent. extraction, that you should add to the flour calcium carbonate.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Calcium is cheaper than flour: there is no question of increased cost.  It is readily available in any quantity, and a modest addition of this mineral to the flour will be detected by nobody who is consuming the flour, but will immediately correct the ricket-producing effect of the bread that is at present being supplied.  It is statistically established that, for every one case of rickets in the population in <Col N="641" /> 1938, there are 10 cases of rickets now. I do not mean by that these cases are cases of advanced or marked rickets, but rather that there are symptoms of rickets to be found in 10 cases, where they were in one case pre-war. That may not be due exclusively to the presence of phytic acid in the flour, but there can be no doubt that it is a contributing factor.</P>
    <P>This is a matter of urgent importance to every expectant mother.  It is a matter of urgent importance to every child in the country whose bones are still going through the process of formation.  Every week that passes, damage is being done. The flour millers are ready instantly to put in the calcium, if the Minister will indicate to them that he agrees to their doing so.  They do not want an Order, nor any facilities of finance. They have the calcium ready to put in, and are deterred from doing so only by a message from the Department of Supplies, asking them to suspend action in this matter until the Minister for Local Government and Public Health has considered it and made recommendations.  All I am asking the Minister to do is to say to the millers: &ldquo;You have my approval.&rdquo;  If the Minister will do that, I will do the rest.</P>

Will the Minister for Finance ask his colleague, the Minister <Col N="642" /> for Industry and Commerce, to send a postcard to the Millers' Association at 32 Nassau Street, saying that they can put the calcium in the flour, with his blessing?  If that is done, grave and irreparable injury will be prevented.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, I quoted figures to show that the taxation per head of the population had increased from £2 3s. 11d. in 1913-14 to £12, under the arrangements presented in this Appropriation Bill for our final approval.  I notice that the Taoiseach, speaking in Tralee on Sunday week last, expressed surprise that the Labour Party should object to the policy of increasing taxation for the purpose of social services.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am talking of Government policy.  I would like to put on the records of the House, before we depart, that the Labour Party do not object to increased taxation for the purpose of improving the social services, so long as it is understood that we are prepared to do it to increase the pensions for widows and orphans, for the old age pensioners and the aged and infirm generally.  We do object to the policy of increasing taxation&mdash;and I would like to have this on record&mdash; for the purpose of maintaining an increasing number of able-bodied citizens in idleness while there is plenty of work to be done.  If the Government had the courage to prepare the plans, or put into operation the plans that they had prepared, they could provide our able-bodied citizens with the work which they promised to provide for them when they came into office.  If the policy of self-sufficiency had been put into operation, there would be no idle man in the country to-day and, if that were so, the amount provided by way of social services would have been reduced by £6,000,000.  A sum of £6,000,000 out of the £10,000,000 provided <Col N="643" /> for social services in the Bill now before us is to be raised for the purpose of maintaining able-bodied men in idleness.  That is the part of the policy which we object to.</P>
      <P>There is another matter which I think can be regarded as a matter of urgency and which was raised by Deputy Dillon in the House this afternoon, that is, the recent sinking of the &ldquo;Irish Oak.&rdquo;  In a supplementary question, the Taoiseach was asked what was the nationality of the captain of that ship and he rather resented such a question being addressed to him.  The question of the nationality of the captains of ships employed by Irish Shipping Ltd. has been a subject of discussion in another place.</P>

      <P>All I say is that a recommendation was submitted.  An advertisement was issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce following the adoption of that recommendation by the Cabinet or by the Minister for Industry and Commerce at any rate and, so far as I know, it has not been strictly adhered to.  I want to impress on the Minister the necessity for doing so, if he believes, as I am sure he does, that it is sound national policy to maintain a position of neutrality.  I <Col N="645" /> know Deputy Dillon's views on this whole question.  I have good reason to know them from hearing them in another place.

      <P>Deputy MacEoin referred to a certain matter here and although, you might say, it did not refer to the general policy of the Government, still I think it refers to general policy.  In the discussion on the recent Military Service Pensions Bill, I said that if the standard relating to certain citizens was the standard that was being held before this country, then I would not stand for the amount of money that was being spent on the general administration here and, particularly, on the maintenance of the Army for the purpose of defending the country, because, when we spend money on the Army, we spend it in order to defend something that is worth defending.  Under the Military Service Pensions Bill, which was referred to, if a man were permanently disabled, who was anything from a private to a sergeant in the Defence Forces, a certain basic provision was made for the man himself, and, if he were a married man, he got an additional 10/-to keep his wife and the rest of his family, whatever the rest of that family was.</P>
      <P>It was because there was that fundamental blemish on the Bill that the Bill was resolutely opposed here and for no other reason.  What is wrong with the general policy of the Government is that, in matters which are fundamental to the well-being of the country and to the moral outlook of the country on its public responsibility, they have no standard.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When the 1934 Pensions Bill was going through the House I urged at a particular stage of the Bill that, as the net of the Bill was spread to widely, it ought to take cognisance of the fact that there was a particular class of people, some of whom were in difficult circumstances and who ought to be provided for; that is men who, although they had no contact with the <Col N="646" /> Civil War on any side, had been out in the Rising of 1916.  I urged that the Bill should make some provision for these men.  The Government refused during the remaining stages of the Bill to accept the suggestion, but they remedied the matter in the Seanad. In the Bill which was before the House the other day they advanced further in consideration of the position of the 1916 men, and provided that in the case of 1916 men with families they would raise their income to a standard level.  It was indicated that, in the case of a man and his wife whose income was below £97, I think it is, by way of supplementary pension they would raise the income of that family to £97 and, in respect of the children of that family under a certain age, there would be an additional payment of £10 8s. per year in respect of each child.  Now, take the case of a man who would have been a beneficiary under that Act.  He had a wife and seven children and he had a 1916 pension of £34.  Under the provisions of that Act, that man, if he were alive to-day, would be entitled to have his income raised to £170, as he would, under the Act recently passed, get an additional sum of £135.  In the meantime, the man has died and, because the man is dead, his wife and children are not to have any contribution made to their upkeep under that Act.  The Military Service Pensions Act of 1934 made a certain provision for the man himself.  If there were any reason for dealing with that particular type of person under the recent Bill, it was because he had a wife and children.  I think it is to our credit that we opposed the Bill when one of the provisions of the Bill leaves that man's wife and children utterly unprovided for because the man died.  As I say, the Ministry have no standards.  They talk with any amount of sympathy and patriotic reference to certain classes, but they have no standards with regard to them, and when they have no standards with regard to these, they have no standards with regard to any classes.  One of the things absolutely necessary is some kind of standards to apply to those people who have been <Col N="647" /> prevented from maintaining themselves and their families by reason of positive public service.  If we cannot get a standard for these, we cannot get a standard for the ordinary citizen. That is all I want to say in relation to this matter, and I say it only because it was raised so positively, so bluntly and in such characteristic manner by the Minister for Supplies to-day.</P>

      <P>Several times within the past 12 months I made efforts to get increases in the allowances to soldiers' wives and children.  These people are bearing very grave hardships, and I ask the Minister if he will do something to ease the burden of the wives and children of our serving soldiers.  Their allowances are totally inadequate. They have got nothing whatever to meet the increased cost of living since they last got an increase, I believe about two years ago.  I have been asked dozens of times to bring this matter to the notice of the House, and I have done so.  I earnestly hope that the Minister will make some effort to ease their lot.  They are not able to buy clothing for their children at the prices which they are asked to pay at present, or to buy the necessary foods to feed their children properly.  I have seen children of all classes in this city clothed in a way which would not protect them properly, and their clothing is so dear to-day that there is a danger of their health breaking down.  I suggest that children's clothing should be available at some low fixed price, and that soldiers' wives&mdash;and I am speaking only for soldiers' wives at the moment&mdash;should get increased allowances and should be paid weekly instead of fortnightly, so as to enable them to buy to the best advantage.</P>

      <P>Appeals have been made to the Minister during this debate on behalf of sections of the community who are poor, destitute and dependent on the State for assistance.  While these appeals will meet with universal sympathy, the Minister will not forget that no grant of monetary relief to any section of our people will avail unless there are available within the country <Col N="648" /> the essential goods which the people require, and on the purchase of which they can utilise their money.  No money will relieve these people if the goods are not available, and the Minister should pause to consider what would be the position of the country to-day if we had, in addition to a shortage of potatoes, a shortage of wheat.  We would have a shortage of wheat were it not for the heroism and self-sacrifice of Irishmen who sailed the oceans and carried a wheat supply to this country. Our home-grown wheat supply was totally inadequate, as may be judged from the fact that millers are to-day empowered to add an admixture of 50 per cent. of imported wheat.  If we were able to provide only 50 per cent. of the grist required from home production, the Government have placed us in a very difficult and very dangerous position, because a failure of the wheat or flour supply, in addition to a shortage of the basic cheap human food, potatoes, would have meant absolute famine, and there is no indication that either the Minister for Finance or any other Minister has faced up to the danger of the situation.  Neither the Minister knows how much wheat was sown during the present season, but there is grave reason to fear that the acreage has not increased very much as compared with last year.  Therefore, we are again facing a position of grave danger with regard to an essential food supply, and nothing in the way of monetary relief to our people will avail so long as we have that inefficiency in important Departments of State connected with the provision of our food supply.</P>

      <P>I simply raise the point in a general way as an urgent and <Col N="649" /> important feature of Government policy.  No matter what Government is in power for the coming years, plans should be pushed forward for ensuring that the maximum amount of food will be got out of the land.  Other nations, and particularly our neighbour, Great Britain, have shown what can be done in the way of expansion of the food supply.  They have achieved that not by giving doles and reliefs to people who are unemployed or destitute but by giving an adequate return to those engaged in production.</P>

      <P>May I ask your permission, Sir, and that of the Minister, to ask two questions?  Would the Minister, when replying, make a statement on the question of drainage, and would he give an assurance to the House that the Military Service Pensions Board will remain in session for at least six months after the new Parliament comes together?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy had given me notice, I should have been very happy to make inquiries and to answer as fully as possible the questions he asked.  So far as I know, the Military Service Pensions Board will not continue its operations much longer.  I think it has almost come to an end.  It is only now hearing appeals from awards made and it may continue for three months, but I do not know whether it will continue longer. I speak subject to correction, but I think that is the general position.</P>
      <P>With regard to drainage, I think that whatever statement can be made has been made more than once here, that is, that the recommendations of the Drainage Commission have been adopted in principle and for some months past&mdash;I do not think I exaggerate when I say, for at least the last six months&mdash;the proper authorities have been drafting the necessary legislation to implement those recommendations. It is a most difficult Bill, one upon which the experts have varied opinions.  But I can assure the Deputy that, so far as the Government could force the pace, they have been doing it, in order to get that Drainage Bill drafted and brought before the House.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. O Ceallaigh</NameTxt>
      <P>At present estimates, when this legislation is in operation it will cost the Exchequer at least £7,000,000.  But we are facing up to that and it will not be the fault of the Government, certainly, if the recommendations in the report are not implemented.  I have been asked dozens of times by the Taoiseach what we are doing about it&mdash;it comes partly into my Department in the Office of Public Works&mdash;but there have been difficulties that we have not been able easily to get over.  At any rate, that report is going to be implemented.</P>
      <P>I cannot answer the Deputy with regard to the detailed questions he asked about Army pensions or the killing of the unfortunate man at Edgeworthstown by a military lorry.  This much I can say, that I put through here, as Minister for Local Government, a Road Traffic Act and, against the advice of very important people, I put into it a section which made it possible for the ordinary citizen to take an action against a Minister whose car, or the car of whose Department, was responsible for an accident.  Up to that time nobody could take an action against the Government, or a member of the Government, following a motor accident in which the Government or a member of the Government might be involved.  I made it possible, with the consent of my colleagues, for the ordinary citizen to take his case into court.  Previously, a citizen, if injured, had to leave himself at the mercy of the Government or of an individual Minister.  Since I became Minister for Finance, I have observed the alarming number of cases, and the size of the awards, against the Government. However, that has not changed my views as to the right thing to do in such cases.</P>
      <P>In this case, if the dependents or relatives of the man who was killed have a case, why do they not take it into court?  Is that not the remedy&mdash; the proper remedy?</P>

I do not know the circumstances of this case, but it seems to me that there must be something wrong when it was not brought in the ordinary way into court.  On the question of Army pensions, the subject Deputy Mulcahy grew so eloquent about and has been so eloquent upon recently, I do not maintain that the Army pensions are as generous as they might be, but they are much more generous than the pensions granted when Deputy Mulcahy was a Minister.</P>

      <P>The last man who ought to criticise pensions is Deputy Mulcahy.  Deputy MacEoin was not in the Dáil at that time.  Deputy Mulcahy ought to say little on that subject, because a meaner Pensions Bill was never brought in here than the one Deputy Mulcahy and his Government were responsible for.  Mean, miserable and starving&mdash;that is what the pensions then were called.  That applies, not alone to the pensions, but to the Army allowances.  We improved all these things, but still they are not what we <Col N="652" /> would like, or what Deputy MacEoin would like.</P>

      <P>No, but did the Deputy hear the criticism of the man who introduced a Pension Bill when he was a Minister in the last Government? Anybody else might justly criticise our Bill in many ways, but certainly not Deputy Mulcahy.  It was not a generous Bill, but we cannot afford to be generous.  It is all very well for Deputy Mulcahy to criticise our efforts. He has not the responsibility of providing the money.  He can shout now about miserable pensions, but when he had the responsibility what did he do? In our present circumstances we cannot afford to be as generous as we would like to be.  I am the Minister for Finance and I admit I am soft-hearted enough, but I hope I am not soft-headed. We have to try to measure our generosity with our resources.

Deputy Dillon asked about the absence of calcium carbonate from flour of 100 per cent. extraction.  That is a question on which I am not competent to speak.

Is there any machinery whereby this Parliament can ensure that its Official Reports will not be misused, and purported extracts from the official records published which, in fact, are not the actual extracts from the Official Report?  Recently, the <i>Irish Press</i> gave what was alleged to be an extract from the Official Reports of this House, which actually consisted of a false extract of a sentence from the report and the addition of another extract. It was alleged to be an extract from the records of our House, and on it was based a lying and slanderous attack on a member of this House, to <Col N="658" /> wit, Deputy McGilligan.  Can we prevent a newspaper publishing as an extract from our Official Reports that which is not a proved extract?</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>On that, Sir.  There is provision in this Bill for the printing of the Official Reports of this House. I want to raise on this a specific instance of what, in my opinion, is a gross abuse of that official record. Those reports are designed to present to our people an authentic record of what passes here in this House.  It is recognised, of course, that an ordinary Pressman may be more struck by one aspect of our proceedings than with another and that, in introducing it to the public he might present a picture which would not be a really accurate or objective one, but over and above that, there is the official record of the proceedings of Dáil Éireann, which records every word that is uttered here with objectivity and detachment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Some years ago, when Deputy McGilligan was Minister for Industry <Col N="659" /> and Commerce, this House was discussing the incidence of destitution in this country and, in the course of his reply, he turned to Deputy Davin and said: &ldquo;Certain people in this country might take up the position that citizens of the State might have to die of hunger.&rdquo;  Then Deputy McGilligan said, looking at Deputy Davin: &ldquo;Neither Deputy Davin nor I would ever subscribe to such a doctrine.&rdquo; That is what the Official Report contains. The <i>Irish Press</i> says in effect: &ldquo;We are now about to quote the Official Report of the Dáil.&rdquo;  They say: &ldquo;Deputy McGilligan said, when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce, that certain citizens of this State might have to die of hunger.&rdquo; Then, they go on and pick out&mdash;several sentences later&mdash;a statement he made in the course of his speech, that it is no part of a Government's duty to provide work for people who are unemployed. That was to use the Official Report of this House to convey to the public an impression diametrically opposite to that conveyed by what Deputy McGilligan said.  I am 20 years in politics.  I have no thin skin. I believe that I can give as good as I get, but there are limits to the extravagant dishonesty, rascality and villainy that ought to be tolerated by this House.  The Minister for Local Government smiles.  The time may come when the official records of this House could be used in just that filthy way to blacken his record as a Minister.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Minister were the victim of that filthy and unscrupulous method of attack, I hope that we, in this House, would react just as violently as against detestable lies of this kind, carrying the specious appearance of truth, allegedly drawn from the official records of this House.  I suggest to the Minister for Local Government that, as a member of this Parliament, as a public man, he should join with me in dissociating himself from that filthy kind of lying fraud, <Col N="660" /> designed to do a man a wicked injustice in the eyes of his countrymen &mdash;a thing for which there is not the shadow of foundation.  I have no personal interest in Deputy McGilligan's affairs.  I am no longer a member of his Party and differ profoundly from him on many things.  But I do not care what Deputy of this House is concerned, this lie, told by an official paper, a paper which is the Government organ, in the full knowledge of its lying, with the desire to lie and with the desire to stab a man in the back, should not be allowed to pass without repudiation.  They hold Deputy McGilligan up as one who would look with indiffernce and calm on his countrymen dying of starvation when they know that he never said that; that, so far from saying it, he said that, while such a thing was possible, the human mind would repudiate and reject it.  That is what the official record says.  This contemptible rag, founded on misappropriation of the American loan&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>This is only one of many topics with which I propose to deal. What I suggest to the Chair is that there are certain occasions when Deputies decide amongst themselves on a common line of conduct, quite apart from statutory duty or formal action by the Legislature as a body.  As decent men and women, we should set ourselves a decent standard.  As a body of average, decent men and women, drawn from the ranks of the people, we should resolve that, to one another, we shall extend charity and justice and conduct our proceedings on some criterion of decency and honesty.  We are all aware that, in the past, Deputies occasionally attempted to misrepresent one another.  In such a contingency, when the attention of the House was directed to the misrepresentation, the Deputy attempting the misrepresentation was required to withdraw.  We always pursued this proper and wise procedure in relation to one another.  I am suggesting that we should resolve amongst ourselves that, no matter how deeply antagonistic we may feel against another Deputy, when we see a conspiracy to repeat what has been repeatedly pointed out as a lie, with the representation that it is drawn from our official report, quite apart from our statutory duties, we should&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it were a pledge to abstain from the conduct I have outlined, <Col N="664" /> I should have no hesitation in asking all the Deputies in the House to become Pioneers.  I think that I have said sufficient to draw attention to this disgusting episode.</P>

      <P>Four lots of commercial timber in Kilmalooda wood on the Beamish estate, County Cork, were advertised for sale by the Land Commission in February, 1943.  A number of tenders were received including one from Mr. William McCarthy, of the Electric Sawmills, Bandon, for the four lots and one from Mr. Jerome McCarthy, of Timoleague, for one of the lots. Three of the lots were sold respectively <Col N="562" /> to: Messrs. J. Spiller and Co., Ltd., Clonakilty; Messrs. Harte and Son, Ltd., Cork; and Messrs.  Barry and Sons, Ltd., Cork.  All three firms were registered timber merchants in 1941.  The fourth lot has not yet been sold and Mr. William McCarthy is among the persons or firms who are being considered as purchasers. There is a keen demand for these trees and the Land Commission have to decide on their most advantageous disposal in present circumstances. The Land Commission were not prepared to dispose of the four lots to any single purchaser.</P>
