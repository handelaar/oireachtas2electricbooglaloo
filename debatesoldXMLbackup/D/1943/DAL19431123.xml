      <NameTxt>Mr. P.J. Fogarty</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he is aware that a considerable number of people in Swords are without supplies of butter, owing to the fact that the Lucan Dairies Co. have failed to deliver supplies of butter to the following shopkeepers: Mrs. Pawley, Main Street; Miss M.E. Ryan, North Street; and Mrs. J. Howard, North Street, Swords; and if, in view of this, he will have the matter investigated immediately; and, also, if he is prepared to allow these retailers to transfer their butter permits to another firm, which will be in a position to maintain supplies of butter to them.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that a considerable number of people in Swords are without supplies of butter, or that the wholesale firm <Col N="3" /> mentioned by the Deputy failed to make deliveries to the three shopkeepers named.  The information furnished to my Department by the wholesaler indicates that during the five delivery weeks ended 18th instant, the three retailers obtained sufficient butter to meet the rations of the domestic consumers registered with them.</P>
      <P>Butter retailers may at any time nominate the wholesaler from whom they wish to obtain butter and normally the nominations are accepted by my Department.  Accordingly, if the traders referred to by the Deputy wish to transfer their butter permits to another supplier the necessary arrangements will be made on receipt of written applications.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose to take Questions Nos. 4, 5 and 6 together.  The normal difficulties which occur at this period of the year, when owing to weather conditions there is an increasing demand for turf together with a steady reduction in the quantity of immediately saleable turf arriving by rail, have been experienced in Balbriggan and Skerries as in other parts of the non-turf area.  The necessary-steps were taken to deal with the situation in Balbriggan and Skerries as soon as the difficulties there were brought to the notice of my Department, and it is not anticipated that there will be a recurrence of these difficulties during the present winter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RoderickJamesConnoll" hpid="Mr. Connolly Mr. Connolly">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Connolly</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he is aware that there was no turf for sale by merchants in the town of Dundalk on Friday, 12th, Saturday, 13th, Monday, 15th, and Tuesday, 16th November, and that orders for turf are two or three weeks behind in the town; further, if it is a fact that Fuel Importers, Limited, are compelling merchants to take turf from railway waggons, instead of from dumps, and thereby making purchasers of turf buy sodden turf; and if he will state what action he proposes to take to remedy these causes of grievance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware that turf was not available for sale in the town of Dundalk on the llth, 12th, 13th, l5th, and 16th November, 1943, or that orders for turf are two to three weeks behind in the town.  On each of these dates supplies of turf were received by Dundalk fuel merchants and inquiries have revealed that none of the merchants is unduly behindhand in dealing with urgent orders.</P>
      <P>Wherever practicable, and to the extent to which saleable turf is available, fuel merchants are required to take their supplies direct from the railway station or other delivery point rather than through the damps, with a view to eliminating as far as possible the extra delivery and storage costs involved in putting the turf into the dumps.  The allegation that the merchants are being compelled to take deliveries of sodden turf from railway waggons is without foundation.  Fuel merchants have the right to reject unmerchantable turf and this right has at all times been freely exercised by the Dundalk merchants.</P>

      <P>Is the Minister aware that as the dump was not opened the merchants could not exercise that option?  Therefore, the only remedy for the situation&mdash;I am sure the Minister will agree with this&mdash;is to open the dumps there when the quantity and quality of the turf at Dundalk are not suitable for the residents.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>When inquiries were made by my Department, none of the fuel merchants in Dundalk agreed that they were without suitable turf, or that their deliveries were in arrears.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health whether he is aware that considerable doubt exists as to the present and future status of the bodies known as parish councils, which came into existence at the instigation of the Government at a time of grave emergency; and whether, in view of the fact that many of these councils hold stocks of food purchased out of moneys subscribed by their parishioners together with balances of such moneys, he is prepared to make a statement as to how these bodies may henceforth devote their energies to best advantage from the national viewpoint.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations on this matter have recently been received in my Department. The establishment of parish councils on a statutory basis was fully discussed in the Seanad in September, 1940.  It was then pointed out that, in the Local Government Bill which has since become law, provision was made whereby the county council could delegate to approved local councils functions which in the view of the county council the local council could-properly discharge.  As approved local councils these bodies would share with the county council the duty of looking after matters which had special interest for a parish.  The county council was also empowered to provide such bodies with village halls. In addition to undertaking the administration of certain matters of local interest the parish councils could also concern themselves with the advancement of the economic and social interests of the people of the parish and, in this way, bring about greater co-operation. It is desirable to keep local councils in existence for the performance of those duties for which they were called into being, including the securing of the equitable distribution <Col N="11" /> of food and fuel and the procuring of supplies for areas that might be affected by a sudden and prolonged interruption of supplies and transport.</P>
      <P>There is now, and will be after the emergency has passed, scope for the activities of local councils in every county.  The law gives the county councils, subject to the approval of my Department, sufficient power to provide halls for the use of approved councils and to entrusts them with suitable functions in relation to their respective parishes.  They can, of course, as voluntary bodies interest themselves in other social and economic matters which specially affect their areas.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. H.M. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state, with regard to the provision of houses for the work ing classes in the City and County of Dublin, what is the average combined cost per house that has fallen on the ratepayer and taxpayer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>If what is required is the average amount of the all-in cost of all houses provided by the Dublin Corporation and Dublin County Council which is borne by the taxpayer and the ratepayer, I may say that the information would be most difficult to compile, and even when compiled the result would be of little value for the following reasons:&mdash;</P>
      <P>Prior to 1922 there was practically no State aid for urban housing schemes.  Between 1922 and 1932 varying rates of State subsidy for urban housing schemes were applicable and the effect of the State contribution by way of lump sum grants which varied throughout the ten-year period could not be given without reference to the cost of each scheme undertaken.  Since 1932 State subsidy to urban housing undertaken by local authorities has been on a definite basis and is payable by way of contributions to annual loan charges over a period not exceeding 35 years.  The position is also complicated by the fact that, during that period, the cost of building schemes varied.  The Deputy will, therefore, realise that any attempt to assess the State contribution since 1922 on the basis of the average combined or all-in cost of housing would entail an amount of work which would not be justified by the expenditure of time and money involved.  A somewhat similar position in regard to rural housing obtains except that a regular State contribution was introduced as early as 1906.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>For the information of the Deputy I may say, however, that the revenue expenditure in Dublin City for the year ended the 31st March, 1942, in <Col N="13" /> respect of schemes being subsidised under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1932, was £487,855, and this was apportioned as follows:&mdash;State, £132,585; Corporation, £108,948; tenant, £246,322.  The corresponding figures for Dublin County were: £32,672; State, £11,987; county council, £2,599; tenant, £18,086. The number of houses provided in Dublin City and County under the provisions of the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous) Act, 1932, were 11,008 and 1,202 respectively.  The division of these figures into the total annual expenditure would not be a reliable guide as to annual cost of a house due to the fact that in some cases the annual outgoings would include capital and interest charges, and in the case of other houses only recently completed no provision would yet be included for repayment of capital, and no expenditure would have been incurred on maintenance.</P>

      <P>I am aware that there are difficulties in arranging for supplies of milk under the free milk scheme in certain parts of Kildare County and my Department has been in communication with the county manager with a view to overcoming these difficulties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The grant for the supply of free milk for necessitous children has been specially provided by the Government, by reason of the special value of milk as a food for children, and the application of the grant for any other purpose but the provision of milk would not be approved.  The Emergency Powers (No. 95) Order, 1941, of the 24th June, 1941, enables milk to be obtained for distribution under the free milk scheme from persons who are not registered dairymen.  This arrangement proved satisfactory in several areas where difficulties of milk supply had arisen, and as the difficulties experienced in certain parts of Kildare <Col N="15" /> County are not altogether due to a shortage of milk produced in the county, the local authority are being asked to make further endeavour to ensure that a supply of milk will be available under the free milk scheme.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This Bill, as the title indicates, and as Deputies are aware, provides for the inauguration of a new social security service in this State involving the payment from State funds of allowances in respect of children under 16 years of age living in families of more than the average size.  The idea of establishing such a service, I think, has received support from all Parties in <Col N="24" /> the Dáil, and from many quarters outside the Dáil.  In fact, so general has been the approval given to the principle of the establishment of a children's allowances scheme that it might at first sight appear unnecessary for me to speak here to defend or to justify the principle of the measure. Unfortunately, however, most of those who advocated or supported, in the Dáil or outside it, the establishment of this service chose to ignore the very troublesome business of proposing how the cost of it should be met. As Deputies know, or as Deputies should realise, that is a matter for the taxpayer.  In one form or another, the cost of this Bill will be met by the taxpayer.  That is a fact which I ask Deputies to keep in the forefront of their minds during the discussion upon it.  Because this Bill, if enacted, will impose additional burdens upon the already heavily burdened taxpayer, I think it is necessary, irrespective of the attitude of Parties in the Dáil, to convince him that it is in the national interest and in his own interest that he should pay more money through taxation to enable this service to be established.</P>
      <P>The practice of paying allowances in respect of children has already been established in some other countries; in some cases through State schemes such as we propose to establish here; in others by means of voluntary arrangements applicable only to employees in particular industries.  I think it may help Deputies if I give an outline of the main features of the schemes in operation in other countries.  I do not vouch for the accuracy of the information that I propose to give.  Deputies will understand that, in present circumstances, it is not easy to get precise information concerning the legislation of other countries.  It is clear, however, from the information available to us that, both in respect of the method of paying allowances and the scope of the service, the schemes in operation in other countries vary very considerably. There is, in fact, no element of uniformity between them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In some countries, notably in Hungary and Holland, the equalisation fund principle is still maintained.  Deputies who have studied this matter <Col N="25" /> will know that the earliest record of the organised payment of children's allowances is in the history of the equalisation funds, as they were called, established on a voluntary basis by the employers in particular industries principally in France and in Belgium. The employers in particular industries there made payments, related to the numbers of workers employed by them, into funds established for their industry, and from these funds allowances were made to married workers with children.  Objection was taken in trade union circles to that principle.  It was alleged to be occasioned by the low level of wages in the industries concerned, and, in fact, for many years there was, amongst trade unionists in countries where the trade union movement was widely established, a general objection to the principle of children's allowances, mainly because the idea of children's allowances was associated with these equalisation funds operating in France and in Belgium. It will be obvious, of course, that any such scheme could apply only to workers employed for wages, and even though in France and elsewhere, these schemes were, in course of time, made of general application and compulsory by legislation, nevertheless they were limited in their scope to persons who were employed for wages.</P>
    <P>In Belgium, in Italy, and in Spain the contributory principle was adopted; payments of children's allowances being made from funds created by the contributions of employers, workers and the State, somewhat on the same lines as the unemployment insurance fund now operating in this country.  In Italy, the workers' contribution was abolished by an amending Act of 1939, and in Spain the scheme was extended to farmers by a special arrangement on an equalisation fund basis.  However, it will again be noted by Deputies that any children's allowances scheme based upon the contributory principle is necessarily limited in its scope also to workers employed for wages.  In the case of Italy there is a means test.  It is not easy to understand clearly how a means test can be operated in relation to a contributory fund, but presumably the <Col N="26" /> Italian Government was prepared to defend the principle of workers paying contributions to a fund from which, in certain circumstances, they could not draw benefit.</P>
    <P>In Australia, New Zealand, Germany, and now in France, the children's allowances schemes in force are, as is proposed for this country, State schemes&mdash;that is to say, the total cost is met by taxation, and the schemes are administered by the State.  A scheme was introduced in Portugal last year, the full details of which I have not got, but which appears to be applicable to family wage-earners of Portuguese nationality employed in stated occupations, although the list of occupations which I saw appeared to cover most of the occupations likely to employ large numbers.  In the New Zealand scheme a means test operates, the allowances paid being adjusted on a sliding scale basis to ensure that the total family income, taking the children's allowances into account, will not exceed a prescribed limit&mdash;a limit which has been already varied since the scheme was first introduced.  In Australia, in Germany, and in France the schemes in operation appear to be nation-wide in scope, as is proposed for this country.</P>
    <P>The age limits fixed to qualify for children's allowances in the various countries in which schemes are in operation vary&mdash;from 14 years in Italy, France, Spain, Hungary and Belgium, to 16 years in Australia, New Zealand and Germany.  In no case does the age exceed 16 years, although some countries have limited provision for the continuation of the payments after the maximum age has been passed in the case of incapacitated children.  In Australia and in France, payment is made in respect of qualified children other than the first; in Germany, if there are three or more children in the family, as is proposed here; in New Zealand in respect of all children, but subject, as I have said, to a means test which fixes the limit of family income beyond which allowances are not paid, irrespective of the size of the family. I have not attempted a comparison of the value of the allowances, which would be of no utility without information <Col N="27" /> as to the prevailing price levels.</P>
    <P>The trend of opinion everywhere appears to be in favour of the establishment of a service such as this as a necessary provision against want.  So far as one can gather from reports presented to the Governments of Canada, the United States, Great Britain and some other countries, public opinion there appears to support the establishment of such a service.  The basis of the argument in favour of the establishment of a children's allowances scheme is that, amongst the many causes of want, apart from unemployment, ill-health, old age, widowhood or orphanhood, there is the fact that in an economic system such as ours, where wages are related to standards of productivity, or determined by supply and demand, the amount which the wage earner can obtain is frequently inadequate to provide for the reasonable requirements of a large family.  Just as the income of a farm, or the earning capacity of a fishing boat is determined by the size and productivity of the farm or the utility of the fishing boat, and not by the needs of the owner, so in an industrial system based upon standard wages, established by trade union action over a number of years, want may be created amongst persons who are employed if the size of their family is such that the standard wage is inadequate to meet their reasonable needs.  It is, I think, necessary to emphasise that the basis of the whole case for the establishment of a children's allowances service is the need of large families.  I should like Deputies to keep that fact before them when discussing the terms of the Bill.</P>
    <P>The Beveridge Report presented to the British Government stated that social surveys carried out in a number of British cities revealed certain results. These surveys appear to indicate that, of all the want shown to exist in those towns, from three-fourths to five-sixths, according to the precise standard chosen for want, was due to interruption or loss of earning power. Practically the whole of the remaining one-fourth to one-sixth was due to failure to relate income during earning <Col N="28" /> to the size of the family.  I should like to quote for Deputies paragraph 13 of the abbreviated copy of the Beveridge Report published by the British Government. Paragraph 13 is as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Abolition of want requires, second, adjustment of incomes, in periods of earning as well as in interruption of earning, to family needs, that is to say, in one form or another it requires allowances for children.  Without such allowances as part of benefit or added to it, to make provision for large families, no social insurance against interruption of earnings can be adequate.  But, if children's allowances are given only when earnings are interrupted and are not given during earning also, two evils are unavoidable.  First, a substantial measure of acute want will remain among the lower-paid workers as the accompaniment of large families.  Second, in all such cases, income will be greater during unemployment or other interruptions of work than during work.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Similarly, the <i>Labour Review</i>, published by the United States Government, contained a survey of the social service schemes in operation in various countries and the review prefaced that survey by indicating that the basic consideration in all cases leading to the establishment of that service was the fact that an income which will provide a minimum standard of health and decency for a married man with a small family may well be insufficient in the case of a large number of dependents.</P>
    <P>I want to make it clear, therefore, that the purpose of the Government in proposing this Bill to the Dáil is to provide means of assisting in the alleviation of want in large families. I may say in passing that it is not contemplated that the enactment of this measure and the establishment of children's allowances, will influence either the birth-rate or the marriage rate.  It is my personal opinion that it will not have any effect on either. Want which may be created amongst the members of larger families under <Col N="29" /> a system of standard occupational wages can be just as real as want resulting from interruption of earning due to unemployment, ill-health or any other cause.  The children's allowances service is designed to alleviate that want by effecting a redistribution of income.  It was pointed out here, in the course of the debate last week, that, in effect, every social security service entails a redistribution of income, and this new service which we are establishing is designed to carry out such a redistribution for the specific purpose of benefiting large families and preventing the development of want in large families which are inadequately provided for, even though the wage-earner may be getting the standard wage for his occupation or even though the income from the farm, the fishing boat, or any other occupation of the bread-winner of the family may be, in every other sense of the term, average.  Now, State action, to effect a redistribution of income within the community, by taking from one person part of the fruits of his labour in order to give it to another person who, from the point of view of his contribution to the national wealth, safety or development is no more worthy of it, can only be justified by the existence of real need.  It is clear, therefore, that we must be able to show that there is a real need for this service in order to justify the burden that will be placed on many people in this country in consequence of its establishment.  It is clear, as was pointed out in connection with other social security services, that a redistribution of incomes does not increase the aggregate income of the community: it merely means that we transfer purchasing power from one section of the community to another. Every penny that any family may get as a result of the payment of children's allowances will be taken, in fact, from some other family or some other individual by means of taxation.</P>
    <P>In deciding, therefore, the extent to which we should like to increase the purchasing power available to the heads of large families, we must also remember, and keep clearly in mind, <Col N="30" /> the extent to which it is desirable and justifiable to go, in taking away purchasing power from others.  Having regard to the evidence of distress amongst members of larger families, the Government is prepared to defend increasing the tax charge by £2,250,000 a year, which is the amount that will be required to finance the service proposed by this Bill.  To give the assistance contemplated by this Bill, to the families that will benefit under it, will mean an increase of 25 per cent. on the amount that is already being provided for the normal social security services here.  As a result of the present emergency, certain expenditure has been undertaken here to relieve particular kinds of hardship directly caused by the emergency, and I am not taking such expenditure into account or regarding it as normal expenditure on social security services.  We make available something up to £2,000,000 per year to finance unemployment relief works, and, properly, that amount should be taken into account, in determining the amount provided by the State to relieve the consequences of unemployment, ill-health, old age, or orphanhood. At the present time, social security services proper, are costing, roughly, £8,000,000 a year in this country, and if we are to take into account unemployment relief, the figure would work out at about £10,000,000.  We are proposing, under this Bill, to increase that expenditure by £2,250,000 per year.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not know whether the people, either inside this Dáil or outside it, who have advocated the provision of this service, are prepared to go to the extent of saying that if we decide to increase taxation upon our people, so as to make available an additional sum of £2,250,000 for expenditure upon social security services, it would be better to spend the whole of that sum upon children's allowances of the kind that this Bill contemplates rather than in any other way.  It must be recognised, having regard to, the resources of this State, both now and in the period that will follow the conclusion of the war, that the establishment of this service, the imposition <Col N="31" /> of this new charge upon the taxpayers of the country, must inevitably mean that any other further and substantial change in our social security services must await the advent of better times.  Those who support this Bill in the Dáil, therefore, commit themselves, first of all, to the view that it is better under existing conditions, or under the conditions that we can contemplate as existing in the immediate future, that increased expenditure upon social Services should take the form ot children's allowances rather than any other form.  They commit themselves to the view that the need for such a service exists to the extent that would justify the increased taxation required for that purpose.</P>
    <P>I submit also that those who support this Bill in the Dáil commit themselves also to the supporting or the tax proposals which will afterwards come before the Dáil in order to enable the necessary sum to be raised.  It is unrortunate that it is not possible for the Dáil to discuss, at one time, all the possible implications of this Bill.  The Bill, as it is introduced, outlines certain charges that will come upon the Exchequer if the Bill is passed, and then, at that stage, the Minister for Finance will bring forward proposals here to meet those charges.  That being the case, we are not now in a position to discuss this Bill fully or possible modifications of it, without immediate reference to the taxation that will follow on it.  We cannot discuss the taxation proposals when they come up, with immediate reference to this Bill, but Deputies who want to approach this question seriously must obviously bear in mind that voting for this Bill puts upon them a moral obligation at some later period to vote for the taxation that will be required to make the implementation of the Bill possible.  It would be a dishonest trick, both on the Dáil and on the people of this country, to support now the establishment of this service and then, at a later stage, to vote against providing the money required for the purpose.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="32" /> In order that Deputies may understand the magnitude of the proposal we are now discussing, I should like to point out that, upon the basis of our experiences in normal times, the raising of a sum of £2,250,000 would require new and additional taxes in respect of the following commodities:&mdash; 1/- in the £ on income tax, 1/- in the lb. on tobacco, 2d. on tea, ½d. on sugar and 1d. a pint on beer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Are these alternatives?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  The sum total of all these taxes would yield less than that sum.  At the present time, these taxes would yield an amount somewhat less than in normal times, but I am putting the case upon the basis of normal pre-war experience.  It would I require the aggregate yield of all these taxes to enable us to provide the amount required to finance this Bill.  I have stated the reasons why children's allowances schemes have been adopted in other countries, and I have expressed the view that the same reasons operate here, and that the same need exists here; that the same cause of want is effective here, and that, consequently, it is desirable that we also should equip ourselves, by means of this new service, to eliminate, if possible, that cause of want.</P>
      <P>I have explained that the Government, after considering each aspect of the matter, including the burden of taxation that the enactment of the measure will involve, has decided that the Bill Should be introduced and that it is prepared to defend it. I know, as I have stated already, that the Dáil is more or less committed in principle to the inauguration of a children's allowances scheme.  I think, however, that a review of the general circumstances should be given here so that those who have, at some stage, the privilege of paying for the establishment of this service will know precisely why these burdens are placed upon them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I propose now to explain the particular form that the Bill has taken.  Clearly there are many alternative methods of operating a children's allowances scheme.  I have indicated already that, in no two countries where schemes now operate, is there similarity either in method of operation or in scope.  We considered all the various alternatives.  We considered, not for a very long time I admit, but nevertheless considered, the principle and method of equalisation funds on the lines of the Dutch and the Hungarian schemes.  We, however, rejected that.  We considered the possibility of providing this service on the basis of contributions and setting up a fund like our Unemployment Insurance Fund to which workers and employers would contribute.  I think that there is a great deal to be said in principle for having a contributory basis for new social service schemes.  I think myself&mdash;it is a personal view&mdash;that if we can get acceptance of the contributory principle, in the matter of expanding social services, we are likely to get more effective progress than if each new social service has to be a direct charge on the Exchequer, and through the Exchequer, on the taxpayers as a whole.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Why does the Minister not indicate that in his Bill, that it is a contributory scheme?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>We have not a contributory scheme, and I am going to explain why we have not.  We decided against the principle of contribution in this case, first of all, because there is no practicable method by which you can obtain contributions except from persons who are employed for wages. Persons working on their own account would not make regular contributions. Clearly, therefore, if we were to adopt the contributory principle, the scheme, would have to be limited in scope, as the unemployment insurance is limited, to persons employed for wages.  In this country a very high <Col N="34" /> proportion of our occupied population is not employed for wages.  Of the heads of families, married men, widowers and widows occupied, totalling about 480,000, 219,000 work for wages.  The balance work on their own account.  They are mainly farmers, but the number would also include fishermen, tradesmen, small shopkeepers, and many other classes. It is clear that if we adopted the contributory principle, this scheme could not apply, except to about one-half of the population.  It would be possible at some stage if it were considered desirable to superimpose on this nation-wide scheme that we propose a contributory scheme applicable only to the definite classes who would pay contributions, but it is not proposed to do that now.  The Government decided for reasons I have indicated upon a State scheme&mdash;the scheme outlined in the Bill, one which provides for administration by the State, and the whole of the cost of which will be defrayed by taxation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now let me deal with the main features of the scheme as it appears in the measure.  Deputies will have noticed that it has these outstanding characteristics.  First of all, we have no means test.  I do not know what the view of the Dáil is likely to be on that aspect of the Bill.  We decided it was desirable from many points of view to get rid of the principle of the means test in relation to this service if possible.  That ensures that there is not the slightest suggestion of charity associated with the allowances.  They will be payable to rich and poor alike, to all persons irrespective of their circumstances. The operation of a means test, as many Deputies know, involves an inquisition into the affairs of families which is often resented and which is, as a general rule, undesirable if avoidable. The means test which at present operates in connection with the old age pensions service or the widows' pensions non-contributory service is, however, limited to income derived from the ownership of property or from a pension or some other asset of that kind.  In this case, however, if we <Col N="35" /> decided to operate a means test we would have to take into account not merely income derived from the ownership of property or a regular income secured through a pension or in some other similar way, but also earnings because clearly, in relation to a service of this kind, the means test, if it is to be just in its operation, would have to take into account all forms of income including earnings of the members of a household.</P>
    <P>Deputies will immediately appreciate the immense difficulty of the task which would confront us if we were to attempt to estimate either, in prospect or retrospect, the income from the earnings of the members of each family.  If we decided to have a means test it would also involve a very substantial increase in the cost of the measure for administrative purposes as well as an increase in the administrative difficulties associated with it.  In fact, taking into account the adjustment in the income-tax code, which the Government contemplates, it may be said that the institution of a means test would involve in administrative costs for the State as much, or almost as much, as is involved in paying the allowances to everybody.  It is proposed to offset the benefit that may be secured by persons in the income-tax paying class through the inauguration of the children's allowance scheme by a reduction in the allowance now made in respect of children under the income-tax code.  It is intended that the allowance now made in the income-tax code should be reduced by £20 in respect of third and later children under the age of 16 years.  The effect of that modification will be that, persons liable to the full rate of tax, will lose roughly about £7 10s. Od. per year per child against the children's allowance of £6 10s. Od. per year per child, while persons liable to the half rate of income-tax will lose about £3 15s. Od. per year per child.  It is not possible to get a completely mathematical adjustment of the allowances under the income-tax code to offset in full the payment of children's allowances, but the broad <Col N="36" /> proposal which is in contemplation&mdash; which may be modified, when Finance Act next year comes before the Dáil, in respect of details&mdash;is designed to secure that, in general, the amount that will be paid out in respect of children's allowances to persons in the income-tax class will be recovered by a modification of the income-tax code.</P>

      <P>I will try to get that figure for the Deputy, but I could not give it now.  It may be possible to say what that modification would have yielded in specific years, but the total yield varies, as the Deputy knows, from year to year and I could not attempt to forecast what the position next year will be.  That is the first feature of the Bill to which I wish to draw specific attention&mdash;that it is proposed to pay these children's allowances without a means test.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Secondly, it is proposed to pay these allowances in addition to all children's allowances at present payable under other social security services.  That, at first sight, might look like piecemeal legislation and be objected to by persons who would like a symmetrical system.  I may say that the Government examined very fully the possibility, as well as the desirability, of co-ordinating all the children's allowances now payable under existing services and those that will be payable under this Bill.  Finally, it appeared clear that to attempt such co-ordination at present might well provide far greater anomalies than would, in fact, be removed by it.  The payment of these allowances in addition to all the other allowances payable under the unemployment insurance scheme, the unemployment assistance scheme or the widows' and orphans' pensions scheme is a simple procedure.  It is likely to be administratively convenient and will involve less unforeseen risks than <Col N="37" /> would accompany an attempt to co-ordinate all those other allowances in a single scheme.  It is, however, desirable that the Dáil should appreciate what is intended.</P>

      <P>They were not difficulties which could not be overcome, if we were prepared to contemplate certain families entitled to benefit under this Bill not getting the full amount of benefit which they would secure when these allowances were paid supplementary to existing allowances.  The difficulties related to the attempt to secure that these allowances would, in all cases, be improved correspondingly. We are proposing here, as I intend to show later, a flat rate allowance, but as Deputies are aware, the allowances under existing services are not flat rate allowances.  Either the payment is higher for the first child than for the second, or is higher for the second than for other children, or there is a tailing-off in the size of the allowance where there is an increased number in the family.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The allowances payable under this Bill will be payable in each of the six-monthly periods for which they are determined, irrespective of any change in the family circumstances in the meantime.  Whether the family becomes richer or poorer, whether the head of the family is employed or unemployed, whether he remains in health or becomes incapacitated or dies, during each of these periods the allowances payable will remain unchanged. The allowance proposed is 2/6 per week for each child under 16 years of age, after the first two.  A family with three children under 16 years of age is above the average in size, and, as I have already mentioned, the intention here is to provide a scheme which would give assistance and relief to families above the average in size.  The average number of children under 16 in families in this State is slightly less <Col N="38" /> than two: it is 1.9 in fact.  Assuming that the average family consists of father, mother and two children, it is only families which are above that in size which will benefit by the Bill.  As I have mentioned already in reply to Deputy Norton, the allowances proposed will be payable on a flat rate babis.  Whether there is one qualified child or a number of qualified children in a family, the payment will be at the rate of 2/6 per week in respect of all.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No, I did not.  I propose to deal with that later.  I have mentioned that the Bill will cost £2,250,000.  It is quite obvious that it would be possible, within that financial limit, to pay less per child to a higher proportion of the children in families or to pay more per child to a smaller number of children.  It is, however, necessary to understand that, because every family of children has a first child and more families have a second than those who have a third, the increase in the number of children in the family in respect of which the allowance will be payable has a very considerable effect upon the financial basis of the proposals.  If we proposed to give 2/6 to all children after the first, instead of after the second, the increase in the cost would be more than 50 per cent.: instead of having to provide £2,250,000 per year we would have to provide £3,500,000.  If we were to give 2/6 to all children, the cost would be £5,250,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If, however, we decided to work only within the financial limit already indicated&mdash;£2,250,000&mdash;and to give the benefit of that expenditure in respect of all children, instead of children after the second, the allowance per child would be only 1/- per week.  It is clear that, in such circumstances, the family with one child, two children or three children would fare better and the family with four or more would fare worse. As the basis of the scheme is to give assistance to larger families, the Government decided upon a payment of 2/6 per week for all children <Col N="39" /> after the second.  I want to make it clear that that decision by the Government is irrevocable.  It comes to the Dáil as the considered opinion of the Government as being the best manner of inaugurating this scheme here, and must be regarded as a matter of confidence.  Other parts of the Bill &mdash;the detailed provisions for the administration of the scheme&mdash;are open for consideration andv discussion by the Dáil and, if satisfactory proposals are brought forward, the Government will be prepared to adopt them.  Upon the size of the allowance and the number of children per family in respect of whom it will be payable, the Government is standing firm; and a defeat of the Bill upon these grounds, or the rejection of these proposals by the Dáil in Committee, would involve the resignation of the Government.</P>
    <P>Under the Bill as it stands, 150,000 families will benefit, the number of children in those families being 620,000 and the number who would qualify for benefit being 340,000. Deputies will observe that the provision governing the qualification of a child is confined to the broad basis that the child lives with and is in the custody, the care and control of the claimant.  There need not be relationship, much less parentage, established. We are proposing to make this payment in respect of all children who qualify by living in families.  The head of the family will be entitled to make application for payment in respect of all children living with him or who are, in his custody, care or control. Children being educated at boarding schools or undergoing treatment in hospitals or resident in institutions at the expense of their parents or guardians are also covered.  Children in reformatory or industrial schools or residing permanently in, or maintained in, institutions where the parent is not liable to make any contribution to their maintenance, are excluded.  The father of the children will be the claimant in 90 per cent. of the cases and he alone will be entitled to receive the allowance.  May I say that, in that regard, the various schemes in operation in other countries show wide <Col N="40" /> variations.  We have decided that it is better that, in normal circumstances, the claimant should be the father, but there is no reason why, as a domestic arrangement, the allowance should not be drawn by the mother of the children.  Leaving aside social questions of one kind or another, the question should be decided by ,the husband and wife and it is proposed to provide by regulation for such an arrangement.  Clearly, there will be cases where the husband, by reason of mental incapacity or other cause, will not be a suitable person to receive the payment.  In such cases, arrangements will be made for making the payment to the mother, but we assume that, in normal cases, unless there is a specific arrangement to the contrary, the father will be the claimant and to him the payment will be made.</P>
    <P>The provision concerning the half-yearly assessment of the amount to be paid has caused some confusion.  Some have even read into it an intention to make half-yearly payments.  That is not what is contemplated.  It is proposed that the circumstances of each family shall be determined every half-year and that payment will continue for the ensuing six months upon the basis of that determination, irrespective of changes in the family meantime. If it is decided that, on the 1st January, a particular family has two or three children qualified, even if there should be in that family another arrival, or if one of the qualifying children should die or pass over the age of 16, nevertheless, for the whole of that period of six months, payment will be made upon the determination arrived at at the beginning of the period.</P>

      <P>What I meant to ask the Minister was how often the payments would be made.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The payments will be made weekly.  I propose to deal with that matter also.  I wanted to explain the proposal regarding the half-yearly assessment because it has caused some misunderstanding.  It will be obvious <Col N="41" /> that this method of operation simplifies administration.  If we had to give effect, in respect of the amount of the allowances, to changes in the size of a family, immediately or soon after those changes occurred, then the administrative problem involved would be greatly complicated.  By this system of determining the circumstances of a family every six months and paying for the ensuing six months upon that determination, irrespective of changes in the family, we get simplified administration, which will not merely ensure avoidance of disputes and difficulties but also minimise the cost.  The intention is to have adjustments as infrequently as possible.  They will not, in fact, be made at all during the six-monthly period except where it is clear that there has been dishonesty, resulting in overpayment, in which case the Minister is given power to recover, as a civil debt, the amount of such overpayment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Another provision of the Bill which has led to some misunderstanding is the proposal to divide the country into regions for the purpose of administration. Let me make quite clear that there will be no difference as between one region and another in respect of the date on which the scheme will come into operation, or the amount of payment.  The purpose of that division into regions is purely to solve an obvious administrative difficulty.  If we were to have half-yearly re-examination of the circumstances of each family, and if there were 150,000 families, on the average, to be dealt with, a great deal of work would have to be done in a couple of weeks every period of six months, involving administrative and staff difficulties of an obvious kind.  In order to avoid these difficulties and spread the work over the year, it is proposed that the date for reviewing the circumstances of each family be a different one for each of three districts.  We shall divide the country, roughly, into three parts, with an equal number of recipients in each part, and we shall have a different reviewing date for each area, thus ensuring the spread over the <Col N="42" /> whole year of this business of reviewing the circumstances of families and issuing new vouchers qualifying for payment during the ensuing period. In order to get that scheme into operation, while, at the same time, bringing the Act into force on the same date everywhere, it is necessary to have preliminary periods of varying lengths in each of the three districts. In so far as any advantage or disadvantage might result from this system of dividing the country into regions, it will result only in connection with these preliminary periods.  In the first region, the preliminary period may be six months.  In the second region, the preliminary period may be four months, and in the third region, it may be only two months.  That will not affect the amount the family may receive in the period, but it will mean that in a particular region there will be a review of the family circumstances in a period of less than six months.  That will apply only at the beginning of the scheme.  After the first review, reviews will be in regular, recurring periods of six months <i>ad infinitum.</i>  In so far as there will be a review of family circumstances in a shorter period than six months in the beginning, some families may gain and some families may lose, but it is obvious that no substantial injustice is being done.</P>
    <P>It is contemplated that, the family circumstances having been determined and the amount of the children's allowances payable to the family having been ascertained, the head of the family will receive a book of cheques or vouchers&mdash;whatever you wish to call them&mdash;each of which will be cashable in a particular week during the ensuing six months.  After the assessment has been made and the amount payable to the family has been determined, the head of the family will get this book of vouchers or cheques on which, subject to regulations yet to be made, he will draw upon the basis of presenting one per week, in much the same way as is done in the case of widows' and orphans' pensions at the present time.  That is not <Col N="43" /> provided for in the Bill.  It is contemplated that these details will be dealt with by regulation.</P>
    <P>As Deputies know, and as I know from personal experience, the big difficulty in relation to new social services of this kind is getting them into operation. Once you get such a scheme into operation, it can be made to run fairly smoothly.  Staffs know what they have to do, the public know what they have to do and unforeseen difficulties are eradicated.  It is in the first period of six or 12 months that special difficulties emerge and that regulations which looked all right upon paper, when first drafted, have to be modified to meet these difficulties.  Therefore, we are proposing to leave to be dealt with by regulation these matters of detail, the method of payment, and other matters of that kind.</P>
    <P>As Deputies will have noticed, we have an omnibus section in the Bill which gives the Minister power, within the period of 12 months after the date on which the Act comes into operation, to make any changes which appear to him to be necessary in order to get the Act working properly.  That is a general power of a somewhat wide character, but it will operate only for 12 months.  It is intended to ensure that problems which will inevitably arise, but which we cannot foresee at the moment, can be smoothly dealt with without the delay involved in bringing in amending legislation.</P>
    <P>I think I have dealt with the main provisions of the Bill.  I have stated the principles which justify the introduction of the measure.  I have intimated the cost and how it will have to be met, and I have given the reasons why the Government decided upon the method of paying children's allowances. The question of the method is open for debate in the Dáil.  Deputies may be able to foresee difficulties which I have not anticipated, or to suggest provisions better than those contained in the Bill for the purpose of meeting the anticipated difficulties.  I will be glad to get suggestions of that kind.</P>
    <P>In respect of matters of detail, I ask the co-operation of the Dáil.  It is necessary <Col N="44" /> to repeat that, in so far as the amount of money to be paid out in the form of children's allowances is concerned, it is not possible to allow the matter to be decided here.  I do not say that the House is not entitled so to decide, but a decision against the Government involves a matter of confidence. The Government have fully considered this question.  We have the responsibility at a later stage of proposing the taxation that will be a consequence of the Bill, and we could not agree that the Dáil should take a decision on the question of cost now without having very definitely in mind the taxation problem that will subsequently arise.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. W.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It would have been of some advantage to the House if that portion of the Minister's speech relating to details had been circulated among Deputies in the form of a paper. When Bills are submitted to members of the Dáil, it is a waste of public time to have to read and re-read them, unless there is some indication as to the intentions of the Minister.  One would have assumed from this Bill that it was intended to put it into operation in Connemara in the immediate future, and in the Borough of Dun Laoghaire in 12 months' time.  One would also have assumed that it was intended to pay the allowances, every six months. There is no indication in the measure that it is proposed to pay the allowances weekly.  I have spoken of this matter so often here in connection with various Bills, that it would seem to be of little use to repeat my suggestion, that a little information accompanying each Bill would save considerable correspondence with the Minister's Department and also the time of persons outside.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister's treatment of this measure would lead us to believe that he has acceded to the recommendations or suggestions of persons in every political Party, and of most of the people outside.  He says that this is not only the best scheme, but it is the only sensible scheme, and it is the only method of dealing with this matter.  Then he goes on to say that it is going to cost £2,250,000 and that you are committing <Col N="45" /> yourself to the imposition of that amount by way of taxation.  I should like to differ with the Minister in this connection.  It does not appear to me that this is a good scheme at all.  I am not quarrelling with the amount of money involved from the State.  With that I am in a measure of agreement&mdash; in more agreement than I have ever been on any other matter that I have had experience of under this Government for the last 11 years.  I think in respect of the sum involved, which I have estimated to be about £2,500,000, I am in more agreement than I have ever been with this Government&mdash;that is, if it is possible for a person such as myself to be in agreement with persons such as they, and that is a very big speculation.</P>
    <P>The Minister refers to this as social security.  What social security is there in it?  Assuming I were voicing the same nonsense as I have heard from the benches over there for five years from Ministers and their supporters, assuming I were to say what they would say, that Ministers are going to provide allowances for children in excess of 1.9 in each family, the crossroads would have been scenes of fire and brimstone.  My view about social security is that the matter should be considered from the point of view of providing sufficient subsistence for every family in the State.  I take it from the Minister's statement that that is beyond the administrative capacity of the Ministry and the Civil Service. I do not believe it is beyond the capacity of any other Ministry or of a Civil Service, properly handled.  Is not that the essence of the Beveridge Report? We got a single paragraph read out of that.  The essence of that report and, I think, the intention of the Ministry which set up the commission of inquiry was to ensure that, by reason of the suggested alterations that would take place in the social services of the State there, a sufficiency would be provided for every family in the State against want and all the evils that flow from want.  We are not doing that.  A man here may be earning 30/- a week, he may have two children, but he benefits nothing by this scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="46" /> The Beveridge Report, as I have said on many occasions, is not indicating social security, is not a social service or a panacea at all.  It is designed to ensure that the population of Great Britain is going to expand, that there will be more marriages, that there will be a greater number of children.  The one thing that operates against marriages in this country, and early marriages in particular, is the insufficiency of income.  During a period here from 1933 to 1938 the average wage of the agricultural labourer was £1 a week. While £1 a week was the average wage paid to those employed by farmers, the average income of the farmer was less than that during some of the periods.</P>
    <P>I am in disagreement with the Minister regarding the basis of his scheme. In my view, the scheme ought to be a contributory scheme, paid for by the person in national health insurance, by the employer, and with a subvention from the State, and an amount equivalent to what is given here should be made available.  On that basis you would have an allowance of 2/6 a week paid for each child.  It would not involve a very severe extra payment.  It would be a better system than this one. This system, in so far as it is described as a system of social security, lacks practically all the characteristics of a scheme of social security.  There is one extra patch, and it is a very nice question whether the patch is even of the pattern of the article patched.</P>
    <P>The cost of administration of social services in this State is enormous.  In my view, for what it is worth, this service should not be administered by the Minister's Department at all.  It does not come either within the Department of Industry and Commerce or the Department of Supplies, and, in so far as it is a social service at all, it could be very much better handled by the department which is handling national health insurance.  Even in the case of national health insurance it, in my opinion, should have been divorced from the Department in charge of it at present.  The Minister for Industry and Commerce, as such, is an entirely different personage from the one who should be dealing with this service.  It <Col N="47" /> is unlikely that he has gone into the question that I have already dealt with, namely that of a census of certain districts of the country showing what is the weekly income in a wage-earning family.  I wonder would it be possible to get that information before the Bill passes through the Dáil?  I think it ought to be. Without the information one cannot say off-hand whether this half-crown a week, even in the case of families of eight or ten people, is sufficient.  It may be only a patch upon a patch.  If the policy of the scheme is to improve the health of the, people, to make them less liable to disease and the disorders which arise from malnutrition, then it is obvious that we ought to have a social survey such as has been taken at the other side.  Such a survey is the basis of the Beveridge Report.</P>
    <P>The Minister read one paragraph from that report.  I propose to refer to another which gives a measure of the social reform which is recommended there.  It deals with ensuring that every family in Great Britain will have a sufficient income.  It also urges that certain expenses which have arisen out of the varying forms of social service, or social legislation, over a long period should be minimised. Let me take what is called industrial assurance.  It points out that premiums received by the industrial insurance offices over a year were £74,000,000, and that the expenses of management were nearly £24,000,000. Let no member of the House misunderstand that statement.  It has reference to what is called life insurance, endowments and insurance which is payable at the death of a person.  We have, at any rate, the statement that £74,000,000 were collected, and that the expenses were nearly £24,000,000. Is there anything in the form of industrial insurance in this country which is likely to be as costly as that?  I believe that while we have not reached the high efficiency which has been developed over a long period of years in British industrial offices, the expenses here in connection with industrial insurance would be in excess of that.  Now, that is waste if a service <Col N="48" /> such as that could be administered by the State, and there is no reason why it should not.  As Deputy McGilligan might put it, there is a considerable amount of &ldquo;slack&rdquo; to be got from wasteful administrative costs on these social services.</P>
    <P>Let us suppose that one of the recommendations of Sir William Beveridge&mdash; the payment of a sum of money at death&mdash;were adopted.  In regard to that there is twice and a half times more money collected for industrial insurance than there is in national health insurance.  Over the long period of 15 years we have had here some amendments of the Workmen's Compensation Acts.  That is a matter that is dealt with in this report of Sir William Beveridge, mainly with a view to correcting the waste there is in connection with that public service.  When a man gets injured he is paid perhaps for a period.  The matter is one between him and the society.  Perhaps he rushes into debt.  After six months or so a settlement is arrived at.  He probably clears his debts with the little money that he has in hand, but when he resumes his industrial occupation he is not as efficient as he was before the accident.  The suggestion in this report is that accidents should be in the same form as disease, and that a man should be entitled to get paid.  In the case of negligence on behalf of an employer, there is no reason why the man would not have a right to action in connection with the negligence.</P>

      <P>There is before the House a concrete measure which proposes to grant children's allowances.  The Dáil is not debating the Beveridge Report, nor social security in general, nor the cost of industrial assurance in Great Britain, nor amendment of the Workmen's Compensation Act.  The Minister referred to one paragraph of the Beveridge Report, relevant to the need for children's allowances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I take it that under this Bill social services can be extended or restricted.  The Bill is capable of extension or restriction.  There is no earthly reason why twice the number of children should not be brought in <Col N="49" /> under it, or why other things than children could not be included.  The real point with regard to it is that the Minister said the Bill was designed to relieve want.  We have got no information as to how many it is anticipated will be relieved of want by reason of this measure, nor did we get any information as to the number of families, subject to income-tax charges, which are going to be affected by it. The Minister says it is not possible to co-ordinate the administration of this measure with the various other social services at present being administered by different Departments.  I cannot accept that.  It is inconceivable to me. At the moment we have national health insurance, unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance, home help and supplementary additions to unemployment assistance.  Surely it ought to be possible to amalgamate the administration of these various services and thus lessen the cost.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister was not particularly helpful to the House in connection with these proposals.  He stated that he did not propose to have a contributory service.  One advantage of a contributory service is that a person who derives benefit or expects to derive benefit is independent.  There is a contribution from himself in such a case.  There is a difficulty where a large number of people are not employed. The Minister would have the advantage of seeing how that could be dealt with if he had read the Beveridge Report, which contemplates contributions not only from persons in gainful occupation, but by persons in gainful occupation on their own account.  It does not appear to be difficult to get small employers to take out cards to which stamps will be affixed.  Consider the position of small farmers.  It may happen that small employers are sometimes puzzled at the number of returns they have to deal with and the number of stamps they have to affix.  But that is not an impossible task.  It may be that we find it impossible to do here what was recommended after careful examination <Col N="50" /> across the water.  I must say that I cannot accept that view.  To my mind the Minister has fallen down on this matter, having a certain amount of money available.  Assuming that he accepts that statement, the Government has not sought to expand that from any other source.  There is every good reason why it should be done, assuming that there is a sufficient number of families in this State needing 2/6 for every child.  It is on that basis the proposals have shown their real weakness.</P>
    <P>I am satisfied that if the Minister and his Department had made a study of the recommendations in the Beveridge Report, they would have got the information they required as far as making this a contributory scheme goes.  It is true that this scheme is not a contributory one as far as family allowances are concerned. It is true that the recommendations of the Beveridge Report are that the State should pay family allowances, but it is made evident in that report, that as regards social security, every person in Great Britain with an income under £420 yearly should be a contributory person.  Having laid that down after great preparation it ensures that, so far as persons with families are concerned, with the exception of the first child, they will have sufficient income, will be free from want, and consequently from disease, from malnutrition and the other evils to which reference has been made.</P>
    <P>The Dáil happens to be a little different from a schoolroom and if a Minister comes here to explain a Bill he does not do so as if before a blackboard saying, &ldquo;whatever I am saying you have to subscribe to.&rdquo;  It is for the Dáil to decide and to see that the administration of the various State services is properly carried out, and to say what sum has to be levied by way of taxation.  The mere addition of £2,250,000 does not qualify the Minister to say that we have to vote for these proposals.  The real mistake he made was, that he sat down within <Col N="51" /> his own restricted conclave of Ministers, and put up these proposals and was probably backed by the best advice that he could get from civil servants.  Deputies have the last word. We happen to be a little too grown up to accept that kind of treatment in this House.  In my view the general administration of this State could not be more extravagant, and it is not efficient. The proposals in this measure are not designed to make the social services of this State efficient, and we fail also to achieve the real purpose of social services, to eliminate want amongst families.  In that respect this measure is short of what we hoped it would be.  Considering the number of families that the Bill will affect, the real purpose of a social service of this sort should be to ensure, where there are children, that nobody would be in want.  That purpose, I regret, is not achieved where the family allowance is only to be paid in respect of the third and subsequent children.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I welcome the proposal to provide family allowances for children in this State, realising as I do that the provision of such allowances is one of the ways of supplementing the family income and, in that way, one of the best means of helping to provide families with a better standard of life. While I welcome the principle of providing children's allowances, I am afraid this Bill has many obvious limitations, and I am not satisfied that these limitations could not have been overcome if the Government had given more study to the question of providing children's allowances, by endeavouring to co-ordinate a scheme of children's allowances with other social services which are operative in the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>At first blush it might seem that any family in which there were four children could obtain allowances under this Bill, but closer examination seems to me to reveal this disparity, that it is possible for a family to have four children, aged eight, 12, 14, 16 or 17 and, although the family income may be certified to be low, they will get no allowance under a Bill of this kind. <Col N="52" /> The two eldest children will be disqualified because they will not be &ldquo;qualified children&rdquo; under the Bill, and the other two will not qualify for the allowance because there must be three children in the family in order to qualify for it.  While starting to provide a scheme of children's allowances we are apparently willing to pass over cases in which parents with four children cannot get one penny under the terms of the Bill.  It is also possible to take a family with six children, four being over 16 years, and two under 16, yet notwithstanding the fact that there are six children, no allowance will be paid in cases of that kind.  I shall come back to that part of the Bill later.  What strikes me about the Bill is the smallness of the allowances provided.  We are providing children's allowances of 2/6 a week.  If we were considering this Bill in 1938, we would scarcely have made the allowances less than 2/6.  Even in the circumstances of 1938 I think the Minister will agree that an allowance of 2/6 to each qualified child was not a very generous allowance; but when we come to fix 2/6, in the circumstances of 1943, when the cost of living has increased by 64 per cent. compared with 1939, I think such a provision is inadequate. In fact, the Government would have got nation-wide support for a scheme of raising the allowance to 5/- per week.  Everybody in the State recognises that the inauguration of a scheme of children's allowances will make a valuable contribution to an equitable redistribution of national income, and will, in its own way, provide families with a better standard of living than that which obtains in the case of many to-day.</P>
    <P>The Minister, in the course of his speech, which, I am glad to say, was an unusually informative one for the Minister, told us it was necessary to make provision of this kind in order to make up the lag in family income and in order to provide for those families where the standard wage or the family wage is not sufficient to provide them with a reasonable standard of life.  It has to be admitted here and everywhere throughout the world that <Col N="53" /> social services are more necessary in countries in which the standard of living of the people is low, and in so far as you have large masses of the people living in conditions of poverty, actual and relative, large masses of the people unemployed, or with a low wage code and a low standard of living, in order to avoid sheer starvation and obviate a deteriorating social and economic position, social services must be provided; but to the extent to which they have to be provided to cater for such circumstances as these, as distinct from their provision as a means of raising the family income, to that extent you confess that the economic structure of the nation is far from satisfactory.</P>
    <P>Children's allowances will not be a substitute for family wages.  Children's allowances on a scale of 2/6 per child, after the first two children, will be no substitute for a decent standard of wages.  They will be a small substitute for regular employment and will provide very little sustenance in the case of unemployment.  What we as a nation have to aim at is the providing of the maximum amount of employment possible for our people, and to the extent that we fail to provide that employment, to that extent will we find it necessary to resort not merely to this type of social service, or social salve, as one might call it, but to other types of social services, if one may so describe them, which take the form of the provision of free fuel and free milk. The recipients of all these benefits would much prefer to have a decent wage, so that they could buy fuel, milk and other commodities in the same way as Deputies buy these commodities; but to the extent that we fail to provide these people with that decent standard of life, with full employment at decent rates of wages, to that extent we shall find it necessary to introduce social services or social salves of this kind.</P>
    <P>In so far as this makes any contribution to relieving poverty and lifting up low wage standards, it will be welcomed by every progressive-minded person in the House and in the country generally; but, as I said to the Minister, I do not think he is going sufficiently <Col N="54" /> far by providing allowances of 2/6 per week.  Let us take the case of an agricultural worker.  His present rate of wages is 36/- per week, and it is one of the wonders of the country how he manages to keep a wife and family on such a wage.  Let us take his case to illustrate the point I made earlier.  Suppose he has four children, aged 12, 14, 16 and 17.  If it is intended to improve that man's standard of living by providing children's allowances, this Bill does not carry out that intention, because two of the children are not qualified to be reckoned as members of the family for the purpose of the Bill, and the other two do not pass over the datum line which qualifies them for payment of even one allowance; so that in that case of a man with four children, not a single one will receive the allowance.</P>
    <P>I think that may well be typical of a large number of agricultural workers, and if our object is to lift up the standard of living of persons who are below what might, in our circumstances, be considered a reasonable standard, I suggest that the Bill ought to be altered in order to cover cases of that kind, because, if it is passed in its present form, and with its present restrictions, you may well find large numbers of lowly-paid agricultural workers and other workers disqualified from benefit because of the provisions of the Bill to which I have adverted.  However much the Minister is anchored to his £2,250,000, or to other features of the Bill, I suggest that, in reason, he ought not to try, because of general sympathy with the Bill, to push it through in that form, but ought to listen to a reasonable request that the Bill be amended to cover cases of the kind to which I have referred.</P>
    <P>On the general question of the allowances, I think that having regard to the standard of living which large numbers of our people are forced to tolerate, to the fact that there is endemic poverty in many parts of the country and that, generally speaking, large numbers of our people have a low standard of living, the Minister might very well have come in with a much more vigorous scheme of children's allowances.  So far as the raising <Col N="55" /> of the necessary moneys is concerned, there are fruitful sources of income within the country which might be tapped in respect of these allowances. If we look at the returns published by the Revenue Commissioners, we will discover about 2,500 people who rake in between them an income of about £7,000,000 a year.  The Taoiseach may scarcely believe that, but it is perfectly true.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>I am thinking how much they have left&mdash;how much of it is taken by the State.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>None of them is parting with the balance in order to get over the hardships imposed by State taxation, and I know a few people who would gladly swap places with them, even though the State has a rakeoff from their income.  I think the Taoiseach would not have to go far to discover a few more.  In our circumstances, a good case can be made for the payment of children's allowances in respect of the first and each succeeding child.  I know that will cost money, but I know, too, that it is only by making a substantial contribution from State sources to many lowly-paid workers that you can hope, in our cirstances, to put up the family income. That matter might well have been examined by the Government, and, indeed, the whole scheme of children's allowances should have been examined by a representative committee which would have been able to give the Government a national viewpoint in respect of children's allowances and to recommend a scheme of allowances which would probably get universal support in the country.</P>
      <P>There is one aspect of the Bill which puzzles me, and that is, why the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be in charge of it.  It does not seem to be industry and it is scarcely related to commerce.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely children are a very valuable industry?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>I did not think it was one that needed so much protection as, apparently, the Deputy does.  But <Col N="56" /> this does not seem to me to be related to Industry or Commerce at all.  I am wondering why the Minister has taken on the responsibility for administering this scheme of children's allowances, which I think is entirely separated from similar Departments in any other country in the world where this scheme of social services is administered. One could understand its being administered by the Local Government Department.  One might understand an effort being made to co-ordinate the various social services. But I am puzzled to know why this scheme is being administered by the Department of Industry and Commerce, because it seems to me to have no close relation to any of the normal activities of that Department.  In respect of this type of social legislation&mdash;social legislation which takes the form of old age pensions, unemployment assistance, widows' and orphans' pensions and unemployment insurance &mdash;it would be very much better if all these services were co-ordinated into a Ministry of Social Services, so that we might endeavour to co-ordinate the services and to administer them without the inevitable wastefulness and overlapping which are inseparable from the administration of these schemes by the different Departments.  As it is, our social legislation is growing up in a higgledy-piggledy way, one Department administering one type of social service and another Department administering another type of service.  A new service seems to bear very little relation to an existing service, with the result that our code of social legislation, such as it is, is growing up in a spreadeagle way without any real co-ordination or without any effort being made to avoid the wasteful expenditure which goes hand in hand with the separate administration of these schemes.  I hope that the Minister, or the Taoiseach, if he speaks on the matter, will give us some indication that the Government realise the necessity for co-ordination of the various social services, so that we can get an efficient Ministry of Social Services, and so that its task would be related solely to the promotion of the greatest measure of efficiency in the administration of our social services.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="57" /> There are other aspects of this Bill which I suppose can be left for the Committee Stage.  But, perhaps, it might be no harm to mention in passing, so that the Minister might look into the matter before the Committee Stage, that while we exclude in this Bill the calculation of children's allowances for the purpose of widows' and orphans' pensions allowances and for certain other claims under other social services, we appear to make it possible for a local authority to calculate children's allowances in ascertaining the means of an applicant for home assistance.  I do not know whether that was definitely intended, but it appears to be the position from this Bill that a local authority can take into consideration children's allowances in ascertaining the means of an applicant for home assistance.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely the local authority takes into account an applicant's needs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Maybe so.  But, in 1935, when the Widows' and Orphans' Bill was going through the Dáil, I think I raised that matter and stated that the State ought not, by providing widows' and orphans' pensions, relieve the local authority of the obligation of relieving need in the case of applicants for home assistance.  So impressed was the Minister for Local Government of that day with the point, that he put into the Widows' and Orphans' Bill of 1935 the provision in Section 54 which reads:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;In granting relief, otherwise than in an institution, to a person in receipt of or entitled to receive a pension, a public assistance authority shall not take into consideration any such pension, except so far as such pension exceeds 5/- a week.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It was recognised in 1935 that unless you did this, the local authority would calculate the income under the Widows' and Orphans' Act for the purpose of ascertaining the means of the applicant for home assistance.  I suggest to the Minister that, unless <Col N="58" /> some similar provision is put into this Bill, the local authority will be entitled to do in respect of children's allowances what the Minister for Local Government felt they ought not to be allowed to do in respect of the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act. I suggest to the Minister that the point is well worth consideration having regard to what was done on a previous occasion.</P>
    <P>The one other point I want to refer to is the provisions of Section 19 of the Bill.  Section 19 gives the Minister power, within one year after the passing of the Act, to do certain things, the things being these:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If in any respect any difficulty arises in bringing into operation this Act, the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, may by Order do anything which appears to be necessary or expedient for bringing this Act into operation ....&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So far as that part of the section is concerned, I think everybody will approve of the power given to the Minister. But the section goes on to read:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;and any such Order may modify the provisions of this Act so far as may appear necessary or expedient for carrying the Order into effect.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I do not know to what extent the Minister may be obliged to avail of the powers given in Section 19, or to what extent he would desire to avail of it. So far as this is merely exercising power of a routine character to facilitate the coming into operation of the Act, one can understand the provisions of this section.  But, if the Minister is taking power to modify, to the disadvantage of applicants, the provisions of the Bill after it passes the Dáil, the Minister ought, in these circumstances, to agree that any such Order which he makes should be laid on the Table of the House, so as to give the Dáil an opportunity of discussing any amendment of the Bill after it had left the House.  I think that is a reasonable claim.  If the Minister feels that he is only going to exercise that power in a routine way, nobody will cavil at <Col N="59" /> that.  But, if the Minister feels that any Order which he makes modifies the provisions of the Bill so as to reduce its value or to make it more difficult for persons to secure benefits, then I think the Minister might consent to lay that Order on the Table of the House so that the House would have an opportunity of discussing the matter.  It would not, as the Minister knows, impede his right to proceed with the terms of the Order, but it would give the House an opportunity of discussing the matter and give the Minister an opportunity of hearing the views of the House on any matter which it was felt desirable to discuss in the House.</P>
    <Speaker pid="MichaelDonnellan" hpid="Mr. Donnellan Mr. Donnellan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Donnellan</NameTxt>
      <P>We, on these benches, feel it our duty to congratulate the Minister on the Bill.  Of course, there are faults in every Bill, but we, on these benches, believe it is a step in the right direction and we hope that the day will come when it can be extended further and that the national income will be increased in such a way that all children under the age of 16 will be in a position to get an allowance without inflicting any undue hardship on the community. One matter I wish to congratulate the Minister upon is that the means test is not to be applied under this Bill. I only hope that that is a forerunner of the time when other Departments will do likewise, and that the means test will not apply to old age pensions.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know this Bill will be a Godsend in rural areas, as one coming from a rural area.  I have one suggestion to make to the Minister, which I would ask him to take very seriously.  I would suggest that the allowance should be made payable to the mothers.  The mother is the chief parent.  As a father, I do not wish to say anything against fathers, but I would ask the Minister seriously to consider that point, because he realises, and every man here realises, that the mother is the chief guardian of the family.  In all sincerity, I would suggest to the Minister to accept in the Bill the principle that the money should be made available to the mother. <Col N="60" /> If that is done, I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the money will be definitely of more value to the family, because this allowance is more or less to help in the provision of clothes and things like that, and, of course, the mother has the chief responsibility in that direction.  I do not wish to delay the House, but I would ask the Minister seriously to consider that point.  By putting the Bill through with the amendment I have suggested, I believe he will have added immensely to the value of the measure.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>I join with the other Deputies in welcoming the Bill as a new step, at any rate, in legislation of this kind.  It is a beginning, and I think it should be welcomed as such.  I think it is only fair to say that, if there is one Deputy who can claim chief credit for this, it is Deputy Dillon.  I remember being in the House&mdash;I think over 12 months ago&mdash;when Deputy Dillon first raised this question here in what I, at any rate, consider was easily the best speech he ever made in the House.  I think most of us who have been a long time in public life have become rather cynical about the value of speech-making.  I think most of us who have contested elections for 20 or more years have come to the conclusion that speech-making, at the chapel gates, for instance, rarely makes converts. It is resorted to in order to create enthusiasm and make people go to the polls.  I was cynical, as a matter of fact, with regard to the value of speech-making, but I admit that Deputy Dillon's speech in the House on that occasion with regard to children's allowances immediately converted me.  I had not given the subject any great thought until I heard him make that speech.  Certainly, I thought he made a most convincing case for the adoption of a scheme of children's allowances, or family allowances, as I think he called them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Everybody in the Dáil, naturally, like Deputy Norton and Deputy Donnellan, would wish that we could go further in this direction but the fact of the matter is, of course, that the Minister in control of the Bill is the person who is responsible for levying the taxes, or at any rate the Government <Col N="61" /> of the day are responsible for levying the taxes to pay for this.  I think we can allow that all Parties in the House, whether they are in the Government Benches or any other benches, would be equally in favour of extending the provisions of the Bill if that were financially feasible at the moment.  The Minister has told us that it will cost £2,250,000&mdash;and that, of course, is a substantial sum in a country such as ours&mdash;and he, fairly enough, from his point of view, put it to us that, if we are supporting this Bill, we must be in a position to say that we will support the necessary taxation to provide the money.  I suppose the Minister has in mind his own performances when he was on this side of the House, because there was nobody who could argue so strongly for social services and, at the same time, there was nobody more denunciatory about high taxation when the Budget was under discussion, than he. But, at the same time, I accept what he has put forward as being fair play. He has said that, if we support this measure, we must be equally prepared to support the necessary taxation.</P>
    <P>I, for one, in order to have a measure of this kind, would certainly be prepared to support taxation to the extent that he put forward or such other taxation as may be preferable to the items of taxation that he put forward. I think this is a sufficiently big step to justify an increase in taxation, and it is a sufficiently valuable step, because, having put on record that we accept this principle of children's allowances, the further extension of that principle to apply, later on, to every child, I am perfectly certain, eventually will come.  People's consciences have to grow to these things.  Twenty-five, 20 or even 10 or 12 years ago, these things were hardly thought of.  Even in the countries the Minister mentioned, I understand, they are of fairly modern institution.  But there is no doubt that when we have become more and more used to the idea, a demand will arise for the extension of this service in the future, and, of course, people will also have to foot the bill.</P>
    <P>As a matter of fact, I would join with Deputy Donnellan in wishing that <Col N="62" /> the mother should be made the claimant, but from what I gathered from the Minister's speech, I think that can be an arrangement within the family and I think that might be even more desirable.  There would be certain cases where it might not be at all advisable that the mother should bo the person who would be handling the money.  If the arrangement can be made within the family that the mother can be made the claimant, then I think the Bill as it stands will be all right from that point of view.</P>
    <P>I do not think the Minister developed the matter sufficiently to make it clear as to what is the intention with regard to the adjustment of the income-tax code.  Everybody, of course, will agree that persons who will benefit from the provisions of this Bill, should not get, as the same time, income-tax relief in respect of tlie same children, but what I want to know is this: Let us take the type of family to which Deputy Norton has referred: a family in which there are four children, two of whom are just over 16 vears of age, and two under 16; and let us suppose that the head of that family is a payer of income-tax.  As things are at present, I understand that he can claim income-tax relief in respect of all the four children: in other words, none of his children come within the provisions of this Bill.  Now, will that person be in the same position in the future as he has been in the past?  Can he claim income-tax relief still, in respect of the four children, since the provisions of this Bill do not apply to him?  To put it differently, if there is a person in the income-tax group, to whom this Bill does not apply at all, can he still continue to claim relief of income-tax in respect of his children?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I am assuming they were at such a school, and that the person concerned was entitled to claim relief in respect of these children, will this Bill affect him, or will he not be entitled to claim the same relief?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I would say to the Deputy that the actual terms of this proposal will appear in the Finance Bill, when it comes before the House. The only thing I can say at the moment is that it is the intention to recover from income-tax payers the amount to which such income-tax payers will benefit under the provisions of this Bill; and the obvious way of doing that is by effecting a reduction in the allowances now made, when it, comes to assessing the amount of allowances to be given in respect of children's allowances under this Bill.  It would appear to me that a reduction of, say, £20 in that allowance should secure the recovery of the amount payable to these children in respect of allowances. It may be that modifications will be made in this respect, but that will be the responsibility of the Minister for Finance, and such modifications, if any, will be set out by that Minister when the Finance Bill comes before the Dáil.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, I agree that persons who may benefit under the provisions of this Bill should not be allowed, at the same time, to claim relief in income-tax in respect of their children.  Suppose that a person is not getting the children's allowances and has children, I want to get an assurance that such a person will be able to claim the relief that he has been getting already under the Finance Acts, and that he will not be affected by the allowances that are proposed under this Bill.  A great many people with children are worried about this, and: want to know whether the provisions of this Bill will be operated to their disadvantage.  Can the Minister tell me anything about that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The general aim will be to ensure that persons in the income tax-paying classes will sacrifice some part of their tax allowance so as to off-set this, but I could not deal now with the precise machinery that will be necessary in order to bring that about.  It is a very complicated matter, and I suggest that the Deputy should bring it up when concrete proposals come <Col N="64" /> before the Dáil, in connection with this matter, under the Finance Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Lynch Mr. Lynch">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lynch</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well.  Deputy Norton, I think, made a strong case: the case of, say, an agricultural worker with four children, two of whom have juat passed 16 years of ago, thus removing the two younger children from any benefit under the provisions of the Bill.  I suppose, of course, that not alone the agricultural workers, but other sections of the community, would be affected in that way, and that it will be a matter of general application. I think it should be possible to make some provision to alleviate the hardships that might be entailed by such a provision in these cases.  I do not suggest that any child over, for instance, 16 years of age, should benefit, but where you have a family of six children, four of whom are just immediately over 16, and ranging from that up to 17, 18 or 19 years of age, and two of whom are underneath 16 years of age, I think it should be possible for some arrangement to be made whereby the definition of a child, for purposes of that kind, would include children under 18, while providing at the same time that no person over 16 would draw the 2/6 a week.  I think that something might be done in that direction.  I admit that, probably, that would make things more complicated, but undoubtedly you have the case of low wage-earners with four or five children, who will be excluded from the benefits because only two of the children' are under 16 years of age, whereas the other children are barely over that age.  I suggest that that would be rather hard on such a person.</P>
      <P>In conclusion, I should like to repeat that I am glad to see the introduction of this Bill, because I believe that it is a first step in this type of legislation, and because I believe that, as a result of it, we can look forward to an extension in the future of the principles underlying the Bill, according as people's, consciences, as it were, become educated up to that point.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>If this measure is an indication of the acceptance of a principle, it is an advance; but if it is intended as a contribution towards a solution of the poverty problem, it is no contribution at all.  The Minister described it as a social security service. I fail to see what social security there can accrue from the receipt of 2/6d. a week for the third child in a family where 36/- a week or less is the income.  I fall to see what security there can be for a widow with three or four children, where one of them only is to receive 2/6d. a week.  I fail to see where that can be described as social security in any sense of the word.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister warns us in advance that, under no circumstances, is there to be any change, as to the number to be included or the amount of money to be expended.  Might I, without infringing on that exclusion, remind him that in a similar service that allowance is not regarded at all as adequate, under the Department of Local Government and Public Health, where children are boarded out and are being paid for by the local authority.  If the Minister would refer to pages 81 and <Col N="66" /> 82 of the Local Government Department Report for 1940-41, he will find that there were 2,381 boarded-out children and that the local authorities, with the sanction of that Department, paid £40,598 for the maintenance of those 2,381 children.  That was equal to £17 per head.  The Minister says now that, in respect of a national responsibility, he will pay only £6 10s. 6d. per annum per head.  It seems to me that the local authorities whom we are seeking to manacle, and in some cases destroy, had a greater conception of their duty towards children than the national Government, has. There is a very big difference between £6 10s. 0d. and £17, and figures are available if the Minister wishes to check it.  I hope the Minister will make some compromise between the amount which the local authorities thought desirable for boarded-out children and what the Government thinks desirable in respect of the children of the nation as a whole.  Otherwise, when he is describing this service I hope he will give it its proper name and not call it a social security service when it gives no security whatever against poverty.</P>
    <P>The Minister did not give sufficient information in regard to the provisions of the Bill.  Deputy Cosgrave seems to have made up his mind that the Minister's statement justifies him in thinking that the Bill cannot be administered in a sectional fashion. Those of us who have experience of measures administered by this Department know perfectly well that some of the things slipped in, in a casual fashion, in some of the measures have operated very grievously against those to whom they referred.  Nobody imagined that the Employment Period Order in the Unemployment Assistance Act would work out in such a way that, in a rural area, in March, work is supposed to drop out of the sky and the men drawing unemployment assistance are told there is work for them in that area and that no unemployment assistance will be paid to them until October; yet that is how that particular measure is operating. Any measure to be administered by <Col N="67" /> the Minister for Industry and Commerce should be examined under a microscope and any possibilities inherent in it should be canvassed to the utmost extent.</P>
    <P>In the definition section of this measure, I find that a child is defined as &ldquo;a person under the aye of 16.&rdquo; I am inclined to ask the Minister if that means under the age of 16 when this Bill is signed, on the appointed day, or on the qualifying date. These definitions seem to be more remarkable for what they omit than for what they include.</P>
    <P>In another paragraph, the expression &ldquo;the qualifying date&rdquo; is given as &ldquo;in relation to the payment period for a region, the date which is, by virtue of sub-section 2 of Section 2 of this Act, the qualifying date in relation to that payment period.&rdquo; Keeping the Employment Period Order in mind, I can imagine an Order being issued by the Minister for Industry and Commerce saying that the measure will apply to Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Waterford on a certain qualifying date and that the rural areas will be excluded.  I can see the Minister postponing the operation of the Bill in respect of rural areas and justifying his action in so doing.  If the Bill becomes law on the lst January, land the appointed date is the 1st March, the Minister may appoint the 1st November as the qualifying date in respect of a certain area, which means that all the children whose birthdays occur between the 1st March and the 1st November are automatically excluded from the operation of the Act.</P>
    <P>The Minister endeavoured to indicate that he does not intend that; but, in dealing with this section on the Committee Stage, I hope he will take the opportunity to convince the Dáil.  I hope he will remove the doubts that exist in a great many minds, and that this Act will come into operation concurrently in all the regions, so that no disadvantage will accrue to anybody in a particular region.  That possibility is <Col N="68" /> inherent in this measure, and, unless those doubts are removed, I cannot see anything to prevent the Minister from taking advantage of them if he so desires. The present Minister possibly docs not so desire, but we do not know who may be Minister afterwards.  Unless we have an assurance from the Minister responsible for this measure that he cannot, by the provisions of the definition section, exclude some classes, I am convinced the measure will not operate as smoothly as it should.</P>
    <P>I notice that the investigation officers and the deciding officers are to be under the control of the Minister's Department.  I think that is a bad system and that the deciding officers should be from some other Department. That system is operated in the Department of Local Government and Public Health, where that Department is the arbitrator between the Department of Finance and the applicants for old age pensions.  On the Committee Stage of this Bill, the Minister should convince the House that the powers there are undoubtedly here will not be utilised through the regional division proposed in the measure to prevent every qualified person from receiving 2/6.</P>

      <P>In the main, I welcome the introduction of this particular Bill.  No matter how Deputies of different Parties may criticise its details, the Government, and the Minister introducing it, have met a demand which has grown very considerably in volume from practically every Party in the House.  Whilst welcoming the Bill, I deplore the Minister's manner in introducing it, and the circumstances under which it was introduced.  Here is a Bill introduced to meet demands from representative Deputies, irrespective of Party, and it is introduced in an atmosphere of bluff, threats and finality. There is no necessity for that kind of thing.  The Minister and the Government may have made up their minds that they were not going to budge an inch beyond the financial provisions of the Bill, or the number of children provided for, but there is no necessity for the Minister to come in here with an ash plant in his fist, as it were, waving <Col N="69" /> it in our faces.  Perhaps it would not be such a menace to our peace of mind, to the national safety or to progress if there was a resignation of the Government; that is a matter of opinion, but I do not like bellicosity when there is no occasion for bellicosity. This kind of shadow-boxing in association with what I might describe as a social welfare scheme, in respect of which the Minister was previously notified that it had, in the main, the support of all Parties, is entirely unnecessary.</P>
      <P>With regard to the conditions surrounding the introduction of the Bill, for some 12 or 18 months past public attention here and elsewhere has been riveted on the question of State assistance for families.  Time and again on the Order Paper of this House, questions have been addressed to the Minister or the Government as to when they would be in a position to make a statement with regard to family allowances or to issue to Deputies the report of the Departmental Committee which investigated all this matter.  The answer from time to time was: &ldquo;At some future date&rdquo;.  Now here the Bill is introduced, no White Paper issued, no Departmental report, and we are baldly told that half-a-crown is the limit, that the first two children must be left out and that anybody who does not like that may lump it.  Surely a Bill of this kind that, in the main, had general support, should be, and could be, discussed in this House in a more reasonable spirit than that.  I should like to approach consideration of a Bill such as this with a table in front of me showing the number of families with one child, two, four, five, or six children and the cost of the scheme taking in all children or excluding the first two or stopping at the sixth or seventh.  In that way, I could make up my mind as to the advisability of finally approving of a Bill of this kind when I had reasonable information as to the cost of alternatives.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In a neighbouring country long before any legislation is introduced the man in the street and the member of the Parliament are put in possession of all the information that is available <Col N="70" /> to the Government, so that a member of Parliament is in a position to come into Parliament and discuss an important matter with all and every information that is available to the Government available to him.  Now whether the State can give allowances only to children after the second or third child is a question of finance.  It is a question of what the extra money cent entailed would be, if we were to take in the second child or even the first child, and every Deputy should be able to make up his mind as to whether the increased cost was justifiable or not, by knowing what the increased cost would be.  We in this Party have examined various official returns, various volumes of the census issued, and we could not with any exactitude get any reasonable indication as to the number of families of various sizes.  The number of children in each age group is clear enough, but we were anxious for some two years past to see legislation of this kind and to approach it with a full knowledge of the circumstances and the facts.  I do not know why the Departmental report and the information of various kinds, which must have been collected in order to make the report of any value, has been withheld from Deputies.  The report was asked for time and again, and it should have been available before this Bill was introduced.</P>
    <P>I do not agree with the attitude of the Minister in quite casually throwing overboard any suggestion of having a contributory scheme.  If we could have a contributory scheme and provide for all children, then I would welcome a contributory scheme.  Everyone of us knows that there are difficulties, to a certain extent, in the collection of contributions from people other than employees. I have no doubt that is one of the matters which was explored and reported on by the Departmental Committee but I do not think it is treating the House fairly merely to walk in and say that because 50 per cent. of our people are not in employment, there would be too much difficulty in collecting their contributions. I do not say that there is not a sound case and a strong case for a non-contributory <Col N="71" /> scheme, but no case has been made here for chucking overboard all consideration of a contributory scheme.  If we could have a contributory scheme and provide for extra benefits for the children brought under the Bill, or the same benefits for the first and second child, then I would think very seriously before I would throw overboard the idea of a contributory scheme.</P>
    <P>It is a matter for debate whether it is wise to exclude the first, or the first and the second child and provide for, say, all children under 16 irrespective of number.  There is a lot to be said one way or the other.  In other State-assisted schemes for dependent children, the other method of approach is the one used.  The first, the second and the third child get State assistance, and then you reach a point beyond which no State assistance is given.  It is certainly a matter that would reserve very full consideration and about which there should be very general discussion in an Assembly such as this.  There, again, we have no figures.  We have no figures whatsoever on which to estimate the increased or the decreased burden on the State.  We are as conscious of the undesirability of overloading the people of this country with taxation as any Minister of State over there but we should like, in considering three, four or five different schemes, to have some figures showing the cost of the different schemes, the saving in one case or the extra commitments in the other.  All that information has been withheld from the Dáil, whether deliberately or otherwise.  I would consider it perfectly reasonable to suggest, on the Second Heading of this Bill, that further consideration should be adjourned until the House is in possession of the Departmental Report on which this Bill was based.</P>
    <P>We have the Minister coming in and saying that the Bill is going to cost £2,500,000 and that on anybody who supports the Bill, there is a moral obligation, except he is guilty of political trickery, to put through the next Budget.  This House, every week or <Col N="72" /> every month it sits is putting through legislation that imposes penalties of one kind or another on the taxpayer. In the history of this House there never was the type of announcement that surrounded the introduction of this Bill&mdash;that there is a moral obligation on anybody who supports the Bill to support the Budget and that, if they do not do that, they are guilty of political trickery&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>Can the Minister spell the word &ldquo;economy&rdquo;?  Can he never balance any new concession to the people by a Government saving? When the Minister and his Ministry increased the administrative cost of government by considerably more than £1,000,000 a year, did we then hear him coming into the House and saying &ldquo;that is so much on tea, so much on sugar, 1/- on tobacco and 1/- in the £ on income-tax&rdquo;?  Other Deputies speaking from these and other Benches, expressed the opinion that it was the wrong Minister and the wrong Ministry that were in charge of this Bill. Whether it is the wrong Ministry or not is a debatable point, but, if we are to judge the Minister by his antics in introducing the Bill, I certainly agree with those who say he is the wrong Minister.</P>
      <P>Information has been withheld.  All the relevant information which we have been told a Department of Government has been collecting for months has been withheld.  We are asked, more or less in blinkers, either to take the Bill as it is, unaltered, or go without it.  We take the Bill.  We take it in the light of the fact that we are not in a position, as responsible Deputies, to consider any alternative.  The data required fcy this type of Bill have been withheld from us.  A number of points have been raised in the course of the debate which are worthy of deep consideration. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>This Bill is similar in all respect to to the Bill introduced this time twelve months.  Twenty years ago or thereabouts, the Expiring Laws Bill used to be a fairly formidable measure, with very long schedules of Bills carried on for another year or two years.  In the course of the past 20 years, the list has dwindled and we have now a mere handful of Bills to be renewed in this way.  Judging by what I have been told, the list will be still further diminished next year.  The Schedule to this Bill is exactly similar to that in the Bill passed by this House 12 months ago.  The older members of the House know what the purpose of the Bill is and its necessity.  This year, for the benefit of new members of the House, we circulated a circular giving a brief account of the contents of each of the Acts in the Schedule and the reasons why it was necessary to continue them in the Expiring Laws Bill. It is proposed to continue for a further year the statutes set out in Parts I and II of the Schedule.  Of the eight Acts appearing in the Schedule, provision has been made for repeal of the Local Authorities (Combined Purchasing) Act, 1925, which will disappear when the Combined Purchasing Act of 1939 comes into operation.  As it will hardly be possible to give effect to the 1939 Act until the end of the present emergency, it is necessary to continue the 1925 Act for a further period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A Rent Restrictions Bill is at present in an advanced stage of preparation, and the Minister for Justice hopes to introduce it at an early date.  It will not be enacted before the end of this year.  In fact, I do not think it will be introduced bofore the end of this <Col N="74" /> year.  It is neeussary, therefore, to continue for a further period the Increase of Rent, and Mortgage (Restrictions) Act, 1923.</P>
    <P>The position regarding the remaining Acts in the Bill has been reviewed with a view to deciding whether legislation might be introduced to give permanence to any of them in its present or in an amended form.  Any such legislation is, however, not thought to be feasible at present.</P>

      <P>I merely want to refer to the Minister's statement that it is proposed to introduce a Rent Restrictions Bill in the near future.  I take it the continual raising of this matter on the Expiring Laws Bill has <Col N="75" /> borne fruit.  I suggest to the Minister, and to the Minister for Justice, that if there is any unreasonable or prolonged delay in introducing the new Bill, they should consider taking advantage of the Emergency Powers Act to remedy a position which is for many people very grave.  The present Act is quite inadequate to give protection to the many people who have been forced to pay what are undoubtedly extortionate rents, as they are not included in the provisions of the existing Act.  I am sure we all would welcome the introduction of the new Bill.  I may say it is very urgently needed.</P>

      <P>One of the reasons why I am stressing the non-issue of the <Col N="76" /> Departmental Report is this.  While agreeing that £2,250,000 is a very generous State contribution towards the maintenance of families.  I would like to be satisfied that within the limits of that sum we could not do better than by excluding the first two children.  We are discussing that particular matter in the dark.

      <P>I am not tying anybody to promises.  I am pointing out in a reasonable way that where a Departmental inquiry has been held in order to arrive at a Bill such as this, surely the data as to the number of families of different sizes and the cost of catering for all children, or all after the first, would be considered relevant material which should be made available to Deputies when they are considering the Bill?  We are all with the Government in trying to do the best we can so far as the sum named goes. There are few of us, if any, inclined to look a gift horse in the mouth or say &ldquo;That is not enough, and you must give more&rdquo;.  We know the world is progressing, even while we are living through existing conditions, and this must be regarded as the first step.  As a first step I would consider it a very considerable step, but I am rather hesitant with regard to the plan of expending this £2,250,000 from the third child onwards I would like to see how it would work out in cost if we began at the first child; how far the £2,250,000 would go, and where we would have to stop.  It is a very moot, debatable point whether it is advisable to begin at the first and stop half-way down the line, or exclude the first and second.  Particularly since prices started jumping very steeply, the cost of a first child nowadays is something appalling and, in a country such as ours, where the majority of families have more than one&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanTOKelly" hpid="Mr. O Ceallaigh Mr. O Ceallaigh">

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>The increased cost of all these articles has been more steep than the increased cost of any other kind of article.  Even in what I might call old times, the cost of what one might describe as the equipment for the first child was as great as that of any four subsequent children&mdash;living in an age where the second child inherited from the first, and so on down the line.  Taking all that into account, I would like to be in a position, as a Deputy supporting the Bill, to reckon how far we could go down the line if we made money available for the first and had to stop somewhere lower down.  I think they found in Great Britain that by excluding the first child they practically halved the cost of the whole scheme, but there they issued all the data necessary; they made the man in the street and every member of Parliament acquainted with the position; they put them in the possession of all the information on which the Government was going to base its scheme.  Here we have a Departmental inquiry sitting for 12 or 18 months doing its work&mdash;I accept it that it was done efficiently&mdash;and thoroughly investigating the comparative sizes of families and the costs incurred.  As a result of all that accumulated information the Government introduced a scheme.  I cannot understand why all the information is withheld from this Parliament when we are discussing our scheme.  It is something like a blind man trying to get a vision of a picture which has been described to him, when the man could be given his sight.  We arp anxious for this Bill; everybody in the House is prepared to support it, but we would like to be in a position to discuss alternative schemes of expending this money without demanding more, and possibly even decreasing the cost.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. O'Higgins</NameTxt>
      <P>But that information should have been available before the Second Reading of this Bill.  We have shown our interest in the measure and in the Departmental inquiry by putting down questions on the Order Paper at different intervals during the past 12 months.  We asked when the report of the Departmental inquiry would be available.  It is true, as the Tanaiste said, that no promise was made that we would be given the report, but common sense and, I would say, parliamentary courtesy and a desire to have a real discussion based on a knowledge of all the facts, would indicate that that should be available.  It was not available in time for the Second Reading and I suggest that it should be made available before the subsequent Stages.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There seems to be a degree of confusion or misunderstanding, and a certain amount of doubt and uneasiness with regard to the alteration in the income-tax code arising out of this Bill.  The Minister stated that the payments under this Bill would be offset by a reduction in the allowances now made in respect of children under the income-tax code.  If the Minister, when he said that, meant that nobody could benefit by this Bill and at the same time get relief in the way of income-tax, then I think we are all with him.  His statement, and the subsequent discussion between him and Deputy Lynch, did not make the point clear.  Suppose, as the Minister suggested, the allowances under the income-tax code are reduced by £20, does that mean that children's allowances in respect of income-tax will be reduced by that amount?  If so, people with children over 16 years of age who will get no benefit from this Bill will be injured financially.  I presume it was not the intention, when introducing this Bill, to assist some families and make the financial position of other families worse.  If the reduction in income-tax only applies in the case of the child that is setting an allowance under this Bill, then, of course, that would be perfectly fair, and, obviously, should he done.  Otherwise, <Col N="79" /> you would be putting some people in a privileged position.</P>
    <P>Both the Leader of this Party and the Leader of the Labour Party have availed of the Second Beading of this Bill to bring to the attention of the Government the desirability of amalgamating under one department the administration of the various pieces of legislation that provide small weekly sums for a very large number of families.  We have old age pensions, unemployment assistance, unemployment insurance, national health insurance, widows' and orphans' pensions, home help, and now this Bill.  All these measures are being administered by different Departments, different sets of officials and different sets of investigation officers.  It is their duty to visit some humble home that is getting a small weekly allowance under one or more of these pieces of legislation.  I have frequently to visit houses throughout the country.  For medical reasons, it is part of my business to know in confidence what a particular family is in a position to do in the way of providing nourishment for a patient.  I frequently visit houses which are in receipt of small weekly incomes from three or four different sources.  One person may be drawing 3/- a week in National Health Insurance; the father may be in receipt oi 6/- or 7/- a week unemployment assistance, and, perhaps, the grandmother in the corner may be drawing the old age pension. The total income of the home may be only 12/- a week.</P>
    <P>Surely, it is not sound business or economy to have four sets of investigators, four sets of inspectors and four staffs administering and doing the accountancy work involved in the distribution of that small weekly sum.  I believe that under these various schemes the administration costs represent a very high percentage of the total sum provided under each.  I am not suggesting that this Bill should be delayed in order to bring about an amalgamation in the matter of the administration of a number of these schemes.  Careful consideration should, and must, be given to their amalgamation under one department, so as to <Col N="80" /> have a more thorough investigation and an easier method of payment, but, above all, so as to cut down the administrative costs.  The Minister says that the cost of this measure is going to be very great, that the amount of money that is being provided for the various social services is immense, and that we cannot afford to go further.  I think that is probably true.  We cannot afford to go further in the way of piling on taxation, but we must go further, I suggest, in the way of effecting economies in overhead charges, costs of administration and of investigation.</P>
    <P>With regard to the machinery to be employed for putting this measure into operation, I do not know what the Minister's intentions are.  All that we learn from the Bill is that there is to be a new set of officials, referees, investigation officers, deciding officers, accountants, clerks, etc.  The Government has already adopted the policy of having county managers.  In connection with other necessary Government legislation, the county manager is now being employed as a regional officer. In the event of an interruption between Government and people, the Government have put the responsibility on him of carrying out all the services, and of making all payments, in his region.  As regional officer he must be familiar with the circumstances of every household in his county, so that if the interruption which was visualised at one time took place, and which we all hope will never take place, he would be able to carry on and make payments.  Where, may I ask, could better machinery be got for the administration of a measure such as this?  The home help supervisor for a county has to be familiar with the financial circumstances of every home in his county. Practically all those men are excellent officers.  They have assistants employed under them who carry out their duties in their own districts.  Have we reached the point when we are going to have another group of investigating officers working alongside them?</P>
    <P>What I am about to say will be said in no critical spirit, nor because there <Col N="81" /> have been changes in Government. The system has been the same, irrespective of the changes in Government that have taken place, but in view of all this overlapping, you may have those with nothing better to do spending five or six days sitting on the fence in front of a labourer's cottage and coming away at the end of a week laughing at Government and at the efforts of Government that are being made here with all these investigators, inspectors and others engaged in paying out average weekly sums of 2/-.</P>
    <P>This is a new Bill dealing with children.  We already have in a Government Department a system under which every child born has to be registered. We have that locally as well as centrally.  We also have administrative machinery that is bound to investigate and know the financial circumstances of every home in each administrative area.  You have local officers and a machine designed to make payments locally or centrally. Let the first step be towards sound economy, towards sounder administration, to ensure that this scheme will not result in the creation of a number of new officers and new administrators and investigators.  Perhaps that question can be better discussed on the Committee Stage, but I put it to the Minister for consideration.</P>

      <P>I welcome this Bill not so smuch for what it provides as for the principle behind it.  It should be recognised, even in normal times, that a service of this kind is necessary. Even then it would take great courage to face the liability which follows the introduction of such a Bill.  It should also be recognised that, in addition to its other responsibilities, it is very creditable to the present Government that they made time to examine this question.  I do not think it could be interpreted from the Minister's introductory statement that he had raised the flag on high, or said that this was the limit which could be expected by recipients.  It is the limit to which the Government could go at this stage. There seem to have been complaints of lack of information about the scheme.  It is true that a statement <Col N="82" /> indicating the difficulties of the present position was not circulated, but certain information was given from which it is possible to make calculations. The Minister envisaged that the scheme would cost about £2,500,000 and will affect 120,000 families.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.  It is a simple calculation to find how many half-crowns there are in £2,500,000 and to divide by 52.  It is estimated that provision will be made for 400,000 children.  The Minister also stated that if the scheme applied to the first child in a family it would cost £3,500,000.  I calculated that if the original figure related to 120,000 families, the latter would affect 150,000 families and at 2/6 per week that would include 500,000 children.  If the benefit was to apply to every child, the Minister mentioned that the scheme would cost the State £5,250,000 and would affect 240,000 families.  His calculation meant that 800,000 children under 16 years of age would qualify on the appointed day.  The Bill in the initial stages provides for 50 per cent. of the children in the State under 16 years of age.  I think that is something which should be taken as a very big step in the direction that we all want to go.  It ought at least to be regarded as something well done as the first step in this scheme, and a big bite off the load that has to be borne.  The House should recognise that this Government has consistently faced its responsibilities towards the masses and that rrpm the very day it took office it has made an effort to deal, as far as was possible, with the most necessitous in this community.  Many points were raised by Deputy O'Higgins, with some of which I am more or less in agreement.  I agree that the first child born into a family is the most expensive.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>I agree.  I suppose it is because Deputy O'Higgins and myself have large families that we agree that that is the expensive stage.  The early years of married life are the difficult ones.  The earning powers of <Col N="83" /> parents then are generally not large. The greatest hardship is experienced with the first and second child.  When the parents are more advanced in years, and the children are bigger, the earning power is greater.  To that extent I agree with Deputy O'Higgins. I believe that all these points were considered by the Government and by the Departments concerned and that they investigated a variety of other schemes.  I am sure they calculated the cost in all circumstances, and having the results before them,they probably came to the conclusion that this is the most this, State can do with this limited amount of money.  The Bill was introduced in the hope that it was going to do the best that was possible in this way rather than in any other way.  On the Committee Stage it will be open to any Deputy to introduce amendments and, in the meanwhile, to look for information which would enable other suggestions to be made.</P>

      <P>I am dealing with the points raised by Deputy O'Higgins, who stated that he was not in a position to judge whether the distribution of money in this way was going to do the greatest amount of good.  The Deputy felt that there was other information to be secured from which better results, might be obtained.  I agree with that approach to the matter.  I do not, however, agree that there was any suggestion of bluff and finality on the part of the Minister, who, so far as I can interpret his remarks, made it clear that we were limited to this amount in present circumstances. I did not understand him to say that we were limited to this amount for all time, and I do not think it fair to interpret his introductory remarks on those lines.</P>

    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The point is that this Government has made a beginning in this matter.  This scheme will benefit 400,000 children, and it will do so because the Government, in its wisdom and its judgment is to how it can best manipulate the finances of the State, has come to the conclusion that the amount which they can reach in this connection is the sum of £2,500,000. Experience of the administration of the Act may show that they arc overestimating or under-estimating, and, when experience has been obtained, they may be willing to alter the rules and regulations, which, I understand, will be made from time to time, to make the scheme apply in other directions. I should like to see, as we would all like to see, a lot more done, but the Government is the best judge as to how far it can go.</P>
      <P>I regard the Bill as being of great value from the point of view that the, scheme is not designed to provide contributions from the State solely to necessitous families, but is designed to affect certain sections of the community, excluding the income-tax class, that is, those who pay income-tax to such an extent that, by claiming this particular payment, they would lose more, through the loss of children's allowances for income purposes, than they would get.  Therefore, it not alone concerns necessitous families but it puts on an even keel the heads of families who are in similar classes of employment, but in whose living circumstances there is a disparity, in that the standard of living is affected by the fact that, in one case, there is a ]arge family, and, in the other, a small family.  These contributions will benefit these people, and to a certain extent, lessen that difference.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>A very good feature of the Bill is the provision of a flat rate to which no means test, as we understand a means test as applied to other schemes, is attached.  Experience of the working of the scheme may suggest that a similar procedure be followed in respect of other social services and we may live to see the time when the means test which affects certain people will be done away with.  We would all like to sec ideal conditions existing <Col N="85" /> in every case, but it cannot, be done. In this particular case, however, there is a flat rate, with no moans test, which is a good feature.  Deputy O'Higgins said he would like to see consideration given to the Bill with a view to its extrusion by a scheme of contributions.  I do not see how anybody could seriously suggest a contributory scheme in relation to such a Bill as this.  One has to have regard to the facts and circumstances of the people who are to benefit.  A man in employment who might want to benefit by the scheme would have to make a certain number of contributions, hut his continuance in employment is beyond his control and he may lose his employment.  There are all kinds of difficulties which would make the adoption of such a suggestion impossible, as it is not at all on the same basis as that of other schemes.</P>
    <P>I do not remember the Minister saying that if the House accepted this Bill it became an obligation on the House to support the Budget.  What I understood him to say was that he hoped there would not be criticism of additional expenditure arising out of payment under the Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasFrancisOHiggin" hpid="Dr. O'Higgins Dr. O'Higgins">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Budget will cover quite a number of other matters.  I believe the Minister would be grateful for and would welcome any suggestions for improving the scheme as a social service, and I imagine that if anybody can point out to him how this sum of money can be used to better advantage, without reducing the number <Col N="86" /> of children whom it would benefit, he will be prepared to consider any such suggestion quite seriously.  If I felt that I could suggest something which would result in an improvement, I should be very anxious to press it, and I am sure that if I could make a good case it would be seriously considered; but I should like to hear people making suggestions of a practical nature. I quite admit that, unless one has certain data, one cannot make these suggestions, but, in the meantime, it might be a good thing to suggest to those who are concerned about making suggestions for improvement that they should ask certain questions to which the Minister might have the answers on Committee Stage, when they could be dealt with on the appropriate sections.  If there is to be an intervening period, perhaps we could get this information by way of Parliamentary question and answer. There should, and can, be no secrecy about it.  The census figures of population are available, and, as Deputy O'Higgins said, the registrations of births are available, so there is no secrecy about the thing at all.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is a point which was touched on by Deputy O'Higgins which I think ought to be seriously considered. I agree that a time will come when there will have to be an amalgamation of all these social services, not alone for the purpose of eliminating certain overlapping costs, but to get a better picture, a more concise way of looking at the matters concerned. I do not know whether it is the best thing that this service should be administered by Industry and Commerce. I do not know that it makes any difference what Department administers any service in present circumstances, but I should like to suggest&mdash;it has been suggested before&mdash; that the time may come when it might be advisable to amalgamate all these services under one Ministry&mdash;a Ministry of Social Services&mdash;and not have them all separately administered as they are to-day.  I agree that with different Departments administering social services, such as unemployment assistance, unemployment <Col N="87" /> benefit, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and now these children's allowances, you may have an overlapping of services.  But, generally speaking, I cannot see how any Deputy can do anything but welcome this Bill because of the new service that it introduces.  I do not suggest that anybody in this House ought to say that this is the ultimate goal at which we should aim.  But one has to remember that we are living in abnormal conditions and that an additional £2,500,000 from the taxpayers, which it really amounts to, is a very big bite off the loaf.  I hope, therefore, that Deputies who will follow in this debate will not approach it from the point of view from which it was approached by the Leader of the Op position, with, a sort of cynical, sarcastic criticism.  There was nothing right in it, except the figure given, with which he could agree.  I hope that other Deputies will approach it from the point of view of recognising that it is a big step forward and making suggestions as to how more good can be done than will be done under the scheme at present before us.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think all Deputies will agree that the principle of the Bill is sound.  It does introduce a new principle in regard to social and reformative legislation by lessening the disparity existing between the standard of living of people with families and the standard of living of those who remain single.  In that way it does introduce a new and essentially desirable principle.  While it will be agreed that parents with families should be called upon to bear perhaps a heavier burden than people who remain single, it is right that this burden should not be insupportable and that the State and the general community should assist those citizens in carrying out their responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one section of our community whom I hold will derive perhaps greater benefit from this Bill than any other section, namely, small <Col N="88" /> landholders and small property owners throughout this State.  In the past, those people have been debarred from the benefits of most social legislation, and they are very often people of very small means.  An attempt to investigate the means of people engaged in agriculture was made some years ago by a Cork professor and resulted in the finding that quite a number of those people were earning incomes of less than £1 per week.  It would be absolutely impossible for people with such an income to undertake the responsibility of marriage.  In the past people in that class have not been able to avail of social legislation to any extent.  Even when they came to the age of 70 and gave up possession of their holdings, they found it extremely difficult to benefit from the old age pensions legislation.  A good feature of the Bill is that it does away with the means test.  No slur is cast upon the person who takes advantage of the provisions of the Bill.  For that reason it is very welcome.</P>
    <P>I understand that the person who is to claim this allowance is the father of the family.  While I am prepared to agree that it may be right and proper that the father, as head of the family, should make the application for this allowance, and, perhaps, for a revision of the allowance at the end of each six-monthly period, when such revision becomes due, I am not prepared to agree that it is right or proper that the allowance should be paid to the father of the family.  I think an unanswerable case can be made for the payment of the allowance directly to the mother. There are exceptions to every rule, but, in general, it must be recognised that the mother is more closely interested in and associated with the providing of food and clothing for the family.  While the father may consider it his duty, and may remind himself frequentty that it is his duty to provide for the welfare of his family with regard to essential requirements, such as food, clothing, etc., the mother, without any reflection on the matter, instinctively feels that it is her duty and will make provision for her family without any coercion.  Since the mother <Col N="89" /> is more closely associated with the upbringing of the children, I think it is right and proper that, in tho main, the allowance should be payable to the mother.  In making the application for the allowance, there might be provision for the father, if he desires that the mother should ndt draw the allowance, to set down specific reasons why she should not.  But, as a genera] rule, I think the allowance should be payable to the mother in those cases where the mother is living.</P>
    <P>While we are prepared to agree that 2/6 per week is a very small allowance, particularly at present when the cost of living is so high, and while we are prepared to suggest that there should be some increase in that allowance, I am not one of those who hold that there is no limit to the amount of the allowance that should be paid in respect to children.  It is not desirable that the allowance paid by the State to citizens should be out of proportion to the amount which they earn through their avocations.  It is sound and reasonable that the allowance should be sufficient to assist in the upbringing of the children, but not sufficient to relieve the parents of all obligations whatever.  That applies also to the plea for the extension of the allowance to the first and second child.  I agree that a good case can be made for that extension also, but I hay that there is a definite limit, even apart from the limit set by the condition of the national Exchequer.  I do not agree that support of this measure places an obligation on Deputies to support all increased taxation necessary to provide these allowances.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>£2,250,000 may seem a very large amount of money; but we must remember that in the last 10 years or so national expenditure has been increased by £10,000,000 or <Col N="90" /> £15,000,000, so that £2,250,000 is not such a huge sum that it could not bo obtained by economy in general administration, by the prevention of overlapping in the various Departments, and also, to a great extent, by a reduction in tho price which the Government and local authorities have seen fit to pay for money which they borrow.  There are opportunities along the lines I have indicated of saving money which could be applied to the financing of a desirable measure such as this.</P>
      <P>I welcome the proposal in this Bill to have the payments made weekly. That, of course, is very desirable.  In certain cases various payments are made to workers and others fortnightly and monthly, which is not at all desirable. The people who will benefit most by this Bill are people of very small means who cannot avail of credit facilities in the shops or elsewhere and it is most essential that they should receive the money within the shortest periods of time.  Therefore, it is most desirable that the payments should be made weekly.</P>
      <P>I think the Minister made a fairly good case for this Bill.  I think it is a Bill which the people of the country in general will welcome.  It has been suggested that there is an alternative, in the way of a contributory scheme of allowances, but if we take a broad view of this Bill, it is reasonably contributory inasmuch as the general taxpayer contributes to the provision of the money.  I cannot conceive any method by which citizens could be called upon to make a direct contribution towards a measure of this kind. I cannot imagine, for example, small farmers or small property owners being asked to stamp cards in respect of such a measure as this, particularly having regard to the fact that a very large percentage of smallholders and small fanners are aged, unmarried persons, who have no prospect whatever of deriving any benefit from the provisions of the Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, I think that, since everybody contributes in taxation, fairly and equitably&mdash;we hope&mdash;every citizen of this country is entitled to draw the <Col N="91" /> allowances provided by this Bill without feeling that he is, accepting charity of any kind.  He is simply accepting from the Exchequer a payment to which he is entitled by reason of the fact that he has a certain number of dependents to support.</P>
    <P>I do not quite agree with the Minister when he said that this Bill represents a redistribution of the national income only, and that he cannot raise the national income.  I think that anything which tends to increase expenditure does have the effect of raising the national income.  We have seen how the national income in this country and in Great Britain has increased over the past few years by reason, solely, of increased Government expenditure and I think that if the Minister were to consider being a little more generous in a measure of this kind, he would be justified in borrowing the money required, or part of the money required, for the first year, on the assumption that the national income would increase and that it would be possible to find the money ouc of general taxation in later years. I think a strong case was made in regard to that particular point by Deputy Dillon when he was speaking in connection with this matter some time ago and he was, of course, advocating a much more generous scheme than this.  I think the case he made for borrowing the money, or part of the money, for the first or second year was sound.</P>
    <P>I welcome this Bill particularly, as I say, on behalf of the rural community. I welcome it also because it casts no slur upon those who will derive benefit from it.  I hope that, now that a step has been taken in this direction, we will have the principle of family allowances further extended as the years go by and as we gain experience of the operation of the Act.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardSidneyAnthony" hpid="Mr. Anthony Mr. Anthony">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Anthony</NameTxt>
      <P>Like all the other Deputies who have spoken before me, I also give this measure a very hearty welcome.  That welcome is tempered somewhat with slight regret.  That regret is in regard to the matter <Col N="92" /> Deputy Cosgrave raised in his speech &mdash;it has also been touched upon by Deputy Hogan and other Deputies&mdash; namely, the question of a contributory scheme.  I cannot see any objection whatsoever to a contributory scheme. Some Deputies appeared to think it waa an unheard of thing in this country, whereas the contrary is the fact.  There are systems of unemployment insurance, unemployment assistance and home assistance in this country&mdash;I suppose everybody is aware of that&mdash;and Deputies should be aware of the fact that the ordinary workingman, when he is employed, contributes towards his unemployment insurance, which he draws upon at a subsequent date when he is unemployed. I do not see any reason why bume contribution should not be made to a scheme of this kind.  I feel that no decent, honest workingman would object in any way to a contributory scheme but rather that he would welcome it because he would feel pride and pleasure in drawing money to which he felt entitled, having contributed to it over a period of months or years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I came into this House to-day prepared to hear a whole lot of nonsense spoken, on this very serious subject of relief.  A number of Deputies who took part in the debate put forward suggestions which, if carried into effect, would mean placing another £2,500,000 on the shoulders of the taxpayers. I certainly re-echo the sentiments of the Minister when he asked every Deputy in this House who intended to raise his voice in the matter seriously to consider the position and its reactions or relations to the coming budget.  I do not at all agree that this was thrown out by way of threat. It was, in my view, asking Deputies of this House to come down to realities, when discussing questions of this kind.  You cannot have it both ways. You had Deputy Cogan of the Farmers' Party advocating an increase in the half-crown.  We would all like to see this increase in operation but it costs money and Deputy Cogan <Col N="93" /> would be the first man in this House to tell you of the tribulations and trials of the poor working farmer in Mayo or somewhere else in raising money for a measure of this kind.  One cannot get more out of a pint measure than a pint.  That is all that is in it. Whatever the national income in this country may be&mdash;£5,000,000 or £10,000,000&mdash;you cannot get more out of it than that.  This Bill, or any other, form of relief, will certainly involve taxation.  We have to face up to that and pay for it.  That is why I think the decent workingmen of this country are prepared to put their hands in their pockets and pay towards a contributory scheme.  As Deputy O'Higgins and others suggested this afternoon, why does not the Minister take this step and get all those schemes under one heading?</P>
    <P>I have read the Beveridge Report from the first page to its concluding page, but I must say that I should not like to see the Beveridge plan put into operation in its entirety in this country.  I have the feeling that a number of independent men in this country&mdash;and, when I speak of independent men, I mean independent workingmen throughout this country&mdash; would not like to see that plan implemented so far as this country is concerned.  If you want to bring up a race of spineless people&mdash;a jelly-fish kind of race&mdash;and spoon-feed them from the cradle to the grave, you must take into consideration what type of people you will have in this country in another generation or two.  I know that that is not in the Minister's mind, but I think it is an undoubted fact that in the minds of a large number of people there is growing up the idea that they should be able to get something for nothing; and what is that wing to lead to in the end?</P>
    <P>The Minister has pointed out what this could mean in certain circumstances: that it might mean 1d. per lb. on sugar, 1/- in the £ on income-tax, 1d. per pint on beer, and so on; and I am quite sure that our citizens would be prepared to pay that if they thought that an adequate return would <Col N="94" /> accrue for the benefit of our people. That is my reply to the critics, and I anticipate that that will be the Minister's reply.  I do not share the view of Deputies who challenged the Minister's figures, when he said that it would mean putting an extra 1d. or so on various commodities, because I believe that it would mean that people would have to bs more guarded as to what they would spend.  However, in connection with that matter, I shall reserve any further remarks I have to make until the Committee Stage of the Bill, when various amendments will be put forward.</P>
    <P>As I have said already, I welcome this Bill, but I think that the Minister should have taken his courage in both hands and brought in a contributory scheme, because I believe that if you had an amalgamation of all the various schemes&mdash;unemployment assistance, unemployment insurance, old age pensions, widows' and orphans' pensions, and this scheme&mdash;an omnibus scheme, such as you have across the water, under which the workingman would pay one contribution, it would be a further step forward.  I welcome this Bill as a good and courageous step forward, however, and I hope that it will pass through this House with the goodwill and good feeling of every Party in the House.  It seems to me that every Party in the House is in favour of the scheme, and, therefore, I hope that the Minister will seriously consider whether or not it is possible to make this a contributory scheme.</P>

      <P>I think that it is, somewhat futile to expect any individual member of this House or any Party in this House to take up an attitude of opposition to this scheme, introduced by the Minister, because it is quite clear, not only as a result of this debate, but from the views put forward by various people for a considerable time before the introduction of this Bill, that it is the considered opinion of a large number of people in this country that a scheme of this kind is necessary.  Because of the peculiarities of the Parliamentary machinery, however, the putting forward <Col N="95" /> of such a measure, and its practical application, are two different things.  Nobody will cavil with the Minister or the Government in regard to any effort they may make to give improved or more widely distributed social services and, therefore, we are confined exclusively, in this debate, to the actual scheme within the frame work and limitations laid down by the Minister.  However, before passing from that point, I want to take issue with the Minister on what seems to me to have been the most important matter referred to in the course of his infcroductorry remarks.  That is where he referred&mdash;as he did in the previous debate&mdash;to the fact that we have in this country certain conditions of want, certain conditions of lack of income, certain conditions which mean that a section of our people are not enabled to enjoy what we would all recognise as ordinary, decent and human conditions; and that, given a fixed national income, that particular situation can only be met by a redistribution of the national income that exists at the present time; and the Minister takes credit to himself that in this measure, which we all welcome, he has taken a step in that direction.  Now, I am not at all clear as to whether he has done so, because it seems to me that there are certain qualifications that have to be attached to the Minister's statement.  Deputy Anthony says that we cannot take more out of a pint pot than is in it, but he seems to forget that some of us may take more out of the pint pot than we are entitled to take.  That is why I agree with the Minister or the Government in the introduction of schemes such as this and similar schemes of social insurance, or all-embracing schemes of this nature, winch would give to the mass of our people something that they do not receive at the present time: and that is their proper share of the national income produced by them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have had in this country, over a period&mdash;and notably since the present Government took office&mdash;an attempt, not only to increase the national income by various legislative and industrial <Col N="96" /> measures, but also, within certain limited degrees, to redistribute the national income.  I have already made reference to that fact in other debates, but I am very much afraid that, if one went into the figures and examined them carefully, it would be found that no matter how well-intentioned or sincere the Minister or the Government may have been, no great or significant change has taken place in regard to the redistribution of our national income, even allowing for the fact that four years of war have intervened.  I think it will be found, if one examines the figures impartially, with regard to the redistribution of our national income, that the poor are still poor, relatively, so far as the rich are concerned, and that, in many cases, the rich have become richer.  I think it will be found that the situation has become even more intolerable as a result of the experience of the last four-year period of war, and that that period has brought greater security and mors wealth to those who already possessed wealth, and a greater degree of poverty to those who were already poor and upon whom the emergency presses most hardly&mdash;and these form the majority of our nation.</P>
    <P>In this country we have carried on a struggle for many generations, with the object of trying to reinstate our  people, not only in national ownership, but in social and economic ownership of their own country.  Whatever may be said with regard to our progress nationally, I think it must be admitted that, so far as industrial and economic ownership of our nation is concerned, we have made little or no progress. Accordingly, when we come to deal with such a measure as this, and when the Minister puts it forward to this House as being a measure which, in his opinion, accomplishes something that does need to be tackled&mdash;the redistribution of our national income&mdash;we are entitled to question that statement, with a view to seeing if he is correct in his assertion.</P>
    <P>First of all, when we speak of the national income, we then have to try to discover what is the present distribution of that income.  Of course, we <Col N="97" /> can get the ngures that have been given to us by economists, and, on the basis of those figures, we can relate the figure that we are now discussing, of £2,250,000, to the total.  On that basis, and giving full credit to the Minister when he says that there is going to be a change, which would mean a redistribution of income, as between one small, wealthy group and a very much larger group who are in much poorer circumstances&mdash;the actual amount, involved would be, comparatively, a very small matter.</P>
    <P>Even allowing for what the Minister has said, however, we cannot take it for granted that there will be a complete change-over.  We have no definite figures as to how the actual expenditure of this sum of £2,250,000 will be spread over the whole of our population.  We are told that there is to be no means test, and I am sure that everybody will agree with that, but it seems to me that we are going about it in another way, by reducing the relief that has been given to people coming under the income-tax group. The Minister has given us certain figures with regard to that matter, but it appears to me, from the figures he has given, that the amount concerned would be infinitesimal&mdash;that, practically, the amount concerned would amount to nothing&mdash;and, therefore, any offset in that particular regard will not be of any particular value.</P>
    <P>It is when we come to the point of how the money is to be found that we are entitled to question what actual redistribution is taking place, and on that basis we have no information whatever.  Two points arise.  First of all, we have no indication from the Government or the Minister as to what proportion of the national income they feel requires to be redistributed, and secondly, who are the people who have got too much, who are those who have too little, and how the balance is to be distributed.  If we could get these figures, we could give them every credit for approaching the question from the proper angle, but we have got no indication, as I say, except a general statement that within the limits of the income of the country, <Col N="98" /> the Government were doing all they could to succour and to strengthen the weakest portion of our people.  In the redistribution of this national income, we should like to know how much at any given time they feel has to be changed over to the more needy members of tlie community.  Here we are presented with a figure of £2,250,000, and we have a scheme which proposes to distribute this income as a social measure.  Everybody with any social sense will welcome this measure, although we may not agree on the actual details of the scheme, but we cannot estimate the value of this very large and very significant social measure until we know what is in the mind of the Government as to the ways and means of finding the money to finance the scheme.</P>
    <P>The Minister tried to frighten us by referring to additional imposts on beer, sugar and tobacco.  I do not know whether these are to be taken even as clues as to the lines upon which the Minister for Finance will proceed when it comes to a question of raising the money.  We are also told that any money we do raise to finance a scheme like this is a burden that must be placed on the back of the taxpayer. Why must we always approach questions of this kind in that way?  Why do we not endeavour to distinguish between taxpayers?  Why do we not realise that at the present time 60 per cent. of our total taxes are being raised by indirect taxation from the least well-to-do of the people, and that only 40 per cent. is being taken in direct taxation from the well-to-do? Within our community, we have got degrees of affluence and wealth and why cannot we find out ways and means of bringing about that redistribution of which the Minster speaks? If we take some of the figures supplied officially by the Minister, we find that in this small country with a population of under 3,000,000, we have a comparatively small number of people, 2,800 people, in receipt of a total income of £9,000,000, or £3,000 per person per annum.  That is, roughly, £60 per week.  A great many of our social services are based on the practicability of helping families whose income is not <Col N="99" /> £60 a week, but £60 a year.  Surely, it is from such sources as these that we should consider the possibility of raising this additional taxation?</P>
    <P>It may not be possible to find all the money in that way, but at least by taking a larger share from those in receipt of these enormous sums of money&mdash;£9,000,000 between less than 3,000&mdash;a considerable proportion of the expenditure required to provide support and sustenance for the weakest portion of our people could be found. The actual amount of money we take in income-tax, supertax and excess profits from these people with large incomes still leaves them with incomes which are altogether out of proportion to those of the masses of the people.</P>
    <P>They still draw a great deal more than the amount upon which the average person in the country has to live.  If we try to contrast their condition with,that of the poorest sections of our people, those with whom we are directly concerned, the comparison is one that it is almost impossible to make.  We have, on the one hand, the man or woman with three or four children living on unemployment assistance, or the widow with a State pension, contrasted with those who, after paying all taxes, are still drawing £20, £30 and £40 a week.  Surely these are inequalities that can be remedied by legislative measures or fiscal measures, to provide a new basis of social relations or a new social structure for the country.</P>
    <P>Therefore, from that point of view, I would make the criticism that whatever good is in the Bill, the big factor that has yet to be decided is the means by which the money will be raised. Who will bring about what the Minister says is his purpose, a redistribution of national economy, so that those who are in a position to hear the burden will be called upon to contribute in proper measure to ease the burden on their less fortunate brethren?</P>
    <P>I do not think that line of criticism is unfair criticism.  It is a criticism which the Minister has invited by his introductory remarks, but it is one that I think, so far as I could see, many <Col N="100" /> speakers seem to have failed to envisage.  Deputy Cogan suggested that the load of taxation is fairly and equitably distributed.  If Deputy Cogan had studied the facts, ho would know that that is not the case at all. There can be no suggestion of fair and equitable distribution of taxation when on the one hand you have individuals drawing £2,000 or £3,000 a year after paying all taxes, and against that, families trying to exist on £2 or £3 a week.  There is no equality or decency about that.  It is nearly time that we approached this question of placing on the backs of that section of the community who are best able to bear it, the cost of bringing about that redistribution of income of which the Minister speaks, and which I am at one with him in his desire to bring about.</P>
    <P>In regard to the Bill itself, naturally the conditions and limitations laid down by the Minister, and the amount of money to be provided, leave very few suggestions to be put forward.  It was very nice of Deputy Briscoe to tell us when he was speaking&mdash;perhaps he had the advantage of speaking to some officials in the House&mdash;that we could make our suggestions to the Minister and that they would be sympathetically considered.  When you have already built the four walls of a house, there is not much use in talking about the plan.  In this case the house has been already set up, and we are told that we can take it or leave it.  There are, however, one or two points which I should like the Minister to consider. In regard to the age limit of 16 years, I take it from the Minister's introductory statement he was following the procedure laid down in other countries, but it seems to me that there is a somewhat different case to be considered here.  We have got an Act on the Statute Book here, the Conditions of Employment Act, which fixes an age limit of 18 years, and, because of that fixation, there has grown up in our industries a reluctance on the part of employers to take in children under 18 years of age, owing to the limitations in regard to hours of work provided for in the Act which, it is held, would create certain difficulties in the normal running of a factory.</P>
    <P>It has become quite a commonplace <Col N="101" /> now that boys and girls are told that they are not wanted until they reach the ago of 18.  That is a very widely-developed practice which is still growing. I would suggest that that fact might be considered with regard to the ago limits provided in this Bill, seeing that we take it for granted in the Bill that when a child reaches the age of 16 he can take up employment and is able to contribute to his own upkeep.  We have a condition of affairs in this country where a gap exists between these ages, a gap of two years in which the demands of a boy or girl on the family income are very great, for food, clothes and the ordinary small, amusements that a young person looks for.  That may mean a very great strain on the family income.  I think the Minister might consider whether it is not equitable and fair that that age of 16 years should be modified to the extent that the allowance should be paid up to 18 in the case of children who are not able to find employment.  When we realise that within the City of Dublin each year, thousands of boys and girls are turned out who have no earthly chance of obtaining employment and who must continue to be a burden on their parents until they can obtain work at the age of 18, we realise that we are only trying to do what the Minister sets out in the Bill, to assist large families and help them to carry the burden of the children who cannot obtain work at the age of 16 and remain with the family for some time.</P>
    <P>There is another point which, I think, is not made clear in the Bill. I take it that such allowances will be paid to the children of serving soldiers, where they are covered by dependent's allowances.  Also, there is the case of children over 16 years of age who, by reason of infirmity or physical defect, are debarred from earning their living&mdash;they may be chronic invalids or cripples of one form or another&mdash;and who must remain a burden on the family tor all the days of their lives.  Surely, an exception could be made in that case and some provision made for bringing those children within the scope of the scheme.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="102" /> In regard to the contributory scheme, I think the Minister dealt quite fairly with it and that it is purely a question of the administrative difficulty. So far as the working class and the trade union movement are concerned, I do not think there was at any time an objection to paying an equal and fair share of any scheme such as this.  We have to realise the conditions under which the bulk of our people live and are forced to rer families.  Those conditions are not of our making.  While it is very nice to talk, as Deputy Anthony does, of preserving the independence of our working class and not making them spineless by giving them so much, the first prerequisite to the independence of any man or woman is the provision of a means of earning livelihood at decent rates of wages and under proper conditions.  Until we have discharged that function, we have no right to suggest that our people want to be reared as spineless people or that they want to hold out their hands to get something for nothing.</P>
    <P>The working class, not only in the towns and cities but also those on the farms, represented by the Farmers Party, are the people who give all and are entitled to full measure.  They are not getting it.  Such schemes as the one introduced to-day provide one small source of returning to the mass of die people what has been denied to them for a very long time.  From that point of view, the contributory scheme is one that could be inaugurated in association with, or on top of, the present scheme, but there is the question of ordinary human social justice to be dealt with first.  This is a first step in that direction, though I am still doubtful that the Minister is doing what he said he set out to do, namely, effect a redistribution of the national income on the basis that it is a solution of some of our social problems.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am very glad, naturally, to see this Bill introduced into this House.  I have been trying to get <Col N="103" /> it introduced for five years and, to-night, I see the realisation of that ambition.  I will not dwell unduly on that, as I have no doubt the Government will scream that I had nothing whatever to do with it.  It really does not mattel who was responsible for having this Bill brought in: the all-important thing is that it has been brought in.</P>
      <P>In our rejoicing at what I regard as something, closely approximating to a great revolution, which will be brought about by this Bill when it becomes an Act, we should not lose sight, of the fact that family allowances, desirable as they are, are only a second best. The ideal, as I see it, in a Catholic country, would be to ensure that every person who did an honest day's work would receive for that labour a wage sufficient to enable him to rear a Christian family.  If we could realise that, it would be a very much better way of meeting the whole question of the special responsibilities of the fathers of families, than the method enshrined in this Bill.  Unfortunately, our country is so circumstanced and the units of industry and agriculture are so small, that it is highly unlikely to be practical in our time to work out a scheme whereunder the persons engaged in agricultural and industrial employment would receive a wage strictly related to their family responsibilities. That ideal being impossible, the best way to meet the evil resulting from the absence of any recognition of the difference between the responsibility of a father of a family and the responsibility of an unmarried man, is to introduce a system of family allowances which shall be superimposed upon the normal wage system of the country, and which will provide a special allowance as a reward to those who have family responsibilities.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened to Deputy Larkin saluting this as the first step in the redistribution of the national income.  I want to sound a note of warning.  If the Labour Party are going to take up the line that everyone who is capable of earning a good income in this country is to have that whole income taken away from them and given to someone <Col N="104" /> else, the net result mil be that everyone capable of earning a good income will quit this country.  There is no getting away from the fact that Has incidence of income-tax, supertax and the other taxes at present being borne by those with comparatinely substantial incomes, is very heavy at the present time.  I know that, it Bounds dramatic and effective to say that there is £9,000,000 being distributed between 3,000 people and to compare that with the man earning 30/- a week; but the truth is that the incidence of income-tax bears wy heavily, not primarily on the, people who are, in enjoyment of what would seem, to us fantastic, incomes, of £20,000 and £30,000 per year, but on the man earning £2,000 or £3,000 a year.</P>
    <P>Take a professor in the university: is he worth £1,200 a year or is be not? If this House thinks he is not, there are hundreds of academic institutions-throughout the world that will be most glad to offer the distinguished scholars of this country more than that sum to give their services and learning in various centres throughout the world.  There are many men working in this country at their own particular jobs who could get more money by going away but, so long as they are able to maintain a reasonably high standard of living here, according to what they think themselves entitled to, they prefer to remain here and give their own people the benefit of their knowledge.</P>
    <P>If it is proposed that a man who has spent 15 or 20 years acquiring scholarship, for the puiyose of qualifying as, a specialist or becoming a professor in a certain line, is to be brought down to the same measure of remuneration or reward as the man who is doing comparatively unskilled work, the net result will be that the scholar and the professor will leave this country and go where their services are better rewarded.  The same applies to the position of an engineer or a distinguished administrator, or to somebody whose presence in this country results in the creation of employment, the stimulation of industry or the promotion of agriculture.  If all those men <Col N="105" /> are to be denied a reward comparable with what they might secure in any other part of the world, the net result of die attempt at a redistribution of our national income which Deputy Larkin mentioned will be that those distinguished men will leave this country and go where their services will be properly rewarded.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that every kind of specious rubbish can be bawled at me.  I can be asked if I am now championing the cause of those individuals who are drawing £15,000 a year from foreign investments.  That is &ldquo;codology&rdquo;. I am talking of people whom Deputy Davin and I know well&mdash;high officials of the railway company, for instance.  Deputy Davin knows perfectly well that they have to be there if the railway is to be kept in existence and if employment is to be provided tor engine drivers and railway porters. High individuals in our public service &mdash;I do not want to mention names&mdash; have been lost to us because of the demand for them elsewhere.  I have in mind one who rose to the highest position in the British Administration. I forget the reasons he left our Administration, but I mention that individual to show the pull there is on the very best men we have got and how, by leaving us and going to other countries, they can get a monetary reward far in excess of anything-they can hope to earn here.  When we exacerbate that situation, undoubtedly we run the risk of losing to foreign competitors the superior brains and ability which are being used in the organisation of industry, agriculture and other enterprises to provide the national ircome we have got and maintain the people who are working in their jobs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Stripped of the service of these elect children of this country&mdash;and they are elect bcause their superior ability and training make them stand out in the community&mdash;we might find that we had no income to distribute and that, instead of serving the wage-earners by distributing the national income on the <Col N="106" /> lines which, I gather.  Deputy Larkin (Junior) had in mind, our very attempt had resulted in tearing down the structure on which their livelihood existed.  The men of brains and ability in agriculture and industry having pone over to our competitors who offered superior rewards, we might find that we had robbed the wage-earner of this country of his ability to earn at all.</P>
    <P>So much having been said, I want to say that I welcome this Bill.  I welcome it for something far more important than the half-crown.  It is the recognition of a great principle.  It is the recognition that, in our community, there should be no penalty for exercising a Christian man's right to marry and raise a family, in so far an the community can help it.  We all know that the terms are not overgenerous. Two-and-sixpence for each child after the second child is not a fortune.  But I want to say quite deliberately that I think it wag a courageous thing ot the Government, in tne circumstances in which it finds itself at present, to face even the burden ot the half-crown.  In the aggregate, it is a substantial sum and many an Executive would have run away from the task of finding the wherewithal to finance this first step on the right road.  I salute the Bill, firstly, for that immensely important thing&mdash;that it recognises the principle of the family wage and our desire to do the next best thing to providing a family wage direct when it is not possible for the employer to provide a family wage for the earner.  I also salute it because it has abolished the means test.  This is, I think, the first piece of social legislation on the Continent of Europe which has abolished the means test.  I have always detested that stigma of pauperism, attached to every social service both here and in Great Britain, under which the fact that a person claimed to be entitled to the advantages provided by legislation enabled a government inspector to trespass on his borne and cross-question him regarding his domestic affairs.</P>
    <P>Under this Bill, every person who has three or more children is entitled, <Col N="107" /> as a right, to get the allowance without any reference to his domestic circumstances whatsoever.  I hope we shall yet be able to organise all our social services here on that basis.  If people came into my home, however well-intentioned they might be, seeking to confer some favour on me, and, as the price of it, claimed the right to pry into my domestic affairs, I should be prepared to suffer a great deal before submitting to that indignity.  The right I claim that my own home be sacrosanct is a right I claim for the home of every individual, rich and poor.  The acknowledgment of that right in this Bill is a precedent on which this Dail will not lightly go back.</P>
    <P>In passing, I want to say something which may be more strictly relevant to the Financial Resolution which we shall consider before the Committee Stage of the Bill.  The Minister, I understand, has adumbrated a very heavy scheme of taxation to meet this service. One cannot distribute £2,250,000 without getting it from some source, but I strenuously urge on the Government, speaking as one thoroughly conservative in matters of public finance, not to attempt to finance this measure exclusively out of revenue during the emergency.  The cost of the Army is £8,500,000 per year.  The Ministry of Supplies, which may reasonably be expected to shrink to diminutive proportions post-war, is a heavy charge on the Exchequer.  Various subsidies of one kind or another constitute a drain on the Exchequer at present, and many of them are made necessary by the existence of the emergency.  It is perfectly legitimate for the Government, at this stage, having decided to introduce this admirable advance in the social service of our community, to introduce the system of two separate Budgets.  That should be done rather than attempt to pile on the taxpayer the total burden of financing this service during the emergency.  The Minister for Finance should prepare an emergency Budget and an ordinary Budget, and bring before the Dáil proposals to finance a certain part of our emergency expenditure expressly and explicitly out of borrowed money.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="108" /> While saying that in regard to the emergency, I want to second most warmly and emphatically the Minister's introductory statement that, in normal times, this service must be financed out of revenue if it is to have any prospect of success or survival. If we were to adopt as part of our normal budgetary practice the financing of social services of this kind out of borrowed money, we should be simply starting on the downhill road which would end in the collapse of all social services.  Having that conviction as clear as crystal before our minds, we should not allow it to confuse us in contemplating the emergency situation with which we are at present confronted.  It would aend off the whole scheme on the wrong foot, it would create unnecessary prejudice against it, if it were made the occasion for putting upon the community a burden of taxation far in excess of their capacity to bear without serious economic dislocation. From the most conservative point of view, it would be an improvident tiling to do.  I shall not pursue that question now because it will arise on the financial resolution which we shall later discuss.</P>
    <P>In what I propose to say now, I confess that I am somewhat thinking aloud.  There is, I think, something to be said for making these allowances payable to the mother of the family. I think that that would emphasise the purpose of the allowance and would establish a kind of permanent memorial of the desire of the Dáil that it should be used for improvement of the amenities which can be afforded to the children in the family.  Now, further than that I do not want to go in indicating the way in which Dáil Eireann desires this money to be used, because, while we have eliminated the means test, I can foresee that before this debate is finished we will find ourselves confronted with a new and much more insidious temptation, and that is that some pious soul will propose that this family allowance will be given in the form of food of some <Col N="109" /> special nutritive character on the ground that we here know better what to do with the family income than the parents whom God has pat over the family.  I think it is reasonable that the Dáil should express a general principle as to how this money ought to be used; but to trespass inside the family circle, to seek to usurp the functions of a father and mother, and dictate to them how the family income is to be used best for the welfare of the family, would be, to my mind, utterly anathema.</P>
    <P>The beauty of this Bill is that it bolts and bars the door against the bureaucrat.  It strengthens the citadel of the family against the Government. It places a complete and absolute discretion in the hands of the parents to use this income as they think best for the benefit of the children, and I earnestly hope that, while we might do something by handing it to the mother, we would not go an inch beyond that in any form of dictation or interference in the way the total family finances are to be administered by the parents.</P>
    <P>I want to ask some specific questions of the Minister which he may or may not be in a position to answer at the moment.  As I understand the Bill, if a family has four children, A, B, C, and D, A and B do not get any allowance and never will, but the moment C arrives on the scene the family gets 2/6 until he attains the age of 16 years, and the same applies to D and to any subsequent children.  But, when A and B attain the age of 16 years, that will not operate to knock C out of benefit.  If I am correct in that assumption&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>No, it is the parents who draw the allowance.  Let us examine the thing from two points.  One could not imagine the Government saying that if you allow that to take place it will cost too much money&mdash;that to allow a child to draw benefit until he is 16 years would cost too much money. Children become more or less like steps of stairs in a family.  If the first child becoming entitled to benefit is two years younger than the second child and gets his 2/6 a week, all you do is to extend the benefit to the third child by two years until it reaches the age of 16 years.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The difference in cost is not going to be substantial to the community; but it will cause a great deal <Col N="111" /> of disappointment and a sense of injustice if a family enjoys allowances in respect of a third child and, because another child attains the age of 16 years&mdash;a child that never had an allowance&mdash;the parents lose the family allowance in respect of the third child. You may argue that the moment the eldest child reaches 16, that lowers the burden of the family, and it is not reasonable that it should go on, getting the same family assistance as it got while the eldest was under 16 years. But in practice, as Deputy Larkin pointed out, the child of 16 does not immediately become an earning asset. It probably will not earn any substantial wages until it is 18 or 19 years, and then probably the contribution to the family would be very much less than the entire wages because the child will become an independent individual. Therefore, I would urge that once the child under this Bill becomes entitled to a family allowance, the family will continue to get that allowance until that child reaches 16 years.  I strongly represent to the Minister that unless that principle is adopted, a bitter sense of grievance will be created in the minds of lots of people.  I do not think we ought to make that concession until we see what it involves. I think it will involve allowing a person with two children over 16 now and two under 16 to get the, allowance, whereas if the Minister's principle stands, then you have a family with the ctBIdren aged 17, 16, 14 and 12 years anal fliat family will get nothing under this Bill.</P>

      <P>Surely it is desirable that representations should be made from more than one part of the House that this anachronism should be removed.  The Minister says, by nodding assent, that interpretation is correct.  I will only repeat that it is a pity to allow that principle to remain.  I do not think any substantial sum can be involved.  It would be impossible, of course, for the Minister to say what the sum will be, but I ask him to look into that point and, if it is trifling, and he finds the <Col N="112" /> majority of Deputies agree with the viewpoint presented by Deputy Norton and myself, he ought to reconsider it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Taoiseach misunderstands me.  As the Bill stands the child of 12 to-day who becomes eligible for the family allowance has an older brother and sister, 13 and 15 years respectively.  The child of 12 draws the family allowance for 12 months and then the eldest child attains 16 years.  Now, the eldest child never had any allowance under the Bill, but the moment that child in respect of whom the family enjoyed no allowance attains 16 years, the allowance in respect of the 13-year-old child stops because the family no longer can claim to have two eligible children before the first child drawing the allowance. My proposal is that, suppose there is a family with children of 15, 14 and 13 years, the third child should be deemed to be a child in respect of whom the family is entitled to draw the allowance until he reaches 16 years of age.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Whatever the Taoiseach may say the people and, I believe, the bulk of Deputies here believe that this allowance is being made to relieve the special circumstances of parents.  The view of Dáil Éireann is that with our limited resources as a community, we must expect parents to enter upon matrimony fortified with provision sufficient to maintain the first two children out of their earnings, and that it is only when the family reaches <Col N="115" /> larger proportions the community comes in and makes a family allowance in respect of the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth child.  I know you can argue that in a family of three children the popular interpretation of this Bill will be that the family allowance is given to the third child.  That may be a mistaken approach.  I think that 90 per cent. of the Deputies will feel that what we were doing in this Bill is asking ourselves could we give it to the second child, and that we made up our mind that in view of the financial burdens of the present time, the cost would be excessive to give it to the third, but that people who had a third, fourth, fifth and sixth child would get this help.  As I say, the popular feeling will be that it is the third child that guts the allowance, although the Minister says it is the family is getting it in consideration of having three children.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I am suggesting to the Taoiseach that the additional financial burden of allowing the third child to enjoy the family allowance until it reaches the age of 16 is not going to be a substantial one.  Now it may be an illogical thing to do.  It may seem to differ from the underlying principle of the Bill.  What matter if it is the better thing to do, and if it is the thing that our people will best understand. I suggest, and press upon the Minister, that once he has accorded a family allowance in respect of a third child, that family allowance should continue until the third child attains the age of 16, and that no regard should be had to the age ot the older children.  That is a point that we can discuss further on the Committee Stage.  It is one that I intend to press upon the Minister.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In regard to the new principle which, I understand, was adumbrated by Deputy Norton, I most emphatically subscribe to it, namely, that the Minister should also provide when the Bill comes into operation that, in the <Col N="116" /> case of a family consisting of three children, one being 16, one 15 and one 14, it should forthwith be entitled to one family allowance in respect of the 14 year old child.  I am convinced that is what the people expect, and that is what they all believed the Bill was going to provide.  I believe it that is done, it will send the measure off to a good start, and that is something which I most earnestly desire that it should have.</P>
    <P>I understand there is a queer proviso in the Bill about regions.  I suppose what is meant is some economy in administration, and that a small group of officials should deal with the country region by region.  It is a point to which I do not attach much importance, provided it does not mean that this allowance is going to be paid monthly or at longer intervals. I think it should be paid weekly with this option, that those who desire to take the allowance monthly, or at longer periods, would be permitted to do so.  I do not know whether the allowance will be paid in the manner that old age pensions are paid, but in my view people who are not accustomed to receive payments weekly at the Post Office should not be constrained to do so.  In their case the payments might be allowed to accumulate and permission be given to cash them at their convenience.</P>
    <P>Apart from these points the Bill does not seem to be a very involved one. I do not regard it as the end of the road.  I regard it as a very early beginning.  I heartily congratulate the Government on introducing it.  I believe it will be a lead, not only in the advancement of our own social services, but a lead to Great Britain, and that in doing good to our own small population, we shall, perhaps, do good to the far bigger industrial population of Great Britain and other countries that will follow our lead.  I trust, however, it will not be made the occasion for a general assault upon everyone in this House who has the presumption to have an income.  I thank God that we have in our midst <Col N="117" /> some men who by their superior skill or intellect were capable of earning a higher income than the unskilled labourer.  I worn the House again that, if we deny them the just reward of such exceptional abilities, there are others who will be glad to give it to them.  I hope that the scheme will go through with a little further amendment, except that which the Taoiseach found it difficult to understand, and which the Minister for Industry and Commerce understood at once, but resisted vigorously from the word &ldquo;go.&rdquo;  I hope when the Taoiseach is clear in his mind on that, that the Minister for Industry and Commerce will soften his heart, and that they will go forward together to make the concession in respect of this Bill and, if they do, I think to-night will be a very memorable occasion in the history of the social services of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Fitzgerald-Kenney</NameTxt>
      <P>This Bill embodies a principle with which the whole House is in agreement.  It might, therefore, seem strange, and did, in fact, seem strange to many speakers in this debate, that this Bill should have been brought in in the spirit in which the Minister introduced it.  On a Bill, on the principle of which all Parties are agreed, it certainly strikes one as strange that a speech of a most war-like tone should be made, and that the Minister should lake up a most threatening attitude. At first sight that might appear rather strange, but on close examination it would have been hardly possible for the Minister to have adopted any other attitude.  If, must be plain to everybody who listened to the Minister's speech that the introduction of this Bill was no labour of love for him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Persons who listened to the Minister must have formed the conclusion that he was bringing in this Bill with very great reluctance indeed, and must have come to the conclusion that he thought he was acting unwisely.  They must have come to the conclusion that the sums of money which the Minister mentioned, involving 1/- on the income-tax, 2d. on this and 6d. on that, were very great sacrifices which he was <Col N="118" /> making with the greatest reluctance. In consequence of his reluctance and because he was probably acting against his better judgment, the Minister adopted a particular tone when introducing this measure.  I sincerely hope when the Bill is going through Committee that the Minister's attitude will be less dictatorial than it was to-day.</P>
    <P>It is unnecessary for me to say that though this may not be the most perfect of Bills of this nature, or the most perfect scheme which could be introduced, yet since this principle of family allowances was one of the things which we put in the very first place on our programme at the last general election, the people are pleased to see any form of family allowance. I am not at all sure that the introduction of the Bill will, of necessity, do the maximum amount of good, or that it may be capable of amendment into the better Bill, which we all wish the Minister would have found himself willing or unwilling to introduce.  I forget who it was that said: &ldquo;Good is the enemy of the best&rdquo;.  Possibly this Bill being good, because it embodies a good principle, may prove to be the enemy of the best, but wider in its scope and working on a different principle than the Bill we would like to have seen introduced.</P>
    <P>There is one thing in this Bill against which I want to lodge my most emphatic protest.  There is one section in it which certainly should not be in any Bill introduced here.  We gave up, during the emergency, the sovereignty of this Parliament.  We gave up the sovereign power of the Oireachtas, and put it in the hands of the Executive.  We did so with great reluctance, and not because we are not wed to the principle of the sovereignty of this Assembly.  No doubt in financial matters the present administration did give away the sovereignty of the Oireachtas.  As far as tariffs are concerned no doubt we cannot introduce all the tariffs we want.  Our legislation as regards tariffs is subject to appeal. Apart from that, and from the power which the House gave to the Ministry, the sovereignty of this Parliament has not been challenged.  This is the first time in the history of this House in <Col N="119" /> which a piece of ordinary legislation embodies a principle like that laid down in Section 19.  I shall read that section.  (<i>Section quoted.</i>)</P>
    <P>Therefore, for one year, it lies in the power of the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Industry and Commerce to set aside, to modify, or to alter what we in this House and in the Seanad may decide to be the law.  We have set up, and are setting up for the first time in the history of this State&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>If it appears in the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Act, I regret that it passed my notice, but it has certainly come to my notice now, and I strongly protest against any Minister or any two Ministers haying the power to alter, by a stroke of the pen, any legislation passed by the Oireachtas.  I sincerely hope that Section 19 will be deleted from the Bill, for it is a bad principle.  One of the dangers of democracy in this and wery other country is the danger of bureaucracy usurping its place, and this is certainly the most bureaucratic section I have seen in any Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are other matters to which I should like to refer, but they are possibly more points for Committee Stage than for a Second Reading discussion. I think, however, that on Committee Stage the words in sub-section (3) of Section 3, &ldquo;The child lives with, and is in the custody, care and control of, that person&rdquo; are words which will probably have to be modified. I can visualise, for example, a case in which a child is boarded out with a foster-parent&mdash;not necessarily by a board of guardians, although possibly the same thing would happen in that case but paid for by a parent. That child would live with and be in <Col N="120" /> the custody, care and control of that person.  I am, of course, visualising a case in which the foster-parent has two children under 16 of his own.  In that case, the father might be paying 10/- a week for the maintenance of his child, and he ought to get the money, and not, the foster-parent.</P>

      <P>Yes; I merely mention it as one case.  Take the case of a widow with children who marries.  The husband might be supporting the entire four children, but yet he could hardly be said to have the custody, care and control of the children who are living there because they are his step-children.  Certainly if there were any question about it, the court would regard the custody as being with the mother.  I am putting that to the Minister in order that he may consider whether these words do not require modification.  I should like the Minister to explain sub-section (6) of Section 3 which reads:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;A person shall not be entitled to payment of more than one children's allowance during any week.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>How does that work in relation to Section 18, which says, at the end of three months. the instruments cannot be cashed at all?  It looks to me that it a person once got into arrears, failed to lodge for one week what he had received, he would not be able to get anything. However, as I say, it is more a point for Committee Stage than for this stage, but I must frankly confess that I do not understand it, even at this moment.  A point has been put forward by Deputy Dillon, and I suppose there will be a difference of opinion about it, as to whether payment should be made to the mother or the father.  So far as my personal view is concerned.  I would regard the father as the head of the family unit, and, <Col N="122" /> although the point is not of very great importance, I should rather see payment nude to the head of the family than to the mother.  We should not have let us say, revolutions in families or disputes as to headship.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I was very interested in the Minister's remarks when moving the Second Reading of this Bill, and, like Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, I welcome his explanatory statement, but I do suggest that there was a spirit of negation in it and a sort of bitterness expressed for which I hope, before we reach the Committee Stage, the Minister and the Government will express their regret.  A Bill like this of which, as has been stated from all sides of the House, the principle is accepted, surely should have come into the House in an atmosphere of contentment and an atmosphere of adjustment, and not in an atmosphere, after an explanatory statement of the different sections, in which a challenge if thrown out to the House to the effect: &ldquo;This is a matter of confidence, and if you do not accept it in the way we formulate it, the Government will stand behind it and challenge the House on it.&rdquo;  I do not think a Bill of this character should be introduced in that spirit at all.  I think it was quite uncalled for, and if the Government wants to make this the main plank of their platform in an appeal to the country, I am afraid it will not be a very sound platform.  The plank would be a bit shaky.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think that one or two Deputies said that it was a matter that nobody should challenge.  But the Government really have not been responsible for tho introduction of this Bill.  The Minister explained that the general consensus of opinion in this country, apart from political Parties&mdash;the opinion of the man in the street, the woman in the house, and sociologists of all schools of thought&mdash;was that something should be done in this direction.  Then why make this challenge?&mdash;more particularly when Deputy Dillon has claimed that he is the father of the child. There seems to be quite a number of fathers or stepfathers.  I know that not only the official Labour Party, but labour generally, have advocated this <Col N="123" /> idea for a generation.  As a matter of fact, the Minister referred to two particular countries where this has been made the ordinary domestic policy of the Government, namely, Australia and New Zealand.  The Minister was on good ground when quoting these countries.  But remember what the basis of the family allowance is in Australia and New Zealand.  The minimum wage required to bring up a family has been worked out and, in any court of law in Australia or in New Zealand, when an argument is raised in connection with wages or workmen's compensation, that minimum wage is always brought in as the basis of the judgment&mdash;that a man with a wife and two children shall be allowed a fixed wage of £4 per week. I wonder what would happen in this country if we set down that a man with a wife and two children would be entitled to £4 as a week's wages.  But that has been in force in these countries. There is, of course, an allowance for additional children.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister went from the sublime to the ridiculous and quoted Italy.  There is a lot of talk about Italy.  For two years I have had to listen to a lot of intelligent people stating that in Italy all kinds of social legislation were in force.  Now, of course, the veil has been drawn back, and it has been shown that all this was only on paper, that the workers there were not enjoying these social security benefits at all.  They had no labour courts.  They had no family allowances or other social security allowances. They were only all on paper.  A certain loud-mouthed gentleman used to say what he was going to do, but he did not do it.</P>
    <P>Then the Minister brought us to that other sublime paradise, Portugal. I suggest to the Minister and to Deputies that they should never mention Portugal when talking about social conditions or social justice.  Some day we will open your eyes when we get rid of the Censor, and will be able to tell the truth about that particular paradisaical portion of the earth.  Then, of course, the Caudillo in Spain gives all kinds of benefits, generally in conditions <Col N="124" /> under which the people are not able to enjoy them or even enjoy life. However, there are other countries, such as the Scandinavian countries, that have taken up this matter.  Then we have the elaborate report which was quoted from both sides of the House&mdash;the Beveridge Report.  I suggest that Deputies should be supplied with a copy of that report&mdash;not the brief extracts that the Minister quoted or that Deputy Cosgrave touched upon.  There are a certain number of copies of that report in Dublin.  We should also get the considered opinion of those associated with Beveridge.  One of the men who drafted the scheme is a fellow-countryman&mdash;a brother of Lord Longford.  In that document, of course, there is a great deal that might be called idealistic from the point of view of Deputy Dillon.  To me it is brutally practical, and will become practical politics in the near future.  There can be no question about that.  This Government will have to move from one stage to another, as we drive them from outside.  I do not mean to suggest that the Government brought in this Bill of their own initiative, just because they loved the common people. Although nearly all of them come from the common people, some of them are trying to get away from the common people, so far as tail-coats can distinguish them.  There was a time when if they were found wearing a tail-coat or a white shirt they would be despised.  But now, of course, they are getting as far removed as they can from the working classes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am only suggesting that there is a certain atmosphere around this Bill.  I may be going outside the ordinary lines of the debate, but I will soon get within them.  I notice, without any reflection on you, Sir, that sometimes other people can suggest colourful ideas which seem to pass.  Deputy Dillon on many occasions gets outside the lines of the debate, and he gets a certain amount of sympathy.  Of course I am like the Ishmaelite&mdash;I do not get that amount <Col N="125" /> of sympathy.  I am asking you, Sir, to give me a certain amount of room to spread myself out.  I am not reflecting on you.  Sir, because I know very well that you are always very careful in regard to this matter.  But I sugscst that this Hill is not introduced because of love, but because of political drive and urge.  How does that urge function?  There are certain people in this country who are living in uncomfortable conditions of life.  The Government wish to take the hard edge off that and to try to keep these people reconciled to the miserable conditions in which they are forced to live by throwing them a sop here and a sop there.  One day you give them turf at a shilling a bag.  The next week you roll them that they will have to pay 2/-.  Then you give the poor widow a bag of turf at 1/-.  You give the blind man a bag of turf, which costs him 6d. to get delivered.  Then you give somebody else 1 lb. of butter and afterwards take it off him.  Why not give them a real measure of life?  Why not give them what they have a God-given right to, namely, a measure of life equal to that of any other man or woman in the community?  The earth is bountiful. During the last few months we have arguments put forward here that certain people will not produce foodstuffs unless they get the equivalent in hard cash.  It is said that they are not being paid for the work they do.  Yet their deposits in the banks have increased from £25,000,000 to £61,000,000.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with where you are to get the money.  This is a Money Bill as well as a Bill for social security, because at a later stage we will have to vote the money to meet the expenditure under this Bill.  I want to draw the attention of the House to where this money is.  I believe Deputy Larkin (Junior) in my <Col N="126" /> absence referred to some of these matters.  I suggest that the principle of the Bill is all right but that the application of the principle in the Bill is all wrong and I think it ought to be modified.  I was having tea in the House the other evening when Deputy Dillon came along.  I never spoke to him before.  He said that the Children's Allowances Bill was to be introduced and the allowance was to be 5/- per week.  I went home overjoyed thinking that at last we were to have real life in this country&mdash;that this was the first step to the enlargement of life.  Then, of course, I woke up the following day and found that the allowance was to be 2/6 subject to certain conditions.  My suggestion is that a family allowance is not the right and proper way to approach this matter.  I suggest that every child born into this country has got a property right in this country.  The child itself should get this value.  The child should get thia money, whether it be 2/6 or 5/- a week, as part of its inheritance. It is not a question of helping the father.  God only knows why some of the fathers are called fathers. They do not accept their responsibilities. That applies to some of the mothers also, who are careless and reckless of their offspring.  Having brought the children into the world, many of them think other people should carry their burden.  But, if the child itself, being born a citizen into this nation, has this right recognised, then there can be no quarrel between any of the parties.  During childhood and adolescence, the father or mother, as the case may be&mdash;in my opinion, the father&mdash;should have that child's allowance given to him for the purpose of giving the child a larger measure of life.  It is not a question of giving the father who has four children or five children another 2/6 a week which he may go and spend in the public house or which he can spend on something else, perhaps backing horses.  It is that any child&mdash; my child or your child&mdash;shall have a guarantee that a measure of life shall <Col N="127" /> be granted to it and in recognising this principle, we grant the child so much a week.  Then we would not have this quarrel between the mathematicians in the House on every side as to whether two goes into three or three into five, or whether the fact that Charlie has come to 16 years of age should debar Mickie from having another 2/6 a week.  Is not that kind of argument absurd and illogical?  It could very easily be dealt with by saying that every child born into any family in this nation shall be entitled &mdash;in this case&mdash;to 2/6 a week.  Somebody caring for tha child should he entitled to draw that 2/6, until it reaches the age which the law itself lays down as altering it from a child to an adult man.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Conditions of Employment Act, 1936, lays, it down definitely and clearly that a boy or girl is a child until the age of 18, when he or she becomes an adult.  In this city alone there are 8,000 children, boys and girls, between the ages of 14 and 20, who have never worked, who have never had an opportunity to work.  It is estimated that there are some 70,000 between the ages of 14 and 20 in this country of less than 3,000,000 people, who have never worked, but in the City of Dublin, we know&mdash;we have had the figures checked up; there has been a difference of opinion as to an odd 500 or so&mdash;that 8,000 have never had an opportunity of getting employment.  Is not that a fearful problem?  The Minister has risen to the occasion.  He set up a committee to deal with that matter.  It is a dreadful thing to think of these families.  There are men and women&mdash; I know many of them; many Deputies know them&mdash;who have four and five children, some of them in their teens, and there is not a chance in the world for those boys between the ages of 15 and 16, up to 18 years of age, getting a job as a result of another Act that was passed.  This is the awful difficulty those of us engaged in industrial organisation are placed in.  The Minister introduced certain remedial measures, intending to do good.  The trade unions approved them.  But <Col N="128" /> they are availed of by directors.  The minimum age, under certain conditions of employment, was raiaed to 18. Another Act lays it down that a boy or girl under 18 years of age could not work longer than 40 hours a week. Immediately, the bulk of the employers, who are distinguished for a wonderful feeling of responsibility towards their directors and the dividend mongers, said,: &ldquo;We are not going to pay anybody a week's wages for 40 hours' work; we will employ no more at 14 to 16 years of age&rdquo;&mdash; although many people believe it is far better for a boy or girl to be at work, at 14 to 18 years of age, than running the street.  The employers said: &ldquo;We used to pay 10/- a week to a boy or girl, but the Fianna Fáil Government, having brought in certain remedial measures in connection with industrial life, have now given us an opportunity to get the boy or girl at 18 years of age as cheap as formerly got the bey or girl of 14 years of age.&rdquo;</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Larkin Mr. Larkin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>I am dealing with the Bill.  I am pointing out that children between the ages of one and 16 come under this Bill.  Under particular measures that have been passed, such children now have no chance of working in industry until they are 18 years of age, and I am arguing along the line along which another Deputy argued, that we ought to increase the age to 18 years of age, so as to cover those boys and girls who are being denied work in practically all the factories in the City of Dublin, because of the 40 hours' limitation in the 1936 Act.  These are practical matters that we are dealing with every hour of the day and when we make these suggestions, naturally, someone resents it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I want to remind the House that the Minister is somewhat fearful of putting heavy taxes upon the community to provide this sum, which is a little less than £2,250,000.  For every child, in excess of two, the family gets an allowance of £6 5s.  That is a little less than £2,250,000.  The Minister is somewhat fearful that he will have <Col N="129" /> difficulty in impressing upon the community the necessity for putting up the money for this very wholesome piece of legislation.  I suggest he ought not be fearful of that at all.  We have seen enough money spent in this country on things that were not going to be as healthy in their effects upon the nation.  After all, we spend £10,000,000 here upon the Army.  What about this army that the Minister is dealing with now&mdash;the army of the young? They are the real army of this nation. They are the coming, nation.  If we give £10,000,000 to organise an armed force to protect this nation, these children and their parents, why should we not spend £10,000,000 on the coming army of the nation, the coming nation itself?  Is not that an idea that the Minister might take home and think out?</P>
    <P>This £2,250,000 is for a good social work, improving the conditions of boys and girls with a view to making them good men and women, with courage and strength; it is to care for them in their formative years.  The Minister anticipates all kinds of difficulties. Who are the people who are going to make the difficulties?  The taxpayers? We suggest that there are many henhouses and roosts in this country that might be raided, where you could very easily get this £2,250,000.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon was somewhat fearful because Deputy Larkin (Junior) sug-. gested that there should be a levelling up of incomes&mdash;a levelling up. not a levelling down.  He asks is the poor professor with £1,000 or £1,200 a year going to be driven out of this country because of this suggestion by Deputy Norton?  Never mind the professors. Never mind the technicians.  I think, with Deputy Dillon, that the professor, the scientific research worker, the technician, are entitled to a full measure of life.  Deputy Dillon then drew a contrast between the professor and the technician and the common labourer. I did not know there was such a differentiation between the common labourer, the technician or professor. I thought that in the sight of God we were all equal, but now it seems that there are classes in this country. <Col N="130" /> Deputy Dillon is concerned about these classes and class differentiation.  I suggest that a child of a labourer has as much right to a full measure of life as Deputy Dillon.  Deputy Dillon never did a hard day's work in his life although he told someone the other day he dug more ground in some particular part of this country than any man on the Farmers' Benches.  I doubt that, however.  I doubt it altogether.  I doubt whether a great many of those people who claim that they would be able to do labouring work would be able to do it if they were actually called upon to undertake it.  I venture 16 say that if the Deputy and I wow to go out together some morning with a pick and shovel in order to cut a certain measure of ground, he would be a very sad man before noon.  However, that is by the way.  I do not like this differentiation in the case of men or women who give away their service to the nation, so to speak, or who give their service according to the measure of its value.</P>
    <P>In that connection I should like to call the attention of the House to a number of people, who are in receipt of large incomes, in return for which they do not give any service.  Let us bring these people out into the light, according to Government figures&mdash;and everybody knows, of course, that Government figures do not lie, and that figures provided by the Government are as near to the truth as you can get in this life.  Now, according to the Department of Finance&mdash;and, above all, if any Government Department might, make a mistake, I am sure we will all agree that the Department of Finance could not make one&mdash;in the year 1938-39, there were no less than 1,093 persons in receipt of yearly incomes of from £1,500 to £2,000; 936 people in receipt of incomes from £2,000 to £3,000 per year; 350 people in receipt of incomes from £3,000 to £4,000 per year.  The list goes down from the number of people in receipt of that minimum of £1,500 per year, to no less than 81 people in this country who are enjoying an income of £10,000 a year, I think it will be found, on examination, that most of those particular ladies or gentlemen do not contribute <Col N="131" /> any scientific or technical knowledge, and, certainly, no manual labour, towards the development of this country, because the majority of these people are living on rents, interest or profits.  The total income assessed in regard to all these people in 1938-39 amounted to almost £10,000,000, of which the Government took, by way of income-tax, surtax, and so on, the sum of £736,000.</P>

      <P>I think we ought to examine those figures with a view to seeing that no people in the community will escape the ordinary measure of fair taxation.  Of course, we are hot going into the question of the financial arrangements of this country as compared with other countries, or with the question of our economy.  What we wish to know is whether there is anybody in this country who has got accumulated wealth and who is not contributing his fair ,share to the existence of this State.  Examine the position for yourselves; Go down to any of the auction sales that are held from time to time here in the city or down to the country, and you will see some old lady or gentleman bidding thousands of pounds for pieces of bric-a-brac that are not even worth carrying home.  I have gone to some of these auction sales and have been astounded to see people paying very big prices for pictures that no decent man would hang on the walls of his home.  Now, somebody mast have the money to enable them to buy these things.  I remember even an auctioneer himself being astounded at the money that <Col N="132" /> was being offered for all kinds of rubbish&mdash;even from an artistic point of view it was really rubbish&mdash;and yet these people were quite willing to throw their money away on such rubbish. Some of these ladies and gentlemen must have the money.  In that connection, I noticed the case of two brothers in the Cooley area in County Louth who had some money hoarded away and, while they were out one day, some wise guy came along and gathered something like £500 which these two men had stored away.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Larkin</NameTxt>
      <P>Very well, Sir, I shall reserve those remarks until then, but might I suggest to the Minister that it would be well to find out who those ladies and gentlemen are?  In conclusion, however, I want to say that I think that everybody in this country, without distinction, will welcome this approach to a measure of social justice, and I believe that we ought to approach this new form of legislation in a different spirit altogether: a spirit of adjusting and improving any particular Bill so that no mistakes will be made and so that we will not be too harsh on any particular sections of the community, but try to be just to all sections of the community.  In that connection, I would say that if I, personally, had to pay even 1/- a pound more for tobacco, and if by doing so a child would be enabled to have a <Col N="133" /> better kind of life than at present, then I, and, I am sure, anybody else, would not grudge it, and I can certainly say that if any man thinks of coining to me to complain of having to pay an extra 1d. for his pint of beer, he had better not do so, because I would throw him out.</P>
      <P>In tho same way, if any other gentleman, in the income-tax paying class, were to come to me with a complaint of that kind, and if, as a result of the increase in his income-tax, a child would be provided with a better way of life, then the child, certainly, would have first claim on my sympathy.  I do not pay income-tax, as a member of the Dáil.  As a matter of fact, I have never paid income-tax, either inside or outside the Dáil.  Many of the people who do pay income-tax are always grumbling about it; but think of the people who have never had an opportunity in their lives of paying income-tax, because they never had a sufficient income on which to be charged a tax.</P>

      <P>I, with other members of the House, welcome this Bill, but I wish the Minister had gone somewhat further, because I am very much afraid that this Bill is going to be a cause of very grave disappointment to many people.  I should like to put a question to him to-night, and to the House senerally, having heard other speakers. Is it correct to assume that in the case of a family where there are four children of the ages of nine, 11, 16 and 17 years of age, that family will get nothing at all?  I listened to the questioning that went back and forward between the Minister and Deputy Dillon, and I ask again whether parents, with children of the ages of nine, 11, 16 and 17, will get nothing under this Bill, although the parents of those four children will be called upon to pay their share of the suggested increase in taxes on certain commodities, such as 1/- a lb. on tobacco, ½d. a lb. on sugar, a ½d. a pint on beer, and 2d. a lb. on tea and also, according to this morning's papers, an extra ½d. on a 4 lb. loaf of bread?  It would appear, if so, that as A result of this measure being brought <Col N="134" /> in, the kind of family to which I have referred will get nothing at all but will have to pay for the increased taxation on commodities mentioned by the Minister to-day.  Is that the position?</P>
      <P>I welcome tho Bill because, it is the first measure that has been brought into this House, to which, apparently, no means test is attached.  It does not involve the application of a means test, but I should like to know whether, say, a widow, who has been gaining benefits under the Widows and Orphans' Pensions Act, will lose under this Bill.  If she has been getting, let us say, 2/6 a week already under that Act, will she lose anything under this Bill?</P>

      <P>Well, I am glad to know that that is so, and that a widow or orphan will not be deprived of even one sixpence under this measure.  I have already made reference to the fact that all people will have to pay this increased taxation, but I welcome the Bill as a step forward.  Mind you, I am not complaining.  I am not asking you to give with both hands, or demanding that you should provide reforms for our people, and then objecting to certain forms of taxation. that may be necessary in order to implement these reforms.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Flanagan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if he will state (a) the dates on which the cutting of turf ceased on Bohatch Bog, Mountshannon, County Clare, for the years 1941-42, 1942-43, 1943-44; (b) the number of cubic yards of peat cut each year and the tonnage of turf produced therefrom; (c) whether some of the peat cut in this bog in 1941 was never removed after being harrowed out, until it was collected up and re-barrowed into bog holes; (d) whether more of it was only &ldquo;footed&rdquo; in the late autumn of 1941, gathered into heaps in the spring of 1942, and offered for sale in the winter of 1942-43 at 1/- per horse creel, but that it was so bad that it could not be disposed of even at this price; (e) and whether he will cause an investigation to be made into the working of the county council turf scheme in the Bohatch Bog.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>The information so far as available is as follows:&mdash; (a) Turf cutting ceased in Bohatch Bog on the 9th August, 1941, the 22nd August, 1942, and the 7th August, 1943; (b) in 1941, 15,924 cubic yards, in 1942, 7,806 cubic yards, and in 1943, 3,700 cubic yards were cut.  Records are not kept of the weight of the turf disposed of from separate bogs.  (c) I would refer the Deputy to the reply given to a previous question in which it was intimated that the Department was informed that such an allegation was baseless.  (d) In many places where scraw or very light turf was cut it was found unsuitable for transport and had to be excluded from the main crop. These cuttings must be undertaken in <Col N="22" /> the process of development, but I have no information to what extent this applied in the present instance.  I am informed that such cuttings were offered at varying prices up to 4/- per ton, and about 20 tons were disposed of.  (e) The circumstances do not call for any special investigation.</P>
