      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if his attention has been drawn to a statement by the Leader of the House of Lords, reported in the Press on March 10th, that the British Government had already been in touch with the Dominions and India on post-war financial questions; whether this country has been included in such discussions; and, if not, if he will make representations to have this country included in any future such discussions.</P>

      <P>I have seen the statement referred to.  This country has not been included in the discussions.  There is, however, a certain informal exchange of information on financial matters going on all the time between the two countries.  If at any time formal discussions are considered necessary, representations to this effect will be made.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for External Affairs if he will state what steps, if any, have been taken by his Department to protect the lives of seamen on Irish ships carrying food supplies and other essential goods to Éire; if guarantees will be asked for an uninterrupted passage for the remainder of our Irish ships, and if the Government have made any protest concerning the recent Irish shipping losses.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It would obviously not be desirable to detail the steps which have been taken to ensure the safety of our ships and their crews. The Deputy may rest assured that no step which might contribute towards that end has been neglected.</P>
      <P>As regards the second part of the Deputy's question, neutral ships carrying neutral cargoes have a right to navigate freely and safely.  I do not see why we should seek guarantees or special agreements about something to which we are entitled in international law, and I do not think any useful purpose would be served by our doing so.</P>
      <P>In the last year and a half we have lost three vessels.  One&mdash;&ldquo;The City of Bremen&rdquo;&mdash;was sunk last June as the result of a bombing attack by a German aircraft.  A strong protest was made to the German Government. Since then, two other vessels have been presumed lost&mdash;the &ldquo;Irish Pine&rdquo; last November and the &ldquo;Kyleclare&rdquo; at the end of last month.  There is no evidence as to what happened to these two vessels, and in each case the loss is at present the subject of an official inquiry in accordance with Section 465 of the Merchant Shipping Act.  I am awaiting the result of these inquiries.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will state in respect of each of the years 1938-39, 1939-40, 1940-41 and 1941-42 (a) the number of persons chargeable to surtax; (b) the total income of the persons so chargeable, and (c) the yield of surtax.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>As the answer to this question contains a number of figures, I propose to have it circulated with the Official Report.</P>
      <P>Following is the answer: As regards (a) and (b), it is assumed that what the Deputy has in mind is the number of persons assessed to surtax and their total income.  As the special-commissioners continue to receive returns for the years concerned, complete statistics showing final figures are not available. So far as (c) is concerned, it is assumed that what the Deputy requires is the surtax charged on assessments already made, and not the amount actually so far collected.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance if he will cause the claim of Mr. Patrick Boyle, 47 Dargle Road. Cabra, to be reinvestigated; if he is aware that Mr. Boyle's wife was killed in her residence, 157 North Strand Road, when her home was demolished by the bombing on the night of 31st May, 1941; if he is aware that Mr. Boyle paid 10/- per week for 18 months for the nursing of the ten-months-old baby deprived of its mother, and if he will state why Mr. Boyle has not received these expenses or compensation for the loss of his wife.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The case referred to in the Deputy's question has already been fully investigated, and reinvestigation would serve no useful purpose.  The answer to the second part of the question is in the affirmative.  As regards the third part, the relevant Personal Injuries Scheme provides for compensation for those dependent upon persons injured or killed as a result of bombing and kindred incidents, but does not make provision for consequential expenditure such as that referred to by the Deputy.  The investigations made in the case show that Mr. Boyle was not dependent upon his wife within the meaning of the scheme and no compensation in respect of her death can be paid to him.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Am I to understand from the Minister that he approves of the decision that no compensation is to be given to a man whose wife was killed by bombing, and who had to find another parent to take charge of his ten-months-old baby?</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Then I ask him whether or not a man whose wife is killed by bombing&mdash;a man who loses his wife as a housekeeper and loses her companionship, and whose baby loses its mother&mdash;is entitled to some compensation from this State?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that in those cases only financial dependence is considered. I do not think anything would compensate a person for the other kind of loss.  I have never heard of an attempt being made anywhere to compensate a person for that loss.  Only financial dependence is considered in those cases, and the Deputy is well aware of that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that, quite recently, a case was decided in England where a woman was killed by a motor car, and her husband got £2,500 compensation for the losses which I have mentioned&mdash;motherhood, companionship and the loss of her as a housekeeper?  Surely those things are worthy of some consideration, and Mr. Boyle ought to get some fair play from the Government.</P>

      <NameTxt>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance (Mr. Moylan)</NameTxt>
      <P>I am advised that any scarcity of turf in Portarlington town is not due to the impassable condition of the roads, as most of the turf cut last year which is <Col N="1342" /> still lying on bogs situated around Portarlington is not fully saved.</P>
      <P>Grants have already been sanctioned for the repair of certain roads in this area to facilitate the removal of the 1943 turf crop, and further grants are being considered in the case of other roads the necessity for which was only recently brought to my notice.</P>

I am informed that the present condition of the roads is not holding up the removal of turf cut last year.

      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce whether he is aware that it has been decided by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company that 18 of their clerical staff in Dublin are redundant, and that the company is proceeding to transfer some of that staff on loan to Northern Ireland and some on permanent transfer to Great Britain; and if he will cause inquiry to be made into this matter, with a view to inducing the company to continue to maintain their staffs in the way in which our industrial and business firms generally are doing, and to preventing harsh permanent changes being made because of temporary emergency conditions.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am informed that the traffic handled by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company at Dublin has shown a falling-off of 37 per cent in 1942 as compared with 1941, and that this reduction, with the reductions of previous years, has rendered a proportion of the Dublin clerical staff redundant.  Of the 18 clerks stated to be redundant at present I have learned from inquiries that arrangements are being made to lend 12 to the Great Northern Railway Company and to transfer the remaining six to other dêpots.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to the latter part of the Deputy's question the position of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Company is not quite comparable with that of undertakings whose activities are located wholly in this country. One of the conditions of service applicable to all its employees is liability to serve at any depot on the system.  I have been informed that the company is not proposing to dispense with the services of any of the clerks concerned. In the circumstances it is not clear <Col N="1347" /> that I can take any effective action in the matter.</P>

      <P>Is not the Minister aware that this company earns a very substantial dividend from the trade of this country, and is he not also aware that the export trade is even increasing?  Apart from that, and the fact that the company depends a lot on this company, is not the Minister aware that this company does not make any arrangements at all by which any facilities are granted to people who join the Army in this country during the emergency, whereas they bring the pay up to the present company pay on behalf of those who join the British Army?  Does he consider that anything can be done in cases like this where permanent changes are being made from residences in Dublin and elsewhere in the country to Great Britain simply because there is a certain falling off of traffic?</P>

      <P>I am informed by the Great Southern Railways Company <Col N="1350" /> that, with the development of road freight services in the Westport area it became apparent that there was a waste of locomotive power and delay in loading road freight lorries caused by sending certain traffic through to the quay station by rail.  The change does not imply the closing down of the quay station, as wagon load traffic, where such offers, will continue to be taken through to the latter place.  The goods of any firm offering wagon load traffic are accepted.  Transport facilities to the harbour are not being taken away since all traffic will be carried by either road or rail.  The additional charge raised on wagon-load traffic taken through to the quay is under examination.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister <Col N="1359" /> for Local Government and Public Health (a) whether he has seen the statement of the acting County Manager for Kerry that the total expenditure on turf was £230,290, that the receipts amount to only £70,597, that Fuel Importers, Limited, owe the council £30,000; (b) what steps have been taken, in accordance with the answer of the late Parliamentary Secretary on December 9th last, to liquidate as rapidly and as profitably as possible the saleable remainder of the turf, whether by export or by local consumption; (c) whether he can give any estimate of the quantity of the turf on hands which may be deemed unsaleable; (d) whether he is aware that in connection with the turf scheme this council has incurred a large overdraft, and (e) what steps the Government proposes to take to come to the assistance, financial and other, of the council.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee) Seán MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not seen the statement referred to but I understand that such a statement was issued.  The rate of disposal of turf is affected by weather conditions as well as demands on transport.  The period December to March is not a favourable one for the removal of turf. From the 9th December, 1942, to the 18th March, 4,090 tons of county council turf were disposed of to Fuel Importers, Limited, and 72 tons to other purchasers.  It is likely the rate of delivery to Fuel Importers, Limited, will increase from now onwards.  I am not in a position to give any estimate of the quantity of turf which may be deemed unsaleable.  There is a considerable quantity which is not suitable for export from the county to non-turf areas, but it is to be expected that the county manager will do everything possible to secure that it is disposed of locally at a fair price.  Accordingly, although the present overdraft is large, it should eventually be liquidated by the sale of the turf on hands and by adjustments based on reasonable costings of production, of the present scale of charges to Fuel Importers, Limited, when the full quantity is disposed of and the financial position definitely <Col N="1360" /> ascertained.  In Kerry, as elsewhere, the Government guarantee already given in regard to loss on turf produced by county councils for export to non-turf areas is a continued one, the only condition being that reasonable precautions have been taken by county councils in the production of such turf. The disposal of the turf will be speeded up within the next two months.</P>

      <P>In reference to the Minister's answer to paragraph (b) of the question, will he say what steps were taken by the turf control body here to secure that the liquidation which the Parliamentary Secretary mentioned on the 9th December did take place?

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture if he is aware that there has been for some time a serious shortage of fresh milk in Dublin and that the greatest shortage was experienced in regard to loose milk which is purchased by the poor; whether the supply is now back to normal or, if not, when there is likely to be a normal supply; whether he will state if the Dublin District Milk Board is responsible for the supply and distribution of milk in the city and, if not, who is responsible; and whether he will take steps, in the event of continued or future shortage, to ensure that the milk available is distributed equitably.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Agriculture (1) whether the Dublin milk supply is now back to normal; (2) what steps, if any, were taken to meet the recent shortage in Dublin and what was the responsibility of the Dublin District Milk Board; (3) if he is aware that distribution was unequal, that loose milk was in many cases cut by half, and that the poor were most seriously affected; and (4) if he will give an assurance that in the event of a similar shortage all sections of the community will receive equitable treatment.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will take Question No. 37 and No. 38 together.</P>
      <P>I am aware that there was a shortage of milk in Dublin recently but am advised that the supply is now normal.</P>
      <P>The Dublin District Milk Board is not responsible for the distribution of milk in Dublin but, during the recent shortage, the board purchased and brought to Dublin all additional milk which could be obtained from creameries which normally do not send milk to Dublin.  Milk was distributed by the board through the ordinary channels, preference in supply being given to special requirements, such as the Dublin Corporation School Meals Scheme, food allowances and similar schemes and public institutions.  As far as the supply permitted, special consideration was also given to the needs of retail milk shops which serve the poorer districts of the city.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not accept the contention that the poor were most seriously affected, seeing that the basis of distribution of the available additional supplies was to divert them, in the main, to the most pressing needs of the community. Should a shortage take place next winter, no doubt similar measures can be taken to bring to the city all possible <Col N="1371" /> supplies which can be obtained from creameries and other sources.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Education (Mr. Derrig)</NameTxt>
      <P>Questions Nos. 40 and 41 deal with the same matter and I propose to take them together.</P>
      <P>(a) Vocational education committees are permitted, under the provisions of the Department's Memorandum, V. 7, to pay whole-time teachers in their employment such cost-of-living bonus on the Civil Service scale as may be approved from time to time by the Minister for Finance.  (b) Under the terms of Section (2) (1) of the Local Authorities (Cost of Living) Act, 1940, this bonus could not be calculated at a figure greater than the figure at which it was calculated immediately prior to that date.  This limitation was similar to that made in the cost-of-living bonus paid to civil servants under the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) Regulations, 1940.  (c) Certain additions were made to the bonus of some civil servants in June, 1942, under the Civil Service (Stabilisation of Bonus) (Amendment) Regulations, 1942; and again in January, 1943, under the Civil Service (Emergency Bonus) Regulations, 1943.  (d) The former regulations, which amended the cost-of-living bonus paid to certain classes of civil servants in the period June to December, 1942, could not be applied to officers of vocational education committees, owing to the provisions of the Local Authorities (Cost of Living) Act of 1940. Authority has, however, been issued to vocational education committees to pay an emergency bonus to whole-time teachers in their employment of the same amount as the emergency bonus paid to civil servants under the 1943 regulations.  This bonus may be paid retrospectively to the date (1st January, 1943), on which it became payable to civil servants.</P>

The people are beginning to discuss this matter openly, where formerly they were afraid to mention it through fear that they might be charged with being pro-British.  In view of these facts, I ask him what steps he has ever taken to ascertain the reactions to teaching through the medium of Irish and the result in the <Col N="1375" /> homes of the poorer children; and, if he has not taken any positive steps, will he do so and also ascertain the public opinion in the matter, irrespective of teachers, members of the Dáil or of the Gaelic League?</P>

The pension awarded in the case is in accordance with the degree of the applicant's disablement as assessed by the Army Pensions Board, but under the terms of Section 13 of the Army Pensions Act, 1923, no payment has yet been made with regard to an award of £300 made to him in the High Court when he instituted proceedings against the person alleged to have been responsible for the accident.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the Second Reading debate on this Bill a number of Deputies put certain queries to me which I promised to look into and give an authoritative answer to each.  The first of these queries was put by Deputy Brennan who asked how would the Bill operate in the case of a house in respect of which remission had already been granted.  That question arose because of the retrospective effect of Section 2 of the Bill.  Now, though sub-section (2) of Section 2 is retrospective in terms, it nevertheless expressly preserves in its latter portion the benefit obtained by a person under the Principal Act in respect of a house which would be excluded <Col N="1388" /> from such benefit by the new definition of residence.  The person; therefore, who has got a benefit under the Principal Act will still retain it and continue to get a remission until the period of remission expires.  I should like, therefore, to emphasise that the amendment contained in paragraph (b), sub-section (1) of Section 2 is merely a drafting amendment and that sub-section (2) is inserted lest it might possibly affect anybody who had already got a remission, although the remission was not intended for him.  I may say that we are not aware that there is a single case of this kind, but I should like to assure Deputy Brennan again that, so far as anything which has happened prior to the introduction of the Bill is concerned, it will not be affected by the passing of the Bill.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon asked whether a man who built a house in 1938, and got a grant under the Housing Acts would be entitled to enjoy ten years' remission on the new house until 1948.  The remission under the Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 1932 is two-thirds of the rates for seven years.  This is the remission that would apply and such remission is not affected by this Bill.  The purpose of the definition is to ensure, however, that a person who has already got the seven years' remission will not get remission for five years under this Bill. Henceforward, he can benefit only under one Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also asked whether a man who built a new house in 1943, and got a grant under the Housing Acts, would not get the usual abatement of rates for ten years.  I think the doubt in the Deputy's mind in regard to that matter arises from the fact that he has not quite grasped the purpose of the Principal Act the life of which this Bill will extend.  The purpose of that Act was to provide for remissions of rates for residences that could not otherwise have got them.  If they have got them or can get them under other Acts this Bill will not deprive them of what they have already got or are entitled to get.  A man who builds a new house in 1943, therefore cannot get a grant unless it were in a rural area and in that case the period of the <Col N="1389" /> remission of the rates will be seven years, not ten.  Residences built in urban areas in 1943 and residences in rural areas which are not entitled to housing grants can get remission under the Principal Act, as extended by this Bill, that is to say, they can get remission of two-thirds of the rates for a period of five years.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon also raised a point with regard to the rating of rooms added to a cottage.  Grants are made in respect of such additions under the Housing Act of 1932 where such an addition would be regarded as a reconstruction. The same Act provides that the increase in the valuation by reason of such addition shall not come into force for seven years.  Accordingly, that means that there is a complete remission in such a case for seven years in respect of the additional valuation.  I should like to make it clear that that provision still stands and is not affected by this Bill.</P>
    <P>The last point to which I wish to refer is a point that was made by Deputy Corish, who raised the question of remission of rates on houses purchased from local authorities under a system of weekly payments.  I should like to point out that such houses were sold by the local authorities at less than cost price and our view is that the local authorities should not be asked to give further assistance in these cases.  I should like to point out that the basic principle of this Bill is to ensure that only one concession will be granted in respect of any particular hereditament.  An example of the case we have in mind is given, say, in the annual report of the Department where, among other things, it is pointed out that in Wexford two houses were sold for £360 each on the deferred payments system, that is to say, one with £100 deposit and a weekly charge of 11/- per week for 20 years or £160 deposit and a weekly charge for the same period of 8/4.  The second house was sold with a deposit of £20 and a weekly charge of 12/- for 40 years.  Both these houses were sold at the basic price of £360. In fact, the all-in cost of these houses was £440 15s. Od. each.  That is to say that houses which cost the Wexford <Col N="1390" /> municipality £440 have already been sold at £80 under cost and, therefore, I do not think there would be any justification for extending a further concession to them at the cost of the municipality.</P>
    <P>These five points are the only points which were raised on the Second Stage of the Bill and I promised to deal with them on the Committee Stage.</P>

      <P>I have provided in the Bill that a holding which is outside an urban area and is not more than one acre in extent would have the benefits of the 1931 Act.  On thinking over the matter, I thought I would not be justified in confining it to one acre.  A person could have two acres, held separately, and would still have the benefits.  I propose now, instead of having a limit of one acre or any area limit, to provide that the lease must be for not less than 20 years so that it would not be a question of an ordinary agricultural letting and, if that is the case, if the land is built on and the lease is for 20 years or more, the benefits of Section 46 of the 1931 Act would be extended to such a lease.  I think that is more satisfactory than limiting it to one acre.</P>

      <P>I move amendment No. 2:&mdash;</P>
      <P>In sub-section (1), before paragraph (b), to insert a new paragraph as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(b) by the deletion in paragraph (b) of the said sub-section of the words &ldquo;the portion of such land not covered by such buildings&rdquo;, and the substitution in lieu thereof of the words &ldquo;either the whole of such land not covered by such buildings, or any separable and definable portion of such land not so covered&rdquo;.</P>
      <P>This amendment and another amendment in my name were designed to cover a type of case where an individual acquired a property under an unexpired lease and proceeded to build thereon.  I have a case in mind of a property in an urban area containing 24 acres and a very substantial residence. A number of houses were built on the land at a cost of some £12,000. The lease is about to expire and the tenant has applied to the landlord for a reversionary lease.  The landlord has refused to grant him a reversionary lease.  It would appear to me to be highly improper and unfair on the part of this landlord, who had no interest whatever in the development of the property in this particular town.  In fact, it appears that he had no intention of building or developing the property.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Here is an enterprising man who, some years ago, expended £12,000 and that particular portion of the property is worth in the neighbourhood of £20,000 now.  If he is not able to secure a reversionary lease, it means that he will have to surrender that valuable property to an individual who has no interest whatsoever in the town.  That is because all the property is not fully developed and, according to the original Act, that portion of the land is not subsidiary and ancillary to the portion which has been developed.  The Minister is conversant <Col N="1392" /> with the case, and so far as I can see, I think he has covered it fully. I should like, however, to have the Minister's assurance that he is satisfied that that case is covered.  If so I shall withdraw my amendment in favour of the Minister's.</P>

      <P>Before sub-section (2), to insert a new sub-section as follows:&mdash;</P>
      <P>(2) Where a lease (in this Act referred to as a partly-built lease) which expires after the passing of this Act would, at its expiration, be a building lease as defined in sub-section (1) (as amended by the foregoing sub-section of this section) of Section 46 of the Principal Act but for either or both of the following facts, that is to say, that, though there are (in either case), at such expiration, permanent buildings on the land demised by such lease, the portion of that land which is not covered by such buildings is not wholly subsidiary and ancillary to such buildings or some (but not all) of such buildings were neither erected by the lessee under the partly-built lease nor erected in pursuance of an agreement for the grant of that lease on their erection, the following provisions shall apply and have effect by way of amendment of the said Section 46, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>(a)  the partly-built lease shall, for the purposes of Part V of the Principal Act, be deemed to be <Col N="1393" /> at its expiration and to have been since the passing of this Act or for the seven years next preceding such expiration (whichever period is the shorter) two separate leases whereof one lease (in this Act referred to as the built-on lease) comprises that portion of the land demised by the partly-built lease which is covered with permanent buildings, either erected by the person entitled at their erection to the lessee's interest under the partly-built lease or erected in pursuance of an agreement for the grant of that lease on their erection, together with so much of the said land as is subsidiary and ancillary to those buildings and the other lease (in this Act referred to as the vacant lease) comprises the residue of the said land, whether there are or are not permanent buildings on that residue;</P>
    <P>(b)  for the purposes of such division of the partly-built lease, the rent thereby reserved shall be deemed to be apportioned between the built-on lease and the vacant lease rateably in proportion to the area of the land comprised in those leases respectively and the covenants on the lessee's part and the conditions contained in the partly-built lease shall be deemed to be apportioned likewise so as to relate separately to the land comprised in the built-on lease and to the land comprised in the vacant lease;</P>
    <P>(c)  the built-on lease shall be deemed to be, at the expiration of the partly-built lease and to have been since the said division of that lease, a building lease as defined in sub-section (1) of Section 46 of the Principal Act as amended by this Act, and Part V of that Act shall apply and have effect in relation thereto accordingly;</P>
    <P>(d)  a sublease of part of the land comprised in the built-on lease, which would, at the expiration thereof, be a proprietary lease as defined in sub-section (2) of Section 46 of the Principal Act if the partly-built lease were a building lease as defined in sub-section (1) <Col N="1394" /> of that section as amended by this Act, shall be deemed to be at the said expiration and to have been from the passing of this Act or the commencement of the term demised by such sublease (whichever is the later) a proprietary lease as so defined as aforesaid, and Part V of the Principal Act shall apply and have effect in relation thereto accordingly, and for that purpose the built-on lease shall be deemed to be the building lease of which the said sublease is a sublease.</P>
    <P>This amendment provides for a case such as was mentioned by Deputy Hughes in which a plot of land was only partly developed.  As the Act stands at present, unless all the land is ancillary to the buildings that are erected, those holding under the building lease or sub-leases thereunder do not get the protection of the 1931 Act.  I agree with Deputy Hughes that that was not the intention of the Oireachtas at the time the Act was passed.  I think it would be most unjust that, because a man proposed to build six houses on certain land and succeeded in building only three, he or those to whom the houses were sublet should be deprived of their rights.  We are providing for that by dividing that particular lease into two leases.  A new term has been coined by the Parliamentary draftsman and he calls one portion of the lease the &ldquo;built-on&rdquo; lease.  That will apply to the part of the land which had been developed. Take the case of a man who proposed to build six houses but who built only three.  To each of these houses there was a certain amount of land ancillary. A road was driven right through the estate, but the other portion on which no houses were built was undeveloped and might have been used as a market garden.  There might have been a house on it before the lease was granted.  Under the amendment it is proposed to treat the part that has been developed as the subject of a &ldquo;built-on&rdquo; lease and give to it all the privileges of a building lease.  The landlord and the tenant can make whatever arrangements they wish as regards the vacant land.  I think this amendment covers the point more fully <Col N="1395" /> than Deputy Hughes' amendment because it provides for the house on the land which his amendment would not.</P>

    <P>(ii)  such sublease would at its expiration (if this Act had then been in force) have been a proprietary lease as defined in sub-section (2) of Section 46 of the Principal Act, and</P>
    <P>(iii)  the granting (under Part V of the Principal Act) to such sublessee of a reversionary lease of the land of which he is so in possession would not prejudice or affect any right acquired before the 1st day of March, 1943, by any person other than such sublessee and the person liable to grant such reversionary lease,</P>
    <P>then and in such case such sublessee shall, during six months after the passing of this Act, have the same rights in relation to obtaining (under the said Part V) a reversionary lease of the said land of which he is so in possession as he would have had during the seven <Col N="1399" /> years next before the expiration of such sublease if this Act had then been in force;</P>
    <P>(d)  in a case to which any of the foregoing paragraphs of this sub-section applies, the fact that the lessee or sublessee to whom that paragraph applies has taken or agreed to take from his landlord or a superior landlord a lease or other letting (other than a reversionary lease the terms of which are not less favourable to such lessee or sublessee (as the case may be), than the terms which might have been fixed by the court under sub-section (1) of Section 48 of the Principal Act) of the land of which he is in such possession as is mentioned in that paragraph shall not prevent or prejudice the obtaining by such lessee or sublessee (as the case may be) by virtue of the said paragraph of a reversionary lease of the said land under Part V of the Principal Act, and, on such lessee or sublessee so obtaining such reversionary lease, the said lease or letting or the agreement therefor (as the case may be) so taken or made by him from or with his landlord or superior landlord shall become null and void, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done in pursuance of a covenant or condition contained in such lease, letting or agreement.</P>
    <P>(2)  Where a lease (in this sub-section referred to as the terminated lease) was, after the passing of the Principal Act and before the passing of this Act, terminated (before the expiration thereof by effluxion of time) by ejectment for non-payment of rent, breach of covenant, or otherwise, or by the exercise by the lessor of a power of re-entry for breach of a covenant or a condition contained in the terminated lease, and the terminated lease was not, at the date of its termination, a building lease as defined in sub-section (1) of Section 46 of the Principal Act but would, if this Act had been in force on that date, have been either a building lease as defined in the said <Col N="1400" /> sub-section (1) as amended by this Act or a partly-built lease within the meaning of the next preceding section, the following provisions shall apply, and have effect, that is to say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>(a)  a person who was, at the termination of the terminated lease, in possession of the land or any part of the land comprised in the terminated lease and was so in possession thereof under a sublease (whether mediate or immediate) under the terminated lease which would have been a proprietary lease (as defined in sub-section (2) of Section 46 of the Principal Act) if this Act had then been in force, shall, if he is in possession of the said land or the said part thereof (as the case may be) at the passing of this Act, be deemed to be and always to have been in such possession under a proprietary lease and shall have and be deemed always to have had, in relation to the said land or the said part thereof (as the case may be), all the rights, privileges, and protections conferred on lessees under proprietary leases by Part V of the Principal Act;</P>
    <P>(b)  where a person to whom the foregoing paragraph of this section applies has, subsequent to the termination of the terminated lease, taken or agreed to take a lease or other letting of the land of which he is so in possession as is mentioned in that paragraph from the landlord who terminated the terminated lease, such lease or letting or the agreement therefor (as the case may be) shall, on the passing of this Act, become null and void, but without prejudice to the validity of anything previously done in pursuance of a covenant contained in such lease, letting, or agreement.</P>
    <P>This is to provide for a case mentioned by Deputy Mulcahy on an earlier stage when he suggested that a sublessee, whose lease expired since 1931 but who is still in possession, should have the benefit of the 1931 Act so long as no third party has acquired <Col N="1401" /> some rights in the meantime.  This is a very long section, and it was very difficult to frame it, but I think every point is covered in it.  It also covers the case where a new lease may have been agreed to on the understanding that the parties could not get the benefits of the 1931 Act.  Provided that no third party is interested, that lease, if its terms are less favourable than those which could have been got under the 1931 Act, is being voided, as it was intended that such cases should come under the 1931 Act.</P>

If, because of a flaw in the Act, this man had to make another agreement with the same person, I do not think that there would be anything unfair or unjust in this provision. If a third party had come in in the meantime, it would be different.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Industry and Commerce (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be read a Second Time.  As the Long Title of the Bill indicates, it is a measure to restrict the taking or continuing of legal proceedings in respect of damage caused by accidental fire. As a consequence of a fire which occurred at the Athlone Woollen Mills in November, 1940, an action for damages was taken against the Athlone Woollen Mills Co., Ltd., in respect of the destruction of certain adjacent premises which were used as a private school.  The Supreme Court, on appeal, recently decided in favour of the claimants on the ground that, as the mill premises were not a house within the meaning of an Act of the Irish Parliament, of 1715, the company was not protected against claims for damages caused by a fire accidentally originating in its premises and spreading to other property.  Prior to that decision of the Supreme Court, the law on the matter was not generally appreciated and there had been a common assumption that the law afforded full protection against claims for damages in such cases.  It now appears that the Irish Act of 1715 affords protection only where an accidental fire originates in a house, chamber or outhouse and spreads therefrom to other premises or property. <Col N="1404" /> If the fire originates, not in a house, chamber or outhouse, but in a factory or mill, then persons suffering damage by reason of the spreading of that fire are entitled to make a claim, since the Supreme Court decided that the word &ldquo;house&rdquo; had not a wider significance than a dwelling-house or place of habitation.</P>
      <P>In the course of the judgment, one of the judges, referring to the English statute of 1774, which enacted that no action should be maintained against any person in whose house, chamber, stable, barn or other building or on whose estate a fire should accidentally begin, suggested that the time had arrived when a similarly wide provision should be enacted in this country. Following the decision of the Supreme Court, various representative bodies, such as the Federation of Irish Manufacturers, the Associated Chambers of Commerce, the Drapers' Chamber of Trade, as well as other interests, made representations in the matter.  They pointed out that the decision would have the effect of placing upon the owners of industrial and business premises an increased and indeterminate liability for loss or damage arising from spreading fires.  Insurers have no rate for that risk and have all along paid claims in respect of loss or damage caused by fire spreading from other premises in the same way as if the damage were caused by the fire originating in the premises themselves. In other words, they have acted as if the law in this matter were the same here as it is in England. Now that the Supreme Court has given its decision on the legal position, it would, it appears, be open to an uninsured or under-insured property owner, or to an insurance company or another insurer, to seek indemnity from the owner of the building in which the fire originated.  In these circumstances, the various bodies to which I have referred have urged the necessity for legislation.  The Government have considered these representations and are satisfied that there is good cause for such legislation and this Bill has been drafted to meet the position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As Deputies will see, the Bill is a <Col N="1405" /> very short one.  It provides that where any person has suffered damage by reason of fire accidentally occurring in or on the building or land of another person, no legal proceedings shall, after the passing of the Bill, be instituted by or through the injured person on account of such damage.  It further provides that in the case of any legal proceedings instituted after 16th November, 1942, which was the date of the decision of the Supreme Court, and pending at the passing of the Bill, such proceedings shall be discharged and made void subject to such order as to costs as the court or a judge of the court may think fit to make.  As a corollary to these provisions, the Bill proposes to repeal the pre-Union Irish Statute of 1715.</P>
    <P>Deputies will observe also that the Bill is so framed as not to deprive the plaintiffs in the Athlone case of the benefit of the judgment in their favour.  In the case of any other proceedings instituted after the date of the Athlone judgment and pending at the time of the enactment of this Bill, however, the recovery of damages will be precluded, it being left to the court to make any appropriate order as to costs.  I do not anticipate that there will be any opposition to the measure, which simply proposes to make it clear that the legal position will henceforth be what, until the recent Supreme Court decision, it was always commonly assumed to be.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not merely what the law is, but also what the practice has been.  Up to the present, if a fire <Col N="1406" /> spreads from one building to another, the insurer paid upon the second premises as if the fire had originated there.  If the premises were insured against fire from any cause, payment was made on that basis.</P>

    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>If that is so, will the Minister tell the House what the object of the Bill is?  Were they not hitherto liable to pay in the same way as they will be liable after the passing of this Bill, and, if they were liable to pay under the insurance contract in respect of damage caused by a fire originating in adjoining premises, the owner of the premises accidentally burned could not get money from the insurance company and then sue the owner of the premises in which the fire originated?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy will appreciate that if an insurance company has paid and then finds that, under the law, it can get indemnity by proceeding against the owner of the premises in which the fire originated, it will possibly do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="DanielMcMenamin" hpid="Mr. McMenamin Mr. McMenamin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>How can it?  The owner of the premises in which the fire breaks out is not a party to the contract of insurance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; but, under the Supreme Court decision, he is liable for the damage.  The law in England&mdash; and the law here was always assumed to be the same as the law in England&mdash; was designed to prevent action for damages being taken against the owner of a premises in which a fire occurred by reason of the spreading of that fire to other premises.  The position, however, was that, while the wording of the English Act was apparently wide enough to secure that result, the wording of the Irish Act has been interpreted by the Supreme Court to confine the protection to the owner of a dwelling-house and not to cover the owner of a factory or business <Col N="1407" /> premises.  We are proposing to change the wording in order to make sure that the protection covers, as well, the owner of a factory or business premises.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  Sixteen years ago, almost to the exact date, a Bill was brought in here to deal with the reorganisation of the creamery industry. The position then was that there was intense competition between the proprietary and the co-operative creameries and the result of that competition was that, in many cases, the prices paid were so high that it led to insolvency.  It meant that a number of the co-operative creameries went down, or were on the way to going down.  The scheme that was then introduced had for its object the taking over of a number of these people, and that scheme has been continued up to the present time.  In the beginning, it meant the taking over of the proprietary concerns, and the intention was to take them over by a holding body, which has since become known as the Dairy Disposals Board.  As time went on, however, the Dairy Disposals Board was forced into the position of taking over also certain co-operative societies <Col N="1408" /> that had been doing badly, reorganising the particular district concerned and, in some cases, doing away with these societies altogether.</P>
      <P>Then as time went on further, the Dairy Disposals Board went into the business of developing new districts, and they have done quite well in most cases.  They have done very well in such counties as Clare, Kerry, and the western portion of Cork.  I think that the success of these co-operative creameries must be apparent to everybody, to the extent, at least, that practically all the co-operative creameries in the country are in a good position financially.  So far as I can see, there are very few such creameries that are in a bad financial position.</P>
      <P>Now, that reorganisation was very well timed, because, two or three years afterwards&mdash;in or about 1930&mdash;the big decline began, and that lasted until the beginning of the present war, in 1939, and if, by any chance, the old position had remained in which the proprietary people and the co-operative creameries were competing against one another, and paying more than an economic price, the result undoubtedly would have been that many of these societies would have to close down. Much of this work has been done by voluntary effort, but, as a result of arrangements made by the Dairy Disposals Board, about 182 private concerns have been taken over by the board during the last 16 years.  I might mention that about 114 of these premises were owned by one firm or individual.  It is felt that the first stage of this reorganisation must be completed some time, and I feel that it should be done now.  After all, there is always the danger of a &ldquo;milk war&rdquo; such as we had in 1937, and such as, in fact, we had two or three years ago in West Cork, between the proprietary owners and the co-operatives. It is not my intention now to say whose was the fault there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>Could the Minister say whose fault it was?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not in a position to say that, but the situation is that trouble of that kind could happen <Col N="1409" /> again.  I understand that there is a feeling in West Cork, amongst the farmers there, that they should have co-operative creameries, but there is a fear there, in the case of the co-operative creameries, that another &ldquo;milk war&rdquo; might start, and they are not prepared to risk the necessary capital expenditure.  Again, there are certain co-operative creameries in West Cork which can hardly be said to be in an economic position at the moment, but which could be made economic, and, therefore, it is necessary to take over the proprietary interests in order to make the others economic.</P>
      <P>We are not doing anything original in this legislation, because in most countries, particularly when it comes to a matter of dealing with co-operative enterprise in agriculture, the general principle that is followed is that where a big majority of the people go in for such activities, then the minority is compelled to go along with the majority.  In this particular case here, we are dealing with a very small minority.  In other words, I should say that the amount of milk left, as compared with the amount going to the creameries in general, would be only about 3 per cent. or 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>How does the Minister determine that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>What I am saying is that the percentage of milk, apart from the amount going to the creameries, would be very small.  This Bill confers powers on me, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to compel the proprietors of milk concerns to sell to the Dairy Disposals Board.  Now, there are two ways in which that can be done.  In the first place, there is the question of the acquisition of the premises, or the sale of superior interests in the acquired leasehold premises, and then there is the question of an appeal to an arbitrator, and then the business will be sold at the price fixed by the arbitrator.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The next point that will occur to any Deputy is:  what will the Dairy Disposals Board do with those concerns when they take them over?  As <Col N="1410" /> far as my information goes, most of them will be closed, because they are redundant where they stand at the moment, and the milk supply will then be sold to a co-operative concern. Some will remain open and will be transferred to a co-operative society.  In that connection, I may say that we have, for the moment, to regard any unit at present worked by the Dairy Disposals Board as a co-operative concern, the idea being that they are held in trust for a co-operative society. There will be some loss to the State&mdash; that is what is referred to in the Estimates for this purpose as a subsidy.  Take an individual unit which has a supply of, say, 1,300 or 1,400 gallons.  In that case, we have to buy the premises, the goodwill, the supply and so on.  The supply, of course, is included in the goodwill.  We only sell, perhaps, the supply to some neighbouring creamery, and the premises are left on the hands of the Dairy Disposals Board.  The Dairy Disposals Board cannot sell those premises for a creamery.  They can only sell them for another purpose, and will probably have to sell them cheaply, so there will be a difference between the price they will pay and the price for which they will sell.  We must refer to that, for the moment, as the subsidy which is necessary. Unfortunately, I cannot give any estimate as to what that subsidy is going to be, because I cannot at this stage, naturally, say what price the arbitrator is going to fix, but I do not think the amount of the subsidy will be very extraordinary as compared with previous deals of this kind.  We will again come to the question of subsidies in general paid by the Dairy Disposals Board.</P>
    <P>The next question that might be asked is:  will this finish all this undesirable competition between one unit and another?  Not in itself.  There has, of course, been very little trouble during recent years as between one co-operative and another.  There is nothing in law to stop them at the moment, but there are various ways of reasoning with them, which are effective in stopping any competition just now.  We must, however, follow <Col N="1411" /> up some time or other&mdash;as soon as possible I should say, too&mdash;with a Co-operative Bill, which has been in preparation for many years.  That will definitely stop any competition between one co-operative and another, because it will define the area of influence of the various co-operatives.</P>
    <P>The next point that might be raised is whether the Dairy Disposals Board are competent to carry out this business, competent to take over, first of all and, secondly, competent to run any of those concerns that they might hold for a period.  I might say there again there will be a necessity for legislation. The Dairy Disposals Board grew up rather a victim of circumstances. It is a very different body now from what was visualised back in 1927.  At that time, it was thought that it would only be a holding body which would hold creameries for a very short time before reorganising and handing them back to the co-operatives.  But in the light of experience it was felt that they would need to hold some of those units for long periods.  Then, of course, they had the additional duty cast upon them to develop new districts, where they will necessarily have to hold on and work those new creameries for quite a long time, so it will be necessary to regularise the Dairy Disposals Board.  There are, as a matter of fact, several entities worked by the Board at the moment. There is the Newmarket Dairy Company, which was the first big group of creameries taken over in the County Cork in 1927, and still worked as the Newmarket Dairy Company.  Then there was the Condensed Milk Company, which comprised a condensory in Limerick, a condensory in Drumkean, and two creameries, Tipperary and Knocklong.  Then there was the Toffee Factory in Limerick, which was a separate entity.  In addition the Dairy Disposals Board works those new creameries that have been organised in the new districts, so you really have four bodies operating, but all run by the same men and by the same staff.  It will be necessary to do something legally as soon as possible to get that matter right.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1412" /> At that stage it may be possible to give more details of the working of the Dairy Disposals Board than I am in a position to give now.  I will, however, try to give an idea of the finances of the Dairy Disposals Board since it commenced operations in 1927.  Those figures include the four companies I referred to, because I do not want to segregate the figures for any one of the four companies.  The total amount of capital voted by the Dáil since 1927 is £1,172,000.  There are certain items that we must deduct from that as being probably irrecoverable.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Would the Minister say whether interest has been charged on that?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will come to that point. Interest has not been paid to the State, if that is what the Deputy wants to know.  There was compensation paid to redundant staffs, which it was felt here in 1927, I believe, when the thing was going through, should be made a State charge.  The total of that to date is £53,000.  In every deal that is undertaken, the Dairy Disposals Board give an estimate to my Department. The estimate is made out as follows: &ldquo;We estimate that we can buy this concern at so-and-so.  We estimate that we can resell it to a co-operative at so-and-so.&rdquo;  The difference&mdash;a stated figure&mdash;we put down as subsidy.  The total amount of subsidy estimated on that basis since the Dairy Disposals Board started operations was £214,000, but they have utilised only £90,000 subsidy so far.  They have repaid to the State £236,000 of the capital.  Every year there is an appropriation. Deputies are familiar&mdash;we were very much more familiar with it some years ago&mdash;with the £3 per cow. That money was collected by the board and handed over to the Department of Finance as an appropriation.  That is the big item in this £236,000.  We have, therefore, the three sums there, that is, the amount paid to redundant employees, the amount utilised for subsidy&mdash;£90,000&mdash;and the amount repaid by way of capital, £236,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If we deduct these three figures from the total of £1,172,000, we have about £800,000 left.  At the moment the <Col N="1413" /> company is indebted to the State to the extent of about £800,000, with or without interest, as the case may be. I suppose, in all fairness, they should pay interest on that money, too.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister say if, in the figure of £236,000, there are included any sums realised for creameries that were disposed of to co-operative societies?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I shall take a note of that point and will deal with it later.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>On the face of it, whatever was realised for the disposal of creameries must be included in that figure.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>I will deal with that position at a later stage.  I should like to be clear in my own mind as to whether the sums realised for the sale of creameries are included in that figure. I am quite sure that not all are included, but there may be some, and I should like to be clear on that point. The valuation of all the properties held by the Dairy Disposals Board, after the usual allowances for depreciation and income-tax and the other things that we see in balance sheets, on the 31st December, 1941, was £782,000.  That is not very far from the figure I mentioned&mdash;£800,000.  The trading profit and loss has been kept in a separate account and, although there is a fairly substantial amount standing to profit at the moment, it has not been included in the assets.  The trading loss in the beginning was high. That was to be expected, because, when the Dairy Disposals Board took over a number of those units and had to work them, they were very uneconomic and it took some time to get them into an economic state.  They had a poor experience so far as ordinary trading went.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When I came into office I was asked by the Department of Finance to try to regularise the position.  I introduced an estimate in 1933 for £112,000, as against trading losses by the Dairy Disposals Board.  The trading losses went on increasing and, by the end of 1933, the amount had reached £137,000. Of course, that included the £112,000. <Col N="1414" /> Then the tide turned for the better and, in the balance sheet issued on 31st December, 1941, the loss of £137,000 had been converted into a profit of £51,000.  The years from 1933 to 1941 were extremely good.  I assume the profit is even higher now.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>In estimating the profits, how is the fact that interest has not been paid taken into account?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a point that has not been settled.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then we do not know whether there was a real profit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>If they had paid the interest every year, I take it there would be a loss.  A lot would depend on the interest charged.  I feel, with the trend of events in the Dairy Disposals Board, that they will be in a position not only to meet the entire amount of capital advanced by the State, but that they will be able to pay some interest also.  I do not know whether they will be able to pay the ordinary bank interest of 5 per cent., but they should be able to pay some interest.  There is a very big investigation going on, both by my Department and the Department of Finance, which will be able to elucidate the financial working of the Dairy Disposals Board before we have the Bill ready.  The Bill will regularise the whole position of the Dairy Disposals Board and, when it is being considered, it might be possible to give more detailed figures with regard to the working of the board.  This Bill will enable the Minister for Agriculture, in consultation with the Minister for Finance, to require any proprietor to sell his business to the Dairy Disposals Board.  The Bill, though it may be comprehensive and far-reaching, is a very simple one, and I do not think it will tax the intelligence of any Deputy fully to understand its meaning.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>I listened with interest to the Minister's description of this concern.  Possibly other Deputies will be able to say a lot on the farming side, but I will approach this matter <Col N="1415" /> from the business point of view.  I call this a concern for the want of knowing what it really should be called.  It does not seem to be a trading company, and it does not seem to be a company under the auspices of the Government; it just seems to be a Dairy Disposals Board that, as the Minister says, was established to meet a state of emergency and was not transferred when the Government found it was necessary to carry it on more or less permanently.</P>
      <P>I should like, first of all, to complain about the absence of accounts.  We never see their accounts&mdash;the Minister can correct me if I am wrong here; he has not got their accounts to the end of 1942.  I cannot conceive a commercial concern, a public company, not having its accounts prepared by the 31st December.  The floating stock of the Dairy Disposals Board could be ascertained at least in a few days.  I might suggest to the Minister that the Dairy Disposals Board is, like the Government, suffering from paralysis.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that, originally, the company was run on a capital expenditure of £1,172,000 which had been reduced to £800,000, and that it does not pay interest on that money. That is not sufficient for me.  I would like to know who is standing the loss of that £800,000?  You cannot get money for nothing.  That sum would probably earn 4 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Therefore, there must be about £32,000 a year being hidden away somewhere in the Government accounts. The Minister and the Government should be honest, and put the saddle on the right horse.  The profit and loss account and the capital expenditure account are, apparently, being kept in watertight compartments. I think I am right in saying that if a trading concern at one period had a loss of £137,000 it would have to add that to its capital.  Therefore, the loss in this case ought to have appeared as a loss of £937,000.  That loss, the Minister has told us, has very fortunately been converted into a trading profit of, I think he said, £57,000, <Col N="1416" /> which ought to be deducted from the capital account.  There ought to be only one capital account.</P>
    <P>I am not going to quarrel at this stage with the principle of acquiring creameries.  It is elementary that, when the Minister does so, he has to sell the premises at a loss.  He may get something for the goodwill.  Will he tell me what this £800,000 is estimated to produce?  Is the plain naked fact this: that that figure is hiding an enormous loss, and that one of these days we will wake up and be told that the Dairy Disposals Board has been wound up&mdash;its losses running to about £500,000?  I suggest to the Minister that he ought to be honest with himself and with the House.  There is no use in making two bites at a cherry.  A concern such as this ought to publish a balance sheet to be presented to this House.  If we have only a limited control of the finances of it, if there are some of its finances that we control and others that we do not, then I want to suggest, in regard to that portion of its finances that we do not control, that our proceedings here are a farce.  Again, I ask why does the Minister want to make two bites at a cherry.  We had an expression of opinion to the effect that there were certain details in connection with this business that could not be revealed. I say that is nonsense.  If an accountant, an auctioneer or somebody skilled in the valuation of property and assets makes a valuation, the Minister ought to be able to present it to the House, so that we may know what the exact position is, just in the same way as a trading concern has to publish its accounts, whether it makes a profit or a loss.  Imagine any trading concern taking up the attitude that because it had a bad year it was not going to publish its accounts fearing that if it did so the report would have a deplorable effect on the shareholders of the concern and on the investing public.  No trading concern would do that.  Why should the Government be immune from criticism for keeping their accounts in a more sloppy fashion than a trading concern would be allowed to do?</P>
    <P>Section 5 makes provision for &ldquo;deductions <Col N="1417" /> in respect of State debts from price payable under sale orders or sale (superior interest) orders&rdquo;.  Is the broad effect of that this: that the Dairy Disposals Board is going to rank as a preferential creditor just as if it had a mortgage, and that ordinary creditors will have to take their place behind the board?  I hope the Minister will deal with that point when replying, because it is a thing that I strongly object to.  Here is a concern, under the auspices of the Government, which publishes no balance sheet, and it is put in the position of having a mortgage on the assets of a company once it says that it is going to take it over.  There is one last point that I want to put to the Minister.  It is only rumour&mdash;I cannot say that I know of this of my own knowledge&mdash;that some farmers are more anxious to take over some of these concerns as co-operative creameries than the Dairy Disposals Board is to get rid of them.  If that is so, it explains why this concern has gone on so long and why it will continue to go on much longer.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ProfJohnMarcusOSulli" hpid="Professor O'Sullivan Professor O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Instead of discussing this particular Bill in a positive way, my purpose in rising is to put a number of questions to the Minister. First of all, I should like to take this opportunity of paying tribute to the very useful work done, in many instances, by the Dairy Disposals Board, especially in the matter of the opening up of new districts.  I do not think there will be anything but a generous recognition of the work that has been done in that particular respect.</P>
      <P>On the financial matters raised by Deputy Dockrell, giving my own personal view, I think it was necessary that the State should have shouldered a loss at the time when this particular policy was inaugurated, and for a number of years afterwards and, perhaps, it is unavoidable even at the present moment.  However, I agree with Deputy Dockrell that, if it does shoulder a loss, there should be no doubt and no ambiguity as to what the loss is.  Therein I agree with some of the criticisms that Deputy Dockrell has levelled, in regard to the general failure to give information in this particular respect.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1418" /> Even after the Minister's speech and the replies he gave to one or two interruptions by way of questions put to him during it, no one can say whether at the present moment this company is making a profit or being run at a loss&mdash;that is, if you take into account what any other company in the country or any individual who runs a business would have to take into account, namely, the interest charge on the money.</P>
    <P>I understand that it is exceedingly difficult to get anything like a detailed statement&mdash;various bodies have tried to get one&mdash;of the finances of this particular body.  If to keep dairying alive, it is necessary that the State should suffer a loss, I have no objection, but the public should be told what the loss is.  As the Minister pointed out, it was inevitable, when this policy was being inaugurated and introduced into the country, that a loss should be incurred. It may still be necessary, and more than once recently I have said that if, to help the dairying industry and keep it alive, it is necessary that a State subsidy should be given, then it should be given.  But the Minister should agree that it is not unreasonable to ask for a clear statement as to what those subsidies are.  For instance, I gather that at the present time it is impossible to make any definite statement about the financial position as a whole&mdash;which should be a simple thing to do&mdash;or about any particular concern.</P>
    <P>In this particular Bill, the company is entitled to look into the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, the trading accounts and the capital&mdash; practically everything&mdash;concerning an undertaking that it intends to take over, but there is no suggestion that any information can be vouchsafed of the trading business of the company itself that is taking over.  It is exempt from any such inquiry and practically no information will be given.  That leaves the people unable to judge whether this company is being well run or not well run.  The company has recently done a lot of good work in opening new districts.  That will cost money to the State.  It is quite right not to hesitate in developing these new <Col N="1419" /> districts, but there should be an effort to show what precisely the cost is.</P>
    <P>There is one thing on which I would like the Minister to enlighten the House.  He intends to use compulsory powers in order to enter into possession of and make the property of the Dairy Disposals Company, a certain number of existing private institutions. He has given the reason for that.  On the whole, they are very few now and the purpose is a twofold one.  To prevent a possible uneconomic &ldquo;milk war&rdquo; in a certain district is the more immediate purpose.  I gather that the formal view of the Dairy Disposals Board is to regard itself as trustee of that property, with the other property it possesses at the moment, to regard itself as a trustee for the farmers.  I take it for granted, therefore, that it is still the declared policy of the company to transfer these creameries to co-operative societies; but the Minister need not be surprised if people are a little doubtful as to whether, in our lifetime, that policy is likely to become operative.  A good number of creameries were transferred at one time but, in reply to a question by my colleague, Deputy Hughes, in June, 1942, the Minister said that, apart from small individual units sold to existing societies, no transfers have been made in recent years.  At that time there was under consideration one large concern, but it is quite obvious that what was always looked upon as one of the primary purposes and one of the aims of this whole experiment has been slowed up.  The Minister must know that there are some societies willing to take over and they get very little encouragement.  There may be one or even two cases in recent times to point a little in the opposite direction.  In fact, new conditions that were not thought of at the beginning are now demanded.  Perhaps the Minister would tell us precisely the relationship between himself and the Dairy Disposals Board.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Then it is amazing that, even in the smallest details, the Dairy Disposals Board manages to anticipate the desires of the Minister, or what might be the desires of the Minister.  They know not only how the cat is going to jump but very often how it is going to jump before the cat itself knows it.  They are intelligent in that particular way. To call this company a Dairy Disposals Board would be a misnomer as, for a number of years past, it has been a Dairy Acquisition Board, having shown a pronounced tendency to acquire rather than to dispose.  It is quite obvious, from the Minister's answer last June, that whether it is his deliberate policy or not the reluctance to part with any of the property has grown with the improving years.  I am not asking what the theory is, as I know the theory is still: &ldquo;We are anxious to dispose of these creameries to the farmers.&rdquo; But I assert that the practice is something very different.</P>
      <P>Though I have, and always have had, a great deal of admiration for the Civil Service in its own particular sphere, I confess that I do not like the continual and inevitable grasping habit. I am not blaming the individuals: it is inherent in the institution and that is why I am referring to it.  The individuals carry out their work well.  I am speaking of the Civil Service as a whole, as an institution: there is a tendency to grasp more power and, in this case, it means to grasp more business and, having got it, not to let it go.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not want the Minister to come along afterwards when replying and say: &ldquo;No, we stand for the principle of handing over to co-operative bodies&rdquo;. Is the time ever to come when they are going to hand them over?  That is the real position.  I do not think the Minister will be able to give a clear answer there.  If he does, I doubt if it will be worth very much notice, as he has no idea when they will be handed over.  You have all sorts of <Col N="1421" /> new obstacles thrown up to prevent the handing over to the farmers.  There is a demand, now, for a kind of plebiscite of milk suppliers.  I have no interest in any proprietary concern. There is to be no plebiscite when the Dairy Disposals Board determines to step in and take a piece of private property.  The milk suppliers there are not to be asked for their views.  There is also to be full power on the part of that company to get full details as to the financial position of any institution which it proposes to take over, but if the co-operative societies approach the company I do not think they can get information as to the financial position of institutions they are anxious to take over.  If a co-operative society is formed, and if it is ready to buy, can it examine the books of the Dairy Disposals Board as regards the position of that society?</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>But the co-operative society is very often never allowed to reach that stage.  A condition that has been laid down recently is that there is to be a kind of plebiscite as to the amount of milk supplies, but before the plebiscite is taken can a society see what the economic position of the business is?  Perhaps the Minister would explain.</P>

      <P>It goes around in a circle. The Deputy will agree that there has to be a limit.  If two or three inquisitive members of a suppliers' company say they want to see the balance sheet, naturally it will not be given unless it is thought there is something serious about it.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>

      <P>I am glad to hear that.  I can assure the Minister it is news to me.  We have it definitely now that a society registered by the I.A.O.S. can examine the books and trading accounts of a particular concern that they are anxious to take over before there is any plebiscite of the individual suppliers.  We can leave it at that.  The Dairy Disposals Board can get the last ounce of information at any time it likes if it proposes to take over a concern, but at the moment there is no reciprocity so far as the co-operative bodies are concerned, or not full reciprocity.</P>

      <NameTxt>Professor O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>Why the concealment? If a concern organised by the I.A.O.S. desires to purchase why conceal the balance sheet?  Is not that concealment a grave obstacle?  It emphasises what Deputy Dockrell said.  I can understand what a tremendous problem there is, but I should like to hear the Minister on the question of policy, which is not now clear.  I can see the ground he has given to bring to practical completion by compulsory powers what was inaugurated 16 years ago.  When we are asked to give these new powers I think this is an opportunity for the <Col N="1423" /> Minister to make a full and clear statement, not in the way of vague general principles, but of the actual practice intended to be adopted by the dairy company.  Is it really to remain for all time an acquiring and holding company? Has the co-operative element dropped out altogether?  At least let us know what the policy is.  With all respect I do not think it is possible at present to determine what the policy of the dairy company is in that matter.  From the time when the company has, apparently, turned the corner, its policy was more and more to hold on, and to become more and more chary about transferring the business and premises of creameries to co-operative bodies.  Apart from small individual units there was one big case to which the Minister referred at that time, June, 1942.  I think it has gone through since.  Has the sale gone through of the big body to which he referred in an answer given in June last?</P>

      <P>We can take it, then, that in recent years there has been no transfer.  I admit that the company is doing a good deal of work, but was it necessary to drop almost completely such an essential portion of its policy?  Is it questionable whether that should be stopped?  I am not an expert, but the Minister should at least be in a position to know what the purposes of that particular body are.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is this, and it is purely a matter of general principle rather than anything else, that you are here interfering with private property.  This is one of the first cases of the kind, apart from land, in which that has been done.  Has the Minister given any sufficient justification for this revolutionary step?  Without any explanation of why they are doing it, except the general one given by the Minister, the Dairy Disposals Board can step in and say: &ldquo;We are going to acquire your premises.&rdquo;  They can choose the time.  Naturally, if they are wise, they will wait for a lean year, as the price then might be lower.  If there is no <Col N="1424" /> agreement, the matter has to go before an arbitrator, not appointed by the President of the High Court or the Chief Justice, but practically appointed by the body that is responsible. In fact, a party to the agreement will appoint the judge.  I wonder whether that is equity.  It is merely on that general ground of equity that I call attention to that.  But my main purpose is really to find out what is the practical policy, not the theoretical aspirations, of the Minister and of the board at this particular moment.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJMurphy" hpid="Mr. Murphy Mr. Murphy">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Murphy</NameTxt>
      <P>I am opposing this Bill because I think it has been presented to the House without anything like a full disclosure of the circumstances that surround it and under an entirely inaccurate guise.  This Bill is represented as a continuation of work begun 16 years ago when a Creamery Bill was introduced by Deputy Cosgrave's Government.  That Bill was introduced under very peculiar and extraordinary circumstances.  That Bill was introduced to prevent the type of competition that prevailed then and to get rid of a very big and powerful monopoly which largely controlled the dairy industry at that time.  In that particular sense, that measure was a national one and received the support of this Party in common with other Parties in the House.  To regard this measure as a continuation of that policy seems to me as ridiculous an exaggeration as ever I heard in this House.</P>
      <P>If this measure to exterminate a number of small creameries&mdash;from 16 to 20 in all&mdash;is considered necessary, if this measure with all its drastic powers, which I hope to refer to in detail before I finish, is regarded as the weapon necessary to achieve harmony or continuity or unanimity in, or a comprehensive scheme for the whole industry, it seems to me like employing a sledge hammer to kill a fly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I object to this measure on a number of grounds.  I object to it on the ground that it is entirely bereft of any provision for compensation for the employees who will find themselves the victims of circumstances if the Bill is <Col N="1425" /> enacted.  There is provision for compensation for the owners of the concerns, but there is not a single word about the employees, many of whom have given the best years of their life to the creamery industry.  The Minister did not indicate by as much as a sentence what is to be the fate of these people when the Bill is enacted. I tried to get a census of the number of people concerned, and I believe that in the County and City of Cork the number would run into 300 or 400. Some of the people concerned have spent 40 years in employment in the creamery industry.  There is no indication that any alternative position will be found for them, or that there will be one penny compensation for them. This House is asked to pass a measure of that kind without the slightest reference to the human element and the human tragedies behind a situation of that kind.  We are asked to provide money to be handed over to a body described&mdash;and the description is a humorous one&mdash;as the Dairy Disposals Board, for the purpose of adding to their already very extensive property.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Sullivan was quite right when he said that this body should be called the Dairy Acquisition Board, because that has been the history of this body for a number of years.  They have acquired property after property and they have not the least intention of letting go.  They propose to swallow up one concern after the other, to add to their powers and to entrench more firmly the rather incompetent bureaucracy that the board really is, if the true facts were known&mdash;and, of course, there is an obvious reluctance, as there has been over a number of years, to let us know the facts in connection with the board.  Even this evening it took some effort to ascertain that, disguised behind the alleged profit made by this board, was the very striking and astonishing fact that interest had not been met for a number of years.</P>
    <P>I have here the Report of the Public Accounts Committee for the year 1940-41, and it is slightly more revealing than the Minister has been this evening as to the operations of the Dairy Disposals Board.  In page 38 of the report there is the examination of <Col N="1426" /> Mr. Twomey, the Secretary of the Department of Agriculture, in regard to the operations of the Dairy Disposals Board.  He is being questioned by the Chairman of the Committee at paragraph 375, as follows:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The last portion of paragraph 19 reads:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;Including the expenditure of £20,339 3s. 11d. in the current year, the total Vote expenditure to 31st March, 1941, from moneys provided for the improvement of the creamery industry amounts to £1,191,767 5s. 2d.  Receipts amount to £229,185 3s. 10d., leaving a net charge on public funds of £962,582 1s. 4d.&rsquo;</P>
    <P>I take it that is the ordinary annual informative paragraph about the operations.</P>
    <P>Mr. Maher: That is so, and I understand the usual return of expenditure has been furnished to the Secretary of this Committee.</P>
    <P>Chairman: We have it here.</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke: Does that mean that the dairy industry was subsidised to the extent of £962,582 1s. 4d. ?&mdash;The Dairy Disposal Company holds against that sum 17 central creameries, 106 separating stations, about 20 travelling creameries, one central condensory, and three sub-condensories.</P>
    <P>Are there any assets to meet this amount?&mdash;No, I doubt if the assets would meet the sum outstanding in full.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin: There is also the annual production?&mdash;Yes.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then at paragraph 385 the examination of Mr. Twomey goes on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Chairman: Does the Dairy Disposal Company present a regular profit and loss account?&mdash;Not in the ordinary way.  The accounts are presented, but one could not say that a profit and loss account is presented in the same sense as if it were an ordinary company.</P>
    <P>Are these accounts accessible to Deputies?&mdash;I do not think they are accessible because the Minister on <Col N="1427" /> more than one occasion has taken up the attitude that some day he will have to dispose of these properties, and in the meantime he does not wish to disclose facts regarding them which might prejudice their sale.</P>
    <P>Deputy McMenamin: But if the facts were favourable&mdash;&mdash;</P>
    <P>Deputy O'Rourke: They may not be.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I think I have quoted enough to show that the whole position of the Dairy Disposals Board, so-called, is very peculiar and extraordinary.  It is a very remarkable fact that the Minister has not indicated where the demand has come from for the measure that is before us this evening.  I contest the view expressed by the Minister that this is a continuation of the policy inaugurated by the Cosgrave Government in 1925, or whenever the measure was enacted.  The suggestion that there still exists any serious danger to the dairying industry in this country arising out of the existence of a small number of these proprietary creameries cannot be sustained if the full facts are examined.</P>
    <P>I regard the powers sought under this Bill as being very extraordinary. Members of this Party have always taken the view that, in certain circumstances, State action for the public good is necessary and desirable, but this is not State action in the sense that it is generally understood and sometimes applied.  This is asking the House to provide public money for the purpose of handing over property to a concern that is not responsible to this House, that does not produce its accounts for inspection by members of this House, that cannot be questioned by this House and in respect of which nobody responsible can be found to answer in this House.  It is asking the House to provide public money to hand over property and powers to that body in the most extraordinary way.</P>
    <P>The Act passed in the time of the Cosgrave Government was passed for the purpose of ending a most unsatisfactory position in the dairying industry. <Col N="1428" /> It was passed for the purpose of getting rid of a very undesirable monopoly.  We have not got rid of monopolies in this country and the Dairy Disposals Board is becoming very rapidly a most extensive monopoly in the country.  In my opinion, it is for the purpose of entrenching more firmly in their well-sheltered bureaucracy the civil servants who run that concern at the present time that this measure is introduced. I have yet to learn of any extensive demand for it.</P>
    <P>I am informed that the Minister's predecessor, a man who was keenly concerned in this question, who knew it in all its phases, was approached in West Cork a number of years ago and was asked to take action such as is indicated in this Bill.  He declined to do it because he said he wished that any further extensions of the kind should be arranged by agreement and, because he regarded the concerns referred to as particularly well managed, he did not wish to interfere with them unless it was possible to arrange for their acquisition by agreement at some later stage.</P>
    <P>Does the Minister suggest that all his persuasive powers have been exhausted in an effort to acquire by agreement the concerns that are the subject of this Bill?  I would like to get more information on that point.  I would like to hear, further, how it is proposed to defend the appointment by the Minister of an arbitrator to sit in judgment on this matter, against whose decision there is no right of appeal.  I think that represents a most astonishing and amazing claim by the Minister, a claim that members of this House&mdash;I do not care what their views are on other questions&mdash;ought to be very concerned about, and which they should keenly resist.  If this measure is to be enacted, and knowing the constitution of this House at the moment there seems to be no doubt about that, I suggest that at least provision should be made for an appeal in this matter of compensation and that that appeal should be to somebody who, by training and profession, is competent to weigh up matters of this kind.  I suggest there should be <Col N="1429" /> in this measure, or there should be inserted in it if it receives a Second Reading and reaches the Committee Stage, provision for appeal to a Circuit Court judge for the purpose of satisfying the public generally and everybody concerned that this matter of compensation has been fairly and adequately dealt with.  There should, at the same time, be provision for the employees concerned in the matter of compensation.</P>
    <P>The powers sought under the Bill are very extraordinary indeed.  Section 9 of the Bill provides that the Minister for Agriculture may make an Order requiring the proprietor of any creamery premises to sell to the company at a price to be determined under the section his estate and interest in the said creamery premises, together with all chattels on the premises and all rights attaching thereto.  So that the Minister was quite right in his concluding statement in saying, in a few words, that this Bill represented certain things.  The Minister's few words and the stroke of the pen are all that is required to create an entirely new and revolutionary position in this whole matter.  I would direct the attention of the House to the particular manner in which this Bill will be put into operation.  The Dairy Disposals Company having indicated their wishes to the Minister, the Bill will be put in motion by their applying for this sale order to which I have already referred.</P>
    <P>The Minister will direct that copies of the order be served on owners of creameries, and as from the date on which the copy of the order is served on the owner of a creamery, the owner and the Dairy Disposals Board shall be deemed to have entered into an agreement for the sale of the creamery. Another portion of the Bill refers to the obligation on the proprietors of existing creameries the subject of this Bill, to make certain returns to the Minister, including an abstract of title, an inventory of chattels and a statement whether any chattels are held by him under a hire-purchase agreement.  I understand that as far back as 1931 these returns were obtained by the Dairy Disposals Board <Col N="1430" /> from one particular section of the creameries.  There is provision here for payment of the expenses incurred in the making of that return, but I understand that not one penny payment has yet been made in respect of the earlier return to which I referred.</P>
    <P>I am not anxious at this stage to go into other matters that might throw a great deal of light on this Bill.  The Minister seems to have been rather hazy on the origin of the milk war that took place in West Cork.  I might be able to throw a good deal of light on that if I wished to go into these matters, and I am quite sure that the Minister could get more information in regard to them than he gave us here this evening.  Perhaps in all the circumstances, it would be as well if we were to say nothing further about them.  Perhaps it might be as well to say nothing more than was said by the Minister's colleague, Deputy Corry, in referring to certain transactions in West Cork that were the subject of court proceedings recently of which the Minister has some idea.  They would throw a strange light on the whole trend of things; they would provide a rather extraordinary illumination as to where the demand for this particular measure has come from and how irresponsible that type of demand can be.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that what has been done in regard to opening up certain districts in various parts of the country could not be done in as effective a way by means other than those adopted by the Dairy Disposals Board.  I am not prepared to throw any bouquets at the Dairy Disposals Board for anything they have done, because, looking over the whole story, what they have done amounts to very little in my opinion. It is the kind of concern very dear to the hearts of the present Government. It is a State or semi-State concern for which nobody need answer here, the kind of concern which has neither a body to be kicked nor a soul to be damned.  That is the type the Board is.  This combination of civil servant-farmers represents, in my opinion, a most unsatisfactory arrangement.  The general opinion is that it is a losing <Col N="1431" /> concern, that it has been a losing concern over a number of years, that it has been bolstered up by various means and subterfuges, and that there is no intention on the part of the people connected with it to let go the power they have got in this country, but rather to seek more power at every possible opportunity.</P>
    <P>The Dairy Disposals Board have a number of creameries in West Cork. If there is a demand for other creameries amongst the farmers, why not hand over some of these creameries to them?  Why cannot they let us have a full and complete statement of their position?  Why do they continue to masquerade as a concern, pretending to dispose of property acquired over a very considerable time, and giving no indication that they have any intention of getting rid of that property?  I dislike monopolies such as the Dairy Disposals Board seem to represent. The tendency in this country is to set them up in every direction.  We have them in every Department.  We have them in national health insurance, industrial insurance, and in every branch of public life.  State ownership and State control would be a clear and understandable thing.  Somebody would be responsible, but there is nobody responsible for the type of hybrid creation that is represented by monopolies of this sort.  I regard them as a danger.  They are generally inefficient, and it is very hard to get down to the root of things.  They are able to cover up their tracks by some high-sounding excuses from time to time.</P>
    <P>I have asked the Minister to give us the reasons for the introduction of this measure and to tell us where the demand has come from, to tell us seriously, if he is prepared to do it, why the continued existence of a few proprietary creameries in West Cork is a menace or a danger to the dairy industry in this country.  The Minister asserts that they are, but if he can prove that in this House, I am prepared to revise my whole view of this matter.  I want him to say whether he thinks it just or fair in present circumstances, knowing the history of the relations that have existed between certain <Col N="1432" /> officials of his Department and certain proprietary creameries in West Cork for years, that the question of deciding what the price is to be and who is to constitute the arbitration court should be a matter in his own hands.  I ask him whether he thinks it does not represent any more than the elementary principles of fair play that there should be an appeal from the decision of the arbitrator to the Circuit Court on the question of determining the value of the undertakings to be taken over.</P>
    <P>Again I want to emphasise the position of the employees in this industry. The Minister indicated that most of the creameries will be closed.  Some may be taken over but, in any circumstances that will arise, the bulk of the employees are going to be flung on the roadside.  Is this a time to do that? Where is the urgency of the situation that calls for that decision at present? We have a number of people on the roadside because of other circumstances. We have a number of people leaving the country because they have nothing to do here.  The employees in this particular industry are getting fairly good wages.  They have got fairly good wages during the whole period of their employment and in many cases it has meant employment for the sons of men who were employed in the concern beforehand.  Does the Minister think that this is a suitable and appropriate time to add a few hundred to the number of people already unemployed? Does he say it is a time to dismiss employees with whatever paltry sum in the way of compensation may be ultimately decided?</P>
    <P>I dislike the methods by which this Bill has reached this House.  I dislike the indefinite and unsatisfactory way in which it has been introduced.  I dislike the absence of full information about this concern which is to take over the creameries.  I am entirely doubtful as to whether the Dairy Disposals Board have any intention or desire of handing over the creameries to the farmers.  I am entirely doubtful as to whether the handing over of the creameries at the present time or at any time in the future, is going to be of any practical benefit to the farmers <Col N="1433" /> of West Cork.  For these reasons, I oppose the Bill and I hope to have an opportunity of saying something further about it at a later stage.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TedOSullivan" hpid="Mr. T. O'Sullivan Mr. T. O'Sullivan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. T. O'Sullivan</NameTxt>
      <P>I believe that there are very urgent reasons for the introduction of this Bill, and I am satisfied that there is a demand for it. In West Cork, there is very serious overlapping of creamery services.  It is an extraordinary thing to see two creameries on either side of a road in a village or townland, with all the duplication of services that that entails.  There is no hope of farmers in that area co-operating to the extent of bringing their milk to market, because in every townland you have farmers going to two different creameries. One man cannot assist another in bringing his milk to the creamery. In other parts of the area, you have co-operative societies setting up creameries very close to one another. Competition is also proceeding amongst those societies.  From the point of view of reorganising the co-operative societies themselves, this Bill is necessary.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Moreover, and more important, there are many areas, especially the poorer areas in West Cork, where no facilities are provided for the farmers to market their milk.  We had experience in the past of proprietary and co-operative societies jumping in and establishing their claim in the best or richest areas.  They kept everybody else out and left the poor areas surrounding them to fend for themselves, with the result that no facilities were ever provided for those poorer areas. Before I deal with that question of the poorer areas, I should like to say that no tribute to the Dairy Disposals Company is adequate for their work in the organising and marketing of the milk supply.  Their work in the Beara Peninsula has been a tremendous success.  In that area, no proprietary or co-operative undertaking was prepared to organise the milk supply because it was thought that it would not be a paying proposition, that the supply would be too small.  The Dairy Disposals Company have gone in there <Col N="1434" /> and organised every gallon of milk in the Peninsula.  They made the market as convenient as possible&mdash; indeed, very convenient&mdash;for every farmer in that area.  They have paid a fair and just price for the milk and, while their accounts are not published, from any information I can obtain I am satisfied that they have made their business in that area pay very well. It is in the hope that facilities for the marketing of milk will be provided in similar areas in West Cork that I welcome this Bill.</P>
    <P>Take the area from Adrigole to Kealkil.  One co-operative society established a creamery in Kealkil but they left all the area between that and Adrigole without any facilities for the marketing of milk.  They never make any movement in that direction until such time as action similar to this is taken.  The same society established&mdash; I do not like to say &ldquo;jumped&rdquo;&mdash;a claim near Schull.  They set up there and left the country west of it fend for itself.  They established a branch at Kilcrohane which they said would not pay but which has paid very well up to the present.  Still, they have not developed the country between there and Bantry.  I suggest that the Minister should take power in this Bill to compel people who have taken control of such areas as that to provide a market for the whole area and not confine themselves to the richest or most convenient little patch in it. Amongst the co-operative societies themselves there is a fair share of overlapping and competition which does not serve the interests of the farmer or the interests of the people of the area generally.  One co-operative society in West Cork recently declared a profit of £10,000 on the year's work.  It would be very interesting to learn how much of that sum of £10,000 represented a direct profit on milk and how much was derived from other trading.  It is wrong that a co-operative society of farmers should neglect to provide marketing facilities in their area for all the farmers while they have time and money to engage in trading of other kinds because it brings in an extraordinary profit.</P>
    <P>This Bill is certainly a step in the <Col N="1435" /> right direction, but it does not go far enough.  Some provision should be made to ensure that co-operative societies cater for the people in their area.  Another serious matter, neglected, I think, in the other Bills, is the provision of compensation or employment for displaced workers.  I agree with the other Deputies who have spoken on this matter that any Act of the Oireachtas which deprives a man of his way of earning a living should provide for payment of just compensation to him if alternative employment cannot be found for him.  There is nothing new in that suggestion because in various other Acts&mdash;the Local Government Act, the Road Transport Act and the Shannon Development Act&mdash; provision is made for displaced employees. I understood from the Minister that, even though this provision was not included in the 1928 Act, £53,000 was provided as compensation for redundant staff.  I am quite prepared to put down amendments to ensure that employees will not be in a worse position because of the operation of this Act.  There is no reason why they should.  There is a huge area to be developed and young men can be employed in its development.  The older men should get alternative employment near their homes, and men who are redundant should be compensated in a just manner.  I am sure the Minister or the board would not attempt to place an experienced creamery manager of 20, 30 or 40 years' service, who knows his business from A to Z, on the unemployed list.  I think the experience of these men would be valuable to the board and I hope that, before this Bill is finished with, some provision will be made in that respect.</P>
    <P>I think it is quite right for Deputies to refer to the fact that no balance sheet has been made available to enable us to examine the operations of the Dairy Disposals Board.  I can speak only of what I see in my own area, and I am quite satisfied with the board's operations there, but I feel that it would be much better if we knew exactly what their all-over operations were.  I ask the Minister very <Col N="1436" /> earnestly to get this Bill through as quickly as possible, my main object being to provide a market for the farmers of the areas in West Cork, where no market exists, and to provide that market, if at all possible, this year. I trust also that he will include some fair and just provision for the employees. Perhaps we shall have an opportunity of helping in that matter later on.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>Our whole attitude to this Bill depends on what the policy of the Government is with regard to the Dairy Disposals Company&mdash;whether it is to become a permanent institution in the State or not, and whether it is to do certain work which it was originally intended to do.  The Minister indicated that his predecessor, some 16 years ago, realising that there was an amount of cut-throat competition and redundancy of creameries in the dairying districts and certain powerful monopolies operating in these districts, decided that it was necessary to reorganise the whole dairying industry.  A Bill was passed setting up this company.  It was set up for the definite purpose of reorganising the industry and of extending the creamery industry to districts in which it was not in existence, notably Clare and Kerry.</P>
      <P>The Minister at that time indicated that he hoped and expected that the company would complete the work for which it was brought into being within five years, and the title of the Bill was obviously an indication of that.  It was designed to dispose of certain creameries and was not called a dairy acquisition company.  In reply to a Parliamentary Question which I had down to-day, with reference to the number of concerns disposed of to co-operative societies by the company, the Minister said that, up to 1932, during the period of office of the previous Government, 46 creameries taken over were disposed of to co-operative societies, and, since 1932 to date, only nine had been taken over.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Surely it is reasonable to suggest that that is contrary to the intention indicated by the decision to set up a body of this sort to reorganise dairying and to put it in a better financial condition. <Col N="1437" /> I do not think it can be denied that the company has done certain useful work, but what we really are criticising is that we have no information as to what it is costing the State, and, in fact, we are not entitled to know whether the administration and work of the company have been efficient or otherwise.  No accounts are submitted to the Committee of Public Accounts and no balance sheet is published.  According to the Minister, the total advances by the State amount to £1,172,000, but the information given by the Accounting Officer before the Committee of Public Accounts was that the sum advanced amounted to £1,191,767&mdash;a difference of £20,000. Whichever figure is accurate, there is a small matter of £20,000 of a difference.</P>
    <P>The Minister was not able to give us any information as to what comprises the amount repaid, of £236,000.  He indicated that the bigger portion of it was the £3 per cow charge, but did not indicate what portion of it covers the amount of capital paid by co-operative societies in acquiring creameries.  He went on to show that the gross liability, not including interest or other charges, was £800,000.  No company can expect to have large sums of capital provided without any charge, and there is no use in the Minister trying to make the case that this company is now beginning to operate on an economic basis.  The Minister gives the value of the assets at present as about £782,000, leaving a balance of £18,000, but he did not tell us who made that valuation, or on what basis it was made, or, in fact, whether it would be possible to realise that amount in present circumstances at all.  I should be very much inclined to question that figure of £782,000 as the value of the assets.</P>
    <P>It appears to me, as it appeared to me last year when we were questioning the Accounting Officer at the Public Accounts Committee, to be extraordinary that in recent years so very few of these businesses have been acquired by co-operative societies.  We were more or less given to understand at that time that there was very little demand for the acquisition by <Col N="1438" /> any co-operative societies of any creameries.  During the examination of the Accounting Officer before the Public Accounts Committee, I asked: Is there any inducement to a co-operative society to take over a creamery when you are operating these creameries free of charge?  The reply of the Accounting Officer was: From the point of view of the supplier of milk, there is not, because he is getting as good a price for his milk as is paid by the co-operative creamery.</P>
    <P>Remember, the original intention was that this company should take over certain proprietary creameries, should close up any redundant creameries or auxiliary creameries and, in fact, it should take over, as they have taken over, co-operative creameries which were in a bad financial condition, reorganise them, put them on a sound financial basis and a good working basis, and then hand them back to a new society.  That is being done.  The price is, relatively, the same as the price paid by the co-operative societies, but of course one must realise that there is no great inducement for a co-operative society to take over certain responsibilities and liabilities which the State&mdash;or, rather, a company subsidised by the State&mdash;is prepared to take over.  It seems to me to be unfair and unreasonable to co-operative societies in other areas, which have to shoulder their capital liabilities and meet the various charges in connection with their capital liabilities, if a similar service is going to be given by a State-subsidised company of this sort.</P>
    <P>Now, I understand, from reading the reports of the I.A.O.S., that a number of creameries or co-operative societies tried to acquire the property of this company, that they have made certain offers, and that the real problem was that they could not arrive at what they considered to be a fair price.  Again, in connection with that question, the Accounting Officer, in reply to a question before the Committee of Public Accounts, said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We would have no difficulty in disposing of these creameries to new societies if we would give them at a low price.  We are inclined to hold <Col N="1439" /> out for such price as will recoup the State for the original cost, plus the cost of improvements&mdash;new plant and new buildings&mdash;since they were taken over.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Of course, if that is the attitude of the company and of the Minister, it is very unlikely that there is any possibility of getting any of those creameries taken over by a society.  I think that the Minister and the House must realise that if, as the Minister has pointed out, a certain amount of redundancy had to be eliminated, it would not be possible for a new society that had to get capital to meet the cost of getting rid of those redundant societies and of reorganising others, as well as compensating the staffs of the redundant societies.  It seems to me to be unreasonable that there is not some provision made for fixing what is a fair and reasonable price as between the Dairy Disposals Board and a new society, or even a reorganised old society, that is prepared to take the thing over and work it without incurring any liability on the State.  Taking the long view, I think that where such creameries are being run efficiently at the moment, we will have to realise that certain losses must be incurred if these creameries are going to be taken over, and I think the Minister should consider having, say, one or two experienced valuers in dealing with any negotiations between the company and the societies concerned, and that those valuers would take everything into account, such as previous agreements, the intention of the original Act, and so on, with a view to seeing that the price arrived at would be a price that, in the circumstances, the society would be able to meet, and which would enable it to meet whatever charges, by way of pensions and so on, might be incurred.</P>
    <P>There is no use in the Minister demanding from a creamery a price that is prohibitive, or that would make the project uneconomic in the long run.  It must be remembered that the suppliers of milk to the creamery concerned are being paid a price that compares favourably with the price paid to the others, and you cannot hope to dispose <Col N="1440" /> of such a creamery on that basis.  For instance, I understand that the New-market people have made several offers since 1928&mdash;even up to last year&mdash;with a view to acquiring from the Dairy Disposals Board a number of creameries in the North Cork area.</P>
    <P>I understand that certain offers were made and that the Minister indicated to the deputation who discussed the matter with him that a condition of the sale would be that the Department of Agriculture must be satisfied that the local suppliers were favourable to the project.  Surely, if the I.A.O.S., who were subsidised by the State to promote co-operative organisation in this country, have interested themselves in forming a co-operative society, and have interested themselves in negotiating the taking over and disposal of those creameries&mdash;as was the intention under the original Act&mdash;that should be sufficient evidence for the Minister that the suppliers are satisfied that those creameries should be taken over and controlled by themselves?  If that is the attitude of the Minister now, what was his attitude to the compulsory acquisition of those creameries that he is going to deal with in this Bill?  Has he tested the feelings of the suppliers of milk to those creameries, and does he feel that they are satisfied that they should be taken over in present circumstances? Is one law going to apply to one concern in one particular set of circumstances, and a different law to apply to the owners of private creameries, or even to co-operative creameries, in a different set of circumstances? I understand that there are other groups also.  For instance, there is the Dicksgrove group in County Kerry, which is referred to in this report of the I.A.O.S., who want to acquire a number of those creameries that could be worked efficiently there. The Minister should inform the House what are the considerations which have operated against the disposal of those creameries to societies which have proved that they are capable of operating them economically and efficiently.</P>
    <P>The Minister has referred to competition between creameries, and to a certain amount of cut-throat competition <Col N="1441" /> that may be there still.  Does not the Minister know that the Rattoo Co-operative Creamery have complained of the fact that the board has taken over certain milk suppliers, and has refused to return them to the co-operative creamery.  The board, in fact, has broken an agreement by accepting milk from a number of transferred suppliers.  Surely that is not in the interests of the co-operative movement in this country?  Is it the policy of the Minister and the Government to put the brake on any further effort by the I.A.O.S., and deliberately to sabotage and prevent the extension of co-operative organisation in this country?  Is it the policy of the Government that the Dairy Disposals Board, which was originally set up for a specific purpose, to operate for a very short period, is to become a permanent institution in the life of the dairying industry in this country? Those are matters on which we want very clear and definite information before we can make up our minds as to whether this sort of compulsory acquisition can be supported.  I agree with other Deputies that it is very undesirable to operate for a long period a board of this sort controlled by civil servants, on which the ordinary business people or the agricultural community have no representation.  I think it might be well too if the Minister, when replying, would give us the names of the members of this board, and their qualifications.</P>
    <P>With regard to the sort of competition to which the Minister has referred, he knows that in the town of Tipperary there is a co-operative creamery, and that the Dairy Disposals Board has also a creamery in that town.  Deputy O'Sullivan tried to justify this Bill by informing the House that in some towns and villages you have, cheek by jowl, two proprietary creameries in operation.  But you have that condition operating in the town of Tipperary. That has been the situation there for a good many years, and no effort has been made to solve that problem.</P>
    <P>Why should that state of affairs be permitted?  It is contrary to the original intention of the Bill that that <Col N="1442" /> should be permitted to continue.  I join in condemnation of the methods adopted in the compulsory acquisition of those creameries, and the manner of arriving at a fair figure of compensation. I think it is ridiculous to suggest that a party to the acquisition should appoint an arbitrator.  If the proposal is left in its present form, the owners of the creameries that are to be acquired can hardly feel that they will get a fair measure of justice.</P>
    <P>I think Deputy Dockrell was right in raising the point as to why the State should have any priority claim for debts that are not secured.  That means that existing encumbrances and mortgages will have only a secondary claim.  Why should the State get a priority claim for any debts that are not secured?  Why should the State get any preference in that regard over the individual who has made capital advances and gone to the trouble of securing them in the ordinary way?  I do not think it is right that, merely by the introduction of this provision, those mortgages which were well founded should be ignored, while the State gets a priority claim.  I hope the Minister will deal with the various aspects of this problem which we have raised, and particularly with the attitude regarding the capital that is advanced, and the fact that even the House and the public are not entitled to any information on the matter of accounts or the publication of a balance sheet.  The Dáil cannot form proper judgments of the efficiency of this board as a business body, unless it gets separate accounts. We should get those accounts for the past 15 years if we are to satisfy ourselves that this board can be entrusted with the business which this Bill suggests should be compulsorily acquired by it.  We are entitled to be put in a position to judge the efficiency of the board's administration.  We can only do so by having at our hand separate accounts for the years during which it has been in operation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrederickHCrowley" hpid="Mr. Fred H. Crowley Mr. Fred H. Crowley">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Fred H. Crowley</NameTxt>
      <P>I wish to support this Bill and to pay a compliment to the Dairy Disposals Board for the efficient manner in which they have carried out their duties up to the present.  While saying that, I agree <Col N="1443" /> with Deputy Dockrell that some other form of arbitration should be set up with a view to assessing the value of the premises and the property being taken over.  My memory goes back to a situation which prevailed 11 years ago in Rathmore village, where you had a proprietary creamery, a co-operative creamery, and an outside co-operative creamery cutting right into the same area.  At that particular time the co-operative creamery was in a very serious position, and owed a very large sum of money to the bank, with the result that a number of us had to approach the bank with a view to getting a reduction, before going to the Minister for Agriculture to get him to straighten out the creamery situation in that area.  Had not the Minister intervened at that particular time, and got the Dairy Disposals Board to take over all the premises and form one unit there, I am fully satisfied that we would have no efficient creamery operating in that area to-day.  We have at the moment one central creamery in Rathmore, four auxiliaries and three travelling creameries.  Take the district along the seaboard, from Kenmare to Cahirciveen, in those two districts we could get no group of commercial people or men of capital to form a group of creameries.  That had to wait until the Dairy Disposals Board was established and, with Government backing, we now have a central creamery with a number of auxiliaries operating in Kenmare and Cahirciveen.  We then come to another area which touches good land and at the same time runs into a lot of reclaimed land, namely, Castlemaine.  Here we have a regrouping of existing creameries, and auxiliaries built.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Now, the point I wish to stress is this, that if the erection of creameries was left to private capital or to commercial people we would not, to this day, along that sea-board, have any creameries operating.  That is an important point to bear in mind.  It is all right to get a co-operative creamery or a private individual to go into a good dairying district and start <Col N="1444" /> a creamery, where the successful working of it is a certainty, but it is another thing to go into an area where no creamery has heretofore existed and where the possibility of operating one successfully is doubtful.</P>
    <P>I must compliment the Dairy Disposals Board for having the courage to start the creameries in the areas mentioned and for having operated those creameries so successfully.  The Minister for Agriculture has given certain figures.  He has shown that in the first three or four years of operation there was a loss, but after that the creameries started to pay.  That is an indication that it was a bold venture to enter those districts, to start creameries and to make them pay.  I think the Dairy Disposals Board deserves to be complimented for having carried out its work so satisfactorily.</P>
    <P>With regard to the re-sale of the creameries to co-operative societies, I listened to Deputy O'Sullivan referring to the reluctance of the Dairy Disposals Board to part with certain creameries.  I know that Deputy O'Sullivan has been approached by probably three or four people who are rather anxious to get the plum creameries in County Kerry handed back to them.  I would not mind the creameries being handed back to the milk suppliers, but I would have an objection to handing them back to four or five individuals, backed by £15,000 or £17,000, but who have very little support from the milk suppliers.  I hope that, if handing back takes place, the creameries will be given to the milk suppliers and not to any outside group.</P>
    <P>The fact that we have the Dairy Disposals Board endeavouring to keep an even keel between the good dairying districts and the poorer areas is an important factor.  When I was approached regarding the sale of the creameries, I gave a reasonable answer and I am giving the same answer to the House, and that is that when the milk suppliers unanimously demand the creameries I would raise no objection, but I will not allow them to pick the plum creameries and leave the others there.  That is the answer I <Col N="1445" /> gave, and that is my attitude here so far as giving back the creameries to the milk suppliers is concerned.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Information with reference to the accounts of the Dairy Disposals Board is given in reply to Question 386 in the Minutes of Evidence taken before the Committee of Public Accounts for the year 1940-41. The Accounting Officer was asked: &ldquo;Are these accounts accessible to Deputies?&rdquo;  He replied: &ldquo;I do not think they are accessible, because the Minister on more than one occasion has taken up the attitude that some day he will have to dispose of these properties, and in the meantime he does not wish to disclose facts regarding them which might prejudice their sale.&rdquo;  I think that is a rather questionable attitude for the Minister to take up.  He does not want persons who contemplate the repurchase of these creameries to know what they are doing; he wants them, as it were, to buy a pig in a poke.  He does not want them to have the long picture of the financial record of these creameries, because he feels that might be used as an effective lever against him for the purpose of establishing a lower price than he wants, and the price he wants is the cost of the creameries, the cost of organising the district, together with the cost of putting in any additional machinery.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We all know that the activities of the Dairy Disposals Board have been of an eleemosynary character.  Certain areas in Kerry are being converted into dairying districts by the Dairy Disposals Board for some purpose which I do not quite understand.  There are travelling creameries in Kerry separating milk on the seashore.  Why they are making a creamery district of West Kerry heaven alone knows, because if you search the face of the earth for land less suitable for dairying purposes, I doubt if you will find it.  But, having established creameries in West Kerry, and having spent large sums of money for that purpose; having gone into areas in Limerick and Cork which are creamery areas and spent large sums, the Minister is <Col N="1446" /> now willing to sell them back to persons at a price which will recoup him for his total expenditure.  That is why he will not publish accounts.</P>
    <P>I think the Dáil ought to make him publish the accounts, so that we will know how much the creamery industry is costing the country.  Nobody does know.  At the present moment most of the new creamery groupings are probably making money.  The Minister might be induced to publish the accounts now.  He ought to publish the accounts of the enterprise for the past 15 years, so that we can learn what the reorganisation of the dairying industry is costing.</P>
    <P>The production of butter in this country for export is as dead as Queen Anne.  It will never pay a profit again, and the sooner Deputies make up their minds to that the better.  The production of butter for export will never pay a profit again and, frankly, any efforts to maintain that trade, to keep it in existence, are doomed to failure.  They will swallow endless sums of money, so long as the dairying counties keep up their pressure on successive Ministers for Agriculture.  That nugatory expenditure may be continued for some years under the pressure of political blackmail.  When the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce go round the country bleating about what Fianna Fáil did to save the dairying industry, they know they are talking through their hats.  The dairying industry has collapsed and is not in a position even to supply butter to our own people. The Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Minister for Agriculture have achieved this much: they have so sterilised and paralysed the dairying industry that we have not sufficient butter to feed our own people.  For the first time in history since Brian Boru was slaughtered on the battlefield of Clontarf, we are unable to produce sufficient butter to meet the requirements of the Irish people.  What the Danes could not do, what Queen Elizabeth could not do, what the Cromwellians could not do, and what the Hanoverians could not do, the Minister for Agriculture has done.  He has created a situation in <Col N="1447" /> which there is not enough butter being produced here to feed the Irish people. If any argument were necessary to justify the winding-up of the Dairy Disposals Board, I suggest that is the most potent one there could be.  Any body functioning under the direct control of a Minister who has succeeded in creating the phenomenal situation in which we have no butter for our own people must prove to demonstration that it is not making as big a mess of the work that it is supposed to be doing under his control as he is making of the work that he is supposed to be doing.  I do not know what success is attending the efforts of the Dairy Disposals Board because we cannot see, and will not be shown, its accounts.</P>
    <P>The Kerry Deputies have reason to rejoice if they can get somebody to go into Kerry to pour out public money there.  If you have a situation in which you have three creameries in a parish and one of them is bankrupt, and if the Dairy Disposals Board will come in and buy the two solvent creameries, setting up the bankrupt one as a monopolist in the parish, who will blame the Kerry Deputies for rejoicing?  They can well say that the Dairy Disposals Board was a magnificent institution to set on foot.  What are we going to do in connection with the dairying industry? Are we going to go on passing Dairy Acts every three years, pouring a little more money into a sinking ship, or are we seriously going to face the situation that confronts us?  The production of butter for export is as dead as Queen Anne.  Is there anyone with sufficient intelligence and enterprise to take effective steps to preserve the dairy cattle population of the country? In order to do that something more than the passing of miserable little Bills like this will have to be undertaken. There are two methods of dealing with it.  One is to withdraw from the business altogether and let it stand on its own legs.  If, say, you have three creameries in Rathkeale, have open competition, and let the most highly efficient unit survive. Withdraw Government control altogether. That is one way.  The other <Col N="1448" /> method, and I believe the better one, would be to set up an organisation analogous to the E.S.B.  Call it the Milk Manufacturing Board, and give it a monopoly in all the processes of milk manufacture.  Let it take the whole country as a unit and give it the exclusive charge of manufacturing and marketing butter, cheese, and casein. They have something of the kind in Denmark&mdash;although there, I believe, it happens to be a combination of co-operative societies.  Let the system be founded on free competition, with the survival of the most efficient units. Such a system would, I believe, produce the best results.  The Fianna Fáil methods will produce nothing but confusion, bewilderment and waste of money.</P>
    <P>I want to warn the House against the growth of the power of this bureaucratic body&mdash;the Dairy Disposals Board.  What actually happened was this: that three or four very energetic men in the Government service were charged with the task of disentangling the creamery tangle.  As they became more and more deeply involved in this job the creameries that they had sorted out and reorganised became more or less their life's work.  Their success or failure, their progress or decline, became the prime interest of their lives, and they did not want to let go. Who will blame earnest or energetic men for feeling that way?  If their zeal is allowed to carry them on, they will spread their tentacles to every county, so that we will have a semi-public corporation controlling the greater part of the creamery industry.  The next stage will be of the kind of which we had a picture here to-day.  Two Kerry Deputies got up, one saying that you ought to sell the creameries in Kerry, and the other saying that you ought not.  I know what will happen. The Deputies will agree amongst themselves in regard to the creameries that they want sold, whether in North Kerry or in South Kerry.  Political pressure will begin to be felt.  The vested interests will bring pressure to bear on the political Minister for the time being charged with responsibility in connection with the Department of Agriculture.  Of all systems of <Col N="1449" /> organisation that is the most hopeless and abominable, because the creamery industry will become just a big political pig-trough in which every political racketeer in the country will be putting his snout.  That would be the most disastrous development of all.</P>
    <P>I think that the proposal for unrestricted competition and for the survival of the fittest is probably impracticable, though it has a good deal to commend it.  I believe myself that the most effective solution would be the establishment of a milk manufacturing board.  The big vested interests will scream blue blazes at that, but they will have to be dealt with justly and fairly.  I would not advocate confiscation. Everybody whose property is acquired, or whose means of livelihood is interfered with, should get fair and just compensation.  This board should be as efficient in its sphere as the Electricity Supply Board is in its. It should have control over all milk not used in the producer's own homestead. It would arrange that in certain areas cheese would be manufactured, in other areas butter, and in other areas, in certain times of the year, casein.  It should concern itself not only with individual small units, but it should be in a position to promote the consumption of liquid milk by means of effective campaigns to that end.  It could also afford the necessary research to discover the best means of using the by-products of milk.  It could encourage the introduction of suitable cattle on to farms where unsuitable cattle are at present being kept.  In a word, it could conduct scientific investigations into the most effective way of carrying on the dairying industry.  It could do something to end the abuses that at present exist to the knowledge of all of us&mdash;of farmers hanging on to unprofitable cows and then complaining that they cannot make money out of milk production at present prices.  The board could take effective measures to compel farmers to belong to a creamery society and keep cows capable of producing a gallonage which would constitute them as economic units.  If these men were not prepared to do that they should be told to get out of the dairying industry since they were <Col N="1450" /> simply a clog on those who were doing their duty.</P>
    <P>There must be a realistic approach to this whole problem.  The introduction and reintroduction of piecemeal petty measures, such as we are considering this evening, will get us nowhere. Every measure of this kind gives the comfortable kind of feeling that we are doing something to help the dairying industry.  We sit back for another six months and wait for the next crisis to come along.  We are not doing anything for the industry by passing measures of this kind.  We are simply putting patches over a running sore. Sooner or later the patches will have to come off and radical treatment will have to be applied to the ulcer.  Unless we do something now for the dairying industry the whole agricultural economy of this country will come clattering down on top of us.  I regard it as the foundation of our agricultural economy which is the foundation of the State.</P>
    <P>Is the Minister for Agriculture satisfied to take the long-term view with regard to the prospects of the dairying industry?  Does he not share my view, and the view of the Taoiseach, of its utter ruin post-war unless there is introduced into it a diversity of products, and a very much higher standard of efficiency than at present obtains?  If he does not agree with those conclusions, what are we going to do about it?  I am satisfied that if we set up a milk manufacturing and marketing board, with instructions to it to concern itself with the interests of producers and consumers, we can save the dairying industry.  As long as the interests of producers and consumers are left in the hands of middlemen, and of those concerned with the distribution of liquid milk, then the industry will remain in its present state of chaotic confusion.  Nothing will be done for the protection of the entire industry.</P>
    <P>I want to say in conclusion what it would not be possible for me to say if I were a member of a political party. It has been said that creamery committees are composed of very efficient bodies of men.  There may be some. I have never met them.  I do not <Col N="1451" /> doubt that in Limerick, and in certain parts of Cork and Tipperary, where people are engaged in a large way in the dairying industry, you may meet with very efficient committees, but in the congested areas which, normally, are not dairying areas at all, my profound conviction is that the creameries are effectively operated by the creamery manager.  If you have a good creamery manager the creamery will be well run.  If you have a bad creamery manager, the committee will be of little or no use in effecting the reforms necessary to ensure the success of the enterprise.  I know that is an unpopular thing to say, but that has been my experience of committees of the kind.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that if we are to save the dairying industry we can only do so by establishing a body like the Electricity Supply Board.  I venture to draw an analogy between the creamery committees and the landlords. When the Land League was started a lot of people came forward and said that you should not abolish all the landlords, because some of them were very good men.  Every branch of the League was constrained to admit that that was true: that some landlords were public spirited, decent, Christian men.  Better men there could not be.  The evils, however, that resulted from the existence of all landlords far outweighed the benefits that accrued from the existence of the few good ones.</P>
    <P>I have no doubt that there are good creamery committees which are most energetic and intelligent, and who would conscientiously do their duty. But there are also bad ones, composed of men who do not understand the business, and who think more of their own personal interests than they do of the enterprise entrusted to them to manage.  They are composed partly of men who are too lazy to set themselves up against a manager, because they are afraid of him, and partly, I am sorry to say, of men who think that, by hunting continually with the manager, they may get some little concession out of him, to the detriment of their fellow-members in the co-operative <Col N="1452" /> society.  The damage that committees of that kind can do, in my judgment, outweighs the advantages that accrue from their activities.  I would be in favour of abolishing them all as executive bodies.  I would allow, if needs be, that the committees in the country be shareholders, or members of the milk marketing board to which I refer.</P>

      <P>They are not.  I saw a creamery committee take as fine a creamery as ever was built, and in five years they made feathers of it, and then sold the machinery out, leaving nothing but an empty shell, although the creamery had £2,000 or £3,000 in reserve some years ago.  There was nothing we could do but watch that happening.  I did what I could.  I went to the Department and to the I.A.O.S., and was told blankly that they were &ldquo;doing swell,&rdquo; but now there is nothing there but the four walls.  I know another creamery that has gone down the drain in that way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>What happened in the case of some of them was that there were weak, inefficient committees: so long as there was a good manager, everything went well, but the moment there was a bad manager there was no authority there to control him, check him or, if needs be, sack him.  Almost invariably, these weak committees are to be found in the areas that can least afford it. Where you have well-to-do farmers with large herds, you are sure to get a group of men with strength of character to control with knowledge and efficiency.  They are able to afford <Col N="1453" /> a manager who knows the business and they are able to take an intelligent interest in the day-to-day workings of the creamery.  When you have small areas, however, where there are 10- or 12-acre farmers, as in a congested area, they are liable, even when they feel in their hearts that they do not know enough, to set their judgment against that of the manager.  Then they find the creameries going bankrupt, with the guarantors mulcted and the creameries destroyed.</P>
    <P>Bearing that in mind, I adhere to the view that the only basis on which you can save the industry as a whole is to set up a board analogous to the Electricity Supply Board and style it the Milk Supply and Marketing Board, for the control of the industry and for the service of the interests of the producer and consumer.  Under the present system, we are getting nowhere, we are merely confusing the industry and persuading the bulk of the people that the Dairy Disposals Board is doing good when, in fact, it is far from doing that.  We are covering up the cracks and saying that creameries are doing well, and if this complacency continues, then it will be too late to do anything.  The catastrophe that will then ensue will hit every farmer, large and small, and it will tax the ingenuity of the best statesmen and economists in Europe to put it right.  I do not know what hope there would be for Irish agriculture if the dairying industry really collapsed. It is in grave danger of doing so. Unless we face that issue effectively and try to prevent it, our name and reputations will have to answer to posterity, and I do not care to state what posterity's verdict will be upon it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyJosephODonova" hpid="Mr. O'Donovan Mr. O'Donovan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Donovan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that this Bill is a continuation of that introduced by the Minister's predecessor, under the Cosgrave régime, and I welcome it as being overdue.  There has been no criticism of the Bill from any part of the House, except for a little from Deputy Murphy; but there has been some criticism of the Dairy Disposals Board.  Possibly there are various reasons to justify that, but <Col N="1454" /> some Deputies have been rather harsh in their statements about the board. In my constituency in West Cork, where a travelling creamery has been established, it has been very successful and is a great asset to the milk producers of that district.  Whilst other criticisms by Deputies may be justified, I must put in one good word in regard to that development in my constituency.</P>
      <P>Under existing conditions, if there is not to be a regrouping, when this Bill becomes law, of the rest of the co-operative creameries in West Cork, I hope that the Dairy Disposals Board will extend its functions and take in other poor areas in the district.</P>
      <P>There has been very little criticism of the Bill.  There is nothing in it to criticise, as it is merely carrying on the work that was started under the Cosgrave régime.  If there is anything to justify this Bill being introduced, it is the way things have worked out since the Act was passed 16 or 17 years ago.  Deputy Dillon referred to co-operative creameries that were not successful.  We had numbers of them in the past, but there have been very few failures since the reorganisation of the whole co-operative system.  In fact, I venture to say that there have not been two failures in the whole country since the reorganisation took place, and that finishes Deputy Dillon's argument that the co-operative creameries are not a success.  I do not know on what the Deputy bases his argument, but the facts are there to prove that co-operative creameries are working successfully all over the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This Bill deals more or less exclusively with County Cork and the West Cork area.  Deputy Murphy asked the Minister if there was any attempt at agreement or negotiation with the party concerned in the purchase of these creameries.  I am satisfied that negotiation has been going on for years and that the Minister has made attempts time and again to negotiate with the parties concerned.  He has failed and, as a result, this Bill had to be introduced.  The necessity for it is the overlapping and redundancy, where there may be two creameries in a little <Col N="1455" /> village&mdash;as mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan&mdash;a creamery on either side of a road in another place, and creameries vying and competing with each other, and no satisfaction given by either side.  If this Bill did nothing but cut the losses through overheads in that particular area, it would be having a very good effect.</P>
    <P>With regard to Deputy Dillon's remarks about co-operative societies and individual proprietary owners, in my opinion, the co-operative societies are doing more to encourage and increase milk production than any other body in this country.  I know many cases in point&mdash;as do many Deputies here&mdash;of co-operative societies, anxious to increase milk production, which are subsidising members in the purchase of double dairy shorthorn bulls, in order to try to reach the ideal of the 700 or 800 gallon cow, which should be the average all over the country instead of being like black sheep, as they are at the moment.  That work being done by co-operative societies is the greatest asset that the milk producers could have, and the initiative of the societies in doing this should be applauded.  I think they are doing excellent work in trying to increase milk production in the country.</P>
    <P>If and when these creameries are acquired by the Minister, I hope that the areas in West Cork which have been untouched so far, and into which the co-operative societies did not get their tentacles, will be dealt with. When this Bill becomes law and acquisition takes place, I hope that the co-operative societies will be compelled to start hand-separating stations or travelling creameries, so as to get into touch with the people in those areas who at the moment are not in a position to market their butter or milk under favourable conditions. That is a very important purpose for which creameries are required in West Cork.  The parties that have my sympathy are those who will be out of work when creameries are acquired.  I do not know how many would be included in such a <Col N="1456" /> group, but Deputy Murphy stated that there might be between 70 and 100 persons.  Some provision should be made for them.  Deputy Murphy made a strong appeal not to have these people thrown on the roadside.</P>
    <P>Some of them have given from 30 to 40 years' faithful service to their employers.  It would not be fair to tax the incoming co-operative concerns in respect of these employees.  I also do not think it would be fair to ask those who will acquire the creameries to take over other employees if they have not sufficient work for them.  I think it would be a State obligation and also an obligation on their employers to provide pensions for those who cannot find other work.  Large numbers of people are getting big pensions in this country who did not do as effective work or give as faithful service to the State as those to whom I am referring. I appeal to the Minister to consider that matter.</P>
    <P>I know that objections have been raised in some areas by suppliers of proprietary creameries.  I think that that is a short-sighted attitude.  When the co-operative movement was started by the late Sir Horace Plunkett and his Party it was hailed as a great blessing. The movement, as well as the work it has done since, have proved successful. At present co-operative societies should get all the encouragement that it is possible to give them.  I believe that the time is ripe for the Dairy Disposals Board to see where creameries are functioning, that they are taken over by co-operative concerns.  If that were done, when this Bill becomes law, it would be an incentive to the people to work and to take an interest in their own business.  When working for others people take less interest in an industry and, as Deputy Dillon stated, they would not then have any knowledge of how to work concerns when they became owners.  If the Dairy Disposals Board and the I.A.O.S. moved in that direction, it would be a help.  This Bill is introduced in the interests of milk producers and I am satisfied that that is a step in the right direction.  I welcome the Bill and I am going to support it.</P>

      <P>I wish to support the Bill and the proposals embodied in it. I am hoping that as a result this is the last act in the way of clearing the decks for a big move forward in the dairy industry.  I realise the importance of the industry to the country and to the agricultural community.  Until all creameries are brought within the co-operative movement I believe it will not be possible to develop the industry to the utmost.  For the betterment of the industry and also of the creamery business it is best to have it in the hands of co-operative societies.  If it were to be organised on a proper basis I believe that some form of central control would be needed. That may not be possible under this Bill, but when the Dairy Disposals Board takes control I see no reason why there should not be a regrouping of all the big co-operative societies.  When we reach that stage, that is the time to get the co-operative movement under central control.  I wish to support the appeal on behalf of the employees made by various Deputies that some provision should be made for them.  I am aware that the Dairy Disposals Board treated redundant employees decently in the past.  That happened convenient to where I reside.  I would feel happier if provision could be embodied in this Bill to cover any hardship that the employees may suffer by losing their employment.</P>
      <P>I wish to pay a tribute to the work of the Dairy Disposals Board.  I had an opportunity of seeing work done by the board in a small district in North Cork, where I can safely say it was responsible for getting a large number of farmers out of serious financial difficulties caused by the overlapping of creameries.  At the same time, I do not like to see the Dairy Disposals Board adopting the attitude of the churchyard&mdash;&mdash;taking all in and giving nothing out.  There was an outstanding case of that kind in North Cork, where we had a group of creameries, one central and six auxiliaries, taken over by the board in 1927.  That group, to my mind, is an economic group. Negotiations are going on for the purchase of that particular group for the past four years.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Meaney</NameTxt>
      <P>They have not got it yet.  The buildings are of a very poor type.  Out of the seven buildings, five of the auxiliary creameries are composed of structures of timber and iron. The peak supply of milk in 1937 was something like 17,222 gallons.  When the negotiations started for the purchase of these creameries by the suppliers who formed themselves into a co-operative society with the intention of purchasing and working the creameries in the interests of the farmers, the price of £19,000 asked by the Dairy Disposals Board was enormous, when we take into account that in 1928 or 1929 two competent independent valuers valued the creameries in that district at £11,500.  The first bid made by the farmers was £12,000.  Subsequent to that the Dairy Disposals Board reduced their demand to £17,500 and the farmers made the pretty decent offer of £16,000.  Personally, I think that anything more than that is an excessive price, and I believe the farmers there are making an honest effort to give the full value of these creameries to the Dairy Disposals Board.  I am aware that the Minister is sympathetically disposed, but apparently other Departments are not so well disposed. Therefore, the only thing I can do is to ask the Minister to keep up the pressure, and if possible try to clinch this bargain for the farmers who were so plucky as to bid this sum.  It is a pretty huge sum for a farming community. It is a big debt repayable over eight years at 5½ per cent. interest. But, in my opinion, until the farmers in that particular area can take over those creameries they will not get the best out of the dairying industry. I hope that the fact of drawing public attention to the matter in this House will at least have the effect of removing what is locally considered to be a grievance.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that in the last 15 or 16 years the co-operative movement so far as the creameries are concerned, has justified itself.  Deputy O'Donovan referred to the small percentage of creameries that failed since the co-operative movement started.  I cannot recall one to mind.  So far as <Col N="1459" /> my knowledge of the creamery industry in the large dairying county of Limerick is concerned, the co-operative creameries have worked efficiently. They made the most of the supplies given to them, marketed their commodities to the best advantage and gave the farmers every satisfaction.  So far as this Bill will help to extend the co-operative movement, I am completely in favour of it.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to go outside the scope of the Bill, which is a Bill to acquire certain proprietary creameries.  One might be tempted to indulge in an extension of the debate, as Deputy Dillon deliberately did, and discuss the whole creamery industry from start to finish.  I think we will have other occasions to do that.  I was glad, however, to hear the final pronouncement of Deputy Dillon, which was so forcibly made&mdash;I hope other Deputies will make it as forcibly&mdash;that the industry is such a one that it cannot be let down, that it must be somehow continued, as it is essential to our agricultural industry.</P>
      <P>I do not intend to criticise any of the bodies concerned&mdash;either the Dairy Disposals Board or the proprietary creameries which will be affected.  So far as I am aware, they have all faced up to their business fairly well.  The proprietary creameries, I believe, are carrying on their business in a very fair way.  As a co-operator and as one who wants to see an extension of the co-operative movement, I am in favour of the Bill so far as the acquisition of outside creameries is concerned.  As regards the Dairy Disposals Board, they were put in a very difficult position 15 or 16 years ago.  I do not believe that any other body of men entrusted with the job could have done it better.  I recognise, as I am sure very many Deputies recognise, the difficulties of the job given to these men.  I never expected that they would be able, at any given date, to show a clean sheet.  It would have been impossible in the conditions under which they were set up.  But they have served the community in a very fair way and in an extensive way.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Without in any way criticising the Dairy Disposals Board, I should like <Col N="1460" /> to get from the Minister a clear indication of what the future policy of the Government will be in regard to the dairying industry, whether we are to have a continuance of what I might call the reluctance on the part of the Dairy Disposals Board or of somebody else to part with creameries already acquired, and perhaps be faced with the same reluctance in regard to the creameries which it is proposed to acquire now.</P>
    <P>For 15 years the Dairy Disposals Board have held a considerable number of creameries.  For years I do not think any one of these creameries has been passed on to the farmers to carry on as a co-operative concern.  There may be reasons for that, but I do not think the House has ever been given a clear indication of what these particular reasons were; whether the farmers were not willing to acquire the creameries, whether the Dairy Disposals Board were not prepared to give any particular group of creamery suppliers, who wanted to take over a creamery, full particulars of the profit or loss on the particular creamery, or whether the principle generally was to keep the concerns going as they are at the present time.  Anyhow the fact remains that the board do hold a very considerable number of creameries. There would be an excuse, so far as one part of the activities of the board is concerned, that is, what one might call the condensed milk industry. That and one or two other items of their activities are more in the nature of a business occupation outside the ordinary work of creameries generally. As far as that group is concerned, there might have been difficulties in getting farmers to take over but as regards several other creameries there were, to my mind, no great obstacles in the way of the ordinary farmers taking over. Some of us have found it almost impossible to conceive why some of these creameries were not already passed on. I move the adjournment of the debate.</P>

      <P>I move the resolution standing in the names of Deputy Alfred Byrne and myself:&mdash;</P>
      <P>That Dáil Eireann is of opinion that a scheme of family allowances on a national scale should be instituted forthwith.</P>
      <P>When Deputy Alfred Byrne and I first mooted the question of family allowances in this House, about three years ago, we encountered an atmosphere on all sides of the House which suggested that our proposal was not one to be taken seriously&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;and that it was probably made for some ulterior motive.  However, in the three years that have elapsed since then a great metamorphosis has taken place. Deputy Alfred Byrne and I find ourselves in the odd position of being hustled by the principal Parties in the State and of finding ourselves confronted with a clamour that it was not we who made this proposal at all, that it had been made by the Labour Party and the Fianna Fáil Party and a variety of other influential bodies long before we had ever adumbrated it. Deputy Alfred Byrne and I are accustomed to directing the attention of this Legislature to necessary reform and discovering, after the passage of time, that our colleagues come round to our point of view.  We are quite happy to witness that recurring event in connection with family allowances.  I venture to prophesy that, after we have completed our task to-night, we will turn our minds to other reforms which require attention and help to lead Oireachtas Eireann on to their completion.</P>
      <P>I would like to direct the attention of Dáil Eireann to an article that was written in last Sunday's <i>Independent</i> under the name of P.S. O'Hegarty. There was a terrible lot of sense in that article.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to.  There was a terrible lot of sense in that article because the theme of the article was this: &ldquo;Be careful lest in inviting the State to lift all the burdens of responsibility off the shoulders of the individual citizen you will not create a situation in which the State will undertake that task but will add a condition that, in consideration of removing these burdens from the individual citizen's shoulders, they demand of the individual citizen certain concessions of liberty in return which might be entirely inconsistent with the views of a Christian democrat.&rdquo;  That article went so far as to say: &ldquo;If you expect to be born at the expense of the State, to be fed at the expense of the State, to be educated at the expense of the State, to be cured of your sickness at the expense of the State and ultimately to be buried by the State, these are demands analogous to those made by a dog upon its master, and the State, in granting these demands, may turn some day and require of the citizen to whom it grants them, duty and subservience analogous to that shown by a dog to his master.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I sympathise with that view in so far as it is interpreted to mean that the growth of the power of bureaucracy is inconsistent with individual liberty and the dignity of the human soul. But the views expressed in that article, I think, must be tempered by a reasonable appreciation of what are the hazards that individual citizens may justly be invited to face, and what are the hazards that any Christian community will combine to protect its members from.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I remember once driving in a motor car&mdash;I think it was from Castlebar to Balla&mdash;and discussing generally with a very shrewd man the rival philosophies of complete individual liberty without social services of any kind and the Rooseveltian approach to life, to be found in the social philosophy.  At the time we were talking the struggle between Mr. Willkie and Roosevelt was proceeding in the United States, and I remember saying that I thought the attitude of Mr. Willkie was very understandable when he said that open competition and leaving every free citizen <Col N="1463" /> open to the blast of events as they might transpire produced the best results and the strongest type of citizen and the most virile nation.</P>
    <P>I remember my companion on that occasion saying that that was all very well, but that there were limits to the hazards to which people ought to be exposed and that nobody, in the last analysis, would be prepared to maintain that you should never extend a helping hand to anybody, to let the devil take the hindmost and the strongest survive, and that, therefore, when you come to consider this question it became largely a matter of degree rather than principle: you had to do your best to prevent your fellow-members in the community in which you live from suffering the full blast of adversity and misfortune and, at the same time, abstain from an undue intrusion on their individual liberty and dignity by bureaucratic interference. I think he was right.  I think it is a matter of degree.  I do not think you can lay down any fundamental principles about it except to say that a man, an individual citizen, has an existence independent of the State, that he has rights superior to any of the rights of the State and, secondly, to say that the obligations of charity are just as strong as the obligations of justice, and that in determining the attitude of society to its members the obligations of both charity and justice must be borne in mind.</P>
    <P>I am very strongly apprehensive of increasing bureaucratic control over the lives of our people, and it is really in order to safeguard the family unit against such interference and control that I am strongly in favour of instituting a system of family allowances. In the absence of any such system, the very poor for the protection of their children must go to the relieving officer, to the public health authority or to the various public schemes that are operating for the relief of indigence and destitution.  Every time they approach one of these public services for the purposes of securing the benefits provided, they find themselves confronted with a questionnaire, <Col N="1464" /> possibly they have an investigating officer, or a relieving officer habitually calling to their homes.  They discover that into their kitchens and their daily lives there intrudes an outside authority that was never there before. That outside influence and interference are brought in by the very fact of the poverty of those citizens.  I want to avoid that.  I want to ensure, so far as we can, that in this society to which we belong, the family unit will be sacrosanct from outside interference, that inside the home the father and mother will be the ultimate authority and that the less the State intrudes the better.</P>
    <P>Believing that a system of family allowance is desirable for that reason, I turn my mind to a comparison of the position of the person who enjoys a good income with the position of a person who has a relatively small income. I then discover that the person who has £500 a year, and say a family of six children, is at present receiving in this State a very substantial family allowance, whereas the agricultural labourer, who is receiving 36/- a week, less than £100 a year, and has six children, gets no family allowance at all.  The fact is that if a man in this State has £500 a year, the income-tax law requires him to pay a certain proportion of that income in income-tax, but there is a provision in the income-tax code that if you get married you are entitled to have a certain part of your income free from income-tax in respect of your wife.  For every child born into the house, a further moiety of the income is relieved from income-tax. You can chop logic as long as you like as to whether it is a family allowance or whether it is not.  You can argue that inasmuch as the State never takes the money from the taxpayer, it must not be regarded as a gift from the State to the taxpayer but the net result is that the man with £500 a year would be paying over to the Government perhaps £120 income-tax at the present time&mdash;I am talking in round figures&mdash;but when he marries, immediately his income-tax is reduced by about £26 a year.  Five children are born into his house and he has to pay no income-tax at all.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1465" /> I suggest to the House that that man is receiving in respect of his wife and family a family allowance of approximately £120 a year, or over £2 a week, whereas the agricultural labourer who gets 36/- a week when he gets married still gets 36/- a week.  His first child is born and he still gets 36/- a week. His fifth child is born and he is still getting 36/- a week.  The man with £500 a year, before he got married, had a net income of £380, but when his fifth child is born his income increases from £380 to £500.  The man, on the other hand, with 36/- a week before he got married is still in receipt of 36/- a week after he has married and even after his fifth child has been born.  Is there any equity in that?  I do not think there is.  I think on this ground you can justify a system of family allowances, but I do not seek to justify it on any grounds of jealousy or comparison.</P>
    <P>I seek to justify this proposal on justice and social expediency. I do not believe that any citizen of this State desires to know of the existence of men who are working hard week in week out, who exercise their divinely granted right to marry and bring children into the world, and who find themselves in the position that when their first child is born it is an occasion of rejoicing, and when their second child is born, they are still in a position to welcome it but for whom, when the third child is born, their standard of living is definitely reduced.  It means for those parents that some of the comforts they had been able to provide for the first few children must now be done without because the cost of maintaining their family makes the continuance of these comforts impossible.</P>
    <P>The fourth child coming into that family is received with consternation because it means that that married couple, who set out on their married lives in reasonable comfort, are now definitely poor people, battling with adversity, not knowing from hour to hour or from day to day, what untoward event may throw them into utter ruin and misery and make them suppliants of the St. Vincent de Paul Society, the relieving officer or <Col N="1466" /> forced to resort to the pawn office. The fifth child is looked upon as a disaster.  The fifth child means hunger, want and misery and is, in fact, a warning that there must be no more children born to that home.  I do not believe that the citizens of this State want that to continue.  I do not believe any citizen to whom these facts are brought home, would not be prepared to say: &ldquo;Whatever the financial sacrifices are, we are prepared to meet them in order to ensure that that state of affairs will not continue.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We all agree with what is said at meetings of Muintir na Tíre and other admirable bodies of that character when people deplore that young persons do not marry in the country, that there are no marriages and that young people are leaving the land.  In the name of commonsense, what young person of 22 years or 23 years would get married in rural Ireland at present on a wage of 36/- a week in the knowledge that, when he had six or seven children, he would still have 36/- a week?  Would any Deputy here contemplate the maintenance of nine persons on 36/- a week?  Would any Deputy contemplate the maintenance of one person at present on 36/- a week?  I know people with five children in the house who are living on 36/- a week.  We must, of course, bear in mind that they live in a subsidised house, for which they are paying a rent of only 3/- a week.  But I honestly believe that some of these children are fated to grow up cripples, in one sense or another, because they are not getting the food necessary to maintain their bodies in perfect health.  I do not refer to a man who is on outdoor relief or out of a job.  This man is working 54 hours in the week&mdash;and working hard.  People may ask why is he not paid more.  For the excellent reason that the work on which he is engaged could not bear the payment of more. The only result of making the enterprise pay a higher wage would be to close it down completely.  And the enterprise in question is farming.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I could not tell you.  I am talking about family allowances and not about turf.  The longer we live in this country, the more it will be brought home to us that what I have said applies to a great many enterprises. They can afford to pay a wage adequate for a single man but, when it comes to providing a wage adequate for a man with a large family, they cannot afford it.  That is one of the reasons why I am about to advocate the payment of family allowances by the State.  It might be argued that each industry ought to pool its resources and provide family allowances for its employees, as is being done in France and Belgium.</P>
      <P>I do not believe that that is practicable here.  Inasmuch as it is not practicable, I do not think that any considerable body of citizens want to go on enjoying reasonably adequate incomes in the knowledge that their next door neighbours have been forced to regard children as a curse rather than as a blessing.  That is a literal fact, and it is a shocking thing to have to say in a Catholic country.  I honestly believe that there are many small homes in which the fifth, sixth and seventh child is looked upon as an utter disaster, its arrival being greeted with nothing but consternation and dismay.  I do not think that anybody faced with the dilemma of stretching a static wage, sufficient, perhaps, for the maintenance of a man and his wife at the barest level of subsistence, over an increasing number of children could react in any other way.  One of the objections to the paying of family allowances is of the type that P.S. O'Hegarty had in mind when he wrote his article in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>&mdash;that it might be that the State would have a right to go in and inspect the family.

      <P>There is a great deal of force in the apprehension that a system of family allowances might bring into every family an inspector to inquire how the allowance was being spent, or whether it was being spent to the best advantage.  You will hear well-intentioned bureaucrats ask: &ldquo;What causes you to believe that the parents will not spend the family allowance on horse racing or cigarettes?&rdquo; or &ldquo;How are you to be satisfied that the allowance will be spent on the children?&rdquo;  Many of them will go on to say that, if you have a scheme of this kind, you ought to give the allowance to the parents in the form of food, or something of that kind.</P>
      <P>I want to reject that line of argument completely, because it comes from a benevolent belief in the bureaucrat's mind that he knows God's business much better than God knows it Himself.  He does not care to say openly that he really thinks that God Almighty &ldquo;slipped up&rdquo; when he instituted the family, that He should have consulted a competent civil servant before He proceeded to set up the family, which civil servant would prescribe that some angelic individual should go in every now and then and see that the parents were doing what the Almighty intended them to do.  I, being a simple creature, believe that God knew what He was about when He instituted the family.  I believe that He knew what He was about when He ordained that the father and mother should be charged with the responsibility of looking after their children.  I do not believe that any rational Oireachtas will seek to amend that arrangement.  Therefore, I say that our duty is not to go in and improve on God's handiwork but to provide the parents with the means whereby to discharge their divinely-appointed mission of bringing up their children properly within the family circle.  I want to provide that without the interference of the bureaucrats, however well-intentioned they may be.</P>

      <Col N="1469" /> That brings me to one very controversial element in the proposal I have to make.  I regard any scheme which involves the application of a means test as abnoxious.  The moment you have a means test, you have inquisition, inquiry and discouragement of any kind of help from friends or neighbours or relatives, because any little help a friend or neighbour may give is treated as means and the allowance proportionately reduced. You have this horrible business of the most intimate details of family life being inquired into and the parents being cross-heckled and harried so as to get information.  You have resentment because of the apparent inequalities that result from the treatment of one case as compared with another.</P>
    <P>If you are not to have a means test, the family allowance must be payable to every citizen of the State, from the millionaire to the crossing-sweeper.  I think it should be so paid.  I would abolish the income-tax allowance in respect of children and I would grant to every citizen of the State an equal family allowance in respect of his children, leaving it to the parents in each family, by their respective exertions and ability, to earn a larger income for the upbringing of their children if they are able to do so.  I would put the subsistence allowance for all children on the same basis and I would entitle every parent-citizen of the State to draw it without question, without investigation and without any stigma of charity or pauperism attaching to its receipt.</P>
    <P>All plans of this character are attractive at their first glance, until you begin to consider what they are going to cost and how they are going to be financed.  That is not quite an easy question but, in approaching it, we ought to bear in mind that a system of family allowances will abolish a great deal of public expenditure at present undertaken on behalf of the children of poor people.  For instance, one of the things it will take care of is the children's allowance in unemployment pay, and I do not want to depart from that without a word.  It often strikes me that one of the most poignant and grievous qualities of unemployment is <Col N="1470" /> the experience a married man has who entered into the responsibilities of matrimony with a full realisation of their magnitude, when he had a good job and could see his way to look after a family, when, through no fault of his own, he loses his job and slowly spends his savings in keeping the family together, until ultimately he reaches the day when he is dependent exclusively on his unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance, and, after his long day's search for work, comes home to find himself confronted, not with consolation or relief from the ardours of his day but with the spectacle of children, whom he was responsible for bringing into the world, and a dependent wife suffering not only the spiritual and psychological discomforts of the unemployed man's home, but the physical misery of hunger because he has not the wherewithal to buy them food.</P>
    <P>That, I believe, is a quality of the suffering of unemployment so horrifying that no conscious Christian community could endure its continuance very long, and I am suggesting to the House that if we had a system of family allowances operating, that additional burden of misery of the unemployed man would at least be relieved, and however he fared, he would know that, provided he left to his wife and children the allowance provided for them, though they might have no luxuries, they would at least never know the spectre of starvation and that whatever came, it would be there for them.</P>
    <P>Suffering of that character is very difficult to bear, if one has to bear it alone.  The misery of unemployment, the frustration of being unable to get a job, is a very great burden, even when one can carry it all oneself, but when, <i>nolens volens,</i> it extends itself to other and weaker shoulders, then it becomes almost unendurable.  One of the great merits of the proposal which Deputy Byrne and I put before the House now is that the unemployed man, faced with adversity, will at least have preserved his ability to bear his burden alone and not call on his wife and children to take their part in carrying it.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1471" /> What is it going to cost?  I am not in a position to put accurate figures before the House.  I have not got them, and, so far as I know, official figures have never been worked out in relation to this problem.  I understand that the Government has an inter-departmental committee operating, but they have reached no official conclusions.  They very kindly communicated to me, at the request of the Minister for Finance, such information as was at their disposal, but it was at that stage&mdash;this was some time ago&mdash;of a purely tentative character.  I could not attempt to quote that information and I do not want anybody to imagine that the figures I am submitting are figures over which any Government committee or Department stands.  They are as near as I can go from my inadequate statistical inquiry.</P>
    <P>I reckon that there are approximately 855,320 dependent children in the country&mdash;that was the position when the last census was taken&mdash;and if we were to provide a family allowance for every dependent child, whether the millionaire's child or the child of the crossing sweeper, it would cost £11,119,160 per annum, at 5/- per week.  If we fixed the rate of annual contribution at 3/- in respect of each child, the figures would be approximately £6,671,000.  In New Zealand and, I think, in Australia, although I am not so sure, the family allowance is not payable in respect of the first child.  It is payable only in respect of each child after the first, and, if we were to adopt that plan, of paying the allowance not to all the children but to all the children after the first child, we should have to deal with 575,000 children, and the annual cost at 5/- per week would be about £7,500,000, and, at 3/- per week, about £4,500,000.</P>
    <P>Those are substantial sums.  If we provide family allowances for every child, the savings to the Exchequer in respect of existing allowances, such as unemployment insurance allowances, unemployment assistance allowances, income-tax allowances, free food distribution, outdoor assistance, and widows' and orphans' pensions, would <Col N="1472" /> amount to about £2,000,000 per year, so that while the gross cost of giving it to every child would be £11,000,000, the net cost would be about £9,000,000 per annum.</P>
    <P>If you gave it to every child at 3/- a week, the cost would be £6,671,000, approximately, and the net cost would be in the order of £4,671,000.  I would give it to everyone, and I believe that if we had to raise, annually, a revenue of £10,000,000 for this purpose, the benefits that would accrue from it would be an ample compensation for that expenditure.  For instance, the great bulk of this money would be spent on the purchase of food&mdash;extra food that these families have to forego at present because they have not the money with which to buy it.  Of the food that would be thus purchased, a very large proportion would be produced in this country.  An immense additional market would be provided for butter, milk, eggs and meat&mdash;all commodities a sufficiency of which is not at present included in the dietary of our people.</P>
    <P>I believe that at the present moment there are hundreds of thousands of children&mdash;well, I should like to correct that, and say tens of thousands of children&mdash;in this country who are not getting enough milk to ensure their health.  I believe that there are thousands of expectant mothers in this country who are subsisting on a diet which is deficient in milk or in calcium intake and that, as a result, their children are bound to grow up in permanent ill-health, or crippled in one way or another.  I believe that that would be remedied by making it possible, through the provision of family allowances, for these mothers to buy milk, which they cannot afford to buy now.  I believe that the investment of this annual sum would result, in addition to the saving of the £2,000,000 which I have mentioned&mdash;because it would result in a far higher standard of health throughout the whole community in the course of ten or 15 years' time&mdash;in a consequent reduction in the charges for public health services that are necessary now as a result of the real destitution that obtains in the country, and I believe that, ultimately, we would reach a stage in which the <Col N="1473" /> vast system of subsidised housing, which at present exists, would become no longer necessary.  I believe that if we make, through family allowances, an adequate provision for every man, so as to enable him to provide for his children, the necessity of subsidising the building of houses out of taxation would disappear, because everybody, then, would be able to pay an economic rent.  For instance, you could have houses designed for various types of families, such as married couples without children, or married couples with one child, or with two or three children, and you could have varying rents fixed according to the accommodation required.  I think that such a scheme of family allowances would be sufficient to enable an individual to pay whatever the cost of building might be, and I think you are bound to fix the family allowance at a level which would enable that to be done.  Unless you do that, there is something manifestly inequitable.</P>
    <P>There is no reason why a man in this country who works, let us say, 48 hours a week, should not be able to obtain from the community a share of the national income to enable him to feed, clothe and house his family. And if he does secure such a share in the national income, then the necessity for subsidising housing and various other forms of relief would disappear, and economies could be effected in other relief services that now exist. Now, I do not want to advance this as of fundamental importance in considering this matter, but I think it is worth while bearing in mind that one of the things that was discovered during the last great inflation, and the subsequent slump, by competent economic observers, was that the slump was not precipitated by any sudden disappearance of wealth.  What happened was that income began to dry up in a vast number of small homes, and the moment that began, they stopped spending.  That wave of caution spread from the small homes to the middle classes, and from the middle classes to the rich owners of property until, eventually, the spending capacity of the people collapsed.  That was the appalling slump which devastated the United States of America and Great <Col N="1474" /> Britain, and which, I must say, to the credit of precautions taken by Deputy Cosgrave, wrought such little havoc in this country, because, as a result of his efforts, our people managed to escape most of the terrible consequences of that slump.  In view of that, I say that the maintenance of a stable purchasing power all over the masses of the people of this country is an economic asset that is worth bearing in mind when one is considering the merits of such a proposal as I am now putting forward.</P>
    <P>Now, this resolution in Deputy Byrne's name and mine, calls for the immediate introduction of a scheme of this kind.  Of course, this is a time in which public expenditure has reached great heights, as a result of the war situation which surrounds us, and, naturally, people will be reluctant to contemplate launching into a scheme which will involve an expenditure of £10,000,000 a year, or at least £8,000,000 a year, in addition to the present Budget charge.  I would not dream of suggesting to Oireachtas Eireann that in normal times, when currencies were stabilised and one was constrained to take a long-term view, we should embark upon an enterprise of this kind on borrowed money, but these are not normal times. We are living in times when the value of money, in two or three or five years from to-day, is very doubtful.  It is very hard to forecast what will happen, or what currency will be worth in the post-war world. The result, in the post-war world, may be a re-valuation of money on a basis that it is now very hard to forecast. Certain it is, however, that with Great Britain spending £5,000,000,000 a year and with America spending £8,000,000,000 a year, the pound and the dollar are not going to have, post-war, the value that they had pre-war, so far as the purchasing of commodities is concerned.  Some re-valuation will have to be undertaken, and, in that period of re-valuation, the man who has converted his currency into fixed assets can contemplate the future with equanimity, because, whatever may happen to the currency, his assets will still remain.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1475" /> In connection with a recent Vote, I was advocating the spending of money on the improvement of land and providing amenities for the urban population.  I now want to suggest to Oireachtas Eireann that one of the most precious assets we can purchase at any time is a healthy nation.  If a necromancer were to appear before us and were to say to us: &ldquo;Your next generation will be made up of healthy men and women, or I can make them all cripples, or half of them cripples and half of them healthy, but I warn you that if I so arrange that the next generation will be all crippled with disease, in the wake of that decision there will come want and destitution, consequent upon thousands of persons being unable to provide for themselves, and there will ensue on that want and destitution vice, squalor and crime; but if, on the other hand, I ordain that your next generation should be a generation of healthy men and women, with consequent progress for your nation and the advantages, material and spiritual, that must result from such a development, what price is this House prepared to pay for that?&rdquo; Will we simply say: &ldquo;No, we will take a middle course, and have half cripples and half sound men and women, because it would cost too much to have 100 per cent. healthy men and women&rdquo;?  Is there any Deputy here who would argue that we should buy a generation of cripples, or that prudence should deter us from the extravagance of purchasing a generation of healthy men and women&mdash;that we should take a middle course and, by paying a moderate sum, bring into the world a generation composed of half cripples and half healthy persons?</P>
    <P>There is no necromancer here; there is no one to put this issue with that certainty before us; but there is that choice before us as certain as we are in this Chamber.  We are the necromancers in this situation; we have to discharge our duty and determine the risks that may be required in order to save those who must be cripples if they have not enough whereon to live now.  Prudent economists may determine that it is better to let these children <Col N="1476" /> die.  I do not want to set against that any appeal to sentiment; I do not want to allege, against a person who makes that proposition, that he is heartless or indifferent.  But, on his own ground, I want to meet him and to tell him that economically he is a fool.  He is in exactly the same position as the wretched miser who starves himself to death in order to stuff his bed-tick with bank notes.</P>
    <P>In normal times, without the excessive defence burdens which are at present imposed upon us by the circumstances in which we find ourselves, I would advocate the raising by taxation of whatever revenue would be necessary to finance this plan.  In the situation in which we do find ourselves I advocate the borrowing of money now wherewith to purchase a healthy generation in the years to come.  I advocate the launching of this plan now, the purchase with borrowed money of the certainty that no child born into this community is going to be reared to perish, or to linger on, a cripple because there is no money with which to buy food.  There is nobody in this House who is not aware that there are thousands so circumstanced at the present time; there is nobody here who is not aware that there are thousands of children who are going to die, or who can only survive as cripples, for want of food.</P>

      <P>It is not what has happened as what is going to happen that matters so much.  Every man makes mistakes.  What matters is whether men learn by their mistakes or go on making the same mistakes.  There is no use dwelling on the fact that many have died.  This is not the only community in which persons have died through that cause.  The fundamental point is, was it wise and good to let them die? I think this community has awakened to the fact that it is neither good nor wise so to let them die.  Let us give effect to that discovery.  Can it be done now?  I say it can.  Should it be done now?  I say it must, and I would like to see it done, not as a feature in the programme of any political Party, but rather as the unanimous resolve of <Col N="1477" /> this House, coming from no Party, but coming rather as the joint responsibility of all of us.</P>
      <P>I think it is right to say there is not any Party in this House which would reject this plan on the ground that it was not good value to purchase children's lives for money.  There may be men here, and there may be women, who believe that the scheme adumbrated by Deputy Byrne and myself will not work.  If there are, I should like to hear them, because I want a chance at the conclusion of this debate of answering them.  If the Government accept this motion, there will be no need to divide the House; but if they do not accept it, then Deputy Byrne and myself will divide the House on it, and I ask every Deputy who, in that event, will walk into the &ldquo;No&rdquo; Lobby, to say, before he goes in, why he is going in, because I know that we have an answer to whatever argument could conceivably induce him to go into that Lobby.  I suggest that it will be ignorance that will bring him into the wrong Lobby.</P>
      <P>Deputy Byrne and I are anxious to hear any objections to the proposals we are making.  We have the answers if only Deputies will ask us for them and the Deputy who walks into the wrong Lobby because he is too lazy to ask the answers is truly deserving of public opprobrium.  We want to hear the arguments against this plan, if there are any, and I submit we are in a position to answer all those arguments. We are prepared to give every Deputy an opportunity of demonstrating before the country what he thinks of the merits of our arguments, and then the people of the country will have an opportunity of demonstrating what they think of the merits of Deputies who decide against the proposal.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>On the 4th March I addressed the following question to the Minister for Lands:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;To ask the Minister for Lands to state the reason for the failure of the Land Commission to divide the lands on the Waller estate, Moystown, Belmont, Offaly, this year; the total acreage of land involved; whether the lands were recently let by public auction for tillage and grazing purposes and the conditions, if any, attaching to the lettings, the total acreage let for tillage and grazing purposes, respectively, the net profit to be derived from same by the Commissioners for the period of letting, and whether any undertaking has been given that the persons to whom the land was let will be given first preference for portions of this estate whenever same is being divided.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>The reply was:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;As the Land Commission only took possession of the Waller estate (comprising 597 acres) on the 2nd of February, 1943, it is not possible to have a scheme prepared for the division of the lands this year.  A portion of the lands was recently let by public auction for tillage and grazing on the usual conditions of auction for such lettings &mdash; approximately 100 acres for tillage, 349 acres for grazing.  The balance of 148 acres of callow land will be let for meadow in due course.  It is not possible to state the net profit (if any) derived from letting the lands until the various items of debit and credit are accounted for, but the aim of such lettings is to provide income as a setoff against the interest payable from the appointed day on the land bonds representing the purchase money of the estate.  No undertaking has been given that the persons to whom the lands are let will be given preference for allotments on this estate when it comes to be divided.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Then I went on to ask the acting Minister if he could state definitely whether the lands were actually let by public auction, and he was unable to <Col N="1479" /> give a definite assurance that that had been done.  I also asked him, in a supplementary question, whether there was any report of any unauthorised interference with the activities of the Land Commission officials endeavouring to let the lands by public auction as previously advertised.  The acting Minister was unable to give satisfactory answers to these supplementary questions.  Consequently, I felt bound to raise this matter on the adjournment, whenever the Minister himself would be available, and I gave notice of my intention to do so, as will be seen from the Official Report, page 952.</P>
    <P>As stated in the reply, the lands were advertised to be let by public auction.  I hope the Minister will agree with me that it is very desirable that lands coming into the possession of the State, when advertised to be let by public auction, should be so let in the way in which an auction is usually held.  Following the information that this land had come into the possession of the Land Commission, on a particular day, or very shortly after that, a Fianna Fáil Deputy for this constituency proceeded to the area concerned. He secured possession of the local school and invited a number of selected persons to meet him there.</P>
    <P>A body was set up and styled locally as a committee for the purpose of endeavouring to purchase the lands that were advertised to be let by public auction on the 24th February.  This self-styled committee held three or four meetings.  On each occasion, they were lucky enough to be able to get the local schoolhouse for the purpose of the meeting.  The Minister for Education, who is also the Minister for Lands, will be surprised to know that, on one of these occasions, by carrying on their meeting all night, they prevented a public lecture being held, which was advertised to be addressed by an inspector of the Department of Agriculture.  That inspector, who had travelled a long distance by motor car, had to return to the place from which he came, without being able to deliver his public lecture, because this self-styled committee <Col N="1480" /> set up to secure these lands remained in session until midnight.</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister quite definitely&mdash;and I am certain he will give me a straightforward answer&mdash;if a public auction was, in fact, held in the way that he knows a public auction should be held in a case of this or any other kind.</P>
    <P>I am reliably informed, that on the date for which the public auction was advertised, three Land Commission officials, accompanied by the auctioneer, arrived there.  The committee previously selected by the Fianna Fáil Deputy made transport arrangements to bring the Fianna Fáil Deputy concerned, to see that he also was present at the public auction.  The three Land Commission officials, the auctioneer, and the Deputy had some private consultation, which nobody but the members of the committee and those concerned are aware of in the district; and, at a certain stage of the proceedings, the Fianna Fáil Deputy&mdash;I am informed, at any rate&mdash;in the hearing of a sergeant of the Gárda and three or four Gárdaí, the auctioneer and the Land Commission officials, publicly stated&mdash;though I am not able to give the reason for it&mdash;that: &ldquo;If the committee do not get the place at their terms to-day, there will be no sale.&rdquo; It is quite evident that the committee, in consultation with the Deputy, had agreed to offer a certain price per acre for these lands, and a warning had been issued by the members of the committee previous to the date of the public auction, that nobody in the district who had any respect for himself should bid against the committee or outbid them.</P>
    <P>That, if true, is a very serious interference with the rights of the citizens of the district in their desire&mdash;as many of them were desirous&mdash;to bid for this State property.  I have here in my possession communications written to me from and on behalf of a number of smallholders, small farmers and landless men who, by threats of that kind, were prevented from bidding for that land.  I would ask the Minister to state, when he is replying, whether he has any information in his possession <Col N="1481" /> that a threat of the kind referred to was made in the hearing of members of the Gárda Síochána, Land Commission officials and the auctioneer, and if he approves of that kind of activity on the part of any Deputy in this House, no matter with what Party he may be associated.</P>
    <P>I received a communication from the secretary of this self-styled committee, advising me that I had been misinformed as to what took place on that particular occasion.  I do not know how the secretary came to know what I had been told about this whole matter, but, at any rate, in his desire to give me some information, he makes a very candid admission.  He states that &ldquo;almost the whole estate was purchased by the committee&rdquo; and then goes on to say that &ldquo;the tillage was allotted to labourers and small farmers.&rdquo;  I have information here&mdash; and I am sure the Minister has information to confirm it&mdash;that it was not let to small farmers nor to landless men, and that, on the contrary, it was let to very large farmers and graziers well known in the district.</P>
    <P>I have here a list of a large number of people who were lucky enough to secure portions of this land, as a result of the intervention of this committee selected by the Fianna Fáil Deputy. Number one has already a holding of 150 acres of his own and grazes a good deal of land in the district, taking it by conacre; Number two has 100 acres of his own; Number three has 70 acres; Number four, who is a trader, has 50 acres; Number five has 70 acres; Number six has between 50 and 60 acres; and so on.  Some of these people are of the same name: whether they belong to the same family clique or not, I do not know.  The secretary of the committee who, apparently, was lucky enough to take control of these proceedings says that the tillage was allotted to labourers and small farmers.  I have a list of names of smallholders and landless men who would not be allowed to bid, who were prevented by threats from doing so at this auction.</P>
    <P>In the question that I addressed to the Minister on the 4th instant I deliberately asked him to state the <Col N="1482" /> revenue derived from the lettings, because I was anxious to find out if there was a likelihood of a loss on lettings of land which is the property of a Department of State.  If there is any loss on such lettings it should fall on the graziers and big farmers in the district but, as a result of the activities of a certain Fianna Fáil Deputy, and the self-styled committee, the taxpayers will have to bear the loss.  I think it is a scandal that any member of this House should be associated with activities of that kind.  Certain smallholders, landless men and the public generally were deprived of their constitutional right to attend a public auction to bid for property of the State.  I feel fairly certain that the Minister does not approve of that kind of activity nor do the Land Commission officials, a fairly large number of whom are engaged in work of this kind, although we are told day after day there is not a sufficient number now at the disposal of the Department.</P>
    <P>In my opinion these three competent and fair-minded officials were deprived, by the intervention of this Deputy and the self-styled committee, of the opportunity of carrying out their duties in the manner in which, I believe, they would carry them out if they were not hampered by uncalled-for and, I believe, unauthorised interference. I regret the necessity of having to raise a matter of this kind in this House.  In my 20 years' experience it has never happened in my constituency before and it is not unreasonable for me to ask the Minister, in view of what happened, for an assurance that it will not happen again as far as he and the Land Commission officials are concerned.  I would not have objected if the auctioneer or the Land Commission officials, in view of the uncalled-for interference of the Deputy and the self-styled committee, had postponed the auction.  I will be satisfied if the Minister will give an assurance that this kind of thing will not happen again.</P>
    <P>In a supplementary question that I addressed to the acting Minister on the date in question I asked him to get a report from the Guards, who were at <Col N="1483" /> the auction, as to whether there was interference of an uncalled-for nature on this occasion.  I should like to know if the Department of Justice was asked to furnish a report and, if so, will the Minister be good enough to give the gist of it?  I appeal to the Minister&mdash; I doubt if it is necessary to do so&mdash;to put an end to this kind of activity.  It is the first time that it has happened in my constituency.  It is a constitutional right, and I will see to it, as far as I can, that citizens will be allowed to exercise their rights, and that in the case of a public auction of State property everybody who is anxious will be allowed to attend and be free from interference.</P>
    <P>I do not think any useful purpose will be served by bringing in other matters that I have been asked to drag into this discussion.  My purpose will be served if I get the necessary assurance of the Minister that he disapproves of what has been done by the Deputy concerned in this case and that, as far as he is able, nothing of the kind will occur again, at any rate in my constituency.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. D. Hogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I am the Deputy to whom Deputy Davin refers in connection with the letting of land near Ferbane. I am sorry I did not hear all Deputy Davin's remarks.  I heard a certain amount and for the information of the House I should like to give my point of view which, I think, is quite different from that outlined by Deputy Davin.  I went to the area concerned at the request of a number of local people, small uneconomic holders and labourers, who wished to get portion of this land for tillage.  I went to a meeting which was called to discuss the question and anybody in the locality who wanted tillage attended that meeting.  It was not a political meeting.  Everybody was free to attend. The people there considered that they had a right to get a portion of this land for tillage, as well as a large portion for grazing.  It was decided that I should attend the auction in conjunction with four others whose names I can give to Deputy Davin if he wishes.  They are representative people from the locality and none of <Col N="1484" /> them wanted any land for tillage, grazing or for any other purpose.  Very reluctantly I agreed to attend the auction and to make a bid on behalf of the uneconomic holders in order to get as much as possible of the land for tillage and the remainder for grazing for the benefit of people in the area.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I attended the auction with a very representative committee, and the auctioneer put up the lands.  I told the auctioneer that the amount he was offering for tillage was not sufficient to meet the requirements of people on whose behalf I spoke, and pointed out that if he extended the area for tillage I would make a bid on behalf of the uneconomic holders. After some time he agreed to give 100 statute acres for tillage purposes, which I took on behalf of the local people at £4 an acre, a price with which the Land Commission inspector said he was perfectly satisfied.  It was intended to divide the land amongst about 60 people, some getting one acre, and the remainder two acres, and to put the land into cultivation.  That has since been done, and the money due on the land paid to the Land Commission, with the result that there are now about 100 statute acres under wheat.  The remainder of this farm adjoins the River Shannon, and during a great portion of the year is subject to flooding.  The Land Commission had about 200 acres there divided into 50-acre lots, and on behalf of the local people I took about 200 acres for the grazing of cattle of everybody in the parish who wants grazing without any discrimination whether a man was a small farmer or a labourer.  Large farmers were not to have the option of putting cattle on these lands.  A fair price was paid for the land, £3 per acre for one lot, £2 10s. for another lot, and for the portion adjoining the river, that is subject to flooding, £2 an acre.  There was no intimidation at the auction.  About ten Civic Guards were at the auction.  I did not use intimidation on behalf of anybody.  The sale was a perfectly open one, at which anybody who wished could bid.  As a matter of fact, when 100 acres were got for tillage, and 100 acres for grazing, I went back to the crowd that had <Col N="1485" /> collected at the auction, and told them that they were free to bid for the remainder of the land.</P>
    <P>I would be sorry to do anything which was not fair and honourable. The Minister for Lands might possibly have a grievance, because it might be said that more money could be got for the land only for my interference.  But, apart from that side of it, I think there could not have been a better day's work done than to take a practically derelict farm, put 100 acres of it under wheat cultivation and the balance of about 300 acres in grazing for the people in the locality.  I offer no apology to Deputy Davin for anything I have done.  I will meet him anywhere in the constituency to discuss the matter.  He mentioned that there are other aspects he was asked to deal with, but would not.  I challenge him now to make any allegation he wishes and I will meet him any place he wishes to discuss it.</P>

      <P>The usual practice of the Land Commission, in cases where estates remain on their hands which they find they will not be able to divide in a reasonable time, is to set the lands by public auction. It is the usual procedure, and I think it is a very satisfactory way of letting land.  It ensures that the State gets a good return, that the matter is regulated according to supply and demand, and most people will agree that it is the fairest way.  I have sufficient experience as a Minister to know that you will have cases of dissatisfaction on the part of the smallholders.  As a matter of fact, I gave instructions to the Land Commission inspectors to facilitate smallholders as much as possible.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this particular case, representations had been received from another Deputy in the area before the auction intimating that he wished, in regard to the estates in the constituency in the hands of the Land Commission, that they should be let in small portions so that the larger farmers who were bidding would not <Col N="1486" /> secure all of them.  His object, as he states here in his letter, was that the land should be let to small farmers for tillage, for meadow, and to have them stocked with calves, cows, and young horses the property of smallholders who have put nearly all their own land in tillage.  He recommended that, as far as possible, this practice should be adopted.  It was as a result of his suggestion that the Land Commission inspector tried to facilitate the local people.</P>
    <P>I think there is no question but that the lands were let by public auction. What actually happened was that Deputy Hogan, as he has explained, made an offer.  At the suggestion of the auctioneer, the matter was discussed with the inspector and it was finally agreed that a larger proportion of tillage should be made available than was originally intended, and this was done at a rate of £4 per acre.  The remainder of the land was then set by public auction.  I have not the particulars of the persons who got it, but I understand they were local people.  I have no evidence that there was any interference.  In fact, the police report would go to show that the proceedings passed off in a very orderly manner.  The police state that there was no intimidation and no incidents, so that I do not think there is any evidence, so far as I am acquainted with the position, that any interference of that kind took place. No doubt there was an organisation there, as Deputy Hogan has explained.</P>
    <P>It is not an unusual thing, as I think Deputy Davin knows, for smallholders to approach Deputies and ask them to try to secure land for them for tillage.  I am not conversant with the local conditions, and I have not a list of the persons to whom the land was set.  But the object of the Land Commission inspector in facilitating the arrangement that was come to to let a larger area of the land for tillage was to ensure that every smallholder in the area who needed tillage should get it.  If smallholders were excluded, I think it is very unfortunate. If that is the case, it would appear that those persons who sought to get the land for themselves, and I <Col N="1487" /> would have a good deal of sympathy with them as smallholders, excluded other persons who were presumably entitled.  Deputy Davin says that is so.  I have no proof that it is so, but he says that it is so.  I do not think that we can go back on the fact that the land is now let and I hope that nobody will think that the Land Commission could be in any way privy to any intimidation of bidders or to any arrangement which would prevent the public who attend auctions from bidding in the ordinary way.</P>

      <P>I am only explaining that we like to facilitate smallholders. Smallholders are generally very difficult to handle.  It is difficult to know how you can arrange theoretically for a public auction which is supposed to be free.  It may not always be free. There may be no threats, no open intimidation, but so long as there is an organisation there, no doubt some people may not wish to come forward and bid.  I do not know to what extent that has been the case but, as I have said, the police report is to the effect that the proceedings on that occasion were carried out in an orderly manner. I do not think there is anything further than can be usefully said on the matter.</P>

      <P>As the person responsible for the policy, while I have to safeguard the revenue, I think it would be a definite hardship and deprivation if an effort were not made to facilitate local people.  When they are <i>bona fide</i> smallholders and there is a reasonable case, we try to meet them, because undoubtedly a good deal of discontent and possibly more serious trouble might occur if land were parcelled out in very large parcels, possibly to persons living outside the area.  I think it is good policy to try to accommodate the smallholders to some extent and possibly even to let land to them at a somewhat lower price.  However, I can see that there is a lot to be said in another direction and the matter has to be balanced up in a particular case.  I had no knowledge of this matter except that one Deputy had written in the terms I have stated and, acting on his advice, the local inspectors were prepared to facilitate the local people and the arrangement was come to.</P>
