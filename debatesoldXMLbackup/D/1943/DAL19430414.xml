      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies (a) whether he is aware that part of the lands of Cooleragh West, in the Barony of Clane and County of Kildare (registered on Folio 657, County Kildare), the property of Mr. Thomas Langan, was acquired over a year ago for the purpose of erecting a camp for turf workers, and that no offer of compensation has yet been made to Mr. Langan: (b) if he will state the exact date of such acquisition, and when he expects to be in a position to make an offer of compensation.</P>

      <P>Possession of part of the lands of Cooleragh West, County <Col N="1886" /> Kildare, containing 9 acres 1 rood, the property of Mr. Thomas Langan, was taken on the 8th January, 1942, in connection with the erection of a camp for the accommodation of workers employed on the Government turf production scheme.</P>
      <P>In connection with the payment of compensation, arrangements are being made for the opening of negotiations with Mr. Langan possibly with a view to the purchase outright of the area taken over.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>Will the Minister bear in mind that there are a number of Mr. Langans all over County Kildare in precisely the same position, and will he therefore make a special effort to ensure that some reasonable offer of compensation is made to these people as soon as possible?  They live in an area which is rather poor, and they have to try to eke out an existence with whatever small quantity of turbary they have.  They are suffering serious loss through the acquisition of the turbary, and will the Minister ease their difficulties by having the matter dealt with expeditiously?</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Possession of part of the lands of Cooleragh West, in the the Barony of Clane and County of Kildare the property of Mr. Thomas Langan, was taken on the 13th March, 1943, for the purpose of providing a site for a road to serve an extensive area of the Timahoe bog, in connection with the Government turf production scheme.</P>
      <P>In all such cases consideration is given to the relevant circumstances, including the question of hardship to the owner of the lands, and in the light of the necessity to provide the maximum possible output of turf.  In the particular case referred to by the Deputy, the measures necessary to ensure that the owner will not be cut off from a water supply are under examination.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>

Every effort will be made to maintain production in slate quarries, but, owing to the serious restriction in the imports of explosives, it will be possible to make available to all users, including quarry owners, only a proportion of the explosives used in normal times.</P>

      <P>In January, 1940, Mr. Peter Murphy was allotted under purchase agreement an area 8a. 3r. 25p. in the townland of Cadamstown, on the More O'Ferrall estate.  On 8th May, 1942, a claim for £18 compensation for the loss of a heifer was received from Mr. Murphy and on the 21st idem he was informed that the matter was being investigated.  Mr. Murphy's solicitors wrote on his behalf on 14th December, 1942.</P>
      <P>The Land Commission after full investigation considered they were not liable for the loss stated to have been sustained by the allottee, and decided not to pay compensation.  Mr. Murphy was notified by letter to this effect on 15th December, 1942, and on the 23rd idem a copy of the letter was forwarded to his solicitors.  The Land Commission are not prepared to reopen this matter.</P>

It has either the responsibility of organising or facilitating the importation of that commodity, of regulating its distribution, or of controlling its price.  It would be impracticable to deal, even briefly, with all of the many activities of the Department.  It is for that reason that I propose to confine my introductory remarks to the general aspects of the supply position, or to commodities which are of exceptional importance.  I can assure the Dáil that I shall be only too willing to deal in detail with any matter which may be raised by Deputies.  It is my desire to give to the House and to the <Col N="1902" /> country the fullest possible information concerning the position in respect of our essential supplies.  If, therefore, I do not, in these introductory remarks, deal with any matter with which an individual Deputy may be concerned, it will be my intention to deal with that particular matter later when it has been raised by that Deputy.  On that basis I can, I think, request Deputies to deal, in this discussion, with the work of the Department of Supplies in a constructive way and, because the fullest possible information will be available to them either now or later, to have full regard in their remarks to the realities of our situation.</P>
    <P>Generally speaking, the supply position was maintained better than we were entitled to hope at this time last year.  That not unsatisfactory result was due, partly, to the good management of and our comparative good fortune in the operation of our shipping facilities, partly to the success of the efforts of the Government to expand the home production of foodstuffs and essential industrial materials and, partly, to the increased efficiency resulting from the wider experience, and an improved and enlarged organisation, of the Department of Supplies.</P>
    <P>In the matter of foodstuffs, our position worsened in respect of sugar but improved substantially in respect of flour.  The position in respect of clothing has deteriorated, but arrangements for the control of the utilisation and distribution of available supplies were improved.  There has been a steady and alarming worsening of our supply of petroleum products which constituted the gravest of all our problems.  The position in respect of industrial materials has remained reasonably good, and, in some respects, has greatly improved.  The outlook for the coming year, while uncertain, is not bad, except in certain limited respects. Probably the wheat situation will remain secure, the sugar position will improve, the butter position will be eased by the more effective control of production and distribution, the transport situation will grow in acuteness to the dimensions of a crisis, the clothing situation will disimprove, generally, <Col N="1903" /> but may be better in some respects. Turf supplies for the non-turf area will, on the basis of the present ration, be reasonably secure, and industrial materials will improve in certain important respects.</P>
    <P>Our comparatively favourable situation now, as compared with our anticipations of 12 months ago, is not due solely to the efforts which have been made to expand home production. During the course of the year we were able to import considerable quantities of necessary supplies from abroad. Our difficulties in maintaining imports of all commodities, or of procuring the quantities necessary to avoid a scarcity here, were, however, due to causes other than the scarcity of shipping. While the shortage of ocean-going shipping has continued to limit our ability to obtain essential supplies from abroad, a new difficulty emerged during the course of the past 12 months by reason of the imposition of restrictions by the exporting countries upon the release of these materials, particularly in the case of the United States of America.  Our importers experienced steadily increasing difficulties in securing the necessary permits to obtain the release of goods we needed from these countries.</P>
    <P>The shipping situation was, of course, the basis of all the problems of maintaining imports.  During the year which ended on the 1st April, only a very small number of foreign ships arrived in our ports.  During that period we received seven cargoes of petroleum products, brought upon British tankers, but, apart from these, no other foreign ocean-going shipping was available except two small ships of Panamanian nationality which were chartered for voyages to Lisbon.  One of these ships was lost on a voyage in September last.  We had, therefore, to rely almost exclusively upon the ships of Irish Shipping, Limited, and on smaller ships owned by three Irish shipping companies of which there were eleven at the outbreak of the war and of which there are now only six left.  It is, I think, appropriate at this stage to refer to the loss with all hands <Col N="1904" /> during the year of the &ldquo;Irish Pine.&rdquo; It was an incident which brought home to the people of this country the risks to which our shipping services are subjected. The loss of the crew of that vessel brought forth a spontaneous demonstration from the whole people of sympathy with the relatives of the members of the crew.  It will help the Dáil to realise how narrow is our margin of safety when I mention that the loss of that one vessel reduced the carrying capacity of all ships under our control by 10 per cent.</P>
    <P>Since the incorporation of Irish Shipping, Limited, its ships have brought 514,000 tons of imports of priceless value to this country during the past year.  Smaller ships on the Lisbon route carried 55,000 tons of cargo comprising wheat, pyrites for the manufacture of superphosphate, coffee and cocoa beans, vegetable oils and fats, newsprint, citrous fruits, medical and surgical supplies, machinery and other essential goods.  It is hoped during the present year to ship sufficient wheat to leave a small surplus with which to face the coming cereal year, to ship also a quantity of sugar from the West Indies, despite the long and hazardous voyage that is involved, to ship a substantial tonnage of phosphate rock which, although small in relation to our normal needs, will be of special importance, to bring here considerable quantities of tobacco and newsprint and smaller quantities of many important industrial materials. All the transport available to us on the Atlantic route is, of course, confined to essential products, and there is no space to spare on our ships for the carriage of non-essential goods. Very many applications for space upon these ships, received from importers of various commodities during the year, have had to be refused, arising out of the decision to confine these ships to the transport of goods which we regard as essential to the life of the community.</P>
    <P>Dealing with the various classes of commodities which are of special importance, I wish to take firstly foodstuffs. <Col N="1905" /> The most important foodstuff is, of course, wheat.  At this time last year, as Deputies will remember, our stocks of wheat were very low. When the Dáil was discussing the Estimate for the Department of Supplies a large part of the time was devoted to debating the flour and bread situation then existing.  The deliveries of flour had been curtailed and the formal rationing of bread appeared at that time to be unavoidable. As a result of the arrangements made, however, normal conditions were restored much earlier than we had hoped.  In fact, by June, 1942, deliveries of flour from the mills were proceeding on a normal basis.  Up to date, from the harvest of 1942 263,000 tons of green wheat have been delivered to the flour mills.  I think the maximum quantity we can now expect to receive from last year's harvest is 270,000 tons.  Last year the quantity of wheat delivered to the flour millers was 220,000 tons.</P>
    <P>Deputies will notice a certain peculiarity about these figures.  The quantity of wheat grown in the country last year certainly exceeded 500,000 tons. Making all due allowance for the retention of wheat for seed purposes and for the feeding of members of farmers' families, there still appears to be an inexplicable deficiency in the quantity of wheat made available for flour milling.  A similar situation arose last year.  It may be that there is some factor in the situation which has not been taken fully into account; but, upon the basis of our experience this year, it is obvious that an increase in the acreage under wheat of nearly 100,000 acres would be necessary to give us from home sources alone the full quantity of wheat which would enable us to meet all the flour and bread requirements of the country without imports.  The total requirements of wheat for the financial year which ended on the 31st March were 342,000 tons and during that period 147,000 tons were imported.  The farmer's price for the wheat is 50/- per barrel, as Deputies are aware.  That price represents a cost of 57/2 for dried millable wheat delivered to the flour mills.  The present price of imported wheat delivered at Irish ports, with <Col N="1906" /> cost, insurance, and freight paid, is about 50/7 per barrel.</P>
    <P>In the case of sugar, it became evident in the late spring of last year that, in the light of the decreased acreage sown with sugar beet, the ration of three-quarters of a pound of sugar per head per week which was then current could not be maintained and, therefore, the ration was reduced in August to half a pound per head per week.  The stocks of sugar at present in hands will enable that ration to be maintained until the commencement of the next sugar production season.  For the purpose of preserving the maximum employment possible, deliveries of sugar to manufacturers needing sugar in their processes of manufacture are maintained at 80 per cent. of the normal; while, in the case of the jam manufacturers, because of the difficulties created by the scarcity of butter, the higher price prevailing for butter, and the disappearance of margarine, normal deliveries are maintained.  This year, as the House, I think, is aware, a substantially increased acreage of beet has been contracted for, and, assuming a normal harvest and the safe arrival of the sugar which has been purchased in the West Indies, it will be possible to consider increasing the sugar ration before the end of the year.</P>
    <P>During the past year allocations of tea from the United Kingdom have been received regularly on the basis of 25 per cent. of deliveries to this country during the datum period, the 12 months which ended in June, 1939. The House will remember from previous discussions that Tea Importers, Limited, a company which the Government set up for the purpose of purchasing tea, arranged during 1941 to buy in India some 12,000,000 lbs. of tea.  Only a proportion of that tea, however, had reached this country when the extension of the war in the Far East made further shipments impossible.  I decided then that a conservative policy in respect of tea was necessary in view of the general uncertainty as to the situation in the Far East.  But it was decided to release some of the tea which had been imported by Tea Importers, Limited, for the purpose of increasing <Col N="1907" /> the ration to 1 oz. per week during the winter months and to keep it at ¾ of an oz. per week since the beginning of the present month.  If a conservative policy is followed and assuming a continuance of the present allocation from the United Kingdom, it should be possible to maintain the present ration for a reasonable time or, alternatively, again to increase the ration to 1 oz. per head during the winter months, for which course there is much to be said because it is during that period that supplies of milk are at their lowest.</P>
    <P>In the case of butter the situation during the year was not satisfactory. The quantities which were produced by the creameries in 1942 and 1941 were 615,000 cwts. and 663,000 cwts. respectively. The average monthly consumption in 1941 was 41,000 cwts., and in 1942, 51,000 cwts.  To put it otherwise, in 1942 the production of butter within the country decreased by 48,000 cwts., but the consumption increased by 126,000 cwts.  A serious shortage occurred in Dublin around September last and rationing was introduced in that area.  At the same time, Orders were made by the Minister for Agriculture restricting deliveries from the creameries to other parts of the country so as to spread the available reserves of stocks over the whole winter period.  I have received many proposals for the introduction of formal butter rationing into other parts of the country outside Dublin.  It is only in Dublin that formal rationing operates at the moment.  The difficulty of rationing butter in rural areas and in country towns arises, as most Deputies will see, from the impracticability of bringing supplies of farmers' butter under control.  It is intended, however, to avail of the period in this year when production will exceed current requirements to bring into operation a formal control of the consumption of creamery butter in the whole area of the State and to take such measures as are necessary to ensure the conservation of an adequate supply in cold storage for next winter.</P>
    <P>In connection with the scarcity of butter, frequent references are made to <Col N="1908" /> the position in respect of the supply of cooking fats and oils.  Although in normal times in this country we had an exportable surplus of animal fats, because of the disappearance of margarine and also by reason of the requirements of industry, the demand for animal fats now exceeds the supply. The shortage of fats here is not as keenly felt as in other European countries, and our problem is mainly one of making cheap fats available for the poorer sections of the population. To control the situation, all the fat melters, other than butchers producing lard and dripping for retail sale, have been licensed, and it has been made illegal to use edible fat for purposes other than human consumption. Substantial quantities of fats normally classified as inedible have been refined at Drogheda to produce a high-class edible fat which is being put on sale in areas where there is found to be a grave shortage of cooking fats.  During the Christmas period 20 tons of Drogheda fat were placed on sale in the poorer areas of Dublin and further quantities have recently been released for distribution in the same area.  It was at first proposed to confine this fat to persons who were prepared to take it in lieu of their butter ration or some proportion of their butter ration, but there was little demand for it on that basis, although it was available at 9d. and 11d. per lb.  It is now being released at the rate of 12 tons per week and shopkeepers have been asked to confine it to their poorer customers.</P>
    <P>Complaints have been published in the Press from time to time that fats are going to waste in public abattoirs and private slaughterhouses.  I have had these complaints investigated.  The investigation has established that there is no serious waste except perhaps in some small slaughterhouses which are located so far away from any melting plant that it is uneconomic to collect their rougher fats for melting.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned already that the gravest of the problems which we will face this year arise under the head of transport.  I have frequently in the past expressed the view that members of the Dáil, and some members of the <Col N="1909" /> public, have failed to appreciate fully the gravity of our situation in respect of transport services.  In the case of petrol, against a normal requirement of petrol of about 44,000,000 gallons per year, we received 17,000,800 gallons in 1941, 13,750,000 gallons in 1942, and in the present year we have been notified to expect a further and considerable reduction in the quantity available to us.  These figures will, I think, help to bring home to the House the need for confining allocations of petrol to essential purposes and also the impossibility of meeting the many demands for petrol for various purposes which are expressed by Deputies from time to time.  Furthermore, there is a possibility, nearly strong enough to be a probability, that for periods either long or short during the present year there will be a complete cessation of petrol deliveries. Already in this year there was a period in which we were faced with the prospect of complete exhaustion of stocks.  Orders restricting the public transport services and enforcing other drastic reductions in petrol consumption were prepared and were about to be brought into operation when the fortuitous arrival of some limited supplies postponed the need for them and, by various measures, arrangements were made to avoid that possibility pending the arrival of a new cargo.  That situation which had so nearly arisen already this year will, in all probability, arise before the year is over.</P>
    <P>It may be no harm to mention in this connection the plans which the Department is making in order to provide against a situation in which there will be no petrol available to the country. The only alternative means, apart from horse transport, of keeping vehicles moving, is by equipping them with gas-producer plants.  It is, of course, necessary to bear in mind that our ability to put gas-producer plants upon vehicles is itself limited.  The materials which are available for the manufacture of these plants, the output capacity of the manufacturing firms and the supplies of solid fuel necessary for their operation are all strictly limited.  It has been decided, however, <Col N="1910" /> to encourage the more rapid fitting of commercial vehicles with gas-producer equipment by various means.  In the case of the large scale transport operators they will in effect be required to do so.  I mean that the continuation of petrol allocations to these firms will be made conditional upon their equipping a proportion of their total fleets with gas-producer plants.  Persons who voluntarily convert their commercial vehicles to the use of producer gas will continue to receive petrol allocations so long as they are in a class of persons to whom petrol would in any event be allowed.  That concession, primarily designed to encourage the equipment of commercial vehicles with these plants, will also be extended to the owners of hackney vehicles.  Arrangements are being made to effect the standardisation of these plants and to ensure that only approved types will be produced.</P>
    <P>Up to the present it has been considered unnecessary to make available allowances of petrol to owners of gas-producer vehicles, unless they were entitled to petrol in any event, for starting purposes.  The manufacturers of the plant have frequently urged the desirability of making available small allocations of petrol for these plants for priming purposes.  It is possible to start these plants operating without petrol, but it will facilitate owners of vehicles fitted with these plants and encourage other owners to instal them if we make available a small monthly allowance of petrol for priming purposes, and it has been decided now to do that.  Permits are required to fit gas-producer plants in any vehicles and they will be given only in respect of commercial vehicles which are in a good state of repair and which exceed one ton unladen weight.  Arrangements which I need not detail now are being made to expand the production of solid fuel for gas-producer equipment, mainly by an increased output of turf charcoal.</P>
    <P>I have dealt, however, with only one petroleum product, namely, petrol.  In the case of paraffin oil, our normal consumption was about 17,500,000 gallons per year, and supplies during 1942 were 10,000,000 gallons. <Col N="1911" /> This year, we do not expect to receive more than 8,000,000 gallons.  Of these 8,000,000 gallons, more than 4,000,000 will be required for agricultural tractors; 1,000,000 gallons will be required for other food-producing equipment, such as incubators, grain mills, fishing boats and the like; and roughly another 1,000,000 gallons will be needed by other industrial users. It will be seen, therefore, that only a very meagre quantity will be left for domestic purposes.  So far as it is possible to ascertain the figure, about 8,500,000 gallons of paraffin were used normally every year for domestic purposes, and of the balance of the total supply which will be available this year and which can be released for domestic purposes, already 1,000,000 gallons have been used in the earlier months of the year.</P>
    <P>It is clear, therefore, that having regard to the fact that the requirements of agriculture will be greater this year than ever, every possible economy must be resorted to in order to ensure that there will be some supplies of paraffin oil, however limited, for rural homes during the coming winter months.  The hardship which the absence of any form of lighting involves in these homes will readily be appreciated by Deputies, and I trust, therefore, that they will use every influence in their own constituencies to discourage claims for paraffin oil by farmers, fishing boat owners or other users, in excess of their minimum essential needs.  It is, of course, very difficult to determine to a gallon the exact allocation which should be given to a particular tractor owner or other commercial user of paraffin oil and there has been a tendency to exaggerate claims for supplies.  That tendency must be discouraged by the exercise of public opinion on the people concerned.  It is only thus that we can scrape together a limited quantity of paraffin oil to make provision for domestic lighting in the darkest months of next winter.</P>
    <P>In that connection, I might refer at this stage to the position concerning <Col N="1912" /> supplies of candles.  Our normal consumption of candles was about 3,500 tons per year.  To manufacture 3,500 tons of candles, an equivalent quantity of paraffin wax was required, and in the past we imported that paraffin wax from the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Burma.  Exports from the United Kingdom are prohibited and, as Deputies are aware, Burma is occupied by the Japanese, and we cannot get supplies from that area. The United States authorities have agreed to make us an allocation of 1,000 tons per annum.  The quantity of candles available, therefore, will be only 30 per cent. of our normal requirements.  Not all these candles can, however, be released for domestic use.  Certain essential industries, such as coal-mining and ship-building, must get their full needs.  All supplies of paraffin wax have been reserved for candle manufacture, except for some insignificant quantities which are made available to a few essential industries.</P>
    <P>The other petroleum product to which I wish to refer is fuel oil.  In the case of fuel oil, supplies have been reduced by more than half.  Of the available supplies, 33 per cent. must be used for transport purposes and 25 per cent. is required for food production in grain mills, bakeries, creameries, fishing boats and the like. The balance is needed by other industrial concerns, some of which are of vital importance to the country.  It is quite clear that the economies which have already been enforced in the usage of fuel oil are insufficient to bring that usage within the anticipated supplies, and, consequently, further and considerable reductions in the allocation of fuel oil to these users will have to be enforced in the near future.</P>
    <P>I wish now to give a brief outline of the position in respect of clothing. It will, of necessity, have to be a brief outline.  In view of the large number of separate materials and commodities which are included under the heading of clothing, and in view also of the variety of orders and directions which have been given for the purpose of coping with the problems of scarcity <Col N="1913" /> and to make the best use of the available supplies, it is impossible to do more than give a very general review of the position.  In the case of cotton, we receive periodic allocations of cotton yarns and fabrics from the United Kingdom.  These allocations represent 10 per cent. of our normal needs. They are at present being supplemented by some small quantities imported from the United States of America.  Similarly in the case of woollens and woollen yarns, periodic allocations are received from the United Kingdom, but they are so small in relation to our normal imports that we are for all practical purposes entirely dependent on our own wool resources.</P>
    <P>To ensure an equitable distribution of available supplies and to prevent excessive competition between traders in this country forcing up prices to our detriment, a buying permit system has been arranged in agreement with the United Kingdom authorities, under which all applications to purchase supplies of cotton and woollen yarns and piece goods must be accompanied by a buying permit issued by the Department of Supplies.  That system has greatly facilitated the proper distribution of supplies and ensures also that the fullest advantage is taken of the available quotas.  In the case of linen yarns and silk yarns, all imports have ceased.  In the case of art silk, in June of last year&mdash;the date will be of some significance to Deputies in view of the agitation proceeding at that time against clothes rationing&mdash; the authorities in the United Kingdom decided to discontinue all new production of art silk goods for this country, and since then have allotted no further export to us, except for some run-off of orders which had been placed prior to June, 1942.  Since March 1st of the present year all types of art silk yarns have been subjected to export control by the United Kingdom authorities.</P>
    <P>The only textile which we can produce from native materials is woollens. There is no machinery in the country for the spinning of flax yarn.  In the case of woollens, the difficulty is that the spinning capacity of the Irish mills is not sufficient to produce all the <Col N="1914" /> yarns which could be utilised on their weaving machines.  Arrangements have been made which will result in this year in an increased output of worsted yarns, which will ease the supply position to some extent.  To sum up the whole textile situation, we can estimate that, during 1943, the supply of textiles of all kinds will equal about 22 per cent. of our normal needs.  That substantial contraction in the total supply available to the country has, of course, necessitated a very rigid control over the use to be made of the quantities available.</P>
    <P>Under the Emergency Powers (Manufacture of Textiles and Textile Articles) Order, directions are given to manufacturers for the purpose of ensuring the production only of essential cloths and garments and the making of the best use of available supplies.  Clothes rationing, as Deputies are aware, is in operation, but it has been operating on a more liberal basis than the supply position justifies, and the result has been the encouragement of undesirable activities by speculators which will now have to be curtailed by direct action against them.  Regulations have been made requiring shirt manufacturers to institute economies in the making up of shirts and to maintain a balance between the production of men's and boys' shirts; the reservation of proofed gaberdine and similar cloths, for the making up of raincoats; economies in the making of men's and boys' suits; limiting the types of art-silk garments which may be made, and instituting economies in the making up of women's outer garments; controlling the production of hosiery garments&mdash;and for many purposes, designed to prevent waste and to ensure the production, so far as is practicable and consistent with the provision of employment, of utility clothes only.</P>
    <P>In the case of fuel, no material change in regard to coal supplies occurred during the past year.  Practically all the coal received was of low quality, and indistinguishable from low-grade steam coal, and consisted mostly of slack.  Imports of coal in 1942 averaged 23,000 tons per week, as compared with 50,000 tons per week in a normal pre-war year.  It is not <Col N="1915" /> possible to include any coal in the domestic fuel ration.  It has been possible to maintain sufficient supplies of coal to industrial users in the non-turf areas.  In the turf areas permits to purchase coal in such quantities as, used in conjunction with turf, would be sufficient to meet industrial requirements, have been issued.  The allocation of gas-coal to this country by the United Kingdom authorities has been reduced to one-sixth of normal needs.  Six of the smaller gas undertakings have closed down here since the war began, and in all areas there has been a curtailment of the hours of supply and a reduction in the calorific values of the gas supply.  There is no immediate prospect of any improvement in the gas position.</P>
    <P>Due to the abnormally dry weather and, consequently, the high coal consumption required for electricity production, it has been necessary to reintroduce the rationing of electricity since the 1st of April.  The drive initiated by the Government for increased turf production was conducted successfully during the past year.  The limiting factor affecting turf supplies for the non-turf areas is transport.  It is not possible to transport more than 450,000 tons of turf in one season and, therefore, turf for domestic use has had to be rationed in the non-turf areas.  This rationing was also designed to secure the building up of a stock of turf in those areas to meet a situation in which transport might have to be further curtailed.  The reserve of turf is now about 300,000 tons, as compared with 185,000 tons at the corresponding date last year, and on the basis of average weekly sales, during the past winter, it is sufficient to meet immediate needs for 12 months ahead.  It has continued to be sold at 64/- a ton, although the average cost of production, transportation, and storage has exceeded that figure very considerably. The total subsidy required to maintain the present price is, roughly, 23/6 per ton.</P>
    <P>With regard to the Supplementary Estimate which was introduced here to-day, the position is, as Deputies are <Col N="1916" /> aware, that the machinery of Fuel Importers, Ltd., is being utilised for bringing turf into the non-turf areas and also for the distribution of the turf within those areas, and that organisation is also responsible for the equalisation of the price of turf throughout the non-turf area.  The turf which is dealt with by Fuel Importers, Ltd., may be divided into two classes.  One class is turf produced by the efforts of the county surveyors, and the other is turf that is produced by private individuals. Fuel Importers, Ltd., enter into firm contracts with private producers and the price, of course, is definitely known.  In the case of turf produced through the efforts of the county surveyors, which, in fact, represents over 80 per cent. of all the turf purchased by Fuel Importers, Ltd., provisional prices have been intimated by the Department of Local Government and Public Health.  Further provisional arrangements will have to be made and a final settlement will not be possible before the winding up of the production programme at the end of the present emergency.  It is already obvious, however, that the cost of saving the turf, delivering it, and keeping considerable quantities of it stored in dumps, to be used when required, will be very heavy.  The Government have fixed 64/- a ton as the present maximum price and the price at which Fuel Importers, Ltd., can sell the turf is this retail price less a reasonable margin for merchants.  The difference between the all-in cost of the turf to Fuel Importers, Ltd., and the price at which it is sold by them is the loss which will be recouped to the company under sub-head G.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does that mean that it costs 87/6 a ton?</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, that would be right.  That is the average cost.  The provision in the main Estimate was intended to recoup Fuel Importers, Limited, for the loss incurred by them on the sale of turf from the commencement of their operations in the sale of turf in December, 1941, up to 31st December, 1943.  Certain factors were taken into consideration with regard <Col N="1917" /> to the price, based provisionally on the turf produced by the county surveyors. That price, however, has proved to be too low, in the light of figures that have come to hand since and, accordingly, a considerable increase in the main Estimate is necessary.  It is for that reason that it is necessary to move a Supplementary Estimate for £280,000, which will bring the total estimate for turf subsidy to £666,000.</P>

      <P>For a considerable portion of the year turf is transported from the turf areas to the merchants' yards, where it is sold.  In addition to that, turf supplies are brought in and stored in dumps.  The total cost of turf, 87/6 per ton, includes the cost of storing the turf in dumps.  A very substantial item is represented by the loss of weight which occurs while the turf is being stored.  In fact, the figures upon which we are now working are based upon an assumed loss of 20 per cent. in the weight of turf in the dumps.  It is mainly due to the loss of moisture, but to some extent it is also due to the crumbling of the turf.</P>

      <P>That fact does seriously alter the average price of all the turf to Fuel Importers, Ltd.  In respect of industrial materials, I do not propose to refer, except in a general way, to the immense problems which are involved in maintaining supplies of these materials.  It would take a very long time to make even a brief reference to all the problems which have arisen. There are, however, a few materials of that class which are of special significance <Col N="1918" /> and concerning which the Dáil may desire to know the position.</P>
      <P>The first of these is rubber.  When I spoke here last year, I anticipated that by this time all our rubber stocks would have been exhausted and no new rubber goods of any kind would be available for any purpose.  Fortunately, as a result of special arrangements made during the year, and as a result, to some extent, of the rigid conservation of supplies during the year, together with the fullest possible utilisation of reclaimed rubber, the situation, although still very serious, is nevertheless much better than was anticipated.  It will be possible to maintain a sufficient supply of new and remoulded tyres for vehicles engaged in essential work and public transport services to meet requirements for the present year.  It is hoped to make available also about 300,000 cycle tyres which, although very much less than our requirements, is larger than the supply which was released last year.  The manufacture of rubber boots has been suspended, but a small quantity of rubber has been reserved for the repair of damaged boots.  Rubber fittings for industrial machinery can also be provided. As a matter of interest, I can mention that the total quantity of salvaged rubber in 1942 was 140 tons, and that represents a very welcome addition to our stocks.</P>

      <P>I can only refer the Deputy to the statement I have made which, I think, is sufficiently comprehensive. In the case of fertilisers, we have arranged for the importation of 20,000 tons of phosphate rock.  That has to be imported from Florida, and it involves a very long sea voyage over a very dangerous route.  Whether it will be possible, later on, to obtain supplies of rock from North Africa, is not yet certain.  Our normal requirements of phosphate rock are about 100,000 tons per year.  We have arranged also to import a smaller quantity of pyrites from Spain against a normal requirement of 40,000 tons. These pyrites and phosphate rock are required for the manufacture of superphosphate.</P>
      <P>The only other fertilisers which will be available this year will be a limited quantity of sulphate of ammonia and some potash, supplied by the United Kingdom authorities for the flax crop. For spraying materials it is expected there will be about 800 tons of copper sulphate, against a normal supply of 3,200 tons.  We expect to have adequate supplies of sodium carbonate. Deputies may be interested to know that there will be a bare sufficiency, but a sufficiency nevertheless, of binder twine, resulting from the importation of 1,000 tons of sisal for manufacture into twine here, and 1,000 tons of manufactured twine.</P>
      <P>In the case of metals, as was stated in the Press, Irish Steel, Ltd., has restarted the mill at Haulbowline and they are utilising supplies of steel billets which were procured some time ago.  The steel produced has been allocated for the production of agricultural machinery, horse shoes, nails, bolts and nuts.  The production from the imported billets is limited and it is not yet certain that it will prove possible to complete the furnaces for the smelting of scrap steel.  Under the most favourable circumstances these furnaces could not be completed before October next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The position regarding paper supplies has become increasingly difficult. The total supply of paper of all kinds, exclusive of newsprint, is about 16 per <Col N="1920" /> cent. of the normal supply.  For newsprint we are dependent on what it is possible to transport in our own ships, and this quantity is so limited that strict control of its consumption has to be maintained.  That control is maintained by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <P>Deputies may have some difficulty in distinguishing between the functions of the Department of Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Department of Supplies is responsible for all efforts to obtain supplies, and it controls the distribution of what are known as consumption goods.  Generally speaking, the allocation amongst manufacturers of industrial raw materials is undertaken by the Department of Industry and Commerce.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>With regard to barytes, are there no supplies of this commodity derivable from Ben Bulben, in County Sligo?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I was talking of pyrites, not barytes.  Pyrites make sulphuric acid.  Deputies may, during the course of this discussion, desire to raise a number of points in connection with the various schemes of rationing in operation.  A matter that has assumed considerable importance latterly is the practice of revoking retail trading licences, in the case of traders who have been convicted of offences under tea and sugar rationing Orders, or under price control Orders. In justification for that course, I should say that experience since the outbreak of the war has shown that full compliance with these Orders cannot be secured unless stern measures are taken against traders who have been guilty of irregularities under them.  The extent to which traders have attempted to disregard their obligations under these Orders can be gauged from the fact that legal proceedings have been, or are being, instituted in 1,114 cases to date.  These cases represent, as Deputies know, only a fraction of the offences actually committed, but which escaped detection. Unless traders realise, or are made to realise, that non-compliance <Col N="1921" /> with their legal obligations will involve a continuing penalty, it will be impossible to get the various rationing and price control regulations adequately observed.  It is for that reason that the practice of withdrawing licences from convicted offenders has been adopted.  It is well that traders should know that convictions for rationing irregularities, or for overcharging for price controlled goods carries, apart from the penalties which may be inflicted by the courts, the added penalty of being put out of trade in the commodities concerned for the duration of the war. That is, in my opinion, a necessary safeguard for the public who should not be left dependent for their supplies on traders who have already shown an inclination to disregard the law.  Up to date, 32 traders in tea and sugar have been deprived of their licences, and the number is likely to be increased considerably during the present year.  Where traders' licences are withdrawn arrangements are made for the transfer of the traders' customers to other local suppliers.</P>
      <P>No doubt we will have a discussion upon the efficacy of the Department's measures for price control.  During the past year, 98 prices Orders were made, of which 85 were Orders supplementary to, or in substitution of existing Orders, and 15 were new Orders bringing the price of additional commodities under control.  The retail prices of 57 commodities of general consumption are at present fixed by Order.  The operation of the price control arrangements goes much further, however, than the fixation of maximum retail prices.  Price control covers the prices of all manufacturers and producers, and, in the case of certain important commodities, the prices of importers and wholesalers also.  The changing circumstances of the times necessitate frequent revision of the measures in force.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>During the past year, 861 statements of financial accounts, covering the trading of 553 firms, were investigated, and, where necessary, limitations upon the gross profits or on the profit margins of the firms concerned, were arranged.  Heretofore, the prices of <Col N="1922" /> certain important commodities have remained uncontrolled to the extent that fixed maximum retail prices have not been established, due to the complexity of the trading arrangements involved, or the wide variety of the goods concerned, which made control by price maximum Orders either impracticable or ineffective.  I refer to such goods as fresh meats, vegetables and clothing.  Circumstances are forcing action now to control prices, or to limit traders' margins in these goods, and while it is recognised that such control must involve the alteration of trading methods, or a degree of interference with normal commercial arrangements heretofore deemed undesirable, it is now becoming necessary in the public interest, no matter how distasteful it is to the interests concerned.</P>
    <P>In the case of fresh meats, it will be recognised that effective price control must begin with the live animal and include the regulation of sales, and, particularly, the regulation of exports which the majority of the Dáil would, in all probability, strongly object to. Up to the present, retail meat prices have been regulated in the Dublin area by arrangement with the victuallers' association, but the prices operative in the city would not apply in the circumstances to other areas.  The prices of fresh meats have always varied from district to district, and for that reason it is doubtful if any form of general control is desirable because it would probably result in prices rising in some districts higher than they otherwise would, even if the Dáil were prepared to face the regulation and disposal of live animals which would be involved.</P>
    <P>Somewhat similar considerations apply in the case of vegetables, although it is now found necessary to fix a maximum price for potatoes.  The required measure to that end is at present being prepared.  In the case of clothing, control is at present confined to the regulation of manufacturers' prices, and to a general review of distribution charges.  For some time past, however, it has become obvious that a far more extensive form of control is necessary, and so the Department of <Col N="1923" /> Supplies has been working out, in consultation with the trade interests concerned, a scheme of price fixation for essential articles of clothing.  It is now considered that it will be possible to devise arrangements to that end which will work, and the necessary Orders will, I trust, be made effective in the near future.</P>
    <P>Included in the price control activities of the Department is direct action against what we may call black marketeers.  Where persons are suspected of having large quantities of goods in their possession for the purpose of exploiting their scarcity value, Orders have been made prohibiting the sale or the movement of such goods, and if the suspicions, on investigation, are found to be justified, these persons are required to dispose of the goods to designated traders at a fixed price. There were a large number of prosecutions for charging prices in excess of those fixed by Order during the year. The precise figures cannot be given because a number of these prosecutions were taken at the instance of members of the Gárdaí as well as at the instance of officers of the Department of Supplies.  In a considerable number of cases, the courts have imposed sentences of imprisonment on the persons convicted.</P>
    <P>That concludes the general review which I propose to make now of our general position and of the Department's activities.  I request Deputies, however, when discussing the work of the Department of Supplies to keep in mind that, due to causes which are entirely outside our control, we are now getting 25 per cent. of our requirements in tea, no margarine, about 20 per cent. of our needs of petrol, less than 50 per cent. of our requirements of paraffin, 16 per cent. of our normal consumption of gas-coal and no domestic coal, 10 per cent. of our normal needs of cotton goods and a total textile supply equal to 22 per cent. of our requirements in linen yarns and in silk yarns, and that a similar story can be told in respect of every other commodity previously imported or which was produced here <Col N="1924" /> by or with the aid of imported materials.  It is only by efficient organisation and control of supply that, in such circumstances, complete economic collapse was avoided and, when Deputies are addressing themselves to the hardships which have been occasioned by the scarcity of some supplies, I ask them to look around the country, to consider the situation existing in the country in relation to these drastic cuts in our available supplies of goods, all of which were previously considered essential to the conduct of industry and commerce here, and I think that in fairness they will agree that, whatever defects there may have been in the Department's organisation or plans, it can be justly claimed on its behalf that it has served this country well enough during these difficult years since the beginning of the war.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Estimate be referred back for reconsideration. I do so not because I want to draw attention to anything that the Minister has not control over.  My criticism will be directed to certain matters that he has complete control over and that, in dealing with certain matters, they could be more satisfactorily and effectively settled if he would accept consultation with the organised traders or groups of commercial people which exist in the country. It seems to me from time to time, and particularly just at present, that the Department of Supplies when dealing with the ordinary organisation of the country is like a small boy without very much intelligence and with little feeling driving a donkey&mdash;an odd whack and an odd chuck and an odd dig of the heel.  The result is that the driving or the co-operation is not of a very satisfactory kind.  The Minister referred to the fact, in connection with the withdrawal of licences for the sale of tea or sugar, that it was necessary to take very stern measures in order to safeguard the public against traders who had misconducted themselves, traders who had already shown an inclination to disregard the law.  If a situation like that arises or tends to arise, I think it is the trading <Col N="1925" /> machinery in the country upon which we must depend for the faithful and best distribution of the goods we have in the country.  We must depend upon them for co-operation with the Department&mdash;and I think they are very ready to give it&mdash;for an understanding of the Department's difficulties, and for giving to the Department that assistance without which the Department cannot overcome its difficulties.</P>
      <P>I asked the Minister the other day how many licences had been withdrawn in the City and County of Dublin since 1st January, 1942, in connection with any kind of offence under prices Orders in the sale of tea or sugar.  The answer given to me on the 8th April was that four such licences had been withdrawn in the City and County of Dublin since 1st January, 1942.  The first case that occurred was on the 7th May, the next on the 16th September, the third on the 16th February, and the fourth on the 16th February.  Now we find that a whole sheaf of notices has gone out to people in the city and, apparently, in the country and that licences are to be withdrawn from a large number of people.  In connection with the move that is now on representations have, I understand, been made to the Minister by the Retail Grocers' and Allied Retailers' Association and that an offer has been made to the Minister to assist him in every possible way to overcome offences of this particular kind.  He was asked to receive representatives on their behalf when certain proposals would be made to him and I understand that he would not agree to receive them.  However, the association have represented to the Minister the various difficulties of traders in connection with these sales where a large number of commodities have to be dealt with, a very large number of assistants have to bear responsibility in the matter and mistakes are likely to occur.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>They have asked (1) that the Minister will not step in and add punishment additional to the punishment inflicted by the courts until at least one or two endorsements have been made on a trader's licence by the courts; that at least he would pay attention <Col N="1926" /> before taking subsequent action on his own behalf to the comments of the justice dealing with the matter; (2) that he would set up an appeal body, consisting of representatives of the Department and of the association which would review the Minister's proposal to take away a licence before the actual licence would be taken away; (3) that in cases in which threats have been made to withdraw licences or in cases in which licences have been withdrawn the persons affected will have a chance of going before the appeal body and having the circumstances of the case heard; that in case of prosecutions traders would not be convicted for overcharging except a receipt was produced, because in controlling the sale at appropriate prices of a large number of detailed items, we might expect that the public would assist in the matter and where anybody felt that he was being overcharged, that he would assist in keeping things right by asking for a receipt, particularly in view of the fact that it is very easy at a particular time to make a mistake.</P>
    <P>In present circumstances, no one wants to make a case for leniency towards people who are deliberately adding to the public danger and who are attempting deliberately to make substantial profits out of the present public distress.  But, in some of the cases which have already been heard, I think the procedure has been rather absurd.  Let us take the four cases about which the Minister gave me particulars on the 8th April last.  In the first case, six months passed between the date of the offence and the date on which the case was brought to court, and two months passed between the decision in the court and the withdrawal of the licence.  In the second case, four months passed between the date of the offence and the date of the prosecution and six months between the date of the prosecution and the date upon which the licence was withdrawn. In the third case, eight months passed between the date of the offence and the date upon which the case was brought to court, and seven months between the date upon which the matter was tried in court and the withdrawal of the licence.  In the fourth <Col N="1927" /> case, six months passed between the date of the offence and the date of the prosecution, and four months between the date of the prosecution and the date of the withdrawal of the licence. Between the date of the conviction and the date of the withdrawal of the licence, there was an interval of two months in one case, six months in another, seven months in another, and four months in another, in the only four cases in the City and County of Dublin where the licence was withdrawn by the 8th April, 1943.  What conviction can be brought by that kind of procedure as to the policy the Minister intends to pursue?  In some of these cases substantial fines were imposed.  Take one case: a pot of marmalade was sold for 1/8 on the 4th May, 1942, when the controlled price was 1/2.  It was a special case.  There were very extenuating circumstances in connection with the matter, but there was an overcharge of 6d. and there was no receipt given.  Six months later, the trader whose assistant sold that pot of marmalade, and sold it under very considerable pressure by the purchaser, was fined £25 for the overcharge and £20 for failure to give a receipt.  That is a substantial fine for an overcharge of 6d. even if that overcharge had been made most maliciously.  But, after four months, to be deprived of a licence to sell tea and sugar when we consider the importance of these items to the trader and the small quantity of important goods available at the moment, is a shockingly big punishment. If it had been done the following day, it ought to have been done in connection with a publicly declared policy, but it is done four months afterwards and there is really no explanation of it.  If it is necessary to pursue such a policy, then it ought to be a declared policy.  Some of the cases are astonishing and they require a very definite explanation, I would say, to the House and I think they make a very strong case for the setting up of an appeal body.</P>
    <P>There is one case&mdash;and I think it is no harm to mention the name&mdash;Messrs. Stanley and Company, of Ballybrack. <Col N="1928" /> The records were examined for the first time in April, 1942, by an official of the Department and it was found that no record was being kept of the cocoa sold.  It was also found that 39 lbs. of tea had been sold which could not be accounted for.  The trader was prosecuted in November, 1942, seven months afterwards.  The trader was fined £5 for not keeping cocoa records, £4 in respect of not being able to account for 39 lbs. of tea.  In April, 1943, four months after the prosecution, he is advised that his licence will be withdrawn as from the end of April. The books were examined in April, 1942; the prosecution was made in November, 1942, and, at the end of April, 1943, the licence is to be taken up, in spite of the fact that fines had been paid and that the judge before whom the case was brought said that the offence was of a trivial nature and that, since April, 1942, the establishment has never been inspected.  There is a number of other cases, but I take that as an example of the slovenly, slow way in which certain action was taken.  From the time this machinery of price control was started, in only four cases were licences removed and they were removed in the sluggish way I have indicated.</P>
    <P>I submit to the Minister that the Department and its inspectors ought to know the difficulties under which retail people labour in keeping strictly to the letter of the price Orders that exist at the present moment.  The multiplicity of things dealt with, the varying degrees of pressure and rush under which business is carried out, the different classes of persons and assistants that deal with the matter, all suggest a possibility of a margin of error.  As far as I can see, there is no margin of error allowed for in a case like Stanley and Company or some of the other cases I have referred to.  Consultation and agreement between the Ministry and the organised traders is necessary. It is particularly necessary if injustice and hardship and serious loss are not to be imposed on unfortunate and, practically, unoffending people by a Department.  The direction of this particular matter has been very bad, and unless there is now satisfactory consultation <Col N="1929" /> between the Department and the traders, a very large and important section of the people who are trying to do their best and who have very manfully done their best up to the present will be in the position that they are dealing with a Department which has no sense of justice and no sense of an orderly approach to difficult problems.</P>
    <P>The next matter is in regard to some of the clothing problems that the Minister touched on.  A very remarkable omission from the Minister's statement with regard to clothing is the omission to state that within the last few days he has instructed the manufacturers of cotton piece goods that they are not to sell their goods without a distribution direction from the Ministry on the one hand and, apparently, a buying order on the other, and that he has indicated that after the 19th April, 1943, no piece goods of any description will be distributed by the cotton manufacturers in the country without distribution directions from him and that he has further indicated that one class of goods, heavy canvas and towelling, may be sold now through the ordinary channels of trade, that another class, consisting of saddlers' ticking, may be sold through the ordinary channels of trade up to the 2nd May, when further instructions will, apparently, be issued and that a large class consisting of shirting, dungaree cloth, lining and pocketing, will only be supplied to holders of buying permits when the Minister issues them and, in respect of a remaining class, cotton woven fabrics such as sheeting, calico and flannelette, other than shirting flannelette, the manufacturers understand from the Minister that these cannot be issued at all at the present time until the Minister issues further instructions.  The position that will be brought about as a result of the Minister's action in this matter is that a very considerable amount of unemployment will be created amongst dressmakers, perhaps amongst drapers' assistants, and a large number of people, probably of the poorer classes, who make their garments at home from piece goods purchased from drapers will not be able to do so at all. It is a very remarkable thing that, although he discussed the <Col N="1930" /> position with regard to clothing, he made no reference at all to such an important action.</P>
    <P>Apparently the intention is that such piece goods as are available will be kept entirely for the manufacturing industries which are making up garments.  It is all the more remarkable that that should be done, in view of the fact that about a month ago there was a meeting at the Department of members of the Drapers' Chamber of Trade, of representatives of the making-up groups, and the matter was considered as to how certain shirtings and flannelettes manufactured in the country were to be distributed.  It was agreed that 75 per cent. of the production here would be reserved for the makers-up and that 25 per cent. would remain for circulation to the retail trade.  There was a plan for issuing buying permits to the makers-up, but in fact I understand that an agreement was come to between the manufacturers of the cotton woven fabrics and the shirt makers that, without the setting up of costly machinery by the Department to issue the various quotas to the makers-up, the making-up firms should get their proper quota by direct arrangement between the manufacturers of the woven cloth and the shirt makers.</P>
    <P>However, without any further consultation with anybody, apparently, Orders have now been issued that the whole of the woven fabric is to be controlled in this way and is likely to go entirely to the makers-up.  The drapers some time ago agreed with the Department that it would be advisable to have a register of drapers' shops made up, in order to help the Minister in controlling the circulation and distribution of these goods, but nothing has been done to make up such a register, and it does not appear that there is any machinery by which buying permits can be issued to drapers without a register.</P>
    <P>The position with regard to drapers and dressmakers, and people who use piece goods, was made more difficult by the operations of the Department last year when the British Government or the British machinery was <Col N="1931" /> approached and asked to arrange that the goods which the British were prepared to supply would be supplied to this country in certain classes dictated by the Minister.  That apparently was agreed to, and the result was that the ordinary trade lines were cut across. A change was made in the type of goods to be sent over here and some of the stuff which had been made and collected by British distributors for the Irish trade was then not permitted to come into the country.  There was a gap due to the delay in making the newer goods which were required under the Minister's policy and, in fact, the drapers lost a considerable amount of piece goods as a result of the transactions at that time.</P>
    <P>Under the arrangement the Minister made at that time, drapers were not able to import piece goods themselves, so that the drapers and the people who depend on them for the purchase of piece goods, either to carry on their business as dressmakers, or to carry on the making of clothes in their homes, have already suffered as a result of the operations of the Department. Now the position is that they are to suffer additionally.</P>

      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister knows quite well that there was.  However, I am simply putting it to the Minister, from my understanding and knowledge of the situation, that the drapers did lose a certain amount of piece goods at that time, and, following the arrangement then made, the drapers are getting less piece goods than they would have got if the Minister's arrangement, preventing the drapers from getting piece goods into the country, was not made.  Now he is apparently planning to prevent the drapers from getting the piece goods manufactured in the country.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1932" /> It may be that the Minister wishes to keep the staffs of concerns which are making-up goods working, but has anything been done to equate the amount of employment that will be continued with the amount of employment which will be lost when rural dressmakers and dressmakers in the city are put out of employment, as a result of their not being able to get their goods and the hardship inflicted on poor people who will not be able to make up their own goods at home? The Minister is not only running the risk of creating greater unemployment, but of striking a blow at craftsmanship, and I think he is raising prices. Anybody who knows the kind of work carried out by individual dressmakers knows what a valuable craft is maintained in the highest perfection there&mdash; giving a very considerable amount of employment on the one hand, and doing a very high class work on the other, as well as substantially keeping down prices.</P>
    <P>The matter was first raised, I understand, in connection with woollen cloths, and it was proposed to have a price permit arrangement in connection with them.  If that is so, or if there is any proposal to deal with woollen cloths in this way, the Minister ought not to be silent about it.  We expected that he would have told us what he was doing with regard to the control of piece goods manufactured in the country and their distribution, and what he proposes to do with regard to woollen goods.  The line generally seems to be that if the Department can take a few sheets of paper and control everything on them, everything is grand, but, on the other hand, we have a statement in the leading article of the <i>Irish Press</i> to-day which shows that, in a matter in respect of which we might say the Government had complete control, they failed ignominiously to deal in a satisfactory way with the situation.</P>
    <P>Last year, persons who wanted sugar for jam making could apply to the Department for the necessary permit to get the sugar, and we have the admission in that leading article&mdash;or the statement; I do not know whether <Col N="1933" /> the Department would admit the charge&mdash;that:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;This summer, no extra supply can be spared for household jam making, but that is largely due to the fact that last year the privilege granted was grossly abused. Thousands of people who had no intention of making jam practised a deception which secured to them sugar to which they were not entitled. This greedy minority is to blame&rdquo;</P>
    <P>...for anything that may happen now.</P>
    <P>Here we have thousands of people, acting directly with the Department under all kinds of forms and certificates, and with the police and parish priests being brought in to certify to their good character, supposed to have got away with a substantial amount of sugar, with the result that now we are short of sugar.  What we are concerned with is the proper distribution, at as low a price level as possible, of the materials that we have here, but both with regard to the grocers, whose hands must tremble every time they lift them to a shelf to-day, or to the drapers who feel that they ought to be consulted by the Department, they do not know where they stand.  The drapers are half consulted in some matters by the Department, but then policies are adopted by the Department which, in the judgment of the most experienced men in the trade, are the wrong policies.  The result is, as I have said, that these people do not know where they stand.  They are all organised and prepared to serve the community in full co-operation with the Department, but the Department seems to be dealing with the matter in a way that can only create disturbance, confusion and general dislocation.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I should like to refer.  I do not know whether an Order has actually been made yet, but I understand that drapers are now instructed that where normally they would send in two coupons to the Department they now have to send in three coupons.  Many of these people put a substantial amount of money into the getting of goods into this country, and but for <Col N="1934" /> them we would not have the satisfactory supplies position that the Minister speaks about.  Surely, therefore, they should not be wronged now by making them surrender coupons in that way.  If there is to be a surrender of coupons, I suggest that it ought to have some relation to the amount of goods held by drapers at present, as well as the amount of coupons, and that they should be credited with them. At the present time drapers have a substantial number of coupons which they are not able to surrender, as against the goods that they have, but as the supplies position improves, either before the end of this emergency or after it, I think that the people who helped us over the situation here by getting in supplies should not be prejudiced in respect of this matter of coupons.</P>
    <P>The general feeling seems to be that both in the matter of distribution of goods and in the matter of prosecutions in regard to prices, the Department is looking for a scapegoat to cover mistakes made by the Department in the past or to cover the position which the Department boasted that it could control but has failed to control.  Take the position with regard to the cost-of-living figures since the beginning of the war.  The cost-of-living figure for all items in this country has risen by 57.7 per cent., since the beginning of the war, whereas on the British side the increase has only been 28.5.  From August, 1939, up to February, 1943, there has been an increase here of 54 per cent. in the cost of food alone as compared with 20 per cent. in Britain. The most remarkable and disturbing fact, however, revealed by the change that has taken place here, as compared with Great Britain, since the beginning of the war until February, 1943, is that, on the basis of the cost-of-living figure of July, 1914, the figure here has risen, for all items, by 55 points whereas, in Britain, it has only risen by two points, and in the case of food the cost here has risen by 47 points, whereas in Britain it has fallen by two points. That shows that there has been a shocking rise in the cost of living here within the last two years, and I think <Col N="1935" /> that the approach the Minister is taking in regard to the prosecutions of grocers and so on is just a mere matter of looking for some kind of a scapegoat, so that the blame for the rise in the cost of living here might be attached, in the public mind, to traders generally, and to hide the fact that the blundering attempts that have been made by the Department to control the supply of drapery goods have only resulted in increased unemployment among important sections of the people here.</P>
    <P>Another matter to which I should like to refer is the fact that there have been certain complaints about the price of such commodities as butter and tea.  The average import price of all the tea that came into this country was 2/3 a lb., including customs duty. Now, 1/1 is allowed for the wholesale distribution of the tea, and 8d. is allowed for retail.  It seems to me that more examination and a better explanation is required as to why 1/1 should be allowed for the wholesale distribution and only 8d. allowed for retail distribution. Comparatively recently, also, under an Emergency Powers Order, a margin of 2½d. a lb. was allowed on butter, but that has now been reduced to ld.  I think that if traders generally are to be assured that their problems are being properly dealt with by the Department, some more explanation should be given to them with regard to such matters.</P>
    <P>I move that this Estimate be referred back, Sir, on the grounds that neither the organised grocers who deal with the distribution of grocery goods nor the drapers nor manufacturers of textiles have any assurance that there is the necessary, satisfactory consultation and co-ordination that there should be in difficult times like these between them and the Department of Supplies.</P>

      <P>The failure of the Minister's Department is largely due to the fact that the Department does too little too late.  That Department is no longer regarded by the people in a serious light.  It is no longer looked upon as an organised Department <Col N="1936" /> for the provision of essential goods and their equitable distribution. The Minister's Department is largely associated in the public mind as a Department of mopes and muddlers. If we stop for a moment to examine the origin of this Department, we will see that in 1938 a section to deal with supplies was set up in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  At the outbreak of the war, the present fully-fledged Department of Supplies evolved from the nucleus that was set up in 1938 in the Department of Industry and Commerce.  It was provided with a Minister, with a permanent Secretary, and so on, and followed the usual process of the Tite Barnacles in the Circumlocution Office, with secretaries to other secretaries, private secretaries to these, and private secretaries to private secretaries, and so on.  I am sure that the people will learn with dismay that this Department is now costing approximately £3,000,000 a year.</P>

      <P>The distribution of salaries and wages in this Department is something like the distribution of supplies throughout the country.  One would expect that the Department would be very vigilant in respect of waste, but the fact is that the Department of Supplies uses hundreds of tons of paper, involving millions of forms and books.  As a matter of fact, it has destroyed millions of these forms.  A considerable number of them were destroyed when the Minister for Supplies announced the clothes rationing scheme and then had to beat a hasty retreat after the force of public opinion was brought to bear on his Department. The Department has definitely failed to get supplies.  It is a fact that in the real Department of Supplies&mdash; that is to say, the black market &mdash;those who have the wherewithal can get what they want&mdash;food, clothing and materials for carrying on industry. Everything is there, provided you have sufficient money.  That is the real Department of Supplies so far as the country is concerned and that Department had its foundation some years back when the Minister for Supplies urged those in the country who had money to lay in stores of goods, to hoard any goods that were available. Using almost his exact words shortly before the shortage, he said: &ldquo;Store coal in your backyard and in your front garden, under the stairs, anywhere&mdash;but store coal.&rdquo;  That was splendid advice.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">

    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was grand advice to the people in York Street, in Cuffe Street, or in Francis Street.  The Minister knows the types of gardens these people have and how much money they had at that time to buy coal and put it under the stairs or in their back or front gardens.  What is true of coal is equally true of tea, white flour and even ordinary soap and mustard.  In the earlier years of the <Col N="1938" /> war the Minister was in the habit of giving assurances that there were ample supplies, more particularly in relation to tea and sugar.  On numerous occasions he mentioned that we had ample supplies of these goods, and in 1940 he refused an import licence to a firm which had purchased large quantities of tea in the United States.  The Minister frankly admitted that he would not issue the licence because he had made a bargain with our friends across the Channel.  Later on, when something went wrong, the Minister was not slow to blame the British people for his failure here in so far as the provision of this particular commodity was concerned.  Repeatedly the Minister explained the shortage on the ground that there was not sufficient shipping space.  At the outbreak of the war the members of the Labour Party called on the Minister for Supplies and urged him to get in food and other essential commodities. When they advised him that ships would be necessary to transport these commodities, the intelligent observation that the Minister then had to make was: &ldquo;What will we do with the ships after the war?&rdquo;</P>

      <P>May I remind the Chair that the Minister dealt at considerable length with the activities of Irish Shipping, Ltd?  I, therefore, claim the right to deal with the failure of the Department to provide the necessary ships.  I am endeavouring to make the point that many of the shortages which now arise are due to the failure of the Minister properly to envisage the position.  I think I am entitled to proceed on those lines, having regard to the Minister's statement. The Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures went one better than the Minister for Supplies <Col N="1939" /> when, in reply to Deputy Hickey's argument in favour of purchasing ships, he said: &ldquo;If all the damn ships were at the bottom of the sea and we used our brains, we would be better off.&rdquo;  Subsequently the same Minister went to America and bought ships.  It is rumoured in Dublin and in many other parts of the country that a number of the ships the property of Irish Shipping, Ltd., ships purchased by the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures, have not been lost by an act of war, but have been lost because of the fact that they were not seaworthy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>A short time ago, replying to a question in relation to the butter shortage, the Minister explained that the shortage was due to an abnormally high consumption of butter.  Even the Minister must be aware that not alone in Dublin, but in many parts of the country, butter is not available.  The reason for this is largely due to the fact that as much as 7/6 a lb. is being paid by North of Ireland people, who take as much butter as they can lay hands on out of the country.  It is also a fact, I understand, that considerable quantities of butter are being sent by rail to Belfast from Southern Ireland.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Deputy know who sends it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JosephHannigan" hpid="Dr. Hannigan Dr. Hannigan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Hannigan</NameTxt>
      <P>I think, having regard to the terrible hardships which the community in general has to suffer, that some steps ought to be taken by the Minister and his 800 officers to check up on these activities and see if something cannot be done about them. I need hardly point out to the Minister that a shortage of butter is very serious, especially so far as the health of children is concerned.  In Dundalk <Col N="1940" /> and Ardee and that district school-going children have to do with dry bread.  That will give rise later to a serious form of disease known as rickets.  Already we have had a sufficient amount of malnutrition.  In view of what I have just stated, the position in that respect is bound to grow worse, due to the muddling of this expensive Department of Supplies.</P>
      <P>Last year I urged that a proper attempt should be made by the State to organise the collection of scrap metal, the material which is most largely used in the manufacture of producer plants for motor cars.  I suggested then, and repeat now, that the long distance buses ought to be provided with these plants.  I do not say there is plenty of this scrap metal in the country, but whatever of it is there should be collected and saved from the black market.  If that were done there could be a considerable development in the manufacture of these producer plants.  It is a pity to see so many of them being used on vehicles that are not engaged on work which could, even by the wildest stretch of the imagination, be described as of national importance. What happened was that shortly before the Order dealing with them was made, a tip was broadcast that people who bought cars with producer plants would be permitted to use them during the emergency.  There was one particular firm in Dublin, doing a lucrative trade in these plants, and it was able to give that advice to its customers.  The result is that quite a number of these cars are in commission.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Likewise in regard to clothes. Almost everybody could tell you six months before the Order was made that the austerity suits were coming. The result has been that old bachelors, with plenty of money, have provided themselves with 12 or 14 suits, more, in fact, than they will ever live to wear out.  That kind of thing has been going on practically all the time. The Minister, who has a very agile mind, uses the opportunity which the radio and this House sometimes provide for him of making some kind of <Col N="1941" /> sensational statement in order to try to divert the attention of the people in general from the failures of his Department and of the discomforts they are thereby suffering.  The Minister announced to-day that in a short time we are not likely to have any more petrol.  I do not know.  That may be so, but up to the present the Minister's prophecies have been like his election promises&mdash;largely false. However, we shall see what will happen.  I pointed out earlier the considerable waste there is so far as paper supplies are concerned.  I suggested that the waste was largely brought about by the destruction of millions of forms relating to rationing and so on.</P>
    <P>On this Estimate, I want to draw the Minister's attention to something which has been brought to his notice on a few other occasions lately.  I think that the Minister, even at this late stage, might mend his hand with regard to the unfair discrimination that is being used by him against the <i>Kilkenny People</i> in the matter of withholding from that paper the publication of Orders and advertisements relating to his Department.  This is a clear example of political discrimination being used against a paper for no other reason than that the Minister does not like the tone of its articles. We had alongside with that the example of a paper in Dundalk which has a negligible circulation but which has something a little more important, a colleague of the Minister's on its board of directors.  I do not think that it is too late, even at this stage, for the Minister to mend his hand in relation to the unfair attitude of his Department towards the <i>Kilkenny People.</i>  I hope that we will hear from other speakers in this debate a reference to this particular matter.</P>
    <P>As I said earlier the shortage of many essential commodities and of many foodstuffs is not so much due to the war situation as to the failure of the Department to plan and take precautions to guard against that situation. The Minister now states that our transport services are in a critical condition. The future outlook is, in fact, not only bad but alarming.  Here again we have a serious situation <Col N="1942" /> created by the lack of foresight of the Minister.  Round about 1940, after the retreat from Dunkirk, the Great Southern Railways Company was offered 1,000,000 tons of coal at 20/- per ton.  The company was not in a financial position to purchase that quantity of coal.  It applied to the Government for assistance, and it was turned down. That is a glaring example.  Had the Government taken proper steps in regard to coal supplies as in other matters, it could have provided this country against a dislocation of its transport services for a period of at least five years.</P>
    <P>As to the point made by the Minister with regard to the revocation of licences held by people who have been fined for profiteering, many people believe that the Minister, who has discretionary powers in the matter, is discriminating against certain traders. Nobody will find fault with the Minister for taking the most drastic and rigorous steps to protect the community against the activities of profiteers and the black market.  At the same time, there would be much wider satisfaction if, in dealing with a case, the Minister would act on the recommendation of the district justice who tried such a case as to whether he should revoke the licence or not.  I fail to understand the Minister's difficulties in the matter.  A very good case can be put forward on behalf of a trader that he had made a mistake and that there was no desire on his part to defraud and a great deal of evidence can be brought forward in support of such a contention.  Therefore, I suggest to the Minister that, if an impartial recommendation were to come from the court in a particular case, he would be in a much better position to decide the matter.</P>
    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no doubt that the Minister has a very big and a difficult task at present in dealing with supplies.  The question of foodstuffs probably touches the community most at the moment, and perhaps it would be only right to refer to some of the actions taken against retail grocers.  In Dublin and district I understand that there are over 2,000 people engaged in that trade and, <Col N="1943" /> when the rest of the country is taken into consideration, the number would be very much higher.  There is no doubt that in dealing with such a number of people as that and with the items they have to supply the public with there is a very wide margin both for justifiable mistakes and, possibly, unjustifiable mistakes.  There has been a sort of committee formed from members of this House and the Seanad and some people representing the trade.  I understand that the Minister is prepared to receive sympathetically representations made by that body. These people are not trying to defend black sheep in the trade, any more than the traders themselves are.  But, certainly where a licence is revoked by the Minister, it only ought to be for what I would describe as an aggravated offence.  Where there is an error of omission, there ought to be some consideration given before a person is deprived of his licence.  Each case would have to be discussed on its merits.  I think that across the floor of this House would be a very unsatisfactory way of discussing the pros and cons of an individual trader's case, the punishment meted out, or what was to be done to others who committed a similar offence.  Therefore, if the Minister is prepared to receive the deputation I have mentioned, I think that is the most satisfactory way of dealing with the matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is the old difficulty in discussing the Department of Supplies and the Department of Industry and Commerce. The Minister towards the conclusion of his speech gave us a very brief summary of what he considered the duty of the Department of Supplies. I take it that the post-war situation falls under the heading of the Department of Industry and Commerce. In a matter such as supplies one has a very big field, and I only propose to deal with one item, namely turf.  I think the Minister said the price of turf in Dublin was 64/6, or that it was one of the prices, and that the subsidy was 23/6 per ton.  Some Deputy asked did that make the cost of turf 88/-, and I understood the Minister to agree.  I take it that in that 23/6 per ton subsidy is included the <Col N="1944" /> £280,000 Supplementary Estimate that we heard of at the opening of the Dáil to-day under sub-head G.  I do not know whether sub-head K (1)&mdash;£522,000 &mdash;is included.  I hope the Minister will clear up that point.  I include sub-head K (1) as part of the cost of the scheme of getting out turf, and that would bring the cost up by another £1 per ton.  Would it be too much to ask the Minister if the sum under sub-head K (1) is included in the 23/6 mentioned by him?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I understood. My argument is that that puts practically another £1 per ton on the cost of turf.</P>

    <Speaker pid="HenryMDockrell" hpid="Mr. Dockrell Mr. Dockrell">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dockrell</NameTxt>
      <P>We will call it £1.  You can put me up to 23/- if you like.  What I am getting at is that the acquisition of sites really ought to be part of the cost of getting out the turf.  I make the Minister a present of the argument, if he makes it, that the cost of the pure turf was only 88/-.  But this puts another £1 a ton on it, which brings the cost of the turf to the State to £5 a ton.  In other words, the turf is being sold to the people at £3, and it is costing the country £5.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been calculated 2¼ tons of turf are equivalent of 1 ton of coal.  If you multiply £5 by 2¼ you get over £11.  In other words, if you could get coal at £11 a ton it would be equal to 2¼ tons of turf at £5 a ton.  Of course, the Minister may say that he has done his best to get coal; that he has done his best to come to an arrangement with our friends across the water and that he cannot get coal, that it is not there. I do not know if it has escaped the Minister's attention that, during the <Col N="1945" /> present crisis on the other side, coal is treated so as to extract certain essential ingredients and a product is left which is practically as good as the original coal.  It seems to me impossible of belief that some greater supply could not be got of, at any rate, that material from the other side.</P>
    <P>There is another matter to which I would like to direct the Minister's attention&mdash;and I do so in all sincerity. Practically every grate or boiler is designed for fuel of a certain kind.  It works economically on that fuel and it works uneconomically on any other fuel.  In other words, coal grates are not satisfactory for turf and turf or wood grates or boilers simply swallow coal.  That means that at the present time, although there is a border-line, and certain receptacles will burn almost any fuel with some efficiency&mdash; broadly speaking, you must have a boiler or grate designed for the particular fuel which you burn in it.  If the figures that I have given are any guide, it means that in the post-war period, as soon as coal is available again, people will cease to burn turf. Has the Minister looked at the end of the road and considered where all this turf-development is leading to, if we cannot continue it in the post-war period and if the figures I have quoted are correct?</P>
    <P>The Minister said, and we all know, that the country is desperately short of petrol.  For a long period, five-ton lorries used to come up from the West of Ireland driven by petrol and loaded with turf.  I think that has more or less stopped now, but I do not know how it was economical.  Certainly that system could not be stopped soon enough.  I would ask the Minister, when replying, to give us some idea as to where we are going in the production of turf and what we hope to achieve by it.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister's speech was somewhat of a mixed grill.  Some portion was digestible, other portions indigestible and it was flavoured with appetising sauces.  He commenced by telling us that the flour position was good and will improve.  He said the sugar position will improve and that <Col N="1946" /> the butter position will be eased.  We must tender to him our congratulations in regard to those three matters. We are all glad to know that the sugar position will improve and that the butter situation will be eased.  Our hopes were somewhat shattered, however, when he came to the tea question and told us that the tea position was serious and that if he could keep up our present supply he would be fairly lucky.  I had earnestly hoped that he personally would have gone to England and asked those who purchase our supplies to give us a little extra supply.  I understand the people across the water still get two ounces of tea per person.  If the Minister could keep our supply even at one ounce per person it would be something to be grateful for.  I had hoped that he might be able to give us a two-ounce ration.  The Minister went on to say that the petrol position was rather &mdash;I think he used the word &ldquo;alarming.&rdquo; He did not say &ldquo;bristling with difficulties&rdquo; but he went on on that line. He said Deputies in their constituencies should ask people not to use paraffin or candles unless in country districts where it was essential.</P>

    <P>I agree with the Minister.  I think that is very proper advice.  It is only right that paraffin and candles should be kept for those who need them.  But the Minister forgot to mention the Dublin tenements.  Residents in some of the Dublin tenements, where there is neither gas nor electricity, were used to small paraffin oil lamps or candles.  At the present moment there appears to be great difficulty about candles.  I met people in the street within the last couple of days who were going around looking for candles. I earnestly hope that when the time comes for an allocation to be made the Minister will see that people living in tenement rooms or cottages that are not provided with gas or electricity will get some ration so that they will not be forced to travel the city looking for candles and paying a high price for them.  The Minister also mentioned that gas-producer plants would be available for commercial vehicles.  I appeal to the Minister to see that our transport company&mdash;the Dublin United Transport Company, formerly <Col N="1947" /> known as the Dublin United Tramways Company&mdash;which carries thousands of passengers to and from their employment every day, will get a fair share, to have regard to the passengers whom the company carry to and from their work in the city and county of Dublin, and to see that if a gas-producer plant quota is to be made available for others, the company will get a quota also.  The Minister paid a tribute&mdash;a very proper tribute&mdash;to our shipping services.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Local Government and Public Health (Mr. MacEntee)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  During a recent debate on a motion by Deputy Cole proposing that the general election, now impending under the law, should not take place during the continuance of the war in Europe, the Taoiseach adverted to the danger which would be inherent in the situation, if, while Dáil Eireann stood dissolved, a grave emergency were to confront the State.  It is true that the Constitution confers on the Government very wide powers in time of war and during a period of national emergency, but none the less in certain matters the assent of Dáil Eireann to actions taken by the Government is essential.  For instance, even in so grave a situation as an actual invasion, the Dáil would have to be summoned at the earliest possible time, so that the Government in its actions would be upheld by the unmistakable support of the representatives of the people.  The importance, therefore, in these critical times of keeping Dáil Eireann in being, even during a general election, will be appreciated.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The House having been practically unanimous as to the unwisdom of deferring the general election now imminent beyond the time which the <Col N="1948" /> law, as it stands at the moment, prescribes, it has been necessary to consider the problem very closely in an endeavour to devise a procedure which will diminish to the utmost the period between the dissolution of the present Dáil and the institution or summoning of the Dáil which will be called together after the forthcoming general election.  In the normal course, as prescribed by the existing law, a general election is completed and the personnel of the new Dáil is settled three or four weeks after the dissolution of the outgoing Chamber.  Not only that, but as the law stands at present the present Dáil, being dissolved, cannot be summoned or reconstituted during that interval, no matter what the circumstances&mdash;even, indeed, if they were such as would prevent a general election being held.</P>
    <P>The aim of this Bill is to make the contingency of there being no Dáil as nearly impossible as may be. For this purpose, it prescribes the procedure by which the outgoing Dáil will be kept in existence until the general election has been completed and the personnel of the new Dáil definitely settled by the vote of the electorate.  As auxiliary to that, it gives to the Minister for Local Government the necessary authority to ensure that the election, and I may say, in particular, the counting of the votes, will be conducted and completed with due expedition.</P>
    <P>It also includes certain consequential provisions for the continuance of the Ceann Comhairle in his membership of Dáil Eireann and for the adaptation of the legislation governing the election of the elected members of Seanad Eireann.  I should emphasise that all these provisions relate only to a general election held during the period of the present national emergency.  As soon as that emergency is declared by the Oireachtas to have passed, the power and authority to be given under this Bill will lapse, and the existing law and existing procedure will be reverted to unless in the meantime the Oireachtas, by further legislation, decides to modify it in any particular.</P>
    <P>A reference to the particular sections <Col N="1949" /> of the Bill will indicate how the policy I have outlined will be carried into effect.  Section 1 is the definition section. Under this section, the phrase which is used in the Bill, and particularly in Section 2, &ldquo;the present national emergency&rdquo; is limited to mean the emergency which the Oireachtas has already declared to exist by resolutions passed on the 2nd day of September, 1939.  By this definition, therefore, the duration of the Act is confined, as I have said, to the duration of the present emergency.</P>
    <P>In the definition section distinction is also made between the incoming Dáil and the outgoing Dáil, so as to make it clear that the expression &ldquo;outgoing Dáil&rdquo; applies to the Dáil immediately present; while the expression &ldquo;incoming Dáil&rdquo; relates to the Dáil Eireann, the members of which are elected at such a general election.  Section 2 will authorise the Taoiseach, instead of advising the President, as at present, to dissolve the Dáil, to advise him to direct that a general election shall take place. Under this section, the provisions of the Electoral Acts which relate to matters to be done consequent on a dissolution will have effect as though a proclamation by the President, directing a general election to be held, were a proclamation dissolving Dáil Eireann. The election will be held on a date, after the proclamation, to be fixed by the Minister for Local Government and Public Health, and, naturally, in that regard, the Minister will conform as closely as possible with the provisions of the present electoral law, and the precedents which have been established under it.</P>
    <P>Section 3 of the Bill directs that when the election has been held, and the Clerk of Dáil Eireann has received from each Returning Officer the names of the persons elected for the constituency concerned, the Clerk will certify to the Taoiseach that the election in that constituency has been completed.  The Taoiseach will thereupon, not later than two days after he has received the certificate from the Clerk of Dáil Eireann, advise the President to dissolve Dáil Eireann&mdash;that is, the outgoing Dáil&mdash;and summon the new Dáil, <Col N="1950" /> the &ldquo;incoming Dáil,&rdquo; to meet.  In the event of the Clerk's certificate not being forthcoming, by reason of the non-completion of the election in one or two constituencies, due, perhaps, to the death of a candidate, or some such occurrence, as sometimes has happened in the past, the Taoiseach must, within 16 days after the polling date give similar advice to the President&mdash; that is, to dissolve the outgoing Dáil and summon the new Dáil.  If, however, something should arise after the poll which would make the completion of the election in a considerable number of constituencies impossible, or which would render it impossible to complete the election, then, I should like to point out, that the outgoing Dáil&mdash;that is, the present Dáil&mdash; could meet to deal with that situation. However, I hope and trust that nothing will arise which will prevent the completion of the election in the ordinary course.  I just want to point out that so long as the outgoing Dáil is in being it can meet to deal with any widespread situation which might prevent the holding and completion of the proposed general election&mdash;or, indeed, any danger which might arise.</P>
    <P>I think there will be no doubt about the wisdom of these provisions.  It appears to me to be quite reasonable to require that Dáil Eireann shall be dissolved not later than 16 days after the poll.  That is the extreme limit. Normally, it will be dissolved within two days after the Clerk of the Dáil has certified to the Taoiseach that the election has been completed, but if for one reason or another the Clerk is not in a position to give a complete or full certificate in regard to every constituency, nevertheless a limit is fixed in this Bill within which the Dáil must be dissolved.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Then, as I have said, this Dáil would be summoned to meet and deal with that position and make provision accordingly.  Let us say that the election is never completed as a result of some catastrophe or another, and that such a happening would make <Col N="1951" /> it clear to us that it could not be completed, then this Dáil would be summoned to deal with that situation.</P>
    </Speaker>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, within the 14 days.  Of course, the Government would also have power under the Emergency Powers Act to deal with such a situation, but I presume that, naturally, it would want to be fortified by the concurrence of the Dáil.  There might be a delay as a result of the death of a candidate, in which event a fresh election would have to take place in the one constituency affected, but I think it will be conceded that it would not be right to delay the dissolution of the Dáil mainly because the result in one constituency had been delayed by some such circumstance. I might point out in connection with Section 3 that in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of that section, the latest date which can be fixed for the summoning of the Dáil, after the Taoiseach has advised dissolution, is the seventh day, and I propose to ask the House to extend that period to the fourteenth day.  That extension will bring the whole procedure into closer conformity with the existing procedure which provides that the new Dáil must assemble within 30 days after the taking of the poll.</P>
      <P>The period of office of members of Dáil Eireann is fixed by Section 4. Under this section the outgoing members of the Dáil would continue to hold office until the Dáil is dissolved, and the incoming members would become members on the next day after the outgoing Dáil is dissolved.  The duration of the life of Dáil Eireann is fixed by Section 7 of the Electoral (Amendment) Act of 1927.  According to that Act, therefore, the present Dáil must be dissolved not later than the 30th June, next.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1952" /> Section 5 of this Bill preserves in full force the existing provisions of Section 7 of the Act of 1927 but, as a precaution, provides that if the President, in the exercise of the powers proposed to be conferred on him by this Bill, directs that a general election shall take place the present Dáil will continue until it is dissolved under the new enactment.  In the event of certain contingencies materialising, it might happen that, under this section, an outgoing Dáil, in fact, would not be dissolved until a few days before June 30th, but I should say that this is unlikely.  The House understands that at present, if it were not for the need to make this special provision to maintain a Dáil in being during the general election, the date of dissolution of this Dáil could be the 29th June, the date of nominations would be the 8th or 9th July, and the date of the poll might be as far back as the 22nd or 23rd July. The actual date of dissolution has not yet been fixed, and it might happen, due either to the difficulty in getting back the writs or to the fact that there are 14 days within which the Taoiseach has the option of advising the President to dissolve the Dáil, if he does not receive the certificate from the Clerk, that the life of the present Dáil would extend a few days beyond the 30th June next.  But, under normal circumstances, we may take it that, under this Bill, this Dáil will be finally dissolved some time before the 16th July.  The general election will, of course, be declared&mdash; probably polling will take place&mdash;before the 30th June.  Perhaps, in saying that, I am going outside my province&mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>&mdash;&mdash;because that is a matter about which the Taoiseach will have the final decision.  I want, however, to make quite clear to the House what the general effect of this section would be, without going too deeply into matters which are not my special province.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Provision is made in Section 6 for the continuance, as a member of <Col N="1953" /> Dáil Eireann, of the Ceann Comhairle. Under the existing law the Ceann Comhairle is deemed to be re-elected when he has not announced to Dáil Eireann, before the dissolution, that he does not desire to become a member of the Dáil which will ensue on the dissolution.  Under this Bill, as the election will precede the dissolution, it is necessary to provide for the adaptation of the provisions of the Electoral (Chairman of Dáil Eireann) Act, 1937. Furthermore, in view of the altered procedure, certain forms already prescribed under the principal Electoral Act will require adaptation.  Express power to make such adaptations is conferred by Section 7, as well as power to modify the Electoral Acts to expedite the conduct and completion of the elections.  I think it will be conceded that, in the particular circumstances of this time, everything should be done to get the counts in the various constituencies completed as expeditiously as possible.  We all know at previous general elections in some constituencies the results of counts have been deferred for a week, and possibly even longer.  We are anxious that the counting of the votes should proceed simultaneously in all constituencies and that the count should be carried through as speedily as possible.  The law relating to the election of the elected members of the Seanad will also require to be adapted so as to secure that the Seanad elections will be completed as soon as possible after the new Dáil assembles, and provision will have to be made so that the newly elected Dáil members will vote at the election of panel members of the Seanad.  Section 8 of the Bill provides for that.  That is, I think, a very detailed statement of the provisions of this Bill.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brennan Mr. Brennan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brennan</NameTxt>
      <P>As the Minister pointed out, on a recent occasion there was a discussion here on the subject of having no election during the emergency. On that occasion fears were expressed, particularly from this side of the House, that difficulties might arise consequent upon the crisis and that those difficulties would be accentuated nationally if there was no Dáil <Col N="1954" /> in existence.  Very grave fears were expressed that the consequences might be disastrous if certain steps were deemed necessary to be taken by Dáil Eireann and if at the time there was no Dáil Eireann in existence.  I take it this Bill is simply to provide the necessary machinery to ensure that there will be no period or, at least, that there will be only a very short period without the existence of a Dáil, which could be called together if necessary.</P>
      <P>When the Minister refers to adaptation of enactments and rules with regard to the conduct of an election, it makes me rather fearful that there might be interference by the Minister with the existing regulations.  He said that they would conform as closely as possible to the existing regulations. They will, I am sure, follow the same course&mdash;at least they ought to.  There does not appear to be any reason why they should do otherwise.  Those things always have to be done with meticulous care and people are very anxious that no stones shall be thrown with regard to the conduct of the elections. If the Taoiseach and the President feel that an election can be held, then surely the regulations governing elections, regulations which have governed procedure in the past, can be followed just as closely as in the old days.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think there is anything that calls for special comment at this stage. There are some matters which, in Committee, will have to be clarified, but at the moment, so far as we are concerned, we favour the Bill because we feel that there ought to be no period in the present emergency in which the country will be left without a Dáil, if it should be necessary to summon it.  It is questionable if a measure of this sort might not be made a permanent measure.  After all, emergencies arise from time to time, emergencies of a different nature.  I am not suggesting that it ought be made a permanent measure, but we might possibly form a judgment upon its operation and we might find that, on the whole, it would be better to be in the position, if an emergency of any sort should arise, to call together the elected Parliament of the people to decide on major issues, <Col N="1955" /> on matters of very great importance to the country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter I want to raise because I do not think it is quite clear from the Bill itself. This Bill is part of the Taoiseach's undertaking to make a general election this year less objectionable than it otherwise would be.  Deputy MacEoin, who expressed dissent from the view held by the rest of his Party as to the expediency of holding a general election this year, said that the substance of this Bill would largely remove his objections to the holding of a general election this year.  It does not abolish mine.  I think that the holding of a general election this year is a very reckless thing.  The proper course to pursue, instead of introducing this Bill, would be for the Taoiseach to invite the other Parties in Dáil Eireann to form a national government with him.  He is the only man who can do it, but, inasmuch as he has declared that he will not, we are faced with the situation where his will and his will alone is going to prevail.  Our job, therefore, is to make the consequences of that extremely reckless decision as little dangerous as we can.  If that is the purpose of this Bill&mdash;to remove some of the perils involved in the Taoiseach's adamantine refusal to co-operate with anybody except his own tried and trusted yes-men from the Fianna Fáil Party&mdash;then, I think, there is something to be said for this Bill.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think the country should be presented with this Bill without being fully advised that its necessity arises from the interesting fact that Eamon de Valera, Taoiseach of Eire, announces that whatever the dangers involved for this country he is damned if he will co-operate with anybody except somebody who is notoriously a yes-man of the Fianna Fáil Party and who, in the last analysis, will do what he tells him.  The country ought to be reminded that this Bill is made necessary by the fact that the Taoiseach, Eamon de Valera, has announced that he will not sit in Cabinet with anybody who has an independent mind; <Col N="1956" /> that those with whom he sits down at the Cabinet table must give an initial undertaking that, in a last analysis, they will do what de Valera tells them, and if they do not give that undertaking he will not co-operate with them.  Well, of course, faced with that situation, unparalleled in any other country in the world at the present time, we must pursue the policy of <i>sauve qui peut.</i></P>
    <P>Judged by that standard there is a good deal to be said for this measure. It is not the first piece of legislation that we have had to pass to insulate the country from the consequences of Eamon de Valera's activities, and I suppose it will not be the last.  The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the situation that would develop in the event of this country being involved in a major catastrophe in the middle of a general election.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health has gone so far as to envisage the possibility of an invasion during a general election.</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>
      <P>I have not envisaged an invasion during a general election.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Envisage may not be the word, but the Minister allowed to peep forth from the back of his mind a doubt that there might conceivably arise a situation in which the country would be invaded during a general election.  I am not suggesting that he spoke of the probability; he envisaged no more than the possibility, but this is a pretty substantial monument to the fact that that apprehension is very real in his mind.  If it was a mere phantasmagoria, why introduce a Parliamentary Bill to deal with it? If its purpose was to soothe the ruffled feelings of Deputy MacEoin, then Fianna Fáil is much more soft-hearted than I have ever known it to be.  When we speak of the great dangers that surround this country and that possibly might confront us during the holding of a general election, everybody of course knows well what we are thinking of&mdash;that the Germans might stage a sea-borne invasion of this country during a general election and catch us on the wrong foot.  That is the plain <Col N="1957" /> purpose of the Bill.  We know that the Minister for Local Government is apprehensive that the Germans will land here in the middle of an election, assassinate the Taoiseach and murder any public men they can put their hands on as they have done in so many countries.  With that at the back of his mind, the Taoiseach says: &ldquo;Even though that danger is one which requires to be provided against, I am damned if I will sit at any table except one with &lsquo;yes&rsquo; men.&rdquo;  It is an interesting thought.  Dáil Eireann should not forget it, and the Taoiseach's supporters should not forget it.</P>
      <P>These facts being true, let us look at the provision that is being made.  We are going to keep the existing Dáil in being, so that in the event of the Germans landing here, we will still have a Government to resist them.  Well, that is good.  We ought to have a Government to resist them, and Dáil Eireann, which is a democratically elected assembly, is the only assembly fit to provide it.  We will provide it, we will resist them, and, with the assistance of the Americans and the British, we will put them out.  In order to do that it is vital that this Dáil should be effectively kept in being.  The Bill provides that the existing Dáil must come to an end on the expiration of 14 days after polling day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Germans land there will be a great measure of public confusion.  It may become necessary to summon Dáil Eireann to meet in some provincial city, in some part of our territory not invaded.  Some considerable <Col N="1958" /> difficulty may be experienced in getting the Dáil to assemble.  What is the purpose of putting in that limitation in an emergency measure?  I agree that if this Bill were to become part of the regular law, such a provision might be necessary to provide against bad faith.  Would it not be better to provide somewhere that, in the event of the new Dáil not being completed or not being available, and until it did meet, the old Dáil would continue to provide the Government of the country?  Is there no form of words we could employ which would ensure that the old Dáil would not go out of existence until the new Dáil actually met.</P>
      <P>Deputy Brennan, when speaking, mentioned that the purpose of the Bill clearly was that the period when the Government would be without the support of the Dáil should be a minimum one, apparently a period of 12 or 24 hours.  Would it not be as easy to provide that when the Ceann Comhairle, who remains a member of both Dála, owing to his automatic re-election, takes the Chair of the new Dáil the calling of that body to order would operate as the dissolution of the old body, thus ensuring absolute continuity and making it perfectly manifest that unless and until he calls to order a body which he describes from the Chair as the new Dáil, the old Dáil continues to function and that, if the circumstances compelled him to preside over a body of Deputies which was in fact the old Dáil, he would be perfectly free to call the old Dáil to order and proceed to legislate, inasmuch as he had not yet had an opportunity of meeting the new Dáil?  That is a very rough outline of what is in my mind and the correct procedure for achieving the end I have in view possibly might be quite different from that which I envisage.  But the Minister will take my point.  What I wish to secure would be absolute continuity so that, no matter where we met or under what circumstances, so long as the Ceann Comhairle or his representative was present, some Dáil would function which would have full authority to speak on behalf of the Irish people.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="1959" /> There is another point to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention. Section 3 (2) (a) provides:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Immediately upon the completion of such general election the Clerk of Dáil Eireann shall certify in writing to the Taoiseach that such general election has been completed.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Is the Clerk of Dáil Eireann a corporation sole?  Is it not better to say &ldquo;the Clerk of Dáil Eireann, or a person designated by him&rdquo; so as to provide, in the event of the Clerk of Dáil Eireann being incapacitated, which God forbid, some person would be permitted to act on his behalf?  My experience of both Estimates and Bills is that in providing for these matters there is a tendency to draft them too tightly, so that sometimes you find yourself in an extremely awkward position through having too closely confined the authority to do certain things to an individual public servant, whereas the important thing is to make it obligatory that the thing shall be done by somebody, rather than that some particular public servant shall do it.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JohnACostello" hpid="Mr. Costello Mr. Costello">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Costello</NameTxt>
      <P>There is just one point I should like to mention.  Deputy Brennan suggested, I think, in passing that he would like to see this measure made a permanent measure.  I want to register my view that it should be as strictly impermanent as possible, because what I can see emerging from this legislation is a whole series of Dála.  We may have two Dála, one that has been in existence if the other Bill which is coming before us providing for a six years period is passed, and another one that is just elected as the result of a general election with members of one Dáil defeated in that general election.  What is the position then?  We have a Dáil that is still a Dáil, and members who have been defeated at the general election can <Col N="1960" /> meet and pass a law extending the life of the Dáil and declaring that the last general election is null and void.  I think that we ought to handle this particular type of legislation with very great care and not be misled into thinking that what we have in this actually is some wonderful constitutional discovery.  This should be as strictly limited as possible.  I do not like the fact that this Bill is extended to the duration of the present national emergency.  I agree that it must operate during the present national emergency, but the present national emergency, as defined, may be years after this war is over.  I do not know where the Bill will lead us.  I think we ought to be very careful indeed.  I take the view that this Bill ought to be given a life of one year from the date of its passing.</P>

      <P>I do not like to sound a discordant note, but I do not like the Bill at all.  Perhaps I might go so far as to say that I do not see any necessity for it.  The public will get the impression that there is some terrible danger overhanging us at the moment, that the danger is far larger than it really is.  The word &ldquo;invasion&rdquo; has been mentioned.  We are dealing at the present moment with a most important matter.  We are taking out of the hands of the people who sent us here certain rights and powers. Each of us was elected in 1938, or at a by-election since, to serve a definite time in Parliament.  Our period of office is to be extended so far as I could make out from the Minister's statement, by a period of 16 days, perhaps more in certain circumstances.</P>

    <P>Whether it is only two days, or 16 days, or two months, we are taking upon ourselves something that the people did not intend us to do and we are exercising certain powers which the people did not intend us to have. We have not had a proper explanation, nor are we having a proper discussion, as to what exactly is the danger.  I am absolutely tired of going around the country listening to people and having to say things myself.  We are all speaking in parables.  I want to know what the danger is.  In response to the <Col N="1961" /> appeal of the Government, I appeared on public platforms in my constituency supporting the setting up of various defence services in this country, but we spoke without exactly knowing what the danger was.  Now the position will be that the public will imagine there is some terrific danger overshadowing us at the moment as the result of which we cannot hold a general election.  If the danger is great I would be satisfied to let the Government carry on without Parliament, because I do not see how Parliament will function.  If we are to talk in concrete phrases and say that the danger is invasion, I wish to say that my opinion is that that is altogether wrong.  I do not believe we were ever in danger of invasion from any side. If the Government ever had such information, it can be described as having been very well guarded and, possibly, wisely guarded.  So far as the general public are concerned, there is no evidence whatever that there was ever any danger of an invasion.  I do not know what emergency exists which should prevent us from holding a general election in the ordinary way. For that reason I think this Bill is not exactly necessary.</P>
    <P>The next point is that when the discussion took place here as to whether there should be a general election or not, or whether legislation should be introduced to extend the life of this Parliament owing to the emergency, a number of people advanced the very correct view that those of us who did not belong to the Government Party could not possibly consent to the extension of the life of Parliament as long as Party Government continued in existence.  It seems to me that what we are doing here is, that we are saying that we are prepared to remain on as a Parliament after the time when a dissolution should take place and still consent to the existence of a Party Government.</P>
    <P>It may be only a small matter.  Parliament may exist only for a week or a fortnight after the date due for the dissolution but, at the same time, we would be consenting to the existence of a Party Government at a time when we would in the normal course of <Col N="1962" /> events ceased to have functioned as a Parliament.  I do not know whether I make myself quite clear on that point.  I wish to emphasise that I do not want to be a party to any measure which would suggest the continuance beyond the appropriate date of this Parliament, supporting the existence of a Party Government.</P>
    <P>The third matter I would like to refer to is this: This is an emergency measure.  This measure is brought in after full consideration by the Government who, with the information they have at their disposal, feel that we are going through very serious times and that these serious times may reach their peak during a general election. I am accepting the proposition that there is a serious emergency, danger of&mdash;call it invasion, or anything you like.  I am taking it that the Government are accepting the position that they have the country behind them on that.  Since this election campaign has opened&mdash;because undoubtedly it has opened during the last few weeks &mdash;there has gone around the country a whispering campaign to the effect that if the present Government is not returned to power there is a danger that our neutrality will be interfered with; there is danger that we may be invaded and danger that we may be brought into the war.  That is a whispering campaign.  During the local elections I heard a Government speaker saying words to that effect. He was a candidate going up for local election.  He was not a member of this House or of the Seanad but there were members of the Seanad and of this House in the crowd and at that particular meeting.</P>
    <P>I think the Government should make it perfectly clear to the country that they deem it necessary to introduce this measure because they consider this is a very serious situation and that these are very serious times, so serious that they consider Dáil Eireann should not come to an end until the new Dáil is elected and ready to function.  They should say that the situation is so serious that they appreciate&mdash;as they must appreciate&mdash; that so far as the members of this <Col N="1963" /> House are concerned they are one behind the Government and that the country is one behind the Government and that, so far as any question of altering the Government or any question of any Party having to form a Government is concerned, they have received the fullest support from other Parties in this House and that any such whispering campaign that is going around has no foundation whatsoever in fact.</P>

I respectfully say it is as important to impress upon the public that if there is a danger that that danger is a danger from without and not a danger that is created by any Party inside the country.  Deputy Dillon has been very vocal while I was speaking.  He mentioned the word &ldquo;invasion&rdquo;.  I will finish on this note, that there is an invasion in this country at the moment; it is in the Six Counties.  If he wants to talk about invasion, I will say that is where the invasion is&mdash;in the Six Counties.</P>

I do not know if it is travelling about the country, but I do know that it is in the West of Ireland and it is due to the fact that an election is due.</P>

I do deplore two speeches which were made.  I deplore Deputy Dillon's speech and I equally deplore Deputy Esmonde's speech.  Deputy Esmonde wants us to tell the country why do we fear invasion and why do we fear the present international situation.  We are not in the counsels of any of the belligerents, but we do know that our country occupies a very important strategical position in the theatre of war and that, so long as it does that&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;we must be apprehensive, and everybody in this country must be apprehensive as to the future course of events here.  It is because this House is naturally apprehensive in that regard that the suggestion was made that, since the general election must be held, some procedure should be devised which would minimise and diminish the possibility of danger to the utmost extent possible. That is the reason for the Bill.  I did not suggest that this Bill was brought in because we were in danger of actual invasion.  Deputy Dillon is apparently incapable of apprehending what another person says.  But what I did say was this, that it was necessary for the Government in certain circumstances to act with the Dáil, that if, for instance, an invasion took place it would be necessary to summon the Dáil.  That is a long way from saying that an invasion is imminent, as Deputy Dillon suggested.</P>

We have tried to do that, but I think that it would not be rational to limit it for a shorter period than the continuance of the present emergency.  If at any time there is a feeling in the House that a briefer period should be put to the currency of the provisions contained in the Bill, no doubt, an amending Bill can be brought in for that purpose.</P>

If we do not get the Committee Stage on Friday, we shall not have it until a week or ten days after Easter. It will then have to go to the Seanad which may make changes in it, so that it would have to be considered here again.  I am anxious to get all the arrangements for the election in train at the earliest date possible.

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>In the debate on the Vote for the Department of Supplies, I had made reference to many matters which were causing alarm to the people.  I had dealt with the dangers <Col N="1967" /> of shortages and I was referring to the Minister's tribute to the shipping companies. I join in that tribute to the shipping companies for what they have done but we cannot forget that they could not have done what was done were it not for the gallantry of our sailors and firemen who took risks to bring us our supplies&mdash;those thousands of tons of wheat and other goods to which the Minister referred.  I often wonder if we sufficiently appreciate what has been done by our sailors and those who took risks every day to bring us food supplies so that we might live. On more than one occasion, they made the supreme sacrifice.  I ask the Government if we reward their dependents sufficiently when their breadwinners are lost in our service.  I join with the Minister in paying tribute to the shipping companies but a far greater tribute&mdash;a tribute words could not convey&mdash;should be paid to the men I have just mentioned.</P>
      <P>In another part of his speech, the Minister said that the clothing position was serious, and he outlined certain quotas for various types of clothing, silks, etc.  Will the Minister now take steps to see that a full quota of material will be available for clothing the children of the working classes?  A week ago I asked him to control prices and issue, with the aid of those engaged in the business, if possible, a schoolboy's suit.  I had in mind boys of 10 and 12 years old. Many boys and girls of this age are not properly clothed because of the cost of materials.  Within the past fortnight, I have seen barefooted children with little, linen, washed-out costumes, when they should have had heavy woollen or other good clothing. Some of the children were undernourished, too.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I know where the sympathy of the Minister lies, and I ask him to safeguard the interests of these children and to secure that quotas will not be given to any greater extent to those who make purchases in a more expensive market.  Expensive clothing is very tempting to those who have the money to buy it and they will make their purchases.  But if there is a <Col N="1968" /> ration of half an ounce of tea for everybody, the Minister should see that there will be a ration of cloth which will secure to these children clothing at a price which their parents can pay.  I say the same of food supplies and footwear.  I feel confident that the Minister will not overlook the points I have mentioned and that there will be a fair distribution of the materials at his disposal.</P>
    <P>One member of the House has referred to the turf position.  I was not quite sure whether we were to deal with that to-day or not.  There are very serious complaints on the part of people who sell turf in small lots. They complain to me that they have to go long distances to get supplies&mdash; that they have to bring them to the other end of the city.  I refer to the dump at Phoenix Park.  There was another very useful supply at Alexandra Basin&mdash;almost in the sea.  I should have thought that that dump would have been used for the people within two or three miles of it.  What is happening is that bellmen who serve people in the North Wall area have to go to the Phoenix Park to get their supplies.  On a recent date, before all supplies were removed by Fuel Importers, Limited, or those who are in the monopoly, I suggested that portion of the supply at North Wall should be left for the small men.  I had hoped that Fuel Importers, with their big lorries, in some cases petrol-drawn and in others horse-drawn, and the big merchants would have been sent to the Phoenix Park to draw the supplies to their yards, and that the unfortunate boy or girl with a donkey and cart, selling in small lots, would have been able to draw from the Alexandra Basin dump.  I thought that the benefits and the hardships would have been divided amongst Fuel Importers, the big merchants and the small merchants but that has not happened.</P>
    <P>I do appeal to the Minister to see that those men get a fair deal.  They are doing good work.  One often wonders what would happen if they did not harness the donkey and cart and go out in the morning to bring one stone or two stone lots of turf to 30 or 40 people.  I think we should be <Col N="1969" /> very grateful to them, and appreciate what they are doing, instead of making things difficult for them and doubting the genuineness of their complaints.</P>
    <P>Again I suggest to the Minister that he ought to extend his control of prices to things to which it does not yet apply.  I heard of a case where a builder in this city who was carrying out repairs to tenement and corporation houses travelled a long distance to purchase carpenters' two-inch wire nails.  Just on the eve of the emergency those nails cost £16 a ton.  Somebody had the cleverness to go around and collect them, believing that there would be a scarcity, and he backed a winner. That person was trying to decide what price he should charge for the nails now that they were scarce, and he thought the easiest way out of it was to take the £16 and put a nought after it.  He got £160 a ton for those nails, which were required to repair tenement houses in the City of Dublin. The grocer who makes a mistake and charges a ½d. too much for jam is heavily fined, but the fellow who charges £160 a ton for nails&mdash;I want to emphasise the point that they were not new nails made at new and increased costs&mdash;gets away with it.  I believe there are other cases, similar to that, in which the Minister ought to do something.  People should not be allowed to charge ten times the original price.</P>
    <P>I would again make my very special appeal that the Minister will do something in connection with getting the people a little extra tea.  They would appreciate it very much.  I believe he could get it; I would not impress it on him if I did not.  I believe that, if he went to England and asked them to increase our supply of tea, they would do so.  I would also repeat my appeal to him to see that the children of the working classes are properly clad.  I should not say &ldquo;working classes&rdquo;; they are unemployed.  If a man is working, he feeds and clothes his children to the best of his ability, but I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the type of person who has little or no income and is not able to meet the soaring costs of foodstuffs.</P>
    <P>Before I sit down, I want to make <Col N="1970" /> another appeal to the Minister&mdash;it was not to him I made it before&mdash;on behalf of the wives of our serving soldiers, who are not in a position adequately to clothe their children.  The allowances which our serving soldiers are getting are totally inadequate.  I have had letters from the wives of soldiers, who say:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Dear Alderman Byrne,</P>
    <P>Could you get my husband out of the Army so that he can go away and earn good wages to help me to feed the children?  I cannot do it on the allowance I am now getting.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to make an appeal to the Minister for Defence, or, if necessary, to the Cabinet, to see that increased allowances are given to provide the necessaries of life for the wives and children of our serving soldiers.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RobertBriscoe" hpid="Mr. Briscoe Mr. Briscoe">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>The Department of Supplies is the one Department to-day that has to defend itself against attacks from all sides and from all sections.  The Minister of that Department has to carry on his shoulders a great burden of responsibility, and in addition he has to deal with the dissatisfaction aroused by the so-called misdeeds of his Department.  Except from the last speaker, we have heard nothing but complaints about the Department. We have heard no expression of gratitude for the many gigantic tasks they have accomplished for the well-being of the community in general.  I admit that, while I see 99 per cent. of good from the activities of the Department, I am prepared to ventilate the 1 per cent. with which I disagree, but we should not forget that this little island of ours is in the middle of a world of turmoil, and that the greatest difficulties confront those responsible for trying to keep things on an even keel.  If we think that mistakes are being made, or that unnecessary hardships are being imposed, we should put forward the case as we see it, and be prepared to listen to the other side of the story.  If we cannot achieve what we believe is right, at least let us understand that what is being done by the Department is being done with the object of <Col N="1971" /> achieving the general well-being of the community.  Every day, indeed almost in every hour of every day, one hears various reasons put forward for certain activities of the Department of Supplies. People do not seem to realise that the desire of the Department is to achieve the well-being of the community. As far as the public is concerned, we should be grateful for the position we are in to-day.  If we compare the conditions here with those obtaining in any other country in the world, we will be driven to the conclusion that this country is the best place in the world at the present moment.  Therefore, as I said, the people ought to be grateful for that situation.</P>
      <P>I want to say to the Minister, and to his Department through him, that I find a general willingness on the part of the public to co-operate with the Department on all occasions.  From certain reactions, one imagines that there is a suspicion in the minds of the officials of the Department that some sections of the public are not willing to co-operate.  It is true that there are numbers of individuals who will not co-operate, so long as they can help it, but we are not concerned with those people.  The cross-section of the public is similar to the cross-section, say, of the Civil Service as a whole, or to the cross-section of the officials of the Department of Supplies.  When we reduce it down to the ordinary things of life, we are a nation of human beings and some human beings happen to be officials and very few officials happen to be Ministers.  I suppose, the fewer there are of certain types of officials, the more abuse they have to carry and the more responsibility they have to bear.  When it is all over, I suppose we will be able to decide and be wise after the event, as to whether we did right or wrong and whether we escaped well or were hurt very badly.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We notice that&mdash;very occasionally, fortunately&mdash;there is a bad civil servant, who has to appear in court for some misdemeanour; but that does not warrant the public believing that the public service, as a whole, is anything like that individual.  On the <Col N="1972" /> other hand, the Department of Supplies, in dealing with traders&mdash;and, particularly, with retail grocers&mdash; should realise that these people have a very heavy burden to carry and, if there are some offenders amongst them, that gives no cause to assume that every retail shopkeeper wishes to enrich himself at the expense of the community.</P>
    <P>Before going further, I would like to mention a matter which has been brought very strongly to my notice. The Department of Supplies, apparently, differentiates in commodities when they come to decide the quotas to be allocated.  In some cases, they act on the family basis and give quotas per head of a family.  The Department should reconsider the method by which they allocate quotas for turf.  At present, each householder is allowed a certain amount of turf per month, which cannot be purchased except in that month.  Whether he has a large family or a small family, the same amount of turf is delivered to each householder.  I happen to know that, in the City of Dublin, there are houses which are divided into sections, regarded as self-contained flats&mdash;in some cases consisting only of a room or two rooms.  You will find ten people living in such a building, each entitled to the same quantity of turf that a neighbour would have as head of a family of five or six children and domestic servants.  In cases of that kind, the Department of Supplies should loosen up a bit and have regard to what is required per head of a family.</P>
    <P>In regard to the retail grocers, I am one of those members of this House who happen to be on a self-formed committee to examine what appear to be certain grievances deserving of examination.  I happen to be chairman of that committee.  We decided that, in our approach to that matter, we would need, first of all, an assurance from the representatives of the trade that they were not asking us to stand over anything which was hostile to the principles laid down by this Government with regard to the general well-being of the community.  We have <Col N="1973" /> been assured that they are not concerned on behalf of bad traders or from the point of veiw of black marketeers or those who are deliberately charging high prices for goods that are scarce. We satisfied ourselves that these were decent, reputable citizens, also members of the public who, while they sell one thing, have to buy another, and who are equally concerned that the cost of living should not be pushed up unduly.  We are satisfied that they had a genuine case, and we hope that the Minister will, in due course&mdash; after he has got through the work in which the piloting of this Estimate involves him&mdash;be constrained to receive a deputation, representing the traders, Senators and Deputies concerned.  An across-table discussion on this matter would enable him to see how far the point of view of the traders may be understood, and how far the traders might withdraw from a certain attitude, on seeing the difficulties the Minister may have in trying to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>We decided that we would try to be in general agreement amongst ourselves to remove from our discussions any question of politics and to try to decide only whether these people had a case or not.  One of the simple things these men wonder about is why the Department of Supplies fixes Friday as the ending of the week, when they themselves say that Saturday should end the week and Monday begin it, for the purpose of records. They say it should be easier for the Department to agree to Monday as the beginning of the week than for all these thousands of traders to do so and alter their tradition, in order to meet the Department's request that it begin on Saturday.  The Department should understand, also, that even Deputies and very well-informed people find it hard to understand all the Orders and regulations which are made from day to day&mdash;and which have to be made&mdash; and that the general public and the assistants in shops will need a very much improved standard of intelligence if they are to understand and know, from day-to-day, all the requirements of the Orders which are published so suddenly.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1974" /> The Department should also consider the question of profit making and the reasonable margin of profit for traders, apart from its relation to the cost of living.  If traders are forced to deal in commodities at prices which do not give them a reasonable margin of profit&mdash;enough to keep them solvent &mdash;it will have a bad effect.  We must not forget that many of our citizens are working in a neighbouring country and that, when they come home for holidays, they have plenty of money to spend on goods which would be much dearer outside.  On coming home, they are able to pay a price which the people at home, because of the wages control, could not afford.  The Minister is very anxious to see that the goods available for the people of this country should be purchasable by them but, if he is too rigid and unreasonable, he himself is helping to create a trade in smuggling.</P>
    <P>I cannot understand why cigarettes should be so scarce in Dublin.  I had to go back to a pipe, as it was impossible to get cigarettes, and, if it is hard for me, other people must be much worse off.  I am inclined to believe, now that the price of cigarettes in a neighbouring country and in the Northern Counties has gone up, that there will develop a trade in taking traders supplies and getting the extra 6d. per packet for them across the Border.  If traders are expected to play fair with the public, the Government should see that there is fair play for them as well.</P>
    <P>In regard to price fixing, I understand that the Department examines books and accounts.  They must be aware that very many small retail shops never keep books, as do big companies which study their percentage profits.  It is, therefore, very difficult to get a proper costing as to what will pay in one area as distinct from another, in relation to a certain class of trade.</P>
    <P>It should be borne in mind that the trader to-day has a much smaller range of goods from which to make his general profits.  We know that there is a scarcity of practically all commodities and that there are certain commodities which are unprocurable.  I <Col N="1975" /> remember distinctly that many shops before the war would sell one particular line at a loss in order to attract customers for another line of goods which they had in considerable quantity and on which they could make a fairly good profit.  One firm made butter their leading line, another firm eggs, and so on.  To-day most commodities are controlled and the remaining goods in free trade are very few and far between and very scarce indeed.  I hope the Minister will indicate that he is ready to believe that traders are prepared to co-operate with his Department and that he recognises that every trade and every section of the community which is organised can be helpful both to themselves and to his Department.  I hope he will receive a deputation and in that way recognise the spokesmen of these institutions.  I hope he will have a repetition of what happened only recently when his Department sent for certain representatives whom they had seen previously to discuss the question of potatoes.  They all came away happy and satisfied.  The Department felt that they had got a fair statement from the representatives of the trade, and the traders were satisfied that they got fair treatment from the Department. Why cannot that spirit be applied and extended in connection with most of the matters which might be termed disputes or grievances?</P>
    <P>I do not propose to deal in detail with what was discussed in committee by us because I am hoping that the Minister will give us an opportunity of dealing with it in a reasonable way. Two names, however, have been mentioned in connection with cases which were brought to our notice.  We do not know all the facts; we know only what we have been told and I am sure that the Minister also does not know all the facts.  I am sure if he did, in one particular case in any event, he would be very reluctant to permit a procedure of the nature adopted in that particular case.  The name of Stanley of Ballybrack was mentioned. I happen to know the firm of Stanley, as I lived in that neighbourhood for five years.  I know the firm to be a <Col N="1976" /> very decent firm.  One could not call them profiteers in any sense of the word.  I know their offence appears on paper to be a simple one.  As a matter of fact if that offence had been detected some months after the case had been taken to court the situation might have been quite different because since that particular time the Department has discovered that it must allow for wastage in handling tea. In the case of this particular firm the Department did not allow for the four lbs. wastage per 100 lbs. which they now allow in the handling of tea.  I do not want to refer to the points that traders regard as essential and as a condition of their deputation being received.  I think the Minister will understand now that it is only a request that they be heard and that they want to put before the Minister or whatever appropriate official he decides to hear them&mdash;I would prefer that he should hear them himself&mdash;how they propose to meet the situation.</P>
    <P>There is a suggestion whether it be true or not&mdash;and there is no means of disproving it&mdash;that not all traders are treated alike.  We read of traders who are brought before courts and convicted and then we hear that a certain number of licences have been revoked, while others have been notified that their licences will be revoked.  We are led to believe that in some cases such drastic punishment is not applied.  I want to tell the Minister that in this connection the public have a grievance which has to be considered.</P>
    <P>Take an area like Ballybrack.  I do not know how many grocers there are there.  There may be three or four, but, at any rate, there are very few.  They supply a very large number of people. If every time a trader is convicted of an offence, irrespective of whether the offence is a bad one, a trivial one, or one that is due to a genuine mistake, and that conviction is followed by a revocation of the licence, you will ultimately reach a stage in which a village or town will be deprived of all its suppliers of tea or sugar because the traders will all have lost their licences. Then the public will have to go to the nearest adjoining town or village to get their supplies.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="1977" /> I want to point out to the Minister on the other hand that the withdrawal of a licence is a very serious thing for a trader.  I agree that the public must be protected against exploitation, and if it is a bad case, the trader deserves to be put out of business permanently, because that is what revocation of a licence means.  In one case cited here a trader had 600 persons registered for tea and sugar.  By a stroke of the pen, following conviction for a certain offence, he lost 600 customers, not only for tea and sugar, but for other commodities as well, because when people had to go elsewhere for their tea and sugar they bought other requirements there also.  Such a man might as well close up his shop if he has no other business.</P>
    <P>This is a point I want to put to the Minister: To whom is he going to transfer all these licences?  Already people who are very national in their outlook object to having to go to what they call cross-Channel houses to buy their tea and sugar.  I am informed that some of these revoked licences have been transferred to houses which are regarded as being cross-Channel houses.</P>

      <P>I should like the Minister to turn over that aspect of the matter in his mind, and not to forget that when he is punishing a trader he is also in some cases punishing that trader's customers.  He has mentioned the fact that some 32 licences had been revoked up to recently.  I am informed that the holders of 70 odd licences are also under notice of revocation.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would ask the Minister to agree to receive this deputation which consists of representatives of all sections in this House and of the other House. I hope he will receive them before revoking these licences and that he will allow them to bring before him certain aspects of these cases which we do not wish to bring out in the House to-day. It has been pointed out also in the discussion&mdash;and we have given very detailed consideration to the question and I hope when the Minister <Col N="1978" /> comes to reply that he will not misstate the position&mdash;that we are not concerned with traders who are wilful offenders.  We are all in agreement, as are the traders who have been in touch with us, that the Minister should retain all the powers he has.</P>

      <P>It would be very unfair to the traders concerned if those of us on that committee brought a personal dispute into this House, when we are all, in our individual capacity and jointly, in agreement with the steps already taken.  The traders have made it clear in their handbook and through the Press, and they have insisted all the time lest there should be any mistake about it and a resultant reaction against them, that they are <Col N="1979" /> in complete agreement with the Minister holding on tightly to the powers he has.  They insist also on making it known that they are not in any way concerned about those offenders who are deliberate offenders.  In view of that, and in view of the terms of the letter which was received, I appeal to the Minister not to consider the matter adequately and finally dealt with in the House, because the members of the committee agreed that individual cases would not be discussed here.  Deputy Mulcahy referred to two cases.  He was not a member of that committee and naturally is free to do as he likes. Otherwise, the cases would not have been referred to.  I am concerned, as the Minister, the Government and, I am sure, the whole House are all concerned, that the public shall be protected in this emergency.  The public themselves are concerned that they shall be protected&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Briscoe</NameTxt>
      <P>So the Deputy has suddenly regained his hearing.  He could not hear before, but he can hear now.  All I want to say is that I do not seek to make any political capital out of this.  I am not looking for an each-way bet, nor do I think anybody is; but there are many people inside and outside the House who are very anxious to make political capital out of the situation.  They are not anxious to come into the House and say what they say outside about the Minister and the officials of the Department.  I referred previously to this abuse which goes on, but of which there is never any evidence produced.  It is just a whispering campaign and people are not prepared to stand up and face facts as they concern and confront us.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>So long as we are in this House, it is up to us to do our job for the public. I do not want to see the people exploited, but I regard traders as members of the public.  They also have to be protected, and protected even against the Minister, if we think the Minister is taking an unfair advantage or does not see the position as we see it.  That is why I am anxious that he <Col N="1980" /> should receive the deputation in the spirit in which it wants to meet him. There are a very great number of persons involved whose livelihood is threatened.  A number of people have come to me with their stories.  I have not approached the Department about them yet, because I have not been able to examine them, but I am delighted that there is an organisation in existence from which one can get first-hand knowledge about the situation.</P>
    <P>I hope I have not overstepped the bounds of what is expected of a member of the committee.  I do not think I have in any way damaged any cases which came before us&mdash;I have not mentioned them&mdash;but I should like the Minister to understand that some of the methods employed by his agents are methods which, while they may be successful&mdash;and he may have to get his men to stoop to certain methods of getting information&mdash;do not look very well.  That is why I say it would be well to recognise the organisation of the trade concerned as other trades have organisations which are recognised, with a view to giving its representatives at least the consideration of being enabled to discuss from time to time what is required of them or matters which they think will not work out satisfactorily or which may bring trouble.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that this body is very happy with regard to the interviews they had.  Individuals amongst them have told me that they have from time to time seen representatives of the Department and they have no grievance against them, but that it is just the situation that is being misrepresented. The Minister is determined to make it known that he does not propose to let go of the tight reins he holds, and he finds that the only way he can get people to march in step in relation to these matters is by continuing on the lines on which he started.  I find no fault with that, but what I do find fault with is that in some cases the casualties are becoming permanent casualties, and I say to the Minister that he ought at least to be prepared to reconsider certain situations, and, after all the benefits which <Col N="1981" /> he wants to accrue to the public have been secured, he ought to be prepared to consider whether some readjustments ought not to be made.</P>
    <P>I have mentioned that so far as I know not all are treated alike.  There may be very good reasons for that.  We read of traders who have been fined and we understand that in some of these cases these people do not expect to have their licences revoked.  It may not be possible&mdash;it may not be good policy&mdash;to give the details of everybody's private business in the House, and the Minister on very many occasions has refused to give certain information on the ground that it was not fair to discuss the private business of concerns here.  Consequently, I appeal to him to intimate, if he possibly can, that he is prepared to meet the situation on the lines I suggest.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickGiles" hpid="Captain Giles Captain Giles">
      <NameTxt>Captain Giles</NameTxt>
      <P>While I agree that this Department is one which is open to much criticism, I hold that it cannot be held responsible for all the ills of the country at present.  We are in a war situation, and in such a situation there is bound to be a shortage of different commodities, but what we hold the Department responsible for is lack of organisation at the beginning of its existence.  If the Department had then been organised on the basis on which it is organised to-day, we should be able to cope with the black market operations which are going on in our midst.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The vigilance of the officers of the Minister's Department is being exercised all over the country in trying to find out the prices charged by the different small shopkeepers.  I think it would be better if he were not so severe on the small shopkeepers down through the country, and if he would concentrate the vigilance of his Department on the large wholesalers in the City of Dublin.  I am quite sure that the small country shopkeepers are not to blame for this kind of thing at all.  Certain people are able to get all they want from the large wholesalers in Dublin, who are directly responsible for the black market, and it is these people, and not the Border alone, who have brought <Col N="1982" /> about the present state of affairs. While the small country shopkeepers cannot get their requirements, the big people can come up here to the City of Dublin and get huge supplies of all kinds of stuff.  These wholesalers are responsible for the blackmarketing, and they will not even supply the small country shopkeepers.</P>
    <P>I believe that there are wholesalers in Dublin who got in large quantities of commodities at the commencement of the war and who have been getting them in since the war started.  They are selling such items as shirts, which then cost 3/6, at 22/6.  Not alone that, but these people, I am informed on good authority, are able to pay bonuses to their workers up to the amount of £20 in cash.  I know that for a fact, and I think it would be far better if two or three of these firms in the City of Dublin were to be blown sky high instead of harassing the small country shopkeepers.  If that were done, it would be a lesson that would make many others take notice.  Sending the officials of the Department down to the country districts, harassing the small shopkeepers, is only doing harm.  It is certainly not the way to deal with this matter of the black market.  Some of these small shopkeepers in the country districts are barely able to keep their books, and it is very unfair to drag them into court, impose fines on them, or perhaps revoke their licences, because they sell a few boxes of matches for a ½d. extra.  The small country shopkeeper is having a harder time than anybody else in the country at the present moment.  He is trying to keep his little shop going as best he can, to keep his little farm, if he has one, going, and also trying to comply with all the various regulations that have been issued.  I think it would be better to let the small country shopkeeper alone, and let him go his way as best he can.  He is not the real offender, but it seems to be always the small fellow who is caught and penalised while the big fellow gets away with it.</P>
    <P>The Minister and his Department should start cleaning up at the top first.  Get after the big fellows who have the nest eggs.  These were the <Col N="1983" /> people who bought huge quantities of stuff at the commencement of the war and have taken advantage of the needs of the people by selling these goods at enormous profits.  Let the Minister tackle this problem at its source, and I think that if the Minister had consulted the business people of this country more as regards the getting in of supplies from outside, we would be better off to-day, because these people were in the habit of travelling across the water and knew where to go to get goods.  I think if they had been consulted originally there would have been a lot more harmony with regard to this matter.</P>
    <P>One thing that I should like to refer to in this connection is the organisation of the parish councils.  My belief is that if you had a parish council properly organised in every district, and if it were given the proper credentials from the Department, it would be of immense value, not alone to the Department of Supplies, but to every Department of State, and it would mean the saving of a lot of money that is now being paid to officials of the Department travelling around the country.  If you had a properly organised parish council in every district, provided with the proper credentials, there would be very little profiteering or racketeering, because these people would tackle the job in an open and above-board way, and they would not be afraid to tackle it.  There is hardly a parish, for instance, in my constituency, where there are not profiteers or black marketeers, but it is almost impossible for the officials of the Department to find them out.  I know for a fact that there is one man who has four or five centres of distribution, but there is hardly ever anything in his own house.  In the various centres that he has, however, you can get three or four dry batteries, or as many cigarettes or as much tobacco as you want, so long as you have the money to pay for them, and he is never caught.  Until such centres of distribution are broken up, you will have this kind of thing going on, and it is the poor people who are suffering the most. The man with a good position or a <Col N="1984" /> large salary can buy all he wants in the black market.  Many selfish people are buying up quantities of goods and storing them up, not for months hence, but for years hence.  Such people are mean and despicable, and when you see the plight in which the poor people are left as a result of the actions of the others, I think one will have to admit that there is very little Christian charity left in the country.</P>
    <P>Now, I do not want to hound the Department for everything that has occurred, because I know that the organisation of supplies is a huge job, but the fact is that at the present moment the position has got out of hand.  While paying a tribute to the Department for many of the things that have been done, I think we should also pay a tribute to the people across the water for the way they treated us because, had it not been for the way they treated us since the commencement of the war, we would be in a very bad position to-day.</P>
    <P>Another thing to which I should like to refer is that people down the country, when they write to the Department, do not receive an answer for quite a long time.  Their complaint is that the replies to their letters are too long in coming.  Of course, if a Deputy writes to the Department, the answer comes speedily, but I think that the Department should have more concern for the ordinary people.  I have known of cases of certain people who wrote to the Department, and it took the best part of a month before a reply came, and in some cases no reply came at all until a Deputy called to the Department about the matter. I think there should be more concern for the ordinary people.</P>
    <P>I have not much more to say.  The people know, of course, that the Department of Supplies cannot do every thing, but they feel that this matter of the black market will have to be tackled in the proper way.  They know that so long as you have money you can get anything you want in this country, whether tea, sugar, or anything else, but if you are poor you cannot, and I think it is a disgrace that that should be the case in a <Col N="1985" /> Christian country.  I believe that it has all resulted from the advice that was given by some Minister at the commencement of the war&mdash;I do not say it was the present Minister&mdash;that people should buy as much as they could and store the goods in their houses or their back yards.  That advice was given with the best intentions, but it has had a very bad effect, and many people spent money buying up everything they could, and then held these goods until prices went up, and made the unfortunate poorer people pay enormous prices for these goods.  The Minister should go into what is happening here in the City of Dublin.  He should try to get to the root of this problem, and see where the stuff actually is.  As I have pointed out, people who were selling shirts at 3/6 before the war are now selling them for 22/6, and I believe they had large stocks of these shirts which they bought at the commencement of the emergency.  Even though these people can pay good bonuses to all their workers, they are still making big profits. That is where the Minister will have to tackle the problem, because otherwise the black market and the racketeering will get beyond control.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Anybody who has listened to the Minister's speech, or who has had anything to do with the Department of Supplies, must realise the huge task with which the Minister is charged.  It struck me as very curious that the Minister is left in control of two Departments when the Department of Supplies alone calls for so much attention that it is really too exacting for one man to handle.  That Department tries to regulate and to ration all the resources of the country so as to utilise them to the best national advantage.  I think the Minister has made a terrible mistake in usurping the functions of other Departments. In no way has he extended himself so unnecessarily as in the handling of licences for shopkeepers. We were elected here nearly five years ago by universal suffrage and we established a Government.  We had the whole machinery of State, all the Departments, functioning.  We were told <Col N="1986" /> we had one of the finest Constitutions in the world and yet, since we were elected, we have done nothing but deprive the people of whatever benefits were in that Constitution.  We have destroyed class liberty and we have destroyed individual liberty.</P>
      <P>By what authority is the Minister for Supplies permitted, after the courts have tried a case, found the person charged guilty, and inflicted punishment to fit the crime, to impose additional punishment on the offender? Has the Minister no sense of justice or fair play?  Not only do the courts inflict punishment on that offender, but the Minister takes away from him his means of livelihood.  That is what happens to an unfortunate shopkeeper.</P>
      <P>I do not agree that the Minister should have that power.  I think the House should take it from him.  I agree that the Minister, having information that no other man in the country can have as to our resources, as to the amount of each essential commodity that is in the country, should have the power to ration such commodities.  I believe in giving the Minister power to make Orders rationing various commodities.  I go further and I say that he might specify the punishment that should be inflicted on those who transgress the Orders, but once the Minister has done that, his functions in that connection should cease.  He can send out his inspectors to detect offences; he can use the Guards to detect them, but, once an offence is detected, there is only one place in which the case should be tried, and that is in the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Four cases were mentioned here to-day. I am not going to attempt what I think other Deputies attempted&mdash; that is, to re-try cases that were dealt with by the courts.  If the accused did not appeal against the court verdict, then we must accept the verdict of the court.  I am not going to mention any of the cases that were referred to here to-day.  I am not defending those who were convicted. I suggest to the Minister that those four cases were tried in the court.  A man was convicted and, in the first case, he was fined £30 and, in another <Col N="1987" /> case, for not giving, as alleged, a receipt, he was fined £20.  The case was presented in full in the court and I should like to know from the Minister if there was any intimation to the district justice that there was other punishment to come afterwards.  I suggest that the district justice had in mind the enormity of the crime committed and the accused was found guilty and fines were imposed.  Were not the ends of justice satisfied on that occasion?  Why should the Minister impose additional penalties?  If a man commits the worst crime of all, murder, and is tried and convicted and executed, are the members of his family deprived of his property?  Are his dependents followed after the sentence of the court is carried out?</P>
    <P>On what grounds has the Minister taken away the right of protection from our citizens?  I will be surprised if any Deputy backs the Minister in so depriving our people of the ordinary rights of citizenship.  If the Minister stated in his Order: &ldquo;Certain offences, if proved, may carry the revocation of licences to carry on trade,&rdquo; and left it to the Justice to decide whether an offence is sufficiently, serious to warrant such further punishment, then, so far as I am concerned, I would have nothing to say.  But a certain offence was committed and the public knew what the punishment would be.  They knew the case would be tried in the court and that a certain sentence would be imposed.  I take it there would be the ordinary right of appeal to a higher court, so that an individual would have an opportunity of proving his innocence.  If he failed to do so he would have to pay the penalty.</P>
    <P>I should like to hear the Minister justifying his attitude in these cases. I should like to hear the Deputy, who said that most Deputies do not want to curtail the powers of the Minister, justifying the exercise of that particular power by the Minister.  I do not agree with it and the Minister cannot plead expedition.  Four cases were mentioned here to-day.  Some of them concerned the revocation of tea and sugar licences.  That took place seven months after the convictions had been <Col N="1988" /> obtained in these cases.  I have before me a summons issued in the City of Limerick in respect of an offence alleged to have been committed on the 24/12/1941.  The case is to be tried on the 30th of this month.  It is <i>sub judice</i>, and hence I am not going to make any reference to it.  The point that I want to make is this, that when an offence is committed it should be tried in the courts and nowhere else. No Minister and no individual should have the power to try cases, not only in camera, but by jungle law methods. The alleged offender is not told that the case for the revocation of his licence is being tried on a particular day.  He is not asked if he has any representations to make.  What happens is that a comparatively junior clerk in the Department reads up the correspondence and recommends to a higher officer.  Perhaps he does not read through the case, but that man's means of livelihood is taken away by such methods.</P>
    <P>There will be no sense of fair play or honesty if that kind of thing is to be tolerated.  The shopkeepers will strike against it.  The Minister knows all the extra work that has been imposed on shopkeepers by ration cards, food vouchers and all the rest.  In the case of an ordinary-sized grocery business to-day, because of all that, the proprietor has to employ a couple of extra clerks.  In nearly every case that I have heard of, where a shopkeeper has been caught, he has been caught by the employment of the lowest possible methods.  An inspector goes in and, by making the plea that he has somebody sick belonging to him, the shopkeeper, in the goodness of his nature, strains the regulations by giving a little extra tea or something else to him.  A quarter of an hour after making that pitiful appeal, the inspector returns with a couple of others who have been lying in wait outside for the purpose of catching that unfortunate shopkeeper.  I say that will have to cease and that shopkeepers will not put up with it.  I will be very interested to hear the Minister defending his methods of administering the law.</P>
    <P>The Minister gave us some interesting <Col N="1989" /> figures about our wheat crop.  I think he said that the cost of the wheat we imported was 50/2d. at the mill here.</P>

      <P>The Minister said that the estimated yield of the wheat crop for 1942 was 500,000 tons, and that the estimated amount given to the millers will be about 270,000 tons.  The latter figure represents very little over 50 per cent. of the total crop.  I suppose that, roughly speaking, 60,000 will seed the coming year's crop.  That leaves 180,000 or 190,000 tons missing.  The Minister did not probe the matter any further, but I think the House would like to know where that quantity disappeared to.</P>

      <P>I do not think that the Government generally are fair to feeders.  All the obligations put on them to produce a standard commodity at a time when there was absolute freedom and opportunity to buy in any <Col N="1990" /> market the best feeding stuffs so as to get the best results, are still in force. These standards of quality and production are still being prescribed and maintained by the Government.  Take the case of a man producing milk for the Dublin market.  He must produce milk with a minimum of 3 per cent. fats.  That was fixed at a time when concentrated foods were so plentiful that people were actually being canvassed to buy them.  Now, under a very efficient system of inspection, a man is still expected to produce milk of that standard despite the fact that these concentrated foods are not available.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>No.  That quality of milk can only be maintained by food produced by the milk producers who are obliged by the Minister to use that food for other purposes now.  If that food is used for the purposes that the Minister requires, and I think rightly requires, then there should be some consideration for the man who is left without proper food to produce milk of the required standard.</P>

    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">
      <NameTxt>An Ceann Comhairle</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Not, I submit, in relation to what I may call the missing wheat.  If the Minister wants to conserve it, and he is right in conserving it, it must be conserved, but it will cause a loss in feeding elsewhere, and he should consult with the other Departments concerned in the <Col N="1991" /> other branch of the business as to which should suffer.  Is the quality of the food to milch cows to suffer or is the quantity of food that the human population should get to be maintained? Which is it?  You cannot have it both ways.  The Minister said that we want 100,000 more acres of wheat this year.  I hope he will get them. The great trouble with the Minister, and everyone in business knows it is a very serious trouble, is transport. It is the big problem for the nation. Why is there not economy in connection with transport?  How can the Minister justify his Department's supplying the Great Southern Railway Company with petrol or giving them coupons to get petrol to carry 10,000, 15,000 or 20,000 tons of timber from railway trucks in Dun Laoghaire down to the dump called the Gut, about 300 yards away?  Why was petrol given for that work?  Why was petrol given to carry turf from Alexandra Basin to private yards in Dublin?  Why were coupons given to lorry owners to do that?  Why was petrol given to send a lorry empty to Ballinasloe to bring four tons of turf to Dublin?  Why were lorry owners prosecuted at the instance of the Department for bringing fuel into Dublin when they were going into Dublin anyway?  Lorries were coming to Dublin twice a day empty using up petrol and kerosene. They could have brought five tons. of wood fuel into Dublin.  When they did that, the owner was prosecuted and fined £90.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That was four or five months ago. Since then they have been coming into Dublin empty on six days of the week, wasting petrol and kerosene which could be used to bring fuel into Dublin. Why did the Minister tolerate that?  Why did the Minister give petrol in the case I mentioned to bring turf from Ballinasloe?  The quantity of petrol used in one case to bring 3 tons 15 cwts. of turf to Dublin would have fetched 40 tons of wood fuel to Dublin. But petrol for the bringing in of that wood fuel was refused.  Does the Minister deny that?  The Minister tells us our great trouble is in the shortage of transport.  He stated that 17,000,000 gallons of paraffin was our normal <Col N="1992" /> supply.  Perhaps he would inform me if he means kerosene, including T.V.O.?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes.</P>

    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>Very good.  In 1942, 17,000,000 gallons of kerosene and T.V.O. were our normal consumption. Does that embrace kerosene, paraffin and T.V.O.?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>In 1942 we got 10,000,000 gallons.  I think I am right in saying that in 1942, if we could get all we wanted, our requirements would be more than 17,000,000 gallons because of the amount of paraffin that was being used.  Therefore that is really more than 7,000,000 gallons short of our normal requirements.  It means 7,000,000 gallons short, plus our increased requirements. This year the Minister anticipates that we will not get more than 8,000,000 gallons, in a year when our requirements will be above normal. That is a very serious situation.  Of that, 4,000,000 gallons will be required for agricultural purposes.  During this year he anticipates there will be no petrol.  Surely he does not mean that there will be no petrol for priming agricultural tractors?  Kerosene flowing in a river past our doors will be no good to us if we have not petrol to start the tractors, and on that depends the food production for the coming year.  Fuel oil, already reduced 50 per cent., will be still further reduced.  Is it not up to the Minister to see that the most is made of the transport facilities we have?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Certainly, if I had any responsibility in the matter I would prosecute the man who travelled with his lorry empty rather than the man who had his lorry full.  A man going from North to South should, by hook or by crook, take a load from the North in addition to the load that he will take from the South. It should be an offence punishable by the Minister for a man deliberately to travel with his lorry empty if a load can be procured for him.  By having lorries travelling empty we get only 50 per cent. of the value of those precious commodities, petrol and kerosene.  Half of it is being used to bring empty lorries in one direction and the other <Col N="1993" /> half is used to bring the load The Minister to-day foreshadowed the steps that would be taken in order to economise in transport.  He obviously foreshadowed the State control of milk distribution.  I do not think he should be in a hurry in that matter.  If the situation demands it, in the last resort, it must be done.  I do not think it is very wise for a Minister to prosecute a man who is economising in transport by carrying a load both ways rather than the man who is wearing rubber and wasting petrol by going with his lorry empty.</P>
    <P>I do not know whether I interpreted correctly what the Minister said.  My note of what he said with regard to the transport of turf to non-turf areas is that our maximum capacity would be 450,000 tons.  I do not think that is adequate for the requirements of Dublin alone.  Can the Minister not increase our transport capacity?  Can he not insist upon vehicles going out full&mdash;whether it is a train or a lorry&mdash; if there is freight available?  I think the Minister foreshadowed that gas-producer plants will have to be more generally used in future.</P>
    <P>I have heard&mdash;I do not know how true it is&mdash;that it is possible that gas producer plants will be fitted to our trains.  The Minister said that many gas producer plants are being manufactured to meet the transport situation. I hope it will be found easier to use them than some people have found.  I know cases where gas producers will not be allowed to go on the road; permits will not be given, even though they are wanted for essential services, and even though the neighbours of the people concerned have gas producer plants for these essential services.  I know cases where people who are producing charcoal are refused permits to use these gas producer plants.  The Minister knows that.  That is a further reason why I would not give the Minister, or any individual, power of life and death over any citizen, or any class of citizen in the country.</P>
    <P>We are all glad to hear that the rubber position is not so dangerous as it appeared in the past.  I asked the Minister a question by way of <Col N="1994" /> interruption&mdash;I want him to take it as an interruption to elicit information. The Minister told us that as a result of the activities of his Department in getting new stocks and salvaging old stocks, the position has been improved. We were all glad to hear it, and we appreciate the efforts of the Minister and the Department.  There is a very important rubber product that is not available in this country and is not made in this country&mdash; namely, tyres for tractors.  I wonder if the Minister could do anything about them.  I suppose they cannot be vulcanised or re-rubbered.  It is very important in connection with food production that the Minister should get the big tractor tyres imported. The small tyres can be easily obtained. The Minister told us that there are 850 tons of copper sulphate available, and that our normal requirements are 3,000 tons.  Are my notes correct?</P>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Roughly correct.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBelton1927" hpid="Mr. Belton Mr. Belton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Belton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a very serious position.  Of course, the House is aware that the principal use of copper sulphate is for spraying potatoes to prevent blight.  We have 850 tons as against a normal requirement of 3,000 tons and that at a time when we are growing more potatoes or, at least, when the necessity for growing a larger acreage is more urgent.  The yield, of course, will be greatly impaired if we have not sufficient spraying material.  I draw attention to the seriousness of that position not in any way to censure the Department or the Minister because I am quite satisfied that they have done their best, but if they can do a little more, it would be an improvement. Copper sulphate is required also now that we are thrown back on our own resources.  It is very largely used for spraying fruit trees before and after blossoming.  The figures given indicate a very serious situation.  The Minister said that we were short of paper.  I do not know what amount of straw has been delivered to the mills and I do not know what sort of newsprint it would make.  The Minister said that our import of newsprint represents only 16 <Col N="1995" /> per cent. of our normal requirements. That is reflected in the size of our daily papers.  In that connection, I wish to put a question to the Minister &mdash;I have not been asked by anybody to do so.  I am doing it entirely on my own responsibility.  I notice in newspapers published in this city that a complaint is regularly published in the form of a sort of framed advertisement that that firm is not getting its equitable ration of newsprint.  I do not know whether that is true or not.</P>

      <P>Our supply of petrol was down from the normal figure of 41,000,000 gallons to 13,000,000 gallons last year, and this year it will be less. That creates a serious situation.  I suggest to the Minister that he should issue an Order making it an offence for any mechanically-propelled vehicle to be found empty on the public highway. If we are serious about using transport to the best advantage, then every vehicle on a public road should be laden.</P>
      <P>The Minister said that 32 traders' licences were withdrawn last year, that quite a number more were being considered for revocation and that 1,114 cases are pending.  It is time that the courts were set to work and that the Minister should cease filching from the people their rights and freedom as citizens.  When the Minister makes an Order providing for the conservation of supplies and declaring it an offence to act contrary to the Order, then that Order should be handed over to the Gárda or inspectors and, if they track down an offender, the case should be tried in the courts and the punishment imposed by the courts.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If either side is dissatisfied, there is a right of appeal to a higher court until they tire going up.  Then, there will be a standard case which will govern future similar cases and the person concerned will have his rights as citizen preserved.  The consumer will have his rights preserved, too, and he will have the right to report an offence with a view to having proceedings taken.  When punishment is imposed by the courts, the Minister should not have the right &mdash;six or twelve months afterwards&mdash; to revoke the licence of the offender, which means, in effect, taking away his livelihood.  I suggest to the Minister that he should start anew on these lines.  Let the punishment of offences rest with the courts.  Let the licences which have been revoked be reinstated and let all such cases under consideration be dropped.  That generous <Col N="1997" /> gesture would be appreciated.  The fright which people whose licences have been revoked have received and the fright which those whose cases are under consideration have received will be a sufficient deterrent to any repetition of the offence.  I am sure it is not the Minister's intention&mdash;it should not be&mdash;to punish anybody except as a deterrent to continuance of an offence that would be injurious to the public at large.  The ends of justice would be well served by the Minister adopting that suggestion and leaving the courts to do the job they were set up to do&mdash;try offences alleged to be committed by citizens of the State.</P>
    <P>It should never be the Minister's job to do that, and it certainly should not be in the hands of a civil servant behind closed doors.  The revocation of a trader's licence, and the wiping out of the work of a lifetime, should not depend on the mood of a civil servant&mdash;whether he had a bottle of stout too much or too little for his lunch.  The Minister cannot give personal attention to all those things; he must delegate his power to officials. Nominally, he is personally responsible, but in actual fact it is impossible for him to make a decision in all cases. Therefore, I think he should not take that responsibility; it should be the responsibility of the courts to mete out punishment when the offence has been proved.  I would strongly appeal to the Minister to consider that matter. If he does not, I shall certainly put down a Motion asking the Dáil to request the Government to do so.</P>

      <P>I am not considering the price of red-herrings this evening. Twelve months ago, the people laughed at those prices.  They are not laughing at them to-day, and the Minister and his Department are to be congratulated on the war they have waged against <Col N="1998" /> the black market.  If there were more co-operation from Deputies and from the general public in this war, it would end very quickly.  The Minister has prevented a social revolution; the poor would have torn down the shops if prices had not been controlled.  Those black market shops would be in every provincial town, if the Minister had not intervened.  In so far as the public has co-operated with him, the nation is to be congratulated.</P>
      <P>There are a few matters to which I should like to draw the Minister's attention. One is the question of fuel oil, lubricating oil and paraffin.  In the small towns&mdash;there may not be many of them, but this matter is important in view of the rationing of light by the Electricity Supply Board&mdash;the new Intoxicating Liquor Act extends the time for the sale of liquor by, I think, four and a half hours per week.  I happen to live in a small town which was supplied with light by a plant worked on fuel oil.  During January and February our light was cut off at 12 o'clock summer time, and we had no light during the day.  I should like to see the Minister consulting the Department of Justice with a view to postponing during the emergency the extension of the hours of trading of licensed shops, in order to effect a saving in fuel oil, and also in lubricating oil which is used in conjunction with fuel oil in the working of those engines.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the question of candles, I have discovered through communications with the Department that the issue of candles to the general public is based on the 1938 purchases.  I find that the oil companies are not fair in their treatment of the public.  There is some slackness there, and I would ask the Minister to see that his Department exercises proper supervision over the distribution of those candles, particularly during the coming winter, when paraffin will not be available and the people will be more dependent on the supply of candles.  I could particularise quite a lot in regard to my own locality, but a general statement of the position is that there is not a fair distribution of candles in the midlands.  I have seen and heard of deliveries of candles in this month of <Col N="1999" /> April from the oil companies to the different shops, and I am credibly informed that these candles are being black marketed at 1/6 each.  It is very hard to get proof of those things, but I have been in communication with the Department in regard to it for a considerable time, and if they would examine the matter thoroughly they would be doing a national service.  In a particular town, I know one shop which had been closed for a number of years; business was not re-started there until 1941, and it is a mystery to everybody how that shop can have candles galore.  I took the matter up with the oil companies, and the answer I got from an important official there was: &ldquo;He is one of the lucky ones.&rdquo; There is something radically wrong there.  Those are the only matters to which I wish to direct the Minister's attention.</P>
    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>There are a very few matters which have not been touched on in the course of this debate, and I should like to say a few words in regard to them.  I refer particularly to farm requirements.  As everybody here who is a farmer knows, when you go to buy many things which are essential on a farm every day you find that they are very hard to get, and then only at enhanced prices.  I do not know why the price of those things is not controlled.  To take an example, everybody knows that we used to be able to buy a hatchet, a felling axe, for 7/- or 8/- or 9/- at the outside, but now we would have to pay 35/-.  Is there any justification for failure to control those prices?  The same applies to buckets.  Any that are available &mdash;&mdash;</P>

    <Speaker pid="RichardCurran" hpid="Mr. Curran Mr. Curran">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Curran</NameTxt>
      <P>That is what I am talking about.  I do not know if they are manufactured in this country, but the purchaser should not be allowed to be robbed in regard to whatever supplies are available.  I would seriously suggest to the Minister that some drive should be made in connection with scrap iron and metal.  I <Col N="2000" /> do not know whether or not it would be a paying proposition on the part of the Haulbowline industry, which, I understand, is starting now, and which, according to a report I saw some time ago, will be in the position to meet to some extent the requirements of the people.  Even iron for wheels or things of that kind is almost impossible to obtain, and the little that is available is at an enhanced price.  The same applies to nuts and bolts.  When you go to buy them you dare not grumble about the price; you are told: &ldquo;Well, you are lucky to get them.&rdquo;  As a matter of fact, a shopkeeper remarked to me not so long ago that if he could get £200 worth of goods he could sell them for £1,000.  I do not see the Minister for Supplies doing anything at all in the way of controlling the price of those articles, although they are largely used by the farming community.  The other day, I tried to buy a bill-hook, but it was not to be had.  If I had succeeded in getting one I would have had to pay from 15/- to £1 for it. Whatever supplies are available should be sold at a controlled price, instead of at the price which can be got for them, owing to the scarcity of supplies.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Reference has been made here to-night to candles and paraffin.  The rural traders have got a very raw deal regarding that.  The meagre supply of paraffin for light which the rural community have has been withdrawn&mdash; half a gallon a month&mdash;and candles are not available.  It is hard to picture what the countryside is like on dark nights.  It is not so bad now, but the winter will come again and the Minister does not hold out much hope that there will be any increased supply of paraffin.  Most towns and some villages have electric light, but there is no such thing in the country, where not half of 1 per cent. of the rural houses are lighted by electricity.  The farmers have to attend to stock on dark winter nights and it is difficult for them to do so when they are dependent upon half a gallon of kerosene per month.  The Minister should examine the whole kerosene position and allot a better quota to the rural areas.  I know that the supply is short, <Col N="2001" /> but the rural community should have the first claim on it.</P>

      <P>I feel it is my duty to pay a humble tribute to the Minister for Supplies and his Department for the very efficient way in which they have grappled with a momentous national situation.  They are to be congratulated, when everything is taken into consideration, notwithstanding all that we have heard from Deputies who have an axe to grind.  I am not going to advocate the blowing sky-high of supplies, which are scarce enough, and I hope the Minister will not hearken to that advice, which he has received here this evening.  There is one matter I would like to bring to the Minister's notice.  For the past few months, saddlers have had great difficulty in getting supplies of ticken for the stuffing of collars, straddles and hoosens. The situation is very serious for these people.  Farmers are bringing these things in to be stuffed and saddlers will not be supplied with ticken unless they, in turn, give coupons to the wholesale dry goods merchants.  Something definite should be done to deal with that.  The coupon pages A, B, and C are to be used for ordinary clothing and no provision is made for the farmer or for the saddler.  If any instructions have been issued regarding this matter, I would ask the Minister to repeat them, as there seems to be a misunderstanding.</P>
      <P>In the poorer homes in rural districts, particularly amongst the working classes, when a baby is born, there should be some provision compelling the trader with whom those people deal to provide at least one candle per week for the attention of the baby at night.  That is an important matter which deserves consideration, as it has been brought to my notice, by poor families of the working classes, that they cannot get any form of light, whether by oil or candle.</P>

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBartley" hpid="Mr. Bartley Mr. Bartley">

      <P>I would like to get some information from the Minister about the recent withdrawal of road licences in West Galway.  All the permits for private lorry owners were withdrawn, as from the 1st of the month.  There is <Col N="2002" /> a considerable amount of agitation amongst them as a result and the reasons for the action have not been made quite clear.  I believe that the public will be prepared to accept the Minister's action philosophically enough, if they are given the reasons for it.  So far as the scheme is operating, it does not seem as if there will be any worth-while saving of petrol, if the same services are to be given and if the motive power is to be petrol. The owners have been told that they can change to gas producers, and it has been suggested to me that that advice should have been given to the railway company some time ago, as they were more wasteful users of petrol than the private owners.  Whether that is true or not, I do not know.  The Department officials do not accept that statement at all, and maintain that the Great Southern Railway give a better mileage per gallon than the private owners.  I have heard that statement made by an official and heard it equally vehemently contested by private owners.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure the Minister is aware that a good deal of unemployment will be created by the Order.  Even so, if the necessity is there, it will be faced and accepted; but there is genuine fear that the turning over of the transport facilities in a non-railway area like West Galway is not the best way to meet the transport requirements of the district.  In remote parts of Connemara, and even in respect of north Mayo, I was requested to say that private lorry owners should be left scattered here and there, as the people would feel more secure then; and in time of sudden need, as happened when the flour supplies became scarce some time ago, the bulk of the required supplies, as soon as they became available in Galway or Westport, might be made available immediately in the remote districts.  The Minister and his Department will probably hear a good deal of this matter in the future as private owners are organising.  Personally, I should like to be supplied with the fullest information possible. I have a very open mind on the matter but I favour the private owner as I think he gives the best service to the <Col N="2003" /> community.  If, however, the Minister can make a case for the new scheme, I believe the people will accept it philosophically in view of the emergency. I think the Minister should answer these specific points; firstly, why the railway company have not been asked to use gas-producer plants; secondly, if the service is to be maintained on its present scale and the railway company are not using gas producer plants, how does the Minister propose to bring about a saving in petrol?  and thirdly, why the Minister selects non-railway areas for the initiation of these schemes?  These are three points in which I am personally interested and on which I have not been able to get sufficient information so far.</P>
    <P>The question of fuel supplies for the private consumer in Galway City is very much bound up with this question of the continuance in existence of the private owner, as it was the private owner who conveyed fuel supplies for private consumers to Galway City. Public transport was used mainly for the conveyance of national turf.  That is, however, a minor matter, as I think the Army lorries could be utilised for that purpose.  The public at all events have only heard one side of the story up to the present, and I should like the Minister to state his case in support of the new scheme in some detail. I heard it also suggested that this may be the thin end of the wedge for cutting out the private owner altogether after the emergency is over.  The suggestion is that the Department is availing of the emergency to abolish the private owner, and that when the emergency is over there will be no such person as a private owner.  That possibility is of more concern to some people than any other aspect of the matter I have mentioned.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Pattison</NameTxt>
      <P>It is interesting to hear some speakers on the Government benches express the opinion that there is a great lack of co-operation, particularly from what they call the opposite side of the House.  It is also interesting to hear Deputy Laurence Walsh, a member of the Government Party, almost weep over the plight of <Col N="2004" /> the saddlers, harness-makers and farmers in his constituency.  I suggest that if Deputy Walsh were doing his work, as a Deputy should, he would know that there is in operation in the Minister's Department, a scheme whereby the people whose plight he so much deplores are facilitated and helped in every possible way.</P>
      <P>I rise principally to refer to the lack of encouragement given by the Minister's Department to secure the necessary co-operation from the community. I can assert, as one member of the House, that I have done everything possible since the inception of the emergency to assist the Government in its difficulties, to induce people to co-operate with the Government and to keep within the law, but I must say that the Minister is not setting a very good example himself.  He is well aware by now that all sections of the community in the constituency that I have the honour to represent, including very many supporters of his own Party &mdash;in fact organised sections of his own Party&mdash;have protested against the partisan attitude displayed by the Minister in issuing information to the public in regard to all these matters of which it is essential they should be kept informed if they are to co-operate with the Government and keep within the law.  I suggest to the Minister that at this stage he should review the position and that, if for no more compelling reason than the interests of common decency, he should see that a newspaper with the circulation which the <i>Kilkenny People</i> enjoys will receive an adequate share of the announcements that are really issued for the information of the taxpayer.  I sincerely hope that the Minister will resume the same attitude which he was inclined to adopt recently when he apparently instructed the Secretary of his Department to arrange a discussion with the managing director of the concern on this question.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest to the Minister that in the interests of co-operation he should set this headline.  I come from a part of the country which, with all due respect to other districts, might justifiably be described as the most law-abiding part of the country.  At the present time <Col N="2005" /> we are doing more than pulling our full weight and the Minister should, as far as his Department is concerned, give us some encouragement.  The position in regard to issuing information to the community in Kilkenny should be put on an equitable basis and there should be no room in the present emergency for such narrow political partisan conduct as has been displayed up to the present.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickBeegan" hpid="Mr. Beegan Mr. Beegan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Beegan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter which I desire to bring specially to the Minister's notice.  I know it is a very difficult and complex matter and that it will require a considerable staff to deal with it on any equitable basis. I refer to the matter of the distribution of cycle tyres which principally affects bog workers in my county. Unless this matter is attended to, I believe that there will be a considerable diminution in turf production this year.  I make that statement on the authority of the county surveyor and the assistant surveyor of my district. Bogs which are suitable for the employment of large gangs of men are situated in certain places which entail a journey of ten or 12 miles on the part of some of these men.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This year, owing to the difficulty of obtaining cycle tyres, the number of workers employed is much smaller and fewer gangs are available.  I know that when individual applications were made to the Minister's Department this year, replies were sent to the applicants suggesting that they should get in contact with the local traders and stating it would be impossible for the Department to intervene. Of course, as far as the local traders are concerned, I am not alleging that there is any black marketing in that line of business although I have heard a lot about it but bog workers live in remote districts in the country.  They are not very conveniently placed in relation to towns where cycle dealers carry on business.  They are very much handicapped inasmuch as people living near towns where the cycle dealers have their establishments can keep in much closer contact with these cycle dealers. I quite admit that it is a very difficult <Col N="2006" /> problem to solve and even if an attempt were made to do so, there would probably still be a great deal of dissatisfaction.  Some people might say that others got cycle tyres while they themselves were more in need.  I think if some system were adopted on the same lines as that under which petrol coupons were issued to the county surveyors last year, or that under which tyres are issued to members of the L.D.F. or if surveyors were asked to distribute tyres on an equitable basis amongst these workers, it would go some way towards relieving the situation.  The surveyors might be asked to distribute such supplies as were available to workers who most constantly worked on the bogs last year.</P>
    <P>In conclusion, I wish to congratulate the Minister and his Department for the excellent way in which I know, from my contacts with the Department, they have handled the situation with regard to commodities in short supply. I know business men all over the country who visited the Department and who had a very different opinion after leaving it from that which they had before going there.  They went away quite satisfied that everything possible was being done.  I also want to say&mdash;and I believe I am justified in saying&mdash;that while I hold no brief for the people in the black market business, I am afraid there is a little too much publicity being given to it and that all our business men are being tarred with the same brush.  That is not at all right.  I believe that 98 per cent. of our business men are quite honest and deserving of the gratitude of the people.  They are not attempting to profiteer, although their position at present and for the past few years is and has been very difficult.  Most commodities are in short supply, but still they have to pay the same rates of wages, the same taxes, the same licence fees and so on.  Some people talk so lightly about this matter that one would imagine that all the business men were profiteers.  I hold quite a different view.  I am quite prepared to support any action, no matter how drastic, to deal with the few who are offending but all our business <Col N="2007" /> men should not be placed in the same category as the few who offend.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Hughes</NameTxt>
      <P>I do not want to minimise in any way the difficulties created by the many complex problems with which the Minister and his Department have to deal.  In present circumstances, with the problem of the shortage of essential supplies and the equitable distribution of these supplies among all classes, it is not by any means an easy matter to handle the situation with any degree of success and to avoid criticism.  It may appear that the Minister is not getting the co-operation which one might expect to be forthcoming from the people.  I do not think it is the fault of the people that it is so.  I am afraid that the Minister himself to a great extent is responsible for the lack of co-operation which exists.  The problem of controlling prices and of distributing available supplies is made more difficult by the attitude of the people, because some people are prepared to buy at any price.  They are not prepared to make any sacrifice, and when they need goods which are in short supply, they are prepared to secure those goods at any price, and possibly that attitude gives rise to the situation in which we find ourselves at present.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I think the attitude of the Minister to the whole matter is all wrong.  He has not sought, in a proper spirit, the co-operation of the people.  His attitude is the attitude of the dictator and his policy is the use of force, pressure and compulsion rather than seeking the co-operation of the people.  I do not think he will succeed, particularly in dealing with the Irish people, who may be led, but will not be driven. The attitude of the Minister to the people as a whole and to this Parliament is wrong.  He is the one Minister of the Government who has adopted an absolutely wooden attitude towards this House.  No matter what sort of help or co-operation was offered; no matter what kind of constructive suggestions were made or what sort of useful information was contributed by Deputies during the debate on the Minister's Vote in the past, the Minister <Col N="2008" /> was never prepared to accept them. He was never prepared to make use of any useful and constructive criticism which came from any benches other than his own.  It is to be regretted that that should be the attitude of the Minister in the very responsible position&mdash;possibly the most responsible position&mdash;in the Government at present.</P>
    <P>That attitude of the Minister is applicable to his whole activity in relation to the problem of supplies and their distribution.  He has made Orders and he has made decisions&mdash; very important and drastic decisions&mdash; affecting the lives of many people, without any attempt at consultation with those who are in the best position to advise him.  He evidently thought he was omniscient and that he and his cloistered officials in the Department were quite capable of dealing with the many complex problems which have arisen.  The result has been the bringing about of very serious discontent and disapproval, and a lack of co-operation on the part of the people as a whole.</P>
    <P>He has not sought their co-operation in the right spirit, and he has failed completely to get that co-operation which, in my opinion, is absolutely essential if the tasks with which he is charged are to be brought to a successful conclusion.  To a great degree, the Minister's attitude is responsible for the very grave situation which exists in the country at present.  The advice and the co-operation of honest, decent and trustworthy businessmen who were willing and anxious to co-operate on many matters were ignored.  They resent that attitude deeply, and I do not think anyone can blame them.</P>
    <P>Deputies have referred to the attitude of the Minister on a matter which has aroused a good deal of public interest recently, that is, the revocation of certain licences.  We all appreciate the necessity for rigid control and for keeping records so as to ensure that those people who are entitled under the rationing system to certain goods will get their quota and to prevent illicit traffic and black market activity.  The Minister has <Col N="2009" /> taken up a certain line with regard to these matters.  He told us that 32 traders had been deprived of their licences and that 1,114 prosecutions were pending.  I do not at all question the Minister's bringing prosecutions in order to prevent irregularities and to ensure the carrying out of Orders which have been made.</P>
