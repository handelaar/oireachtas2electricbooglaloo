      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether his attention has been directed to the hardship imposed by Emergency Powers (Compensation for Personal Injuries) (Civilians) Scheme, 1942 (First Amendment), 1943 (S.R.O. No. 7 of 1943), on such persons as were prior to the emergency in regular employment with national health insurance stamps and unemployment insurance stamps to their credit but who, through unemployment arising out of the emergency had, before receiving a personal injury entitling them to compensation under this scheme, exhausted their benefit and are now in receipt of unemployment assistance, and will therefore receive compensation only on the unemployment assistance basis; and whether, in view of the fact that had the regular employment of such persons not been discontinued by reason of the emergency, they would have been entitled to receive normal compensation under the scheme, the Minister will amend the scheme to provide for normal compensation in all cases where unemployment insurance stamps had, prior to the emergency, been to the credit of injured persons.</P>

      <NameTxt>Minister for Finance (Mr. O Ceallaigh)</NameTxt>
      <P>No representations have been made to me in the matter referred to in the Deputy's question.  To give effect to the suggestion now made would involve an investigation, in every case of an insured person who was <Col N="550" /> unemployed at the date of injury, as to whether in fact his employment had been discontinued by reason of the emergency, and might lead to an indefensible discrimination as between persons whose employment might have been so terminated and other insured persons whose benefit had been exhausted but whose unemployment could not be attributed to the emergency. I am satisfied that the only reasonable and consistent course to adopt in connection with claims generally is to deal with persons who have received injuries by reference to their actual condition as at the date of injury.  I regret, therefore, that I cannot undertake to amend the scheme on the lines suggested by the Deputy.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Finance whether, in view of the recent increases in wages and salaries granted to serving civil servants to meet the increased cost of living, he is prepared to grant increases in the pensions of officers who retired from the Civil Service when the cost-of-living index figure was substantially lower than at present and who are suffering grave hardships by reason of the shrunken purchasing power of their small pensions.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state the reasons why present limited and costly shipping <Col N="552" /> space has been used to import Canadian oats instead of utilising tonnage for the purpose of importing wheat, a more valuable and essential cereal from which bran and pollard could be extracted for animal feeding, thus releasing home-grown oats for oatmeal purposes.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if he will state in relation to Canadian oats (a) the total quantity recently imported; (b) the cost per barrel landed at the port of Dublin; (c) the average bushel weight; (d) total quantity intended to be imported, and (e) cost of freight per ton.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether he intends to relieve oatmeal shortage by imports from Canada, and, if so, why we are importing oats and not oatmeal in view of the fact that imports of oats yield only 67 per cent. oatmeal and 33 per cent. worthless hulls, instead of 100 per cent. of available shipping space in oatmeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies whether Oats, Limited, have received a cargo of Canadian oats; whether these oats carry any Government subsidy in their price; whether Oats, Limited, have consulted him about the allocation of these oats to millers; and, if so, why certain millers have received no quota while other millers have been provided for.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass) Seán F. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Supplies (Mr. Lemass)</NameTxt>
      <P>I will answer questions Nos. 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9 together.  The quantity of Canadian oats imported since the 1st November, 1942, was 54,856 barrels (14 stone).  The cost per barrel before shipment was 16/1½, and the c.i.f. cost per barrel was 35/11.  The average bushel weight was 46 lbs.  The total quantity intended to be imported depends <Col N="553" /> upon what further supplies of oats are made available from the home market to licensed oatmeal millers for the production of oatmeal.  The cost of freight on the imported oats was 19/9½ per barrel including insurance.</P>
      <P>This cargo of oats was imported to relieve the serious shortage of oatmeal due to the difficulty in obtaining a sufficiency of home-grown oats for milling. It is not practicable to import a quantity of wheat sufficient to permit of the production of bran and pollard even if it might be assumed that it would have the effect of releasing more home-grown oats.</P>
      <P>These oats do not carry any Government subsidy but a portion of the cost was met by Grain Importers (Éire), Limited, out of their reserve funds to enable the oats to be sold to Oats (Ireland), Limited, at a price which will enable millers to sell oatmeal at the controlled price.  I am aware that Oats (Ireland), Limited, with my approval, distributed the oats amongst its members on a basis agreed amongst them, apart from a small quantity sold by the company to the Macroom Oatmeal Millers' Association.  By limiting the oats to the company, it is believed that the oats will be used only for the production of oatmeal for human consumption.</P>
      <P>I am advised that it would be impracticable to import oatmeal in preference to oats, even if the oatmeal could be procured.  The nature of oatmeal does not lend itself to bulk transport, and difficulties would be experienced in procuring the necessary sacks. Furthermore, the additional handling involved, the loss of time in loading and discharging, and the smaller quantity which could be shipped in comparison with oats, supported the decision to import oats in preference to oatmeal.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it seriously suggested that it is an economic proposition to ship across the Atlantic Ocean 19,000 barrels of oat hulls which will have to be burned on their arrival at North Wall, after we have paid 19/9½d. freight on them?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Col N="554" />
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; it is a much more economic proposition to grow the oats here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would it not be much more economic to bring across oatmeal instead of hulls?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>No; we would bring in much less.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister tells us it is more economic to bring across oat hulls to be burned at North Wall than oatmeal to be consumed by the public. I wish further to inquire, in connection with question No. 9, if these received the Government bounty, which they clearly did, from the reserve fund accumulated by Cereals Limited, why are certain oatmeal millers in areas where the scarcity of oatmeal is greatest denied supplies of these oats for conversion into oatmeal, while millers situated in remote places are granted shares of these oats, with the result that, from where the oatmeal has been manufactured, it will have to be carted 100 or 150 miles, instead of sending oats to the mills where the demand exists?  Why does not every oatmeal miller get a fair share of the oats?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Why did three millers get a share of these oats for conversion into pinhead oatmeal, while other millers who are anxious to manufacture oatmeal for human use, have been refused an allowance of these oats? I say that is wrong and I am asking the Minister how does he justify it?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesHughes" hpid="Mr. Hughes Mr. Hughes">

That is public money. I am asking why public money is used for subsidising the price of oats, parcels of which were given to individual millers, while millers, similarly situated, were denied any share of the oats, although they wanted them to manufacture oatmeal for human consumption. Why was that done?  Will the Minister give an undertaking that millers who want to convert part of the oats into human food will get a share of the supplies, or is it intended to continue to discriminate between millers?</P>

      <P>Payment of bread subsidy in the particular case referred to by the Deputy and in several others, has been refused as the bakers concerned did not keep the required weekly records of sales of batch bread upon which the subsidy is based. Licensed batch bread bakers are required to keep this record amongst others as a condition attached to their licences and payments of moneys out of public funds cannot be made to them unless they keep the necessary records of sales of batch bread.  No other records can be accepted and an exception to this rule cannot be made in any individual case.</P>

      <P>asked the Minister for Supplies if, in view of the numerous complaints that are being made in every part of the country respecting the uselessness of turf as a fuel, owing to the excessive amount of moisture in it, which excessive moisture is due in most cases to deliberate carelessness in the handling, he will take steps to fix legally a maximum percentage of water content for all turf offered by <Col N="560" /> sale and compel the issue on demand of a certificate to this effect by every seller of turf.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am not aware of numerous complaints that turf is useless as a fuel owing to excessive moisture content.  In the turf area a purchaser of turf, whether a merchant or consumer, is not subject to restriction either as to quantity or source of supply, and this absence of restriction affords the same protection as is provided by ordinary commercial methods governing the purchase and sale of unrestricted commodities.  In all cases where complaints as to quality of turf offered for sale have been received from the turf area, it has been possible to indicate alternative sources of supply of good turf at reasonable prices.</P>
      <P>In the non-turf area where consumers are restricted as regards the quantity of turf which may be purchased and the merchants from whom they may purchase, the merchant is free to reject turf which he regards as unsaleable and is required to replace, free of charge, any such turf which he is found to have delivered to a consumer.</P>
      <P>With regard to the last part of the Deputy's question, tests have shown that moisture content is a varying factor even in respect of turf cut from the same bank and could vary from day to day, in respect of the same turf, according to the moisture content of the surrounding air.  The Deputy's suggestion is therefore impracticable.</P>

      <P>In November, 1941, the Athy Urban District Council submitted proposals for the drainage of 24 <Col N="563" /> houses at Plewman's Terrace, Black Parks Road.  These houses, which were completed in 1937, are provided with earth closets.  The proposal for a water borne system of sewerage would involve discharging the sewage of these houses untreated into the canal via an existing rubble drain.  This drain was originally intended to carry off surface water.  A number of houses other than those which were the subject of the proposal were already connected with this drain, and the county medical officer of health gave it as his opinion that if the sewage from the 24 houses in question were to be added a nuisance would arise at the point of discharge.  Last August the council were informed that in view of this report, the submission of alternative proposals for dealing with the situation would be awaited.  These proposals have not since been furnished.</P>

    <P>
      <Col N="565" /> Proceedings under the Sale of Food and Drugs Acts lie primarily against the vendor of a contaminated article to the public and only where warranty is pleaded and proven would any liability pass on to the wholesaler or manufacturer.</P>
    <P>In the case of some custard powders the name of the manufacturer does not appear on the container.  Usually, a particular brand appellation is used in such cases.  When it came to the knowledge of the Department that custard powder which was contaminated was on sale, the chief medical officers of health for those areas in which factories manufacturing custard powder were known to be situated were communicated with and instructed to arrange for inspection and examination of the commodity stored at those premises, and of the processes and methods of manufacture, and generally to take such action as might be called for under Section 28 of the Public Health Acts Amendment Act, 1890, which empowers a sanitary officer to seize any foodstuff found unfit for human consumption which is intended for sale.</P>
    <P>According to the latest information available all stocks of custard powder which were likely to be contaminated with live meal mites have been withdrawn and every precaution will be taken by the responsible medical officers of health to ensure that no custard powders so affected will be offered for sale.

The granting of this concession <Col N="569" /> would mean the postponement of the operative date of the rule from the 1st October, 1934, to the 1st October, 1939, which would bring in a large number of women teachers who could continue in the service after marriage.  In view of the unfavourable reaction which such concession would have on the employment of existing women teachers, and of the further restriction which would thus be imposed on the present limited opportunities of entering the teaching profession which are available to young girls leaving the secondary schools, I am not prepared to accede to the proposal in the Deputy's question.</P>

The claims of all local applicants were carefully considered. The Land Commission are not aware that Mr. Lambert has let the holding, but are making inquiries in the matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>I would like to make some remarks in connection with certain convent schools where there is an industrial school and a national school together.  This affects the employment of teachers in these schools. In respect of children committed to the industrial school, the capitation grant is made to the establishment to provide for the education of the children.  In every industrial school there is a considerable number of children who do not benefit under that provision.  These are the children who enter the school voluntarily with the consent of their parents or who are committed to the school at the instance of a local <Col N="582" /> authority.  Now, the convent to which these children would be sent gets nothing for them except what the local authority or the consenting parent is able to contribute towards the cost of maintenance.  It has been the practice that these children would be sent to the national school attached to the convent the same as all the children from the neighbourhood.  That is a very salutary thing to do.  It is a great misfortune to a child if he has no family background, and the less you emphasise, in the impressionable years, that it is different from other children, the better for the child.  Therefore, it seemed a very desirable thing that it would run into the national school with all the other children from the village, playing with them and partaking of their life.</P>
      <P>So long as that arrangement was permitted, the numbers of these children from the industrial schools were taken into consideration for the purpose of determining the numbers on the school roll so as to fix the number of teachers who would be eligible to be employed.  Recently, the Department of Education ordered that these convents and schools should take such people off the roll, and, in more than one case, that would mean a reduction of the number of people who could be employed.  That would entail a position in which these children would have to be educated free of cost to the State. No fund is provided by the State out of which their education can be provided for.  Now, it is technically true to say that, in one sense, these children are receiving education at the expense of the State, but the question arises as to whether these industrial or convent schools can meet their costs, and whether they will be compensated for that expense by this Vote.  I understand that the Minister wants to have a review of the position.  I am not raising this matter in any controversial sense.  I am sure that the Minister is as anxious as I am to deal with this matter in a proper way, and I should be grateful to him if he could tell us whether he has found a way out of the difficulty, or, at least, let us know on what lines he intends to proceed to deal with this matter.</P>

    <Speaker pid="ThomasDerrig" hpid="Mr. Derrig Mr. Derrig">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Derrig</NameTxt>
      <P>The position is that in industrial schools there are children for whom grants are paid and also children for whom no grants are paid&mdash; children who are sent by the local authority or go there voluntarily, and in respect of whom no grants are paid. A considerable amount of accounting would be required to keep an account of the amount of capitation grant in respect of each child when one takes into consideration the number of children who are in these institutions on a voluntary basis and the number who are sent there by the local authority. Again, it must be remembered that the schools in question are limited in the numbers they can take.  It may happen that children, on behalf of whom grants have not been paid, may come in as grant-earning children.  All these things make it very difficult from the accounting point of view.  There is also the viewpoint&mdash;I do not know whether Deputy Dillon will agree with me on this or not&mdash;that if we are paying for these children in industrial schools, there would naturally arise the question as to whether we should pay for them again at ordinary national schools.  Further, with regard to the type of children to whom the Deputy referred, undoubtedly, these children are in a particular class, and I am hopeful that we may be able to alleviate the position in favour of the schools to the extent of making special allowance with regard to that type of child.  I can tell the Deputy that the matter is under consideration.  No decision has been reached yet, but I shall be glad to let the Deputy know the result, as soon as a decision is arrived at.</P>

      <P>The sum of £2,000 provided in this Supplementary Estimate is required to meet expenditure in connection with (a) increased superannuation and additional allowances to certain retired officers formerly serving in the Ordance Survey; and (b) payment in respect of children's allowances to the children of a deceased civil servant. Certain Ordnance Survey officers were discharged from their employment during the war of 1914-1918.  If these officers had joined the British Army at the time, their posts in the Ordnance Survey would have been kept open for them and the period of their military service would have been <Col N="588" /> reckoned for superannuation purposes. When they failed to join the British Army, they were discharged from the Ordnance Survey with the pensions or gratuities to which their service entitled them.  They were later reinstated in our service and certified under the Superannuation Act, 1925, or the Superannuation Act, 1936, but under those Acts their pensionable service was allowed to remain only from the date of discharge as the inclusion of their previous service would involve double reckoning for the purposes of the Superannuation Acts of the same period of service.</P>
      <P>To meet the difficulty, however, that these officers should be put in at least as good a position as their colleagues who had not been victimised, power was taken in the Superannuation Act, 1942, to reckon their earlier service for pension.  The gratuities paid will be recovered as an offset to the additional benefits conferred, but pensions being paid by the British Government are not subject to our control.  Offset will be secured in the case of pensioners by issuing from our funds the difference between the pensions paid by the British Government to these officers and the full amount of the pensions which would be payable if awards were being issued on the basis of their total service.  The amount provided in the Supplementary Estimate represents the cost in the current financial year of the reassessment, with effect from the date of retirement, of pensions or gratuities already granted to retired officers of the Ordnance Survey.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Allowances not exceeding a certain fixed maximum in each case are payable in respect of the dependent children of certain civil servants whose salary scales are differentiated on a marriage basis.  Where the fathers are still serving in the Civil Service, the children's allowances are borne on the salary sub-heads of the Votes for the appropriate Departments.  The expenditure provided for in the Supplementary Estimate represents the sum payable in the current financial year in respect of the children of a deceased civil servant.  As the children's allowances in this case are no longer portion of the salary of a serving civil servant. <Col N="589" /> they cannot properly continue to be borne on the salary sub-head of the Department&mdash;in this case, the Department of Industry and Commerce&mdash;in which the deceased officer was serving at the time of his death.  The payment being a non-effective one has, accordingly, been transferred to Vote 16&mdash; Superannuation and Retired Allowances&mdash;which provides exclusively for non-effective payments.</P>

I admit freely that it is a very technical question which it is possibly difficult for the Minister to answer offhand, if he had not got notice, and, to tell the truth, I do not want an answer offhand, <Col N="590" /> provided I am given an undertaking that the Minister will look into it and see that equity and justice are done between the amalgamating companies and the Life Assurance Amalgamation Company, Ltd.</P>

      <P>As Deputies are aware, the Vote for this service is taken towards the end of the financial year to recoup to the Contingency Fund moneys issued from it since it was last replenished, other than advances for services covered by and repayable out of other Votes.  The items of expenditure&mdash;seven in all&mdash;which necessitate this year's Estimate are shown in Part III.</P>
      <P>Item 1&mdash;Stamp duty remitted on deeds and other instruments for public Departments, £575 9s. 9d.&mdash;is a regular feature of the Vote.  The Revenue Commissioners, following a long-established practice, stamp deeds and other instruments for public Departments without insisting on payments of duty, but as there is no power to remit the duty which is imposed by statute, the amount has to be made good to the Revenue and it is more convenient to utilise the Contingency Fund than to make separate provision in Departmental Votes.  Most of the instruments for stamping are presented by the Department of Lands and the Department of Education.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item 2&mdash;Refund of stamp duties paid by the Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company, Ltd., No. 31 of 1938, Section 8 (1) (g) (ii), £381 18s. &mdash;the insurance amalgamation scheme to which effect was given by the Insurance (Amendment) Act, 1938, involved the transfer of assets from the various companies participating in the scheme to the Industrial and Life Assurance Amalgamation Company, Ltd.  It was inexpedient for practical reasons to exempt the instruments of transfer from stamp duty, and, instead, provision was made in the Act that any stamp duties paid on these instruments by the amalgamation company would be refunded to it out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas.  The amount to be refunded was determined only recently, and there being no existing Vote out of which it could be met, it <Col N="591" /> was paid, like the stamp duty remitted in item 1, out of the Contingency Fund.  I wonder if that meets the Deputy's point.</P>

      <P>Item 3&mdash;Recoupment to Drogheda and Dun Laoghaire Corporations of cost of fire brigade services rendered to Belfast following air raids (£141 10s. 1d.).  The payments to these two local authorities (Dun Laoghaire, £85 6s. 1d.; Drogheda, £56 4s. 0d.), represent the expenses incurred by them in sending their fire brigades to Belfast following the air raids on that city in April and May, 1941.  In view of the special circumstances, it was decided that the expenditure should be borne by the State and, as it was not appropriate to any existing Vote, it was defrayed from the Contingency Fund.  Expenses (£355 8s. 2d.) incurred by Dublin Corporation on the same occasion were similarly met out of the Contingency Fund and the amount was recouped to the fund by last year's Vote.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Item 4&mdash;Duty chargeable on estate of late High Commissioner for Canada (£93 3s. 6d.).  Mr. John Hall Kelly, High Commissioner for Canada, died here in March, 1941.  The diplomatic representatives here of external Governments are immune, by diplomatic privilege, from State taxation generally in this country, subject to their Governments being prepared to grant similar concessions to our representatives accredited to them.  In accordance with this principle, the death duties payable on Mr. Kelly's estate were remitted, it having been ascertained that reciprocal treatment would be given in the converse case of an Irish High Commissioner accredited to Canada.  Probate of the will could not be taken out until the appropriate estate duty had been paid and, there being no existing Vote out of which this could be met, the amount involved was defrayed from the Contingency Fund. <Col N="592" /> Item 5&mdash;Travelling Expenses incurred by Deputy (since deceased) prevented by illness from claiming recoupment within statutory period (£16 4s.).  The late Deputy Seán Munnelly died in October, 1941, and, subsequently, a claim was received from a motor hirer in respect of journeys made by the Deputy on various dates during the period May to August, 1941, in connection with his duties as a public representative.  The claim had not been furnished to the Deputy on the ground that the claimant did not wish to trouble him during his illness.  The statutory time limit of 100 days for claiming recoupment of such expenses having expired, they could not be paid out of the usual Vote (House of the Oireachtas), and they were met out of the Contingency Fund, to which non-statutory and <i>ex-gratia</i> payments of unusual character are appropriate.</P>
    <P>Item 6&mdash;Payment in respect of Property Losses Compensation (re-issue of a cancelled payable order&mdash;1936-37) (£14 6s. 4d.).  This payment relates to an award made in April, 1935, under the Damage to Property (Compensation) (Amendment) Act, 1933.  The payable order issued in December, 1936, went out of date and was later mislaid, and the matter was not brought to notice by the applicant's solicitor until May, 1942.  As there was no longer a Vote for Property Losses Compensation &mdash; the service having been closed down at the end of 1941-42&mdash;the payment was made out of the Contingency Fund.</P>
    <P>Item 7&mdash;Triplets Bounty (£12)&mdash;this, like the stamp duty remissions covered by item 1, is a hardy annual.  It represents four payments of £3 each.</P>

    <P>Go ndeontar suim breise ná raghaidh thar £11,000 chun íoctha an Mhuirir a thiocfaidh chun bheith iníoctha i rith na bliana dar críoch an 31adh Márta, 1943, chun Tuarastail agus Costaisí Oifig an Aire <Col N="593" /> Tionnscail agus Tráchtála, maraon le Seirbhísí áirithe atá fé riaradh na hOifige sin.</P>
    <P>That a supplementary sum not exceeding £11,000 be granted to defray the Charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending 31st, March, 1943, for the Salaries and Expenses of the Office of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, including certain Services administered by that Office.</P>
    <P>The increase in sub-head A is due to an unanticipated expenditure arising in connection with the compilation of the register of population, the administration of Emergency Powers Order No. 166, and the additional cost-of-living bonus payable to certain classes of civil servants, messengers, cleaners, and the like, as from 1st January, 1943. The increased expenditure under sub-head C is due to a greater expenditure in advertising during the course of the year.  Sub-head L (3) relates to advances to the Mineral Exploration and Development Company, Limited. Under the Act by which that company was established repayable advances may be made to a limit of £50,000. Advances to a total of £9,814 had been made prior to 1st March, 1942, and the Estimate for that year provided for additional advances to a total of £30,000.  In fact, the company found it needed £39,000 during the year.  The additional £9,000 expenditure arose, first, in connection with capital expenditure upon the development of the phosphate-bearing area in Clare, which was higher than anticipated; secondly, because of the urgent necessity of providing the manufacturers of artificial manures with a supply of sulphur ores the company speeded up the development of the programme in the Avoca area and incurred an expenditure in this financial year which it was anticipated would not have to be made until 1943-44; and also because during the year certain exploratory work was undertaken upon a deposit of iron ore which had been located.</P>
    <P>Sub-head LL provides money to enable the Geological Survey to remove surface drifts and expose underlying rock formations for the purpose of establishing <Col N="594" /> whether a mineral deposit is worth prospecting on an extensive scale.  In the main Estimate for the year only a nominal sum of £5 was provided for that, but, in fact, a sum of £100 was found necessary.  This was due to the fact that the Geological Survey found it desirable to investigate two mineral deposits.  One of these was a deposit of molybdenite at Murvey, County Galway, and involved an expenditure of £80.  The second was a deposit of lead ore at Hollymount, County Mayo, on the examination of which £20 was expended. In both cases it was decided, as a result of examination, that extensive prospecting operations should not be undertaken.</P>
    <P>The only remaining item in the Supplementary Estimate is that for Appropriations-in-Aid.  When the main Estimate was being prepared a national figure of £10 was estimated as the amount likely to be received in respect of fees payable under the Trade Loans Guarantee Act, 1939, in respect of loans guaranteed.  In fact, because of one guarantee of £200,000 given to Irish Steel, Limited, the fees payable, which are calculated on a rate of one half of one per cent. of the amount guaranteed, amounted to £1,000.  That explains the increase recorded in the Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>

      <P>On this Vote.  As the Chair is well aware, the Department of Industry and Commerce has wide scope.  The Minister on a previous occasion, when dealing with this question, said that the purpose of his Department was to use money provided for advertising exclusively for the purpose of bringing the matter to be advertised to the attention of the largest possible number of the persons concerned.  He then explained that his Department would take into consideration the volume of circulation and the class of circulation of the newspaper when determining whether that paper should be advertised in or not, and he went on to say, when pressed as to why his general conduct seems to suggest a marked discrimination against the <i>Kilkenny People,</i> that one of the reasons for this discrimination was because there was another paper circulating in Kilkenny with a larger circulation than the <i>Kilkenny People.</i> His attention was at once directed to the fact that, whatever information was placed in his hands to that effect, was incorrect.</P>

      <P>In order to rebut the obvious fact of discrimination against the <i>Kilkenny People</i>, dictated exclusively by the fact that the <i>Kilkenny People</i> could not be purchased or intimidated into supporting the Fianna Fáil Government, the Minister sought to persuade the House that these were not the motives that moved him, but rather solicitude for the wider dissemination of the facts which he desired to advertise, and that, considering how best to disseminate the information he wanted to spread in County Kilkenny, he had regard to the relative circulation of the newspapers in the County Kilkenny and discovered that another journal in Kilkenny had a larger circulation than the <i>Kilkenny People.</i>  His attention was directed to the fact that this was not so, and that, as so frequently happens in this House, what he stated in the House, to the House, was untrue, and demonstratively untrue, and that if he was stating this on the authority of those who advises him, the sooner he changed his advisers the better, and that, if he was stating it on his own initiative, the sooner he changed his bad habits, the better. Has it made the slightest impression upon him?  Not at all.  He is doing today precisely as he has done in the past.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am sure this House will have great patience with any Minister who suffers from temporary lapses, but I think the House ought to indicate to the Minister for Industry and Commerce that their patience with a Minister who <Col N="597" /> habitually falls back into evil ways, of which he has been warned time and time again, is coming to an end.  His conduct in the County Louth was far different from his conduct in County Kilkenny.  In County Louth, one of his colleagues&mdash;the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures&mdash; was interested in a newspaper.  He is a shareholder and director of a Dundalk paper with a microscopic circulation. Were any errors perpetrated in regard to the circulation of the newspaper concerned?  Yes; but here, astonishingly, the error was exactly the reverse of the error made in Killenny. In Kilkenny the paper with a large circulation was deemed to have a small one and the paper with a small circulation was deemed to have a large one. In Dundalk, the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures' paper, which had a circulation almost invisible, despite their own claims to a circulation of 7,000 copies a week&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Not only by myself, but by the Minister, Deputy McGilligan and by a variety of others.  The sole concern is to secure that where a paper is a violent protagonist of Fianna Fáil it shall not be preferred for the receipt of public advertisements before independent newspapers who are not prepared to be bought or intimidated by Fianna Fáil.  Surely that is a reasonable contection.  Surely it is reasonable and right to inquire in this House why a paper which is controlled by a Minister of State receives preferential <Col N="598" /> treatment over newspapers which are independent of the Government and insist on retaining their independence? Is there anything indecent or improper in discussing that question in the House?  I think it would be right and proper on occasions when obvious discrimination was shown in favour of the Government-kept paper, the <i>Irish Press,</i> that the fact that the Taoiseach was a director of that paper should be mentioned and repeated in this House until the alleged discrimination ended.</P>

      <P>But I have seen it in connection with the <i>Kilkenny People</i> and I have seen it in connection with the paper of the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures in County Louth&mdash;his constituency&mdash;and I think it ought to stop.  This splashing of public money about for the purpose of keeping rickety, political rags on their legs until the pending general elections are over is becoming something approximating to a public scandal and the attempt to purchase or intimidate the independent Press of the country is a very serious menace to free institutions in the State.  I think responsible Deputies on Government Benches as well as Opposition Benches should be solicitous to put an end to it because it is highly likely that, after <Col N="599" /> the next general election, whatever Government will be in power, it will not be a Fianna Fáil Government and whoever comes into their place may start the same game.</P>
      <P>I will deprecate the victimisation of the <i>Irish Press</i> just as I deprecate victimisation of the <i>Kilkenny People.</i> I would like to see them all getting a fair &ldquo;do,&rdquo; and being allowed to fight their corner as best they can without interference by the Government of the day using State funds for a purpose for which they were never meant to be used.  I know when men have been in office for a protracted period they get into a state of mind when they imagine that they are never going out of office, and, therefore, any villainy they can perpetrate with public funds they think it safe to do, because they never contemplate the morrow when somebody else may take example by their activity.  Therefore, I suggest to Fianna Fáil Deputies that they ought to interest themselves in this matter. It is not for the purpose of calling for favouritism for anybody, but merely to ensure that everybody will get a fair &ldquo;do.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I will be interested to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce deal with this question, most especially with the information which was supplied to him that the circulation of the other Kilkenny paper was larger than that of the <i>Kilkenny People.</i> I shall be most interested to hear the Minister tell the House whether he still believes that information.  I shall be interested to hear him tell the House whether he regrets having communicated that as a fact to Dáil Eireann, and having stated in the Dáil that his judgment in allocating other amounts on a previous occasion was influenced by that so-called fact.  I shall be interested to hear him tell us if all the facts by which his judgments in this and other matters are affected are as reliable as that particular fact, and I shall be interested to know if, in the future, when he tells us of certain facts, we are to attach the same importance to them as we are to his allegations in this matter.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to sub-head L (3), is <Col N="600" /> there any Deputy here who has ever succeeded in extracting from the Government a clear and categorical statement as to who owns the Clare phosphates, or what are the Clare phosphates in terms of intrinsic value? I never yet discovered anything in that connection.  Sometimes I am told that they are owned by private citizens, and again I am told that they have been acquired, or are about to be acquired, by the Government for compulsory exploitation.  Sometimes I am told that the deposits there are of substantial value, and again that they are barely worth while developing.  Surely if we are going to spend more and more money in connection with investigation and development work around these deposits we ought to have an authoritative statement as to their true value?  We ought to be told who owns them and on what basis it is intended to get them exploited&mdash;that is, provided one is satisfied that they are really of value.  Perhaps the Minister will give us information on those two points, which are the only two points I would be interested to hear about in regard to this Estimate.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I should like to have some assurance from the Minister regarding the allocation of the moneys provided for under sub-head C.  I listened to the Minister's statement&mdash;I am not sure if it was on the occasion Deputy Dillon referred to&mdash;concerning his policy with regard to the allocation of money for advertising purposes and I was surprised to hear him say that the <i>Kilkenny People</i> had not as big a circulation as another paper circulating in the same area.  I have no political interest in the <i>Kilkenny People</i> and no interest in the extent to which it may get a share of the funds at the disposal of the Minister for Government advertisements, but I know that the owner of the paper, who is a very keen political opponent of the Government Party and of the Labour Party, is a very good employer.  On another occasion, and in another place, I raised this question and a colleague of the Minister gave an assurance that, in regard to the advertisements issued by another Department of State, this <Col N="601" /> paper would in future get its fair share, on the ground that he was convinced that it was the paper that has the biggest circulation in the County Kilkenny and in portion of the adjoining county, which is in my constituency.</P>
      <P>In the allocation of the moneys provided by the House for this purpose, I am concerned only from this point of view&mdash;that the advertisements will be given to the papers with the biggest circulation.  I think it is desirable that the information which it is desired to get into the heads and hands of the people will be given to the papers that are most popular, and that have the biggest circulation in the area.  I think that is the way the Minister should look at the distribution of this money. I should like to have an assurance that he will in future, like one of his colleagues, see that justice is meted out to the owners of the <i>Kilkenny People</i> on the ground only&mdash;as I am satisfied, and as a colleague of his is satisfied&mdash; that it is the paper with the biggest circulation in the County Kilkenny, and in portion of the adjoining county.  I know nothing whatever about the other paper that Deputy Dillon referred to, but I daresay he speaks with some authority on the matter.</P>

As the Minister is aware, an instrument that is out of commission here entirely, at least for the period of the emergency&mdash;what is called the Constitution&mdash;is most elegantly arranged, and every effort is made so to modify any section that is amended that the chief advisers of the State are all saddled with responsibility in connection with it&mdash;I think even the Chief Justice is brought into it.  It is of little use at the moment.  It may have political or other uses at another time, but just now it is out of action.  The last time I looked at Emergency Order No. 83, there were six amendments to it.  It might possibly save some expense with advertisements if there was a single Order framed and if the rest of them were put out of commission.</P>
      <P>I share the views that have been expressed by Deputy Dillon and Deputy Davin in connection with that paper that circulates in the County Kilkenny.  Outside of whatever information was given to the Minister, there is no other person in this country who believes that the circulation of the <i>Kilkenny People</i> is less than the circulation of any other paper in that area.  I believe it is greater.  When the auditors issued certificates in connection with that matter, the <i>Kilkenny People</i> got a certificate, and the paper that the Minister is under the impression has a larger circulation got no certificate.  Apart from that, anybody in that district could inform the Minister that the <i>Kilkenny People</i> has the largest circulation.  Assuming it had not&mdash;and that is assuming a good deal &mdash;there would not be a good case for the Minister's discrimination against it. It would be much better if we would not have that type of thing in this State.  Even if there are political opponents of persons who are in authority, it would be better not to make any discrimination.  The Minister must be succeeded some time or other.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="603" /> These things are sometimes seized by others as precedent.  They are unworthy and dangerous precedents. After 20 years we should be sensible enough in connection with these affairs of public administration to have a fair and honest line.  On the moral side of it, the Minister has no right to discriminate in this case against some person who perhaps disagrees with his Party, and it only adds to whatever political hostility there is.</P>
    <P>Only this morning there has been issued to some members of the Dáil a very interesting publication from the Swedish propaganda body.  They have set a high standard there with regard to propaganda and have put the entire responsibility on the persons in the industry.  I take it, from the way in which this publication is phrased, that it is rarely that there are cases in the courts in connection with abuses on the part of journalists.  It is very undesirable that allegations such as we have heard here now and on other occasions should be made to Ministers in connection with the manner in which they administer office.  Surely, we are old enough to get rid of political discrimination. The sooner we do so the better.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">

      <P>I would like to hear a declaration by the Minister that certain newspapers will not be discriminated against when State funds are being expended on advertisements. Regardless of the views expounded by the writers, I think they are entitled to equal treatment.  Mr. E.T. Keane, the editor of the <i>Kilkenny People,</i> has been an outspoken critic of the Government and its policy.  One must have regard&mdash;as Deputy Davin has said&mdash;to the fact that he is a good employer. He has been an outstanding Nationalist for many years.  He is fearless, he is a lover of freedom, and in his desire to expound the policy of freedom for all classes he should not be discriminated against.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I would like to hear the Minister say that, in future, all the papers, regardless of their political views, will get a fair share in the distribution of State <Col N="604" /> moneys for advertising purposes.  They are entitled to that, regardless of Government favour, by the fact that you get good value from the circulation of the advertisements.  It is an unwise policy of the Minister to select papers for his patronage and discriminate against others, and, with Deputies Davin, Dillon and Cosgrave, I think that the <i>Kilkenny People</i> is worthy of better treatment than has been given to it by the Government.</P>

      <P>The question of newspaper advertising has been raised on this Supplementary Estimate.  I suppose it could be raised on the Supplementary Estimate for any Department, but it has been raised now, and it is no harm to tell the Dáil the principles on which the Government works when advertisements have to be published. They are given to all the daily newspapers and to a selection of the provincial newspapers.  It would be an easy matter for the Minister for Finance or any Minister to decide to give the advertisements to all provincial newspapers, big and small, important and unimportant.  That would avoid the possibility of charges of political discrimination being made by people with the minds of Deputy Dillon and Deputy Byrne.  I am accustomed to allegations of that kind from these Deputies but, in so far as there is any annoyance, I could easily avoid that by spending public money and giving these advertisements to all provincial newspapers who apply for them.  A large part of that money would be wasted, and the Minister for Finance would object.</P>
      <P>In fact, only about 40 per cent. of the provincial newspapers get these advertisements.  The selection is not made upon political grounds.  The implication of Deputy Dillon that, by giving these advertisements, we have purchased the allegiance of provincial newspapers which receive them, will not stand an investigation of the leading articles of some of them.  I do not know if Deputy Dillon still reads <i>The People's Press.</i></P>

      <P>It is true that some provincial newspapers, which are strongly opposed to the policy of the Government, receive Government advertisements. I think it is an insult to the proprietors and editors of those papers to suggest, as Deputy Dillon suggests, that the mere giving of Government advertisements will buy their political allegiance.  Deputy Mulcahy has made a reference to a particular advertisement. I am not responsible for it.  The deliberate policy of the Government is to refuse to give advertisements encouraging people to grow wheat to newspapers which, in their leading articles, give contrary advice to the people.  It would be sheer stupidity if the Government took the people's money and spent it on putting advertisements into newspapers which devoted every other part of the paper to propaganda to deny the truth and counteract the advice given in the advertisement.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="606" /> So far as the <i>Kilkenny People</i> is concerned, I have no particular animosity against Mr. Keane, as editor.  He has succeeded, in my opinion, with skill amounting almost to genius, in dodging the libel laws for years.  The information which came to me as to the relative circulations of his paper and other papers circulating in that locality, and of the provincial newspapers of the country, was supplied by a reputable firm of advertising agents.  At the present time, none of these papers will supply certified circulations. In normal times, some provincial newspapers had their circulations certified; others had not, and in respect of those who had not, those who were engaged in the advertising business had to take the word of their managements as to the size of the circulation. I stated, however, when this matter was under discussion before, that the size of the circulation is not, and cannot be, the only consideration in the matter.  We must also take into account the area in which the paper circulates, the class of people who purchase it, and any special features which may make it a necessary medium to employ in order to get Government advertisements to the public.  We even cater for the class of people who vote for Deputy McMenamin.  I heard his guffaw.</P>

      <P>Those people require some money to be spent on them, and require to be exhorted to do their duty, same as other people.  They also require information as to the methods the Government is adopting to protect the national interests, and they get it. Having regard to his experience in his own constituency, Deputy McMenamin should be the last to suggest that political considerations determine the giving of public advertisements. No Deputy here would make that assertion.  There are about 60 provincial newspapers which get no <Col N="607" /> advertisements from the Government, and they are of all shades of polities; but, for obvious reasons, one newspaper has been singled out here as a source of attack, to support the contention that the Government, in giving advertisements, is animated by political motives.  There is a very substantial number of newspapers which are strong supporters of the Government which do not get advertisements from the Government, which newspapers Deputy Dillon could go out and look at.</P>

      <P>Deputy Dillon loves to wallow in mud.  He loves it, but he seems to forget that you cannot keep dabbling in mud without having some of it stick to your fingers.  He loves to throw mud, but it does not do us any harm; it only harms himself.  The <Col N="608" /> Deputy asked for information about the County Clare phosphates, and again, of course, his assumption, that everyody is as ignorant as himself, is completely unfounded.  These phosphates are the property of the State. Of course, they can be leased by the State.  It is, perhaps, true to say that all the undiscovered minerals beneath the soil of this country are the property of the State.  It has, however, always been the policy to provide that the people who discover these minerals and work them through their own resources have a right to a preference in obtaining a lease of them, subject to royalties and conditions.  In the case of the Clare phosphates, the individual who discovered them and who undertook their development at his own expense, was granted a licence to work them.  Subsequently, when the present crisis necessitated the greater development of our mineral resources, the Mineral Development Company, Ltd.&mdash;a Government Company&mdash;secured the greater part of these deposits and also secured a licence from the State to work neighbouring deposits.  That company is now working the deposits.</P>

      <P>I understand that they are producing 500 tons a week.  In that connection, however, I should say that any deposits of that kind are almost invaluable at the present moment.  Certainly, it will be almost impossible to import the fertilisers that we require and, therefore, any fertilisers that we can produce or make for ourselves are practically invaluable. The phosphate rock produced at Clare, mixed with whatever phosphate rock we can import from other countries, <Col N="609" /> will be the basis of production of all the superphosphate available to this country.</P>

Deputy Cosgrave referred to Emergency Powers Order No. 166&mdash;I do not know whether his question was inspired or not&mdash;and asked whether anything was being done towards codifying that and the amending Orders. The codification of these Orders is being proceeded with, and I hope the new Order will be available in the near future.</P>

Not only have I personal knowledge of this matter, but representations have been made to me in connection with it.  It is the question of providing for the comfort and the expenses of jurors who are summoned to serve on juries and who have to come to court under considerable difficulty in present circumstances. I am aware that an arrangement has been made to meet the situation by a reduction in the number of jurors on a jury from 12 to seven, but that does not solve the problem.  Very often a case which a country jury is trying does not finish until the last public vehicle has left the town, with the result that jurors are left on the streets for the night. No provision, financial or otherwise, is made for their accommodation, although some of them have come considerable distances.</P>

The criminal trials are heard in Wexford town and some of the jurors come from the Wicklow border and from the borders of Waterford.  Even in the ordinary course, it is very difficult to get from one end of the county to the other, and this is particularly the case now.  My suggestion is that some arrangements should be made by the Department to ensure that a juror who has served on a jury all day will have some accommodation provided for him <Col N="613" /> at the end of the day's work, or, in the alternative, that some method of bringing him home that night will be provided.  The matter is urgent not only in my constituency, but in all the country constituencies where the jurors have to come long distances.  This was a matter of importance in normal times and a grievance in respect of it existed in normal times, and the Minister can readily understand that the grievance is multiplied a hundred fold now.</P>

      <P>When the question of juries is being considered, it is high time that the question of providing jurors' expenses should be considered. Some time ago, when the Courts of Justice Act was being discussed here, I tried to have an amendment inserted providing for increased allowances for jurors.  I think it should have been done in that case.  I do not know of any section of the people who are as harshly treated as jurors are at present. Nobody is asked to spend his own money in doing public service, except a juror, who has to go to the court whether he wishes or not and no matter how urgent his own business may be, and, as the previous Deputy has pointed out, the question of what time would be suitable for such people is not considered.  I know that many jurors have been summoned to appear at a certain hour.  In order to be there at that hour, they have to leave the day before.  If they wait for a bus or the ordinary travelling facilities, they are told they are late and are summoned on that day three months again. That has happened to my knowledge on several occasions.  No consideration is extended to these people.  I think it is time that their expenses were met, which would solve the whole problem. The courts might then, for reasons of economy, consider calling these people on the basis of the travelling facilities available.  In any case, their out-of-pocket expenses should be provided. That is not going to corrupt our courts.</P>

      <P>I might say that, in addition to providing for seven jurors, the Order referred to by Deputy Esmonde also provided, where necessary, for the limitation of the area from which jurors for the Circuit Court may be drawn.  I do not know if Deputies are aware of that.  Because of a realisation of the difficulties in respect of travel, to which Deputy Esmonde referred, it was decided to give power to limit the area.  I think the Order sets out that the Circuit Court shall have power to call jurors from a limited area, and to reduce the number to seven, with the object of preventing as much hardship as possible.</P>
      <P>On the question of expenses, I know that very small payments are made and then only in civil cases, but I take it that the theory is that jury service is voluntary and always has been voluntary, and that, if there was any question of payment, the whole voluntary idea would disappear.  I am giving that as my own view, but I think that must have been the basis of it.  I think that regard is had to the circumstances of the people called and I imagine that jurors are not called indiscriminately.  I did not expect the point to be raised, but I do know that the object of reducing the number of jurors and restricting the area was to avoid any hardship there might be in people being unable to get home at night.  I think the cases mentioned by Deputy McGovern probably occurred before this Order was made.  Whether or not the situation has been met by this Order, I cannot say, but I shall look into the matter.  I do not know what authority we have to increase allowances, but I shall look into it and see if any easement can be afforded.</P>

      <P>There is one thing which might make matters easier so far as the jurors on the list at present are concerned.  There is at present a great need for a wider extension of the number of jurors on the list.  So far as I can see from any registers I know, nobody ever becomes a juror unless his father was a juror, and in the Circuit Court in Cork I have seen time and again, when a jury was being called, a number of people claiming exemption on the ground that they were over age.  They had been left on the list, but are then wiped off.  The jury system at one time was the privilege of a certain class, and, so far as I can see, the position has remained that only landed people and business people of a certain type succeeded their fathers as jurors.  We never seem to get any new names and I think there are a number of legal men in the House who must know that.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>An additional sum of £9,761 is required for the prisons service for the year 1942/3.  This additional expenditure is practically entirely due to the increase in the prison population during the year.  The original estimate provided <Col N="617" /> for a daily average of 615 prisoners, whereas the daily number in custody reached a peak point of 857 during the year.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>They are not.  They are a different type of person from the ordinary criminals.  In Mountjoy, in 1941, the number of committals for house-breaking was 86, and in 1942, 123; for larceny, in 1941, 339, and in 1942, 666&mdash;almost double the number. The increase in the number of prisoners in custody is reflected in the additional sums required under the following sub-heads of the Vote: (a) Pay and allowance of officers, including uniform, (b) Victualling, (c) Clothing, bedding, furniture, etc.; (g) escort and conveyance.  For the pay and allowance of officers the additional sum required is £1,720.  It was necessary, in order effectively to supervise the additional prisoners in custody, to recruit a number of temporary warders through Employment Exchanges.  The increase in bonus which was granted during the year is responsible for portion of the additional expenditure. The increased amount required for victualling is £3,415.  In addition to the increase in the number of prisoners, there has been a general rise in the price of foodstuffs.  The annual cost of feeding a prisoner increased from £20 19s. 6d. to £23 8s. 0d. during the year.  The increased amount required in the case of clothing is £155.  The increase under this sub-head is small and is again due to the increased number of prisoners.  In the case of escort and conveyance, the additional amount required is £2,550.  In addition to the increase in this sub-head occasioned by the rise in numbers, other factors have operated to swell <Col N="618" /> expenditure, e.g., (a) rise in charges for motor hire; (b) curtailment of rail services resulting in longer absences of prison officers engaged in court duty; and (c) frequent transfers from Limerick prison to prevent overcrowding in that establishment consequent on Cork prison not being available for ordinary prisoners.</P>
      <P>In the case of fuel and light, etc., the additional sum required is £1,220. The increase under this sub-head is not due to the increased number in custody.  It has been caused mainly by the fact that we have had to use wood and turf in lieu of coal for firing the boilers at Mountjoy Prison.  The increase of £2,450 in the manufacturing department and farms is almost entirely offset by the increased yield from Appropriations-in-Aid.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="TimothyLinehan" hpid="Mr. Linehan Mr. Linehan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Linehan</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one item under the heading of Escorts and Conveyance which the Minister would do well to look into.  It is a matter which is costing the State quite a lot of money and wasting a lot of petrol which would be very valuable for other purposes.  It is all occasioned, in the south, at any rate, by the fact that Cork prison is not being used.  The type of case to which I want to draw attention is a case where an offender is charged with a minor larceny.  That person is remanded by a peace commissioner and taken to Limerick prison and has to be brought before the District Court in the area where the offence occurred within seven days. That means that the prisoner is driven on a Monday in a motor car, say, from Castletownbere to Limerick prison, which would be, practically, 200 miles by road, and, possibly, brought back to the Bandon District Court or the Clonakilty District Court some few days afterwards.  The difficulty is that, as the law stands, a person must be brought back for trial before the district justice of the area in which he was charged before the peace commissioner. In 90 per cent. of these cases you will get pleas of &ldquo;guilty&rdquo; or, if the cases are contested, the jurisdiction of the District Court is accepted by the prisoners, who will not elect to go for trial before a judge and jury.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="619" /> It strikes me that if, for the emergency at any rate, some method could be adopted whereby the prisoner could be brought before the district justice in the area where the prison is situated, it would get over the difficulty.  It would make no difference to the prisoners, as 90 per cent. of them are people who are not particularly concerned about what type of legal aid they get.  They are not anxious to be driven 150 miles to employ a particular solicitor.  Even if it were done by emergency order, something should be done in these cases where a person is charged with a minor offence.  If the person is taken to Limerick prison, he could be brought before the district justice in that area.  I think it is not unreasonable to ask that that should be done, because it is ridiculous to see a police car travelling a couple of hundred miles for the sake of a case which may only take about five seconds to hear in the District Court.</P>

      <P>On this Estimate last year there was a great hullabaloo about what was occurring, which to me seemed only a passing phase in this country.  To-day the Minister slurs over the abnormal increase in burglary and housebreaking cases.  I would much prefer if the Minister opened up on that and enlightened the House as to what steps he proposes to take in regard to it.  I am never alarmed at any increase in petty offences, as it may be a passing phase.  But these cases are really alarming and I should like to hear from the Minister what steps he is taking to meet them.  So far as I can see, the position has reached such a stage that people have come to the conclusion that the persons committing those offences are armed when they come to the houses, with the result that, although people may be upstairs while the burglars are in a house, they are afraid to come down or to raise any alarm.  If that spreads, it will create a very serious condition of affairs in this country.  It is quite easy to say things and to make charges about the extension of crime.  The <Col N="620" /> important thing is to grapple with it. As far as I see, the problem arises from the fact that there are not sufficient Guards and, in the main, the time of the Guards is taken up with a lot of detailed work which, strictly speaking, is not police work at all but work connected with other Departments, for instance, enforcing the School Attendance Act, looking after unlicensed bulls, and things like that.  There may be only three men and a sergeant in a station and one man is off duty every day.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McMenamin</NameTxt>
      <P>This House does funny things.  I only want to refer to the effects of them.  I think the Minister will have to approach this matter seriously and perhaps, later on, the House will be called upon to deal with it.  Extraordinary powers may have to be taken in connection with it.  So far as I can be of help to the Minister, I would suggest that he will have to increase the number of Guards in rural Ireland in order that there may be one or two extra men in every station who will be free to deal exclusively with criminal matters or, if he cannot see his way to do that, that he will have to organise the L.D.F. or the L.S.F. to act in co-operation with the Guards in doing patrol duty at night.  I do not make that statement loosely and haphazardly.  If that idea were adopted, it would have to be carried out in a systematic way.  I do not think we can expect to get efficient service in enforcing the law without making proper provision.  We cannot ask these men to do that work on a voluntary basis.  We cannot reasonably expect them to go out on dark winter nights, when it is most essential that they should be out, on a voluntary basis. They may do it in a district for a week or ten days.  I take it that they are on duty all night.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister should take active steps to deal with this matter.  If he does not do so, it will get completely out of hands and will reach a crisis. In that event very serious steps <Col N="621" /> might have to be taken and the numbers of the Guards might have to be seriously increased.  It is quite possible that with some plan for the coordination of the Guards with the L.D.F. the problem could be solved but it would have to be done in a systematic way, on a sound basis. In my opinion, it is no use simply asking the L.D.F. to do police duty at night, and to do it effectively, without some financial provision to compensate them for the sacrifices they will have to make.  It would not do to put them on for a night now and a night again; they would have to go on duty every night or alternative nights.  Alternatively, the number of Guards should be increased to provide at least two men extra in every barrack in the State.</P>
    <P>I do not know what is coming over the country.  It may be that the shortage of certain things has started this wave of housebreaking.  It may be that men have lost employment and are now short of money and in desperation are doing these things. Whatever is the cause, it is not justifiable. I think the matter is reaching such serious proportions that the Minister should take immediate action in the matter.  I am not saying that in order to raise alarm.  The Minister has received returns from all over the country.  He knows exactly the position.  The figures he quoted here this evening speak for themselves but, over and above the actual convictions, there is a number of cases where there are no convictions. The Minister has reports of these from police officers throughout the country.  I would like some details to be given to the House so that we might get a picture of the general trend.</P>
    <P>I had these things in my mind on the occasion of the Estimate last year.  Everybody in the House raised a furore about a simple matter and everybody, apparently, closed down on the serious matter of crime.  I felt there was some misunderstanding about it owing to the atmosphere in the House and I closed down on it. I regretted having done so afterwards. I regretted that I did not say what I had intended to say.  I <Col N="622" /> do not want to overstate the case or to create unnecessary alarm but the House can appreciate, from the figures given by the Minister this evening, the trend of events in the country.  I think we should have regard to the old maxim that prevention is better than cure and if in the last analysis, we are confronted with the fact that we will have to increase the number of Guards, the position should be dealt with in an effective way so as not to allow the country to drift into a situation that it would take a huge effort to remedy.  If persons knew that the arm of the law was strong enough there would not be a temptation to commit crime.</P>
    <P>Owing to the limited number of Guards in certain districts, there are whole tracts of country where it is impossible for the Guards to have any control.  There are stretches of 10, 15, 20 and 25 miles of country in which there is no Guard at all.  There is temptation to men who have lost employment.  They may be hungry. They may be in need of things.  I do not like the trend of events.  Some of these things may be very petty in themselves but they reveal a grave tendency.  I would like the Minister to tell us what reports he has received and if he proposes taking any steps to co-ordinate the Guards and the auxiliary forces.  If this state of things continues people will become alarmed, and if law-breakers are armed they will take no steps to resist them.</P>

      <P>A matter arises on this Vote in connection with transportation of prisoners.  It is a matter that can be rectified by some adjustment in the regulations of the Department. In the town of Wexford we have a very serious transport situation in regard to travelling north from the town.  There is only one bus, which leaves at 4 o'clock.  There is no train after 9 o'clock in the morning.  It is a well-known fact that many people are left behind.  One evening I witnessed three prisoners and four attendants boarding the bus.  The three prisoners were convicted in the local District Court and had been sentenced to be sent to Mountjoy Prison in Dublin. Under the regulations, one of the <Col N="623" /> prisoners being a female, it was necessary to have a female attendant.  In addition, there were three others&mdash;I am not sure whether they were Guards or warders&mdash;and altogether there were seven passengers placed on the bus, to the inconvenience and discomfort of people who wanted to travel that day. I made enquiries in orded to discover why the prisoners and their attendants could not wait until the train next morning at 9 o'clock when, no doubt, there would be plenty of room for them.  I was informed that there was no procedure under which the prisoners could be kept overnight in the town of Wexford.  I do not know whether that was so, but that was the explanation given to me.  I think it is a matter that is deserving of some consideration by the Department.</P>

      <P>As to the point raised by Deputy McMenamin, I do not know whether the Minister has any statistics to show in what areas the increase in charges of larceny and housebreaking arises.  I have had many cases reported to me recently of housebreaking in and around the City of Dublin and many cases concerned with the snatching of ladies' handbags in the suburbs of the city.  I think there is great need for increased police vigilance in some of the roadways in the suburbs.  It might be advisable if the Gárda authorities made representations to the Dublin Corporation with the object of ensuring that there will <Col N="624" /> be improved lighting along some of those roads.  I know many roads along which, at night time, women would require to be fairly courageous in order to travel.  I know many ladies who would not dream of walking along some of those roads even though it might not be late at night.  Many bags have been snatched from ladies on roads of that kind.  The bag-snatching has been facilitated, first, because one rarely sees, a policeman on these roads, and, second, because the lights are unnecessarily restricted and, where there is a light, it is unnecessarily cowled.  I think the Minister ought seriously to consider the need for increased police supervision.  These roads are the mecca of the bag-snatchers and the housebreakers. The Gárda authorities should request the corporation to provide better lighting in the areas where this type of crime has grown to serious proportions.</P>

      <P>I should like to press the point made by Deputy McMenamin.  When he speaks of the L.D.F., I think he would be satisfied to refer to the L.S.F., particularly with regard to the City of Dublin.  I think it is very important at the present time that we should get a proper appreciation of this problem of housebreaking, larceny and bag-snatching.  I think that whatever difficulties the Gárdaí have in this connection should be made the subject of discussion between the police chiefs and the chiefs of the L.S.F.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The L.S.F. was brought into being to assist the police.  They are doing a fairly considerable amount of work in connection with traffic direction at certain hours on certain days.  It would be much more important, from the point of view of public morals and public confidence, if it were shown that a very definite attempt was being made to stop this outbreak of larceny and housebreaking.  If the L.S.F. were told that that is a definite matter in which they could stand in with the police, in order to assist the police, then I believe that whether they are on or off duty there will be an alertness and a sense of responsibility awakened in them and you will have a greater <Col N="625" /> watch maintained in lighted or darkened streets.  I suggest that once you call the L.S.F. in and give them a systematic responsibility in connection with this matter, you will strengthen public spirit and public opinion and the ordinary individuals or the men with special qualifications who are in the L.S.F. will be all brought into the scheme.</P>
    <P>From what we hear in many directions, there would appear to be a very definite undermining of public confidence and assurance because of this outbreak of crime.  It is definitely suggested in certain parts of the city that the police are weak in regard to this matter.  There are some parts of the city where there is ample evidence that they are quite alive, but, on the other hand, there are sections of the city where people simply toss their heads when you talk about the police in connection with these matters.  If the police were brought into more systematic touch with the chiefs of the L.S.F. and were brought a little more into touch with other people outside police organisations, I believe the weak spots in the police would be strengthened and they would be made more alert.  If they did not become more alert, you would have a better chance of finding out where the weak spots are.  I think something along these lines is very necessary, at least in and around the city.</P>

      <P>I should like to call attention to the situation that exists in some of the suburbs.  It would appear, from what I can gather, that there has been great difficulty in getting additional Gardaí.  In certain districts limited numbers of Gárdaí have to do duty outside the houses of the Ministers and judges.  In districts where there are numbers of Ministers and judges residing, the area is in this way absolutely denuded of Gárdaí, particularly at night-time.  I suggest that the Minister might consider limiting the number of men on duty outside the residences of Ministers and judges and bring in members of the L.S.F. in order to assist in this duty.  In that way numbers of Gárdaí would be released for ordinary police duties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I have discussed this matter with <Col N="626" /> certain officials and I find that burglaries and interference with individuals occur more or less in groups. The wrongdoers happen to know the particular police station which is left short of policemen.  When they become aware that there are no policemen to do duty on a particular night, they carry on their operations.  The Minister should take some steps to see if Gárda could not be relieved of the duty of watching Ministers' and judges' houses and members of the L.S.F. substituted. That will give the Gárdaí an opportunity to carry on their regular police work.  I have had experience of cases being brought to the notice of the Gárdaí, and I am aware that they acted very promptly.  I think it is only right that some recognition should be given to the prompt way in which they acted.</P>

      <P>I think Deputy McMenamin suggested that I was more or less slurring over this matter.  On a supplementary estimate it is not usual to enlarge on certain points.  As a rule, that is done on the main Estimate.  I have already drawn public attention to what has been happening. The fact that we will have to increase our expenditure because there are additional prisoners indicates that we are doing a good deal towards apprehending wrongdoers.  In 1941 there were 399 prisoners for ordinary larcenies, and this year we have 666. I think that speaks for itself.  Something has been done, at any rate.  The number of prisoners has doubled, and that means that double the number must have been caught.  I am prepared to admit that all have not been caught.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>
      <P>That may be so.  I suppose there always will be a percentage of people who will escape.  I did not expect a long debate on this.  Ministers generally do not, and, frankly, I did not; and therefore I have not got the full statistics.  I do not know whether the percentage of detections has gone down or up, and will have to go into that more fully.  Generally <Col N="627" /> speaking, one-third more prisoners than formerly have to be provided for all over the country, and that shows that we have caught a good number of them.</P>
      <P>I have been going into this question of the L.S.F., but I do not think it would be easy to get L.S.F. men to do what Deputy Briscoe suggests.  One could not expect to put them outside Ministers' houses and let the police off. It becomes a question of getting more police.  We have not got the extra Gárdaí whom we were trying to recruit, as there was some disappointment in the examinations.  We have not got as many as we expected, and none has been called up yet.  We have been trying to remedy that.  When it comes to a question of increasing the police force, we have to bear the cost in mind, and I am sure that Deputies opposite will admit that there has been a vigorous campaign against the increased expenditure on the Gárda Síochána.  Deputy O'Higgins had several long letters in the Press, pointing out the big difference in the expenditure in 1927 and to-day, even though I showed that it was due, not to a greater number of police, but to the fact that men are longer in the Gárda and that they have got increments during those years, and that there is a very high percentage of married men now, with rent allowances and so on.  If we want more police, we will have to pay for them.</P>

      <P>On the question which Deputy Esmonde raised about transport, I cannot say what the facilities in Wexford are for keeping people overnight.  It is a fact that travel facilities have deteriorated so much that these things are, unfortunately, bound to happen. I will look into the Wexford question and see what can be done.  With regard to Deputy Linehan's point about trying to have people brought before the district justice in the district in which the prison is, I will have to consider that.  It seems a reasonable proposition.  It may be necessary to make that arrangement by an Emergency Powers Order.  It is a pity that Cork prison is not available.

In regard to the lighting restrictions in the city, the Gárdaí would like to have as much light as possible, but there is an A.R.P. regulation regarding the cowling of lights.  Everyone knows that that came in with the emergency.  It is one of the difficulties with which the Gárdaí have to contend.  I do not know <Col N="629" /> whether anything can be done about it or not.  I do not think the corporation alone could do anything, as the A.R.P. authorities would have to be consulted.

    <Speaker pid="GeraldBoland" hpid="Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland) Gerald Boland">
      <NameTxt>Minister for Justice (Mr. Boland)</NameTxt>
      <P>I move that the Bill be now read a Second Time.  This is a Bill to amend sub-section (1) of Section 46 of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931, in two respects.  First, I shall deal with the amendment of paragraph (d) of the sub-section, probably the more important one.  The effect of paragraph (d), as it has been interpreted by the courts, is that, if the original lessee had erected a building before he had actually obtained a building lease, the present-day lessee would not be entitled to the reversionary lease.  This is being remedied by the amendment of paragraph (d), contained in paragraph (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 2 of the Bill.  Certain necessary consequential provisions are contained in sub-section (2) of Section 2. That is the first amendment.  There was a case recently where one of the judges said, in delivering judgment, that there was clearly a flaw in the Act, as he thought the intention was that a reversionary lease should be granted where the building was erected in accordance with an agreement; but it happened that the court decided that, as the Act stood, of the buildings were erected before the lease was signed, the lessee could not get the benefit of Section 46.  We are bringing in this Bill to amend that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="630" /> We are also providing for another type of case, where the building lease was given outside an urban area or a village.  There is a case where, about 60 years ago, a board of guardians got a building lease a little bit outside a village and, because it was not in what is described as an urban area, it was found that they did not get the benefits of a reversionary lease.  The other amendment covers that by providing that any house, even though it may be outside an urban area, if the area of the land is not more than one acre, will get the benefit of Part V of the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1931.</P>

      <P>That case has been settled, but such a case may arise again.  Other provisions of the 1931 Act have been applied to such buildings outside urban areas, and it seems there was an omission to provide for such a case as this, and that omission is being rectified now.  I took advantage of one matter to deal with the other.  The person who had that lease has lost, of course, as this will only deal with future cases, if they arise.</P>

      <P>On behalf of Deputy Costello, who raised some of these points&mdash;some of them I raised myself&mdash;I want to express my appreciation of the action of the Minister in bringing in this Bill.  I think, however, that there is, at least, one gap to be filled.  Under the 1931 Act, in order to hold your legal right to get a reversionary lease, you had to make application for it seven years before the actual lease fell in.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Boland</NameTxt>

    <Speaker pid="RichardJamesMulcahy" hpid="General Mulcahy General Mulcahy">
      <NameTxt>General Mulcahy</NameTxt>
      <P>Any time within the seven years?  At any rate, the Minister, while settling the position with regard to the past, is not in a position to say what will happen with regard to any lease that may fall in at the present moment or before this Bill becomes an Act, and which may not be covered by this particular Bill.  While the Act is intended to make right the position which, it was thought, the 1931 Act made right, and which legal decisions held that it did not make right, we are still leaving a gap and, if any lease falls in before this Bill is passed, we are deliberately excluding the possibility of any reversionary lease being taken into consideration.  I would suggest that, in order to meet the Minister's intention, it would be necessary to amend this Bill so that where, since the passing of the 1931 Act, a person was prevented from getting a reversionary lease, by reason of a defect which showed itself afterwards, after the passing of this Act it will be possible for such a person to remedy that situation.  To my knowledge, there are two cases where leases have expired and where, normally, an application would have been made and an attempt made to get a reversionary lease, but the people concerned did not come under what was, evidently, the intention of the 1931 Act.  My point is that such people will be excluded now also.  I am not speaking of cases where there might be a question of a third-party interest.  I know very well that there are cases where third-party interests would be involved.  My point is that there are certain cases which, clearly, come within the intention of the 1931 Act &mdash;where there are no third-party interests concerned&mdash;and I think that such cases should be dealt with in this Bill.  I think that an amendment should be inserted to deal with that matter, and I propose to submit an amendment myself&mdash;if the Minister does not do so&mdash;with the object of making this retrospective.</P>

      <P>I think that the first amendment is a very necessary one, and I think that the case that came before the Courts will be only <Col N="632" /> the first of a series of such cases, because a great deal of the property in Dublin comes into the same category. With regard to the second amendment, I presume that the Minister considered that that was necessary and I have not a very great quarrel with it, but it seems to me to bring in every building throughout the country.  There is no restriction there except to an area of an acre. Under the original Act, an urban area included towns of a certain size, but also a village.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Boland Mr. Boland">

      <NameTxt>Sir J. Esmonde</NameTxt>
      <P>But it did definitely exclude an area outside a village.  I think it should be realised that the amendment is aimed at meeting a certain case.  It brings in every building &mdash;no matter where it is situated&mdash;provided that it has an acre of ground attached.  Now, that might bring in a mill.  I do not know whether it is intended to go as far as that, but it seems to me that, according to this Bill, any building that is surrounded by an acre of land will come under it. It seems to me that, since the Minister did say that the second amendment was intended to deal with cases that had already arisen, now would be the time to deal with such cases as I have mentioned.</P>

Where there is a question of a third party involved; the case would be different, and it will be understood that I would have to provide for the interests of any third party that might have arisen in the meantime.  However, I see the Deputy's point, and I shall endeavour to meet it.  I shall bring in an amendment on the Committee Stage to deal with the matter.  With regard to the point that was made by Deputy Esmonde, I think that if he will look at Section 46 of the Act, he will see that certain other conditions have to be complied with.  If the Deputy will look at that section I think he will realise what is meant by &ldquo;a building lease.&rdquo;</P>

    <P>This amendment covers a point raised in this House, in the first instance, but with which I felt I could not deal at the time, because it was raised at a rather late stage of the discussion.  The point made was that it was a bad principle to have the whole board going out of office at the end of five years.  This amendment provides for rotation.  The Bóard will consist of nine members, of whom three will go out each year.</P>

    <P>Debate resumed on the following motion:&mdash;</P>
    <P>So as to give effect without further delay to the undertakings in Article 45 of the Constitution that the State shall direct its policy towards securing that the citizens may, through their occupations, find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs, Dáil Eireann <Col N="639" /> requests the Government immediately to formulate proposals for absorbing into useful employment at adequate remuneration all adult citizens able and willing to follow useful occupations.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>When this motion was under consideration on the last occasion, we were treated to a very interesting statement by the late Parliamentary Secretary, Deputy Hugo Flinn, and I think the House listened to his opening statement with very great interest.  Every member of the House must feel a deep regret that he was not spared to develop the points which he appeared from his opening remarks to intend to raise.  This motion raises the biggest possible issues which could be raised in this House.  It deals with the duty of the State to direct its policy to securing that citizens may, through their occupations, find a means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs, and suggests that Dáil Eireann should request the Government immediately to formulate proposals for absorbing into employment at adequate remuneration all adult citizens able and willing to follow useful occupations.  If it were possible to give effect to the terms of this motion, it would mean that most, if not all, of the troubles under which this country has laboured since the establishment of the State, and in fact, long before the establishment of the State, would be eliminated.</P>
      <P>Deputy Dillon, in the course of his remarks, said that he did not know how the problem of providing permanent employment for the adult population of this State could be solved. Deputy Dillon, of course, has always been, and I suppose will always remain, a loyal adherent to the doctrine of free trade, to the Manchester School of Economics which claims that problems of this kind should be left to chance, and that, according as international circumstances raise or lower the volume of trade, so must large sections of the population of this and of other countries be thrown out of employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not think for one moment that <Col N="640" /> the people of this country are prepared to go back to the easy-going, haphazard conditions which prevailed prior to the present emergency.  I think that public opinion is now thoroughly aroused to the need for so planning our entire economic system as to ensure that the resources of the country will be developed to their fullest extent and that the entire population will be permanently employed.</P>
    <P>During the past 20 years, we have had a condition of affairs in which there was permanently a volume of unemployment amounting, in round figures, to 100,000 adult citizens.  In addition, we had a very large volume of emigration to other countries. During the first ten or 15 years of the life of this State, emigration was largely to the United States, but during the past five or six years, that emigration has been largely to Great Britain.  To whatever country our people are going, they are certainly leaving this country, and the people who are leaving are people who would be most valuable to the nation, inasmuch as, to a very large extent, they are young men and women of high character and qualifications, both physically and mentally.  The question which this motion raises for serious consideration is, how we are to prevent in the future this emigration of our people; how we are to prevent the high volume of permanent unemployment; how we are to prevent the rapid decay and decline of our population through a falling marriage rate and a late marriage rate and the other evils from which this country has suffered during the past 20 years.</P>
    <P>I believe there is no real solution of this problem except through the intensive and extensive development of agriculture.  If we look at a graph of statistics for the past 20 years showing the agricultural price index over these years we see a line that resembles a deep valley.  We see a level of prices prevailing at the time this State was established which rapidly sinks until it reaches a level far below what prevailed prior to the last world war; and a level of prices which has, during the <Col N="641" /> past few years, began to rise steeply. We have to ask ourselves, are we going in future to allow a similar state of affairs to develop?  Are we going to compel the agricultural industry to face a rapid and steady decline such as it has had to face in the past 20 years?  Are we going to allow the standard of wages in agriculture and the standard of income in that industry to sink down to what it was, say, in 1934 or 1935, when it reached its lowest level?</P>
    <P>To-day, the agricultural labourer commands a wage of 36/- per week. That wage may appear to be low, but compared with what prevailed in 1934 or 1935, it represents a substantial increase in the standard of income.  Does anybody contemplate that we should force the agricultural labourer back to the wages which prevailed in 1934 or 1935?  Does anyone seriously contemplate that we should force down the standard of the rural population generally, which at any time was lower than the fixed standard of agricultural wages?  By that I mean that the incomes of the farmers' sons, daughters, and other adult dependents on the farm was at all times lower than the fixed agricultural wages.  If we allow that state of affairs to continue, then we are not seriously endeavouring to put into effect the terms of this motion, because, as I have said, it is only through an extension of employment on the land that we can hope to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>Agriculture is the biggest industry. It is the industry in which the largest section of our people are engaged.  It is the only industry which can, by development, solve effectively the problem of unemployment.  One simple way of looking at the problem is this. Suppose every farmer was in a position to employ one additional agricultural labourer, it would mean the employment of over 300,000 workers, and that would more than solve the entire problem.  Farmers have always been prepared to undertake their full obligations to the rest of the community. They have loyally and willingly accepted the Orders compelling them to till a certain percentage of their land.  They have loyally accepted the <Col N="642" /> Orders compelling them to pay a fixed minimum wage.  The farming community are prepared to provide employment to such an extent as would solve the entire unemployment problem, provided the community would give the farmers an effective guarantee that, over a prolonged period, agricultural prices and agricultural income would remain stable.  There is no insurmountable obstacle to the community or the State or the Government giving that guarantee to the farming community.</P>
    <P>If the State here and now on behalf of the community were to assure the 300,000 farmers of this country that, for the next ten years, agricultural prices would remain stable and that, no matter what economic conditions prevailed outside this country, the farmers would be sure of such an income as would enable them to produce their various agricultural products at a reasonable profit and pay a reasonable wage, the farmers in return would have no hesitation in undertaking to provide a fixed minimum amount of employment on their holdings.</P>
    <P>That is really the only permanent solution of the unemployment problem. It is not beyond the power of the State to give that undertaking, provided that all parties in the State are prepared to co-operate.  But, as long as we have people like Deputy Dillon clinging to obsolete ideas in regard to economics, clinging to the idea that we should have in this country free importations from all parts of the world, and that imports and exports should be governed entirely by chance, or by the operations of what is known as the natural economic laws, the problem cannot be solved.  But if all sections of the community and if all Parties in this House are prepared to co-operate in putting into operation a planned economy, in which the agricultural producer will be guaranteed not only a market for his produce but an economic price, I am certain that the degree to which employment in rural Ireland can be extended is almost unlimited and is certainly sufficient to solve the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I ask the Taoiseach, therefore, to face this problem along those lines.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="643" /> The Taoiseach may say: &ldquo;I cannot&mdash; no Government can&mdash;guarantee agricultural prices over a prolonged period; no Government can guarantee markets for agricultural produce over a prolonged period because there is, of course, a certain exportable surplus.&rdquo; I believe that the question of the exportable surplus of our agricultural produce will have to be faced up to and that, in so far as it is necessary for this country to export goods, the farmer who produces goods for export, in the interests of the community, is as much entitled to an economic price for his goods as the farmer who produces for the home market and, if it is necessary, to supplement the external price by a direct subsidy from the State, then that consideration should not debar the Government from taking action.</P>
    <P>The problem can be faced only along those lines because there is no source of employment, no source of development in this country sufficiently extensive to provide employment for our entire population but the land.  The problem will be solved if we can get to the stage when our people will regard the land as the most valuable asset, when our young people, even in the towns, will try to get out to the land, in contrast to the present position, when the young people in the country try to get into the cities.  Until we reach the stage when skilled work on the land becomes the most remunerative occupation in the country, there will be no real solution of the unemployment problem and there will be no real economic development.</P>
    <P>From our workers' point of view, and particularly from the point of view of the organised workers in the towns, it is highly undesirable that there should be in this country a huge reservoir of unemployed people and a huge volume of people employed at such a low standard of wage that they are seeking to complete in practically every other branch of labour in the industrial and commercial life of the country.  Along the lines which I have suggested, a guaranteed income for the man who really works upon the <Col N="644" /> land is even more important than the reforms suggested in the Beveridge Report which guarantee a minimum of income for all persons, whether they work or not.  A guarantee of income to all citizens of this country, whether they work or not, will not be effective unless there is a volume of productive work being carried on and the only way to get productive work carried on intensively and extensively is to pay the productive worker better than any other type of worker in the country.</P>

      <P>The issues involved in the motion now before the House have been under discussion on innumerable occasions since I came into this House nearly 20 years ago.  They have been discussed from every angle during the lifetime of the present Government and of the previous Government, but it appears that, even under the limited freedom which we had under the régime of the Cosgrave Government, the position was nothing better than it is to-day.  I have been looking through some of the debates in this House on previous occasions, particularly the debate that took place shortly after the present Government came into office, in 1932.  I am sure the Taoiseach will forgive me if I repeat, for my own purposes, some of the very significant and acceptable statements that he made shortly after his Government came into office.  We had the famous statement made in this House by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Cosgrave Government, in a debate of this kind, that it was not the duty of the Government to provide work for the unemployed.  That statement was discussed, not only in the House, but on platforms throughout the country.  After the present Government came into office, in 1932, we had a discussion, based on a motion similar to the one now before the House, in which the Taoiseach made very clear what his position was in regard to the duty of the State towards the unemployed.  He said&mdash;column 913, Official Debates, Volume 41&mdash;on 29th April, 1932:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;It is the duty of the State to provide work.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="645" /> That is quite the opposite kind of statement to that made by Deputy McGilligan when he was Minister for Industry and Commerce in the Cosgrave Government.  The Taoiseach, going into a great deal of detail which I do not want to repeat in this discussion, subsequently made some very interesting statements and admissions which are worthy of repetition either here or outside the House.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I never regarded freedom as an end in itself, but if I were asked what statement of Irish policy was most in accord with my view as to what human beings should struggle for, I would stand side by side with James Connolly.  The thing that was most heartbreaking in this Dáil since I came into it was to find the two Parties, who should have stood side by side trying to secure the freedom in order that they might have power to order their own policy, divided.  I am speaking of the Fianna Fáil Party and the Labour Party.  These two Parties had, naturally, the same programme, and when I differed with the Labour Party after the Treaty it was because I thought that that Party was making a mistake and that they did not see what James Connolly saw, and what he told me he saw, that to secure national freedom was the first step in order to get the workers of Ireland the living that they were entitled to in their own country, because,</P>
    <P>&mdash;The Taoiseach was apparently quoting words used by the late James Connolly&mdash;</P>
    <P>&lsquo;As long as a foreign Imperial Power holds this country the workers are the people who will be principally exploited.&rdquo;&rsquo;</P>
    <P>He then went on:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We wanted our freedom in order to put an end to that.  When I was speaking to the people I was not so foolish as to believe or to ask the people to believe that we could suddenly, when I came to occupy the seat that was occupied by Deputy Cosgrave, change overnight a situation brought about in the course of centuries of foreign misrule and ten <Col N="646" /> years of the serious misrule of those who occupy the benches opposite.  I did not think anything of the kind, and I told the people of Ireland, before the election, that if there was to be any real change in the situation it should be envisaged as a whole, and gone about in an ordered manner, that haphazard methods would not do, that it would not do to have a patch here and a patch there, but that if you wanted to build you should do so on a sound foundation and build as a whole. Since we came into office that is what we have been trying to do.  We have been trying to get the facts. How many people are unemployed? No one knows.  We have figures and we know they are wrong.  I had a map made indicating the various parts of the country where there was unemployment, and when I asked questions about the figures on which the map was based I was told that they were taken from the employment exchanges or something like that, that could not be depended upon.  I asked local people who know the facts, and I was told that the figures did not represent the situation. We have to find out exactly what the situation is as a first step.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is fair enough, but at any rate the head of the Government committed himself in that statement to a definite line of policy.  He indicated quite definitely 11 years ago that, as soon as the figures and facts had been verified, a definite line of policy would be adopted for the purpose of providing work for the unemployed.  The figures of the unemployed at that period were about the same as the figures now registered at the local exchanges, strange to say, although the Taoiseach and everybody else acquainted with the facts know perfectly well that between 30,000 and 40,000 persons have joined the national defence forces and over 100,000 persons have left this State to get employment in the Six Counties or in Great Britain.  Supposing the people who were out of work at the beginning of the emergency had no means of finding some type of employment, either outside the State or in the national defence forces, I <Col N="647" /> think it will be agreed that the situation here would now be extremely serious.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>I say that, if those people had not found employment elsewhere, we would have a very serious situation to face.  It is fortunate for us that during the past couple of years we had certain avenues such as the defence forces and employment outside the country to absorb our people who would be otherwise unemployed.  The next discussion on the subject of finding work for the unemployed took place in 1940.  I want to draw the Taoiseach's attention particularly to this discussion and to the decision taken by the House.  A motion similar in its terms to the one now being discussed was tabled by the members of this Party on the 12th December, 1940.  After it was fully discussed an amendment, moved by the then Minister for Industry and Commerce, who is now Minister for Local Government, was carried by 54 votes to 32.  The amendment was in the following terms:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;Being of opinion that a commission should be appointed to inquire into and report upon the extent, cause, incidence, general <Col N="648" /> character and other aspects of unemployment, and to make proposals in relation thereto.  Dáil Eireann requests the Government to appoint such a commission.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>On the 29th April, 1932, it is quite evident from the language used by the Taoiseach that an immediate attempt was going to be made by the Ministers concerned, with the assistance of the different departments over which they had control, to find out the facts in relation to the unemployment position.  What was the result of the lengthy consideration which was given to the subject from 1932 until the facts were finally revealed? It is evident when the amendment I referred to was carried in the House in December, 1940, that no accurate version of the unemployment position&mdash;the cause, the incidence, the general character and other aspects of unemployment&mdash;was in the possession of the Government, because, if they had the information in 1940, it would have been ridiculous for the Minister for Industry and Commerce and his colleagues to vote for the amendment.</P>
    <P>I want the Taoiseach to tell us what transpired subsequent to that amendment being carried.  What was the result of the inquiry, if any, which was held into the matter?  I agree that whatever blame may be attached to the Government for not carrying out their promise previous to the emergency, certainly the situation was seriously altered on the outbreak of the war.  I am not going to blame the Government for everything that has happened, including their failure to deal with unemployment since the outbreak of the war, but the country is entitled to know what action was taken by the Government following the adoption of the amendment I have referred to.</P>
    <P>We had another famous statement in the House by the Taoiseach to the effect that if he could not solve the unemployment problem within the existing system, he was prepared to go outside that system in order to find a solution.  Does he believe he has given a fair trial to the present system in order to solve the unemployment <Col N="649" /> problem?  How much longer will he wait before he goes outside the existing system in order to solve the problem?</P>
    <P>During the long and very interesting discussion that took place here on the Central Bank Bill, it was repeatedly stated by the Minister for Finance that there was plenty of money available for every creditworthy scheme and every creditworthy person.  I do not accept that statement, and I need not go outside my own constituency for evidence to prove that.  If there is plenty of money available, why is it&mdash;and this is only a small thing&mdash;that we have such a large number of bog roads in my constituency and in the turf-cutting counties generally, in such a rotten state of repair&mdash;so bad that the people are unable this year to get out the turf that was cut last year?</P>
    <P>The statement that was made by the Minister for Finance on that matter during the discussions on the Central Bank Bill was subsequently contradicted by his Parliamentary Secretary, the late Deputy Hugo Flinn.  I raised the question in the House as to why, in the existing emergency conditions, in view of the fact that there was a shortage of fuel and that it was necessary to get everything possible done to provide all the fuel required in the country, more money could not be made available for the repair of bog roads, as it was impossible to get turf from the bogs.  It is still lying on the bogs in large quantities at the present time in my own area.  The answer given by the Parliamentary Secretary on every occasion was that there was only a limited amount of money available to be put into the pool for purposes of this kind.</P>
    <P>We have conflicting statements&mdash;one by the Minister for Finance that there is sufficient money available for every credit-worthy scheme and the other by the Parliamentary Secretary that there is only a limited amount of money to be put into the pool.  Which answer is correct?  I suspect that the statement made by the late Parliamentary Secretary is the correct one.  If there were a limited amount of money available <Col N="650" /> for purposes of this kind, surely there is no more urgent work to be done than the repairing of bog roads, in order to get out the fuel that is lying on the bogs, and which has been lying there in the turf-cutting counties during the past year or two?  I suggest that the shortage of money is the principal cause of the failure of this Government and the previous Government to find a solution for our unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach spoke here on motions of this kind on previous occasions, and gave the House his view of the reasons why more money could not be spent on forestry schemes, land reclamation and national drainage. It is all a question, as far as I can see, of too much red tape being bound around the files in the different Departments.  That is the cause of the hold-up of such schemes as land reclamation, afforestation and peat development.  That is the cause of the failure to put more people to work on those schemes.  I mentioned in the House on previous occasions the type of schemes that might be embarked upon for the purpose of providing employment in the rural areas as well as in towns and villages.</P>
    <P>Several statements have been made by Ministers during the past few months in connection with the postwar planning policy of the present Government.  A statement was made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Supplies some time ago, in which he challenged the accuracy of a statement made on some platform in the country by Deputy Norton, to the effect that certain suggestions had been put to the Cabinet in the early period of the present emergency in connection with plans for the solution of our unemployment problem.  I assert quite definitely in this House&mdash;and this is the place to make the assertion&mdash;and I think I shall be able to produce confidential minutes of the conversation that took place, that on a certain date in September, 1939, a deputation representing the Labour Party and the trade union movement waited upon the Taoiseach in connection with the question of schemes that might be taken in hand during the emergency period. <Col N="651" /> The Taoiseach will remember that he made arrangements for that deputation to be introduced by the Minister for Supplies and Industry and Commerce. I can quote here from a document the items that were discussed on that particular occasion.</P>
    <P>I repeat that quite definitely, and I assert that suggestions were made at the time for the purchase of ships in order to get raw materials from other countries to maintain in employment a large number of those who had been put into industrial employment through the operation of the Government's policy between 1932 and the outbreak of the present war.  The Minister denied that any such proposals ever were submitted, but there is available a confidential minute of the matters discussed on that particular occasion, as well as a fairly detailed survey of the proposals put to the Minister.  I do not mention this matter for the purpose of playing politics across the floor of the House, but in order to assert here&mdash;where I am entitled to make the statement&mdash;that we did make suggestions at different periods, in regard to proposals that might be carried out and which, carried out, would have maintained in employment a number of people who have been thrown out of employment since the emergency began.  Those proposals provided for additional employment on land reclamation, peat development, afforestation, road repairs, and so on.</P>

However, we are entitled to know now, after a period of 11 years, what real effort was made. What investigations were undertaken, what figures and facts were discovered, which prevented the Government from carrying out the promises which the Taoiseach made here definitely in 1932?

      <P>I think he will find that he had a preliminary discussion with the deputation in the first few days of September, 1939.  He made an appointment, I understand, for the deputation to be interviewed by the Minister, and details should be available in the Department concerned as to the items that were discussed and the proposals put forward.  I am making this statement in this House, because it is a fact that, although we have been accused on many occasions of criticising without putting forward any constructive proposals, on that particular occasion&mdash; and critical occasion it was&mdash;we did put forward suggestions.  If the Taoiseach speaks in this debate, I would like to hear from him the reasons why every one of those proposals was turned down, and also why the Government failed to put into operation any other or better schemes that would absorb the unemployed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I listened on many occasions to discussions where schemes were put forward for the provision of work for the unemployed in my own part of the country.  I wonder if any proposal ever reached the Taoiseach or the Minister responsible, showing how many people could be provided with employment if the main trunk roads of this country were widened and improved. I am not sure to what extent material can be found now to carry out extensive schemes of road reconstruction. I understand it is not possible to get some of the material that was available in large quantities before the emergency.  However, you do not need any tar or imported materials in order to widen the main and trunk roads of many counties and to standardise them.  There are different types of repair and maintenance in different counties: anyone driving around the country would <Col N="653" /> notice that.  I am assured by county surveyors and other people who know more about this than I do that, if the roads were widened and repair were undertaken on some national standard basis, there would be a considerable amount of employment over a long period for a large number of people. I have been assured recently, when asking questions as to why certain works were not carried out in my own area, that certain materials, which it was necessary to import, cannot be got now, and that some of the jobs must be deferred to a later date.</P>
    <P>I am relating the position stated by the Taoiseach in this House on the 29th November, 1932, to the position of the Government when it passed this motion in the House on the 12th December, 1940.  I would be very glad to hear from the Taoiseach the reasons why no real attempt has been made to find a solution for this pressing problem, which is bound to grow considerably worse as the war goes on.  Everybody seems to think that the position is not going to improve immediately this war ends, whenever it will end, but if we cannot find a solution for the minor problems which confront us to-day, I do not know what is going to be the position when the war ends, and when this emergency no longer exists.</P>

      <P>Well, the Deputy can take part in this debate afterwards, and he can put forward any suggestions that he wishes to put forward.  I am sure that he has had many opportunities of putting forward suggestions in other quarters.  The members of this Party, however, are not putting this motion forward for the purposes of Party, political play-acting.  We are putting it forward only for the purpose <Col N="654" /> of finding out from the head of the Government, at this period, which we regard as a very serious and very critical period, what proposals the Government have in mind to meet the position as we see it to-day.  Of course, if I wanted to repeat many of the things that were said by other speakers from these benches, such as Deputy Murphy and Deputy Keyes, I could go on for a long time, but there is no use in repeating what they have already said, and all I wish to say is that we would be deeply interested in hearing from the head of the Government what investigations have taken place with regard to this matter, and what steps the Government are taking to deal with the situation as we now know it, or whether the problem of unemployment can be solved within the existing system or not.  If it cannot be solved within the existing system, what steps does the head of the Government propose to take to deal with that problem?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>This question of unemployment and the promise of the Government to solve it at various stages is a very old red-herring, but it is a problem which requires immediate attention.  It is one on which I always agreed with the present head of the Government, when he said that it was capable of solution.  Now, it is often said: &ldquo;Oh, we could solve that problem and others if we only had the money,&rdquo; but when I see nations, all over the world, who are able to procure or create money for the production of weapons of destruction and death, and who seem to be able to get unlimited amounts of money to produce those weapons, it seems to me to be an extraordinary thing that it should not be possible to get money to produce assets that would be of real benefit to our country.  In my opinion, there is no reason why the things that are ready to our hands should not be undertaken.  It seems to me that there should be no reason why a Government should not be able to provide money for such undertakings at any time, and, particularly, at the present time, when so much is needed by our people.  Take, for instance, forestry. There is no doubt that if that matter were properly undertaken, and if sufficient <Col N="655" /> money were made available, it would give immediate employment to, and keep in continuous employment, a fairly considerable number of men&mdash; apart from the fact that these forests, when grown, would be a very valuable source of material for wood pulp and other things which we require very badly at the moment.  I hold that wealth, thus created, would be an asset to our country.  It would be far better to spend money on such things than to spend it on things that are blown to smoke in a moment or go down to the bottom of the sea.  I think that the Government should undertake such developments at the earliest possible moment.  For instance, we have such problems as drainage, sewerage, bog development, and so on. Money spent on each and every one of these projects would create an asset. It would be money well spent.  I am not a financial expert&mdash;I only know that, if I issue a cheque, and there is no money in the bank to meet it, the bank manager will tell me all about it &mdash;but I am reliably informed that, so long as solid assets are being produced, it is always possible to get money for such purposes, and that it is good business to do so.  Therefore, I hold that the establishment of plantations on our waste lands would do much to relieve the unemployment problem.  Not alone would it create employment, but it would also create valuable assets for our country which, if not immediately available, would be available at some future date.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In that connection, I think it would be no harm to draw the attention of the Government to the fact that in the United States millions of people were put into employment as a result of national schemes of development, and the justification for the creation of the money for such purposes was the fact that assets were being created in that country as a result of these schemes. The same thing applies here with regard to drainage.  I think it is a fact which cannot be denied that much of our land is waste because of the lack of drainage.  For a great number of years, many rivers have been left in their natural state&mdash;being allowed <Col N="656" /> to fill in and silt up&mdash;and no matter what the local farmers may do, so long as the main artery is not able to take away the waste, all the work that is done in connection with drainage is of no use to the farmers concerned. Therefore the work done throughout the country under the farm improvement grants is to a great extent nullified.</P>
    <P>In regard to housing, the Government has no doubt done well and I have always paid tribute to the work done by the Government in respect of the reconstruction of houses.  That work has vastly improved a great number of houses, but I contend that these houses are not nearly good enough.  If war came and they were all levelled, we would be able to build them again. There would be money available, astonishingly enough, but it is only when some catastrophe comes that we can rebuild.  When other nations have advanced so far in respect of housing and sanitation, I hold that we should be as far advanced as the best of them, and that when the Land Commission or local authorities are building houses, they should not build them on the lines of houses built 100 years ago, without sanitary accommodation, water supplies or opportunities for the people to have baths.  The houses which have been rebuilt in the country are as obsolete as an old battleship with sails.  Much employment could be given in this direction.  We have any amount of native timber which could be utilised in the building of these houses, and there is no reason why a much greater drive should not be made to give the people proper housing conditions.  It would be at least a partial inducement to people to remain in the country and on the land.</P>
    <P>The country at the moment is in a very depressed state.  When farmers and their sons have to work, and to do this, that and the other things, and then come home after their day's work to houses in which there are no candles, no paraffin and no lights, it is no wonder that the wish and will of the young people is to run to the cities where city amenities are available. <Col N="657" /> Money spent in this direction would be well spent, and I hold that the Government would not be unorthodox in their financial tactics if they borrowed, and borrowed extensively, for housing, to improve housing conditions and the type of houses built.  I saw the Land Commission building houses and when I suggested to them that they should build houses a little better than the houses which the people were leaving, the reply was made by an architect that that was the type of house the people had been accustomed to.  I think that was a bad philosophy and a bad outlook.  There is no reason why, if a person was reared in a house with a room and kitchen, that should be the type of house he should always have and that he should get no better. I do not want to elaborate that point, but I could give a description of the position in that respect.  The supplying of water and the improvement of wells would all take money, but, as I say, its expenditure would be creating assets and would do much to keep our young people in the country and prevent them from going to England and to the cities here.</P>
    <P>Bog development is now very essential, and it is an astonishing fact that, to my knowledge, in respect of 30 to 50 relief schemes sent in from County Longford because there were not people in receipt of unemployment assistance in the district, the engineer was not allowed to employ people like farmers' sons who were unemployed.</P>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If they are producing food on the farms, is it not better for them to be employed at that work?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>In places like Longford and the west of Ireland, the amount of food which you can produce from November to March is what?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>He need not be idle on the farm from November to March.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>I know he need not.  I have two workmen whom I pay and keep during the whole winter, so that I will have them in the spring.  The Taoiseach knows thoroughly well that for two or three of a farmer's sons, there is not <Col N="658" /> enough work, but you expect the farmer's son to work on the farm for nothing to produce the food required. If that farmer's son, even if he is the son of a farmer of £30 valuation, could work for a month or three weeks on a minor relief scheme and earn a few pounds for his pocket, it is an inducement to him to stay at home, but when he sees everybody else able to get money by going away to England, while he is left without a halfpenny, his inclination is to go and nothing you can do will stop him, unless you provide him with something at home from which he can get ready money.</P>
      <P>Everybody knows that farmers in a number of cases are very hard and close-fisted with their families.  It is not easy for them to provide money to enable their sons to go to dances, and if they do not give it to them, they will pack their bags and go.  I hold that if they were allowed to get employment on these schemes, you would get the work done and you would be creating an asset, so that the money would be well spent. That is why it is so difficult to get the exact number of unemployed in any district.  I agree with Labour that the register does not give a true picture of the number of unemployed in a district, because there are these farmers' sons who are not on the register and who, for the months of November and December, are idle. They may not be completely idle, but they are available for work that would help in keeping them in the country.</P>
      <P>Then, there is the very important point with regard to local electrification. The Taoiseach knows Switzerland very well and he knows the huge number of local electricity schemes in that country.  Switzerland of course lends itself to that type of development inasmuch as there is perpetual snow in the mountains which feeds mountain streams all the time.  We have peat and any amount of water supplies in this country in connection with which small electricity schemes which would give power and light in the rural districts and brighten the home life of the people, could be put up.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="659" /> Bog roads are also very important. It is almost impossible to get valuable bogs developed because of the lack of roads.  I have sent in scores of proposals for the making of roads through bogs and quite a common reply is that the quota of minor relief for that particular district has already been given and that there are not enough unemployed on the register to warrant the carrying out of the work, no matter how important or valuable it is.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>It is the stock reply.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GenSeanMacEoin" hpid="General MacEoin General MacEoin">
      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, and it shows that there is not that wisdom or vision in respect of such work that should exist.  I assert that unemployment would be much lessened by the development of such schemes.  In connection with the land improvement schemes, I think the Government should consider giving to farmers who take on an unemployed man the amount of unemployment assistance which that man is being paid by way of a grant-in-aid for paying the standard rate of wages.  The number of people engaged each year on a farm can be ascertained, and if a farmer takes on a man from the labour exchange, the unemployment assistance which was being paid to that man when he was unemployed should be paid to the farmer as a kind of grant-in-aid towards paying the wages which are fixed.  That would do much to relieve unemployment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There are a number of people who are able and willing to work at certain jobs, but who are not much good for anything else.  I think it is a very great hardship to expect people like that to do work for which they are unfitted.  For instance, asking an unemployed tailor to cut turf is a bit of a joke.  It is not reasonable either to ask an unemployed carpenter to break stones, though he might be able to do it.  If an unemployed person refuses to work at a job for which he is unsuited, he is immediately cut off from unemployment assistance and his family are left starving.  I have known several cases of that kind.  A reasonable <Col N="660" /> discretion should be allowed to the managers of labour exchanges in regard to that.  Then again, if a man is ordered to take up employment six or seven miles away from his home and he has no bicycle or other means of conveyance, it is a very great hardship that he should be struck off the unemployment assistance, perhaps for five or six weeks, until he shows that he could not get to the work.  He may then get back the unemployment assistance but, in the meantime, the man has nothing to live on.</P>
    <P>With any sort of determination and organisation, I believe it is possible to solve the unemployment problem.  The excuse put up by this Government, and every other Government that I know of, until some emergency arises, is that it is due to lack of money. There is no reason why the money should not be made available so long as those who are unemployed are creating assets that will be valuable to the nation.  Therefore, I am in sympathy with this motion.  I suggest that the Government should prepare elaborate plans for the solving of the unemployment problem and put them into effect.  A few months ago the Taoiseach said that we have been talking about unemployment for the last ten or 15 years.  But talking about it is very little good.  One ounce of effort, one ounce of solid work towards the solution of the problem, is better than all the talk.  Therefore, I support this motion.</P>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>I have great sympathy with this motion put down by the Labour Party.  For the past 20 years in this House we have been listening to promises in connection with the solving of the unemployment problem, particularly by the present Government. We are as near to solving it to-day as we were 20 years ago.  We have only really touched the fringe of the problem.  The late Mr. Hugo Flinn was anxious to do what was possible in the matter, but he also only touched the fringe of the problem.  In connection with forestry, some years ago we were told that the Forestry Department would not take over anything less than 300 acres of land for planting in one particular place.  However, <Col N="661" /> on an Estimate for Forestry at a later date we were told that they were prepared to take over plots of 50 acres. I should like to know if that has been put into operation, because, if that were put into operation, it would certainly relieve unemployment to a great extent.  There are very few 300-acre plots available for planting.</P>
      <P>Since this State was established we have been talking about developing our own industries.  I do not see that we have done a great deal to develop them.  We certainly tried to develop industries when raw material had to be imported from another country and then tried to export the manufactured articles back to that country.  But, even when building was going on, we were not able to develop our slate quarries, of which we have seven or eight in the country.  Building was held up month after month for want of Irish slates.  It may be late in the day to talk about this now, but something should be done about it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Surely there is no hold-up in housing through want of roofing material, such as slates?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Brodrick Mr. Brodrick">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Brodrick</NameTxt>
      <P>Probably not at present, but I am talking about the past when we could have developed a very good industry.  Take another industry&mdash;the woollen industry.  In County Galway we have produced about one-sixth of the sheep in the whole country and at the same time we do not seem to be getting anywhere. Whether it is that the wool is rough and cannot be used in this country, or not, I do not know.  Last year, we tried to get a fixed price for it but did not succeed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is another point I would like to mention, with regard to roads.  I am not so much interested in trunk roads because there is very little motor traffic at the present time, but there are district roads which are not receiving proper attention, that is, roads leading into small villages.  If they were improved it would give a good deal of employment.  Galway and Mayo are expected to grow 13,000 acres of beet in 1943.  I know several places where there are hundreds of acres of land but, on account of the condition of the <Col N="662" /> roads, the farmers cannot bring a donkey cart into them.  They are expected to sow beet and potatoes and to do the extra tillage.  Tillage inspectors tell them they must do a certain amount.  I have tried to travel some of these by-roads into villages and I found it impossible.  As Deputy MacEoin has stated, the trouble is&mdash;it has existed for years&mdash;that if there is not a certain number of registered unemployed in the particular district, no work can be done.  If they are cute enough in a district to have 12 or 14 registered as unemployed, the work can be done in that district.  I think that Order should be abolished.</P>
    <P>In connection with turbary, I suggested some years ago that the Land Commission should maintain the roads and, when the roads are improved, if it is a bog that is being opened up, they could set the bogs to the people in the district who have no turbary. People will not buy turbary where there is no way into the bog.  If the Land Commission were to open up the bogs and set it in perches or roods, or whatever way they liked, to the people in the district, I firmly believe that the cost of making the road would be repaid by the receipts for the turbary. It would also give a good deal of employment in the lean part of the year, the winter time, when the farmers' sons have not very much to do.</P>
    <P>Again, even where the local authorities are working bogs, I do not see that it will be of much use, if roads are not made that will take a horse and cart.  As regards land reclamation, I find, although we are lowly valued in the west of Ireland, that the valuation is fixed too high.  Anyone having a valuation of £25 or over will not get the benefit.  Very often farmers with that valuation may be very poor. They may have rough land, which, if it was reclaimed, could benefit the community.  I think the whole matter should be considered.</P>
    <P>As regards drainage, I would say we are starting at the wrong end.  In order to make drains effective, in my opinion, you should start at the outlet. I know several rivers.  I know the Corrib in Galway.  The Corrib drains right into the borders of Mayo.  What <Col N="663" /> is really wrong there is that the Corrib is too high for the rest of the land. There are some rights&mdash;some navigation rights&mdash;on the Corrib but I do not think they are worth much.  If it is a question of compensation, it is pretended that they are important but I do not think they are.  There is no use draining a bog out to a river unless you have the outlet fixed first.  It is throwing money away to do five or ten miles in the centre of the river, leaving the outlet too high.  That only results in flooding out people's land.  We are doing the same thing with the bogs. We are draining them into rivers and flooding people's land.  I would like to know what is the report of the Drainage Commission and what has been done about it.</P>

      <P>I do not know in this debate how I can disentangle the thousand and one things that have been woven and interwoven in and out in it.  The first thing in trying to get some line of approach is to distinguish carefully between the present circumstances and what I may call normal conditions.  I do not know to which of these conditions the Labour Party and some of the others who have been speaking have been addressing themselves because, at one moment they were speaking as though they were thinking of what you may call normal conditions, and at others they were talking as if they were discussing the present exceptional circumstances.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>There is no doubt that we are going to have a very serious situation when this war emergency is over, and it is our business, in so far as it is possible to see, in advance into that situation and to make plans in advance to <Col N="665" /> deal with it.  That is being done to the extent to which it is possible to do it whilst the other work is being attended to, but we have the serious situation at present to attend to.  It might have been a great deal worse. I have some minutes here of deputations, and it is very difficult for me to identify the exact deputation which Deputy Davin refers to, but I remember that at that time, at the very outbreak of the war, there was some suggestion of seeing a deputation.  I have a note of seeing a deputation and of some questions being asked.  It seems to me it was a question of asking questions about the situation rather than anything else.  At that time, looking forward and realising the dangers that this country was likely to be threatened with, I was prepared to find even a much worse situation than the situation we have had to face so far.  But we are not out of the wood yet, and we may have to experience some of the dangers that I anticipated at that particular time.</P>
    <P>I cannot attempt to deal with all the points that have been raised and, in the circumstances, I shall have to confine myself to one or two.  I am going to assume that the main purport of the motion was not to deal with the immediate circumstances, although its terms would seem to suggest that. The suggestion would seem to be that we should have produced, as it were, out of a hat, some plan by which everybody would be put into full employment, doing useful work at fair remuneration. If it were possible for us to do that, we would be such supermen that our services would be in demand, not merely in this country, but all over the world.  If we were such people as that we could, in a modern, complicated community, produce a plan by which all the unemployed would be put into useful work and given ample wages, then I certainly think we would be the types of magicians that would be very much in request.  We are not such men, and we never pretended to be.  It was suggested by Deputy Norton that at one time I indicated that by a wave of the hand, as it were, we could do these things.  There is no record to show that I ever indicated that.</P>

      <P>Is there anything such as the Deputy suggested in my speech, portion of which was quoted by Deputy Davin?  It is clear from that speech that what I said was that we, because of our undeveloped resources, had opportunities for dealing with unemployment such as were not afforded to developed countries like Britain and America, where they had big unemployment problems to face. That is a very different proposition.  I went further at that time and had calculations made of the numbers that could be employed in producing boots, apparel and other things which we were paying other people to produce for us.  I went into calculations based on the rate of production which was at that time obtaining in Great Britain in several industries, and I made a comparison with the rate of production which I thought was possible here.  Of course, their industries were much better established, they had larger units, and they were able to get a higher rate of production per person employed than we could hope for in our newly-established industries and with less skilled operatives.  We got a calculation that about 80,000 could be employed here.</P>

      <P>I doubt very much if I had.  If the Deputy's figure is correct, there must have been some other reason why I gave it.  At that time I went through the list of imports and I showed that it was possible to give employment, by producing things that were not previously produced in this country, to about 80,000 people. <Col N="667" /> The remarkable thing is that there were few estimates that have been so well justified in the actual event, because, if you look at the figures, you will find that that is roughly the number put into employment in producing articles here.  I was amazed at how near the estimate was to what has actually happened.</P>

      <P>I did believe, and I still believe, that the best solution for unemployment here, the most permanent type of solution that can be got, is to put our people producing goods for themselves with Irish resources, making use of them to the utmost, instead of getting them from other countries.  I know there is another type of argument against that, the argument which Deputies on the opposite benches used when they were on these benches and when I went round the country speaking to the people about doing these things for themselves.  I have not changed a bit, and I am very glad to find that there are more people in the House to-day of that opinion than there were some ten or 11 years ago.  It is refreshing to find that we have a great deal of unanimity to-day with regard to some of these things.  Although we have taken into employment quite a large <Col N="668" /> number of people, we have not solved the unemployment problem.  We have not pretended to do it.</P>

      <P>What would the position be if we did not make certain changes?  A lot of people have been rendered idle through lack of raw materials.  So long as these materials were there, they were working.  It is quite obvious to me that if we did not have the development of industries which has taken place and the opportunities for useful work which were given in that particular way, our unemployment problem would be very much more serious than it is.  It is better for us to keep to the normal situation.  I do not want to be drawn into the present situation.  There is a normal unemployment problem which existed here just before the war.</P>

      <P>What does the Deputy want me to argue about?  Is it the position before the emergency or the position now?  If it is the position now, I simply cannot do it in the time allowed, and would not consider doing it.  With regard to the future, no one can tell what the position will be.  As the Minister for Supplies said quite recently, there is no doubt that our conditions here will be modified and may be determined largely by the conditions in the world around us.  We are not an isolated people: we are in a world in which the conditions in other countries will affect us.  Therefore, we must try to look ahead and see what is likely to happen and what the general conditions in the world are likely to be after the war.  I do not pretend to be able to tell.  Some of the difficulties which existed before in regard to unemployment are likely to remain.  No one in any country will find a complete solution, and the utmost one can do is to get as near as possible to a good solution.  Where it is not possible to do that, the community must provide resources to maintain the unemployed, always remembering that unemployment is in itself an evil. <Col N="669" /> Everyone who has to be maintained by the efforts of the rest of the community represents a disadvantage. Everyone who can be transferred from that position to the position of doing some good work for the community represents an advantage.  The aim should be, therefore, to get as many people as possible out of the position in which they have to be maintained by the rest of the community.  When we try to get down to bedrock in this matter, we recognise that there are difficulties of various kinds standing in the way.  It is not a question of want of will.  One of the objections I have to the terms of this motion is that there is in it the suggestion that in the Constitution there is something which you can implement immediately, and that it is only a question of having the will to do it.</P>
      <P>In this matter, the Constitution is quite clear and definite&mdash;so clear and definite, indeed, that some people said it was &ldquo;eye-wash&rdquo;.  This point was put in as a &ldquo;directive&rdquo;, as an indication of the sort of policy that should be pursued, and not as something that was the law.  If it were possible to do this, it would have been made the law, but because it was not possible, this could be put in only in the form of a general directive, indicating the aim which should be pursued.  It was left as something which the courts could not take cognisance of.  I am delighted that the Labour Party has at last realised that there is some value in having in the fundamental law of the State a directive of that sort.</P>

      <P>At any rate, this principle of social policy was set down as a headline.  I have noticed that, in another country, they are very anxious to have some principles like this accepted. This country has accepted these principles: there is no question about that.  The Constitution says: &ldquo;The State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing ...&rdquo; In <Col N="671" /> other words, this objective should be kept in mind as being of primary importance. &ldquo;...that the citizens (all of whom, men and women equally, have the right to an adequate means of livelihood) may through their occupations find the means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.&rdquo;  That is the basis of social policy and the aim which we have constantly kept in mind.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>This problem has proved to be one of the most difficult problems which we have had to tackle.  We had&mdash;and still have&mdash;many opportunities for useful employment for our people that the highly industrialised States have not.  I do not think it is likely that we would reach such a highly industrialised position that we would not have those opportunities, as there are certain factors operating against that here.  Otherwise, we would be faced with all the difficulties that other organised States are facing in regard to this unemployment question.  We still have opportunities for further industrial development, and it is very important to employ people in the production of food and clothing, some of which we have been accustomed to get in from outside.  If we have a surplus of these things, we can exchange them for other things what we need: otherwise, there would be no point in producing a surplus.  Until the ordinary needs of our citizens are met, the obvious thing is to put people at employment to produce these particular requirements.  This Government worked on that basis, starting with agriculture.  That was at a time of agricultural depression all over the world&mdash;a thing which is often forgotten. A thing that is often forgotten is that just about the period that we came into office, and for a year or two afterwards&mdash;quite irrespective of certain controversial things that happened at that time, such as the various tariffs which were put on as a result of those happenings&mdash;there was agricultural depression all over the world, and that our country, being an agricultural country, was hit by that depression to a greater extent than other countries were hit by it.  But we said, <Col N="672" /> in effect: &ldquo;Very well, then; if we have difficulty in getting foreign markets for our surplus products, why not create a home market for our own produce? Why bring in from other countries what we can produce for ourselves? So long as we have mills to grind the wheat, why not use them, and why not produce the wheat ourselves?&rdquo; We decided that we would provide a home market for the produce of our own farms; and to the extent that that has been done&mdash;whether by giving a fixed price to the farmer for certain of the produce of his farm, or protecting him against foreign goods coming in here in competition with his produce, or giving him an opportunity of getting into tillage by preventing the importation of foreign bacon and so on, and a number of things of that sort&mdash;the income of the farmer in this country has been increased by several millions of pounds that would otherwise have gone out of the country. That policy gave the farmers an opportunity of doing useful work in providing for the immediate needs of the community, and also it was a protection for the farmer himself.</P>
    <P>Now, the needs of the community that are most appreciated are the fundamental things, such as food, clothing, and housing, and things of that sort.  Of course you may find people who will prefer to lie in bed in the morning and listen to the radio, if they have money enough to have a radio set, but if it were a question of getting food, or boots, or clothes, then I think these people would be up and doing because these are the fundamental things.  Accordingly, the first and fundamental thing in our programme was to try to create a greater market for our farmers and agricultural workers here at home&mdash;to give them an opportunity of giving service and doing useful work for the community as a whole, and getting an adequate reward for themselves.  We did that, and, as I have already said, it resulted in giving several millions of pounds to the people employed in agriculture in this country.</P>
    <P>The next thing we set out to develop was one that had been completely undeveloped before and that was the <Col N="673" /> field of industrial employment.  Again, we started off with the fundamentals, such as clothing, boots and shoes, and so on, and as a result of that development of industrial activity in this country, some tens of thousands of workers were engaged in that particular way, but we have not come to the end of that yet.  We could, and should, develop such fundamental industries so as to give the workers an opportunity of providing for themselves and also producing a surplus by which they could give a return which would enable the rest of the community to get other things from outside, and the more prosperous our agricultural industry is the more we can do that, and by doing that we can usefully employ a greater number of people in agriculture than at present.  Two things are operating there&mdash;both in slightly different directions&mdash;because if you want efficiency, you will need a greater amount of technically qualified people, and that might tend toward less employment, but still I think it is not unfair to say that with a more scientific development of our agricultural production we can employ more people on the land than at present.  It is quite possible also that if we could employ more people in that direction our problem of unemployment would be solved.</P>
    <P>Now, another fundamental thing is the matter of shelter.  Obviously, if you are trying to get employment for people, one of the fundamental things to be considered is the matter of housing.  Are our people housed as they should be housed?  We have undertaken a very large programme of housing, and you have only to go around the city here, or around the country, to see evidence of the results of that programme.  That programme has only been made possible by the community giving considerable subsidies.  Take the labour costs and the costs of materials of these houses, and the rents that had to be charged for these houses.  Some of these rents are beyond what some of these people could ordinarily pay and, therefore, the community had to give subsidies to these people&mdash;and subsidies to a considerable extent&mdash;but the result of that has been the building <Col N="674" /> of a very large number of houses. I do not want to complicate this matter by going into the figures, but, in fact, at one period the suggestion was made that, by the very speed of our programme, we were running up the cost: that we had not enough skill, and that, if we had not proceeded at that particular pace in our housing programme, the costs would not have gone up to such an extent. It was suggested that, as a result of the speed of our programme, the rents would be so high as to make the whole thing a very heavy burden. Well, then, if anybody starts to try to do useful work, I think it will be admitted that the best thing that could be done would be to give people an opportunity to produce food, clothing, and shelter for the citizens of the country&mdash;that these are the best things to which our activities should be directed.</P>
    <P>Passing from that, however, we went on to what might be regarded as our less fundamental needs, but still useful work.  A good deal of employment is given in the mere division of land.  Now, it was a part of our programme to put as many families as possible in economic security on the land.  Our belief was, and remains, that the family which has an economic holding, on which by their efforts they are able to support themselves, are the most independent people upon the earth.  The person on the land who can, by his labour on that land, his own property, provide for his family, is king in his castle.  No more useful work, it seems to me, could be done for the community than to put as many families as possible in that position. We set out to do that.</P>
    <P>At times, the rate of division was such that it was suggested that the quality of the work would suffer.  We had to get a national balance.  We want to do good work, but we do not want to spend a lifetime doing it.  To be really good, any work must be done within a reasonable time and there are imperfections in every sort of work which undoubtedly could be got rid of by spending a long time over it.  I, for one, do not believe in this perfection <Col N="675" /> which is to be got by spending a whole lifetime at it.  There is a period of existence for the human being which is rather short, and if you want to do something which is valuable you must do it within that time.  If you can work for ages to come, you can afford to spend a long time in perfecting a piece of work, but a work which is intended for the use of a living generation, for people living at the particular moment, must be done with reasonable speed to be of any value to them, and consequently we had in some cases to sacrifice what might be regarded as perfection in order to get the work done.  We had to say: &ldquo;We want a reasonable speed.  Mistakes will be made when that reasonable speed is sought, but we shall simply have to accept that it is inevitable that certain mistakes will occur, while, of course, doing our best to avoid them.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>We set out to divide the land both because of the fundamental idea and because there was a considerable amount of useful employment given in the distribution of land.  My view is that in regard to housing and the development of industry, our plans should now be made for continuing that development after the war, trying to speed it up as quickly as possible and making the plans, so that when the crisis is over and anything like conditions which will enable them to be put into operation have come, it will be done, and that the plans for doing it will be there.  It generally happens that when you decide on something, like the drainage schemes spoken of a few minutes ago, a certain amount of time must be taken, if you want to do your work with reasonable efficiency, to find out what is the problem and what are the facts in connection with it.  Data, in respect of levels and other engineering matters, cannot be dealt with overnight.  You must have a certain amount of time, if you are not to make a regular mess of what you want to do, for examining the facts, getting data and making plans, before you can put the plans into operation.</P>
    <P>We have a sub-committee of the Cabinet dealing with this question of <Col N="676" /> the post-war situation and the plans for it, and one of the things we have been examining is in what time, with our present aims, can we hope to finish the division of the land which is available for division, with the general idea of relieving congestion where congestion has to be relieved and of putting as many families as is reasonably possible in economic security on the land?  That has been actively examined, and I want to say here that nothing has been more disappointing to me than to find how slowly these things are being done and how slowly they will have to be done in order to get anything like reasonable efficiency, because, unfortunately, there are such matters as inspections, and all sorts of questions that cannot be solved in a day which come up for solution and take time.</P>
    <P>No person in the Dáil is more impatient at the time which some of these matters take than I.  There was a period during which there was a very much greater distribution of land than has been the case recently.  Since the war situation began, a number of new problems, which needed some of the experienced staff, arose, and we had to take the experienced staff off some of this work.  We have had to take from the Land Commission inspectors to look after the tillage question for us and so on, and all this meant that to a certain extent the land division Department has been considerably upset by the fact that we had no other people whom we could put in charge of the important work of seeing that the necessary food for the community is produced.  But we are trying to get back as quickly as we can for the Department of Lands its old organisation, or as much of it as possible, so that as much of the work as can be done will be done, so that after the war that division of land will continue and so that employment will be given &mdash;and there is a considerable amount of employment so given&mdash;in preparing estates for division.  The work done in that way is useful work for the community. It is work of a type for which the community can afford to pay because it is going to give an ultimate return.</P>
    <P>Forestry has been frequently referred <Col N="677" /> to here, and I am sure that nobody in the House has spoken about forestry as often as I did before we came into office.  I pointed out very definitely at that time, some ten or 12 years ago, that, taking the fundamental things we needed, food, clothing and shelter, timber was essential if we were to be able to carry on our ordinary building work and so on, in an emergency such as that which has come upon us.  I can honestly say here that I have been pressing every Minister in the Department of Lands since we came into office to try to get more and more land planted.  I have been disappointed that we have not already reached the 10,000 acres a year objective, and I have been pressing for that.</P>
    <P>But there, again, one has to be fairly reasonable.  I think that sometimes to be a little unreasonable is no harm because, if you are too reasonable, people will think that matters are all right.  When there is urgent work of value to be done one can be unreasonable, and I hope that I will not be misunderstood in my use of the word. In other words, you have to be impatient about things, because the answer is put up: &ldquo;We have this, that and the other difficulty to face&rdquo;, to which we must answer: &ldquo;Difficulties are there to be overcome.  You must try to get a solution for them.  There is no use in saying: &lsquo;we cannot do it because of so and so.&rsquo;  Go and get a remedy for it when the remedy is possible&rdquo;, but there is a limit to the extent to which one can be unreasonable in that way.  If, for instance, after the war I have to have a programme of afforestation and I ask what is the limit to which it can reach, I may be told: &ldquo;We have not enough trees in the nurseries of the types we want to plant.&rdquo;  Some of them had to be got from outside for some reason or other in the past.  That is no reason why we should comment on the wisdom or unwisdom of not having the necessary plants and seeds at this stage.  But if the case is put up that that is what we have to do, it will be necessary to say: &ldquo;If that is the situation, we want it to be changed with all possible speed.&rdquo; You cannot do any more.  You cannot create the plants and the seeds simply <Col N="678" /> by a wish.  All you have to do is to ensure that every possible effort is being made.  All I know is that I have tried to see that everything that could possibly be done to increase the amount of land that was to be laid out in forestry since we came into office was being done.  I do not want to say that I am satisfied with the programme that has been put up to us as possible. If I can get the 10,000 acres, instead of the figure given, the moment we can get going on it, then I will do it and the Government and the Ministers will do it.  I do not think there is anybody in the House can get more done in that matter.  The advisability of doing it is accepted.</P>
    <P>As to the extent to which we should have land under forests, the question is what we would require for all our needs.  Various estimates have been made.  The question is how much per year should be planted so that, when it comes in, it will be likely to meet the national needs in timber.  A total of 10,000 acres has been put up a number of times as being about the amount of yearly planting which, when it came in rotation, would meet our needs.  If I was fairly certain of that estimate, I would say: &ldquo;Very well, go and do 12,000.&rdquo;  If I thought 10,000 was sufficient, I would say go and do 12,000, because in 20 or 30 years' time it is better to be on the right side than on the wrong side.  In regard to afforestation, as has been pointed out by one of the Ministers here a number of times, there is considerable difficulty in getting land.  I do not think that that is a difficulty which should be allowed permanently to stand in the way.  I think we have to educate public opinion to the extent to which we should say to people who have sheep pastures or something of that sort which have been useful to them in the past, that the community's needs will have to override their private needs. If I were doing it and I came to such a place I would say: &ldquo;You have been getting a living out of grazing the land.  We are sorry, but we want that land.  It is land that from the point of view of the community it is better to put in forestry.  We will give you a farm or we will give you employment in some of the places where afforestation <Col N="679" /> is taking place.&rdquo;  There was at the beginning a considerable amount of objection to it because some of these people had been grazing the land and their people before them had lived in this way and they did not want to be deprived of that method of existence. But now they see that there is employment being given in connection with afforestation and they are gradually coming over to the view that, taking all in all, their livelihood will not be diminished.</P>
    <P>Land reclamation has been mentioned. The Minister for Agriculture has been trying to get farmers to reclaim their own land or portions of it.  Help is being given from the State to enable that to be done.  But as to land reclamation on the larger scale, there is the big question as to whether you are not putting more in the way of work into reclaiming land than the land will ever be worth.  Compared with the price at which you can buy land, you may be paying very much more for every acre of land you reclaim than for a good acre of land.  From a community point of view, the increasing of valuable land is an addition to the wealth, so to speak, of the community. There, again, you have the old question as to whether there is an addition in fact, or whether you are not diminishing the wealth by turning the efforts, that might otherwise be employed more usefully, to this work. Then you would not do it, of course. But I am assuming that there is no other way in which you can more usefully put the people to work than in reclaiming land.  It is useful work. But its economic reaction is another question.  However, that has been actively under consideration.</P>
    <P>Fundamental in that is the question of drainage.  Everybody knows there is a considerable amount of land in this country which is flooded periodically. I have been down the country recently and on a few trips I have seen a considerable amount of land under water. Nobody can see that and be satisfied as long as a remedy is possible.  As the last speaker wisely said, there is no use in trying to do that in a haphazard way, because you may do more harm than good if you do not do it properly. <Col N="680" /> The whole thing has been carefully examined to get the planning of the measure expedited.  We went outside the ordinary routine and got the heads of the Bill drafted by the Chairman of the Commission.  Quite a number of Departments were involved and, when these were examined, there were a number of matters which had to be adjusted.  Unfortunately, it has taken a very long time to adjust all these problems which arise for adjustment in connection with a matter like drainage.  But we have accepted in principle the commission's report that this should be undertaken.  We have decided, in general, upon the areas where a beginning is to be made.  I have given orders that, even while we are waiting for the necessary legislation, the engineering and other plans should be gone ahead with so that there will be no delay about them. Therefore, so far as the suggestion of trying to find useful work on drainage is concerned, that has been undertaken and is being done.</P>
    <P>Now let me take the other suggestions which have been made.  I am taking the ones which occurred to me as they have been mentioned.  If we take any of these we will find the same thing, because all these suggestions have been exactly the suggestions that were made by the Government and which are being followed up, just as our industrial policy has been followed up.  One of the early things we did after we came into office was to get a report&mdash;I have got a large volume&mdash;from the various Departments, of the useful schemes which had been suggested and which were put aside for one reason or another.  We got these to see if there was anything in addition to the general schemes that we had suggested to the people in our programme before we were elected.  We went through them to find what was the labour content of the various schemes, what was the respective value of them, and anything that was of value has been followed up.  But, when all these things are done, there is still unemployment.</P>

      <P>The Deputy suggests to me a matter I have spoken about. Long before the present emergency arose, the question of utilising our bogs was considered.  We did not wait until the emergency, when we were getting no coal and when we had, willynilly, to try to get alternative fuel.  We did not wait until that time to consider the utilisation of that natural resource&mdash;turf.  I do not know if there was any accurate way of estimating it, but the general estimate just before the war was that 3,500,000 tons of turf was produced normally for our needs and that we were importing 2,500,000 tons of coal.  Long before the war, we wanted to try to get turf used instead of coal, particularly in the areas where turf was near the towns.  We wanted to try to develop the use of turf.  We had regard to the labour that would be involved in producing it for the community.  We had a problem, of course, around Dublin. Everybody knows the problem that existed.  First of all, there was the problem that appears now, namely, transport costs.  There are certain transport costs about carting a relatively light, bulky commodity, such as turf.  If you have to transport it from the bogs of Mayo or Donegal to Dublin, it is going to add considerably to the costs.  It is a different thing if the turf is used as fuel for the people in the neighbourhood of the bogs.  But we had, all the time, a very difficult question with regard to the use of turf in this very large consuming area of Dublin.</P>
      <P>There was a question of briquetting. There was a question of getting machine-won turf, and so on.  The Turf Development Board was set up with a view to developing turf, to do its best to make it reasonably competitive with coal to the greatest extent possible.  We also had actively under consideration the question of utilising turf to produce electricity so as to add to the water power resources we have already.  It has not been possible to get some of the equipment, owing to the emergency, but that is one of the things that we have been developing and, undoubtedly, that is the line on which we should go to try to get useful employment.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="682" /> In regard to bog roads, I think the late Parliamentary Secretary had power to make bog roads wherever they were necessary for the development he required.  You will not put a road necessarily into every bog.  There are certain bogs that are not going to be developed but, if you are going to cut turf in a certain bog, you naturally want some means of bringing it out.</P>

      <P>With regard to turf, I do not think if any question had been asked at any time, there would have been any limit to the amount made available in order to make fuel available. Naturally, we were very anxious about the costs of fuel because we know that, ultimately, if turf is to be continued to be used as a fuel in this country, we have to produce it reasonably efficiently.  Otherwise, it will not be continued as such.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>There is no use in doing it.  The point is that, if it was done, it was done with a view to building the road later.  You cannot cut turf at every season of the year.  I do not know if you can make a road at every season of the year, but you can possibly make a road at a time when you could not cut turf, and if you say to me: &ldquo;I want turf next year and I see a bog conveniently situated but into which there is no road,&rdquo; I would say: &ldquo;Cut the turf during the period in which it can be cut and let us try to get the means by which it can be taken out afterwards.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>The Deputy need not tell me about it.  I say that there has never been in principle any objection to making roads as a part of producing turf and, in fact, it was never put up to us and never turned down.  There never has been put up to us a proposition, &ldquo;Here is a bog road which is necessary in order to get turf that is required for the community out of that bog&rdquo; that was turned down on account of money.  We would put up the money and say that that would have to be brought back, either immediately or later, from the price of turf.  I do not know of any case.  If ever there has been a case it may have been turned down on the basis that we have a number of other bogs which give us all we can get at the present time, or all that we can transport.  If, for instance, we had calculated on getting 1,000,000 tons of turf which we could transport, <Col N="684" /> and if the transport facilities suddenly diminished and we were not able to get the 1,000,000 tons in, and could only take 500,000 tons, I would say, &ldquo;Transport all you can get.  Do not make roads for the whole 1,000,000 tons when you cannot get it out.&rdquo;  I do not know what the position is, but, as far as I am aware, there has never been a turning down of a bog road on the basis, &ldquo;That is the quota; you can get no more.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>I would like to know that and I say it is fundamentally not a fact, no matter where it appears.  I can say, as far as I am concerned, and as far as the Government are concerned&mdash;and I think I have been at every meeting at which the thing has taken place&mdash;that there never has been, to my knowledge, a case where a bog road or any other facility was needed in order to get fuel which was turned down simply on the basis that the quota for the year was so much.  It might have been turned down for a variety of other reasons that I can easily see, but certainly not on that basis.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can say a lot of things.  If I were in charge of the Estimate, all that would be immediately to the point, but I want to say that I doubt that it appears anywhere&mdash;during the emergency particularly&mdash;that any bog road that was needed for the transport of turf which was cut and required for the community was turned down on the basis that there was some definite sum allocated and no more would be given. I think it is altogether so much at variance with our whole attitude towards the crisis and the way of dealing with it that I cannot conceive it <Col N="685" /> happening.  I have gone into land reclamation. We next come down the scale to things that are less productive because, obviously, the more productive an enterprise is, the more it gives back to the community, the better.  There are yet some of the useful services; or even the amenities. Surely, there is some limit to the extent to which we can go in for amenities.  We will have to produce things that are necessary and useful for the life of the community and, until we are able to get out of these enough to enable us to have further amenities, we cannot have these amenities.</P>
      <P>I will repeat what has been said here so often, that the question of money has never prevented us from going ahead with any scheme that was shown to be productive, or even reasonably useful for the community.  That does not mean to say that we think that money, or its equivalent, does not matter.  It is quite obvious that no community can go on using more than it produces.  There is surely a limit to that and, therefore, when people talk as if the accounting of what you lose and what you get back is not of value, and that you can go on constantly having one side of that account in debit, that is so much nonsense.  Therefore, accounting is important, and if you go on paying no attention to things&mdash;it is suggested in some quarters that we should not pay such attention&mdash;you are going to get into an extraordinary position.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We are asked to look at the war position, and we are asked why Britain and other countries seem to have no end to their resources when it is a question of war.  Their point is that during war the people are prepared to make efforts and to face sacrifices that they would not even consider in peace time.  Some people consider that the conditions that operate in a country in time of war&mdash;that is, so far as the spending of money is concerned &mdash;should continue to operate in time of peace.  Certain conditions are made possible in time of war because the individual citizen is prepared to make sacrifices during a war that he would not dream of making in peace time. <Col N="686" /> He is prepared to allow himself to be regimented, to offer his life for the community, to work hours that he would not dream of working in normal times; he is prepared to leave home, to leave his wife and family and to suffer hardships that he would never suffer in time of peace.</P>
    <P>During war the people are rationed, they have to subsist on far less food and to use less apparel.  The people experience what would ordinarily be regarded as a depressed standard of existence.  They lead a depressed life and live in what would be regarded in ordinary times as a slave state. People are prepared to do these things in war time, but do you think that in peace time they would suffer such conditions? Under war conditions the people have to work and they are given what I might describe as vouchers for which they will be allowed to purchase a certain amount of goods.  The real purchasing value of these vouchers afterwards will depend on the conditions in which the community find themselves when the emergency has passed.  You could have a lot of these things, no doubt, if you were prepared to accept, as your normal existence, that you should be regimented as people in other countries are in modern war, that your family life should be broken up and that your labour should be regulated.  If you do not want those conditions, what is the use of asking why certain things cannot be done in peace time just as in a time of war?</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamDavin" hpid="Mr. Davin Mr. Davin">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Davin</NameTxt>
      <P>Is that argument related to our own defence costs?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>To a certain extent, but to the extent to which any individual in the community has his efforts deflected from production, from giving services which would be necessary in order to convey to the members of the community the things they most require&mdash;to that extent, from an economic point of view, that individual's efforts would be a loss. But the safeguarding of the community is more important still and, in so far as the soldiers are giving that service, they have not been deflected from more important to less important duties; as a matter <Col N="687" /> of fact, they have been deflected from less important to more important work when we consider the safeguarding of the community.  But somebody will have to pay for it, and in that connection we have the people who are producing and making available the requirements of the nation. These have to be produced, in one form or another, by the efforts of the rest of the community.  Those engaged in military work are not able to produce them, and the rest of the community is satisfied to do it, recognising the supreme service which the army is giving.</P>
      <P>Money intervenes as a means of doing that, but it is only as a medium. The money that we have to our credit abroad represents goods received from or services done by other nations.  We can draw on that credit or we can export some of our surplus agricultural produce in exchange for the commodities we require.  If you put people to do work that is not of a productive character, all the food and clothing they require&mdash;as represented by their wages or salaries&mdash;must be produced by the efforts of the rest of the community. There is a limit to the burden which can be borne, and if it were put on a small section of the community, it would easily be seen that they could not bear it.  That proves that there is a limit to the distance you can go in monetary methods in providing amenities for the community.  It has been our policy, not merely to build houses but also to provide towns with sanitary accommodation and water services and generally to improve the conditions of life.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Rural electrification has been suggested and has been under active consideration for a long time past by the Electricity Supply Board.  Any reasonable scheme for rural electrification would be welcomed by the Government.  We have said &ldquo;Go ahead&rdquo; in general terms to the Board. A certain amount of the cost would be repaid by those who would use the electric power.  Any further water resources that we have should be, and are being, developed.  This is an amenity of great value in the countryside, <Col N="688" /> but its development would be fairly expensive.  However, it is of such importance that I think it should be undertaken.  I have been wondering whether the smaller rivers could not be developed by means of smaller units, but I have not gone into that from a purely economic viewpoint. Although it would not be as economic, perhaps, as the larger schemes, I always have hoped that science and engineering would develop the small machine which would be used instead of the present mass production methods.  I believe in the development of electric power and its extension to all parts of the country, and in the decentralisation of industry as well as in the use of smaller units and smaller machines.  The whole trend of our policy has been towards decentralisation, although we have had to depart from that in some particular instances.  In that way, we have tried to provide more employment in various parts of the country, instead of attracting people to the larger centres.</P>
    <P>With regard to our coal reserves, before we came into office there were claims made for various parts of the country which, unfortunately, proved to be incorrect.  I had hoped at one time that Leitrim&mdash;which had not advantages in other directions&mdash;might be worked as an industrial centre, as the data we had at that time seemed to indicate that coal and iron would be available.  After careful examination, we find that some of the resources we have are not as valuable or as attractive as they appeared to be at first, but to the extent to which they are reasonably economic we must develop them.  I might even say, in the strange use of the word, we might proceed even when they appear to be &ldquo;unreasonably&rdquo; economic, rather than proceed with too much caution. There are, however, limits to the amenities which can be provided and to the resources which can be developed.  Our attitude has been to put the social policy in the fundamental position and to try to make it possible for our country to support, economically, the largest population it can support, and to provide for the <Col N="689" /> people the highest standard of living that can be provided by our own efforts and from our own resources.</P>
    <P>It is a question of how quickly you can go.  There is a suggestion that the Government has not gone quickly enough.  I will not be sorry to have behind me the support of the Dáil in urging the Government to go faster in dealing with these matters.  I am glad to know that the Dáil wants to go in the direction we are going and to go more rapidly than we have gone. There is no use in people saying that we have not been working along these lines, as the records show that we have been doing so.  I did not say I am satisfied with the pace we have been able to set.  If you look back on the period that this Government has been in office, you will see that during five or six years of it we had a day-to-day contest with Britain, which absorbed a good deal of the energy and activity of the members of the Government. That was the whole economic situation from 1932 to 1938, until the settlement with Britain.  It was a substantial period&mdash;six years almost&mdash;and now the world war has been in progress for three and a-half years; so a good deal of our time and energy has been taken away from the work that we would like very much to have been doing.  I have not changed, as far as I am concerned, and I do not think any member of the Government has changed.  We have not changed in the slightest.</P>

      <P>I waited for a very long time for somebody to rise.  The position is that this problem of unemployment is a very difficult one.  I do not believe that there is definitely a solution to give full employment to everybody anywhere except you are going to have such a regimentation as our people, at any rate, are not prepared to accept.  We can try to solve the problem in a variety of ways.  I have indicated the natural lines upon which to go, but, even when these are completed, for a variety of reasons, there is still going to be a certain element of our people unemployed. When you have done your best in various directions&mdash;the Minister for Supplies has indicated some of the directions in which you have to move in order to deal with the problem&mdash;I doubt whether it will be possible for the State to plan so that every person will be, so to speak, usefully employed. What the State has got to do is to move in the direction where the greatest possible amount of employment will be got for all the citizens, and to keep that as its constant aim, and if, while that is being done, people are unemployed temporarily or for fairly prolonged periods, then the point is whether the community, or certain <Col N="692" /> sections of the community, if organised in a particular way, will see that such people are reasonably maintained.</P>
      <P>When we had this, beginning a good while ago, a motion was brought in here on the question that there should be work or maintenance.  That was a reasonable approach because it indicated that there was likely to be a reasonable time before your best efforts were made, and even then it was necessary to provide, naturally, that the whole effort should be directed towards diminishing unemployment to the greatest possible extent and that there should be maintenance for those who failed to secure employment&mdash; always regarding maintenance as an evil to the extent that it showed that your efforts to secure employment for all were not successful.  That was a reasonable approach, and if it were being made now, I would stand over it, but when we are asked now to produce a plan to implement something which is already being implemented in the fullest sense, and that the State should direct its efforts towards doing a certain thing that is already being done, then I think there is nothing to do except to vote against the motion, because the motion does not indicate a serious consideration of the matter.</P>
      <P>I was watching this matter because, naturally, one would welcome any suggestions to indicate how this problem would be met, and I certainly would welcome any suggestions to meet it, but to pretend that this is a thing that can be done by simply wishing, is a thing, I think, that should not be indulged in by responsible people.  I think that in a matter of this sort the people in the Dáil should not be content to say merely that it is desirable. There is, certainly, unanimity, as far as the members of the House are concerned, as to what the aim should be, and if there are any better suggestions as to how that aim can be achieved, we shall certainly keep an open mind in regard to them.</P>

      <P>We have listened to a very long statement from the Taoiseach as to the activities of his Government and the efforts to secure employment for our people in the past <Col N="693" /> 11 years.  The speech of the Taoiseach seemed to me to be notoriously incomplete because he ought to have added a postscript: &ldquo;Now, boys, having tinkered with the whole problem of unemployment for 11 years, I can do nothing with it.  It is just as bad to-day as it was, and in fact it tends to get worse,&rdquo; and he might have added: &ldquo;Boys, I can do no more now than to give the idle people permits to go to Britain and the Six Counties, because I have given up completely any hope of being able to solve the problem.&rdquo; That was the only thing lacking in the speech of the Taoiseach.</P>
      <P>There was a time when the members of the Government were much younger, much more buoyant and apparently much more enthusiastic than they are now.  A morgue-like mantle has fallen over the whole Government on the question of unemployment. The star performer in respect of the problem was the Minister for Industry and Commerce.  He was the wizard who had a plan not merely to put every unemployed man and woman into work, but who at one time confessed that it might be necessary to comb the cities of America to bring back the emigrants.  Now we cannot stop the emigrants from going out&mdash; not to America, but to bombed and &ldquo;blitzed&rdquo; Britain.  Somebody told the Minister for the Co-ordination of Defensive Measures in Dundalk in 1932 that there were 80,000 unemployed people in the country, and his reply was: &ldquo;Ah, well, shouldn't we be glad to have them to do all the work that Fianna Fáil is going to make available for them?&rdquo;  These were the balmy days when the Government believed they could cure unemployment; these were the days of plans; these were the days of organisation of a type of which Deputy Harris talked in the 1931 by-election in Kildare to which I shall refer later, quoting from his poster.</P>
      <P>Here is what the Minister for Industry and Commerce said in the Dáil on 20th April, 1932:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;I agree with what has been said that unemployment need not exist here.  I always held the opinion that unemployment in this country <Col N="694" /> was due mainly to misdirection, bad industrial organisation, or some such man-made cause.  The additional information which it has been possible to acquire, with the assistance of Government Departments at our disposal, has only convinced me in that view.  It is true that the world depression has produced its reactions here to some extent. The increase in the volume of unemployment has been due to that world depression, but despite all that may be said in that connection, I am more than satisfied that unemployment, as we now know it in this country, can be remedied, and it is the intention of the Government, in so far as its ability will permit it to do it, to find that remedy and to give effect to it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>These were brave words.  The Taoiseach, in the same debate, said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;I do not say that any situation ought to be allowed to stand in the way of meeting the needs of the unemployed, I say that we are a solvent community.  We have a potential capacity to produce wealth.  We have the capacity to meet all our needs.  All we want is to begin properly. We do not want to go off without a general idea of the direction in which we are going.  We want to examine the situation, and I promise, just as I am firm, when I think we are right, in dealing with England or anyone else, I am going, as long as I occupy this position, to be firm that the people who are entitled to get a living in this country will get it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Cheers from all the people leaving every night on the mail boat!  Here are two positive declarations by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce made in 1932. If the language used means anything at all, it means convenanting with the people that, during the régime of this Government, the problem of unemployment would be solved, and that not merely would it be solved in respect of the unemployed in this country, but that even emigrants would have to be brought back to do all the work that was to be made available.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="695" /> That was the false promise on which the Government crept into office&mdash;the promise that they could solve the unemployment problem.  The Taoiseach says now that he is not a magician and that the Government are not magicians in dealing with unemployment, and he says that, if they were, their services would be in great demand everywhere. This Government would not get a job dealing with unemployment in any cocoanut republic in the Pacific because of the way they handled the problem here.  I was looking through some interesting documents the other evening and I came across a leaflet issued by Deputy Harris in connection with the 1931 by-election in Kildare.  It made very cheerful reading then, and in case the Deputy has not got a copy, I will send him one as a souvenir, and I am sure he will value it as a most interesting document.  In that leaflet, he said there was no reason why unemployment should exist in this country.</P>
    <Speaker pid="ThomasHarris" hpid="Mr. Harris Mr. Harris">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Harris</NameTxt>
      <P>It does not exist in Kildare in any case.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>That is why the people are going to the employment exchanges &mdash;to see how things are going on there or to look at the tapestries in the buildings.  The Deputy said that unemployment need not exist in this country and that, if it did exist, it was due to bad organisation at the top, but that when Fianna Fail got into office, all that bad top-storey organisation would be altered and altered in such a way that there would be no unemployment in the country.  He said, too, that the Cosgrave Government at that time was so concerned with drawing salaries of £33 per week that they did not care what the unemployed suffered.  There has not been much reduction in the £33 since and, in fact, the cost of salaries is greater now than it was then, but that is what Fianna Fáil apparently believed in 1931 and 1932.  The people can take their choice.  They have had Deputy Harris's view on it and the view of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, but the substance of the promise made by the Government was that this Government <Col N="696" /> would solve the problem of unemployment.</P>
      <P>I am not going to be impetuous and to expect quick results, least of all from this Government, but it has been 11 years in office now and one cannot be accused of any excessive impetuosity if, after 11 years of the government, we say: &ldquo;What have you really done to solve the problem of unemployment confronting this country to-day?&rdquo; What have they done?  We have approximately 60,000 people registered as unemployed, as well as thousands of others who do not register because they can get nothing, owing to the application of niggardly means tests by the employment exchange.  Notwithstanding that we have that large number of unemployed, we have to remember that, during the past three years, approximately 30,000 people have joined the Army, have been artificially taken off the unemployment market, and that, during the past two years, 100,000 of the best of our men and women have been driven out of this country to get employment in the Six Counties and Great Britain. Although we exported 100,000 able-bodied men and women and although approximately 30,000 additional people have joined the Army, we still have approximately 60,000 people registered as unemployed, and tens of thousands unregistered because it is not worth while going to the labour exchange for the miserable pittances they get there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the net result of 11 years of this Government's operating on the problem.  That is the net result of 11 years of activity by this Government, based upon a plan designed to eliminate unemployment.  Does not every Deputy on the Government Benches, every Deputy in the House, know that the biggest trade in this country is the export of human beings?  Does not every Deputy know perfectly well that, every day in the week and every week in the year, he gets letters from constituents asking him to try to get them exit permits to go to Britain?  The letters I get from the place where Deputy Harris says no unemployment exists are heartrending.  They are letters from men who are trying to get work and who cannot get it, who are <Col N="697" /> trying to get exit permits to go to Britain, leaving behind their wives and children, to work under the conditions which prevail there, and prepared to do that rather than to put up with the unending poverty and daily grind for the miserable pittanees masquerading as wages which they receive in this country to-day.</P>

      <P>The Taoiseach told us about Article 45 of the Constitution, which declares that the State shall, in particular, direct its policy towards securing that the citizens may, through their occupations, find a means of making reasonable provision for their domestic needs.

Yet, the State is moving along the line of enabling the citizen to make reasonable provision for his domestic needs through following a particular occupation.  If the State does contemplate action of that kind, that clearly shows, as the Taoiseach is bound to admit, that the State was not going fast enough.  But this Article of the Constitution clearly implied some positive State action.</P>

      <P>I am much obliged to the Taoiseach and his friends.  In any case, we heard a lot of lyrical nonsense from the Taoiseach about Article 45 of the Constitution, but it has no meaning whatever so far as the unemployed man or woman is concerned.  Not a single person who goes to the labour exchange at Gardiner Street would give a ½d. for a dozen copies of Article 45 of the Constitution.  They know it is a sham and a mockery.  They know that it will not pay any grocer's bill; that it will not enable them to buy fuel or commodities which are in short supply through Government mismanagement.</P>
      <P>You should take Article 45 over to the destitute people at Chatham Row. Not even the Taoiseach would have the brazen audacity to trot out Article 45 to the people either in Gardiner Street or Chatham Row.  These people suffer from want and hunger every day in the week.  This Constitution has meant no change for them.  Article 45 has made no difference to them.  They still suffer from hunger, want and destitution, notwithstanding the promises of the Government to solve the problem of unemployment and to provide maintenance for the unemployed people. The Taoiseach does not believe that people in Dublin are suffering from destitution.</P>

      <P>Here is a leaflet sent out by the St. Vincent de Paul Society in 1942.  That society is not an adjunct of the Labour Party.  Here is what it said:&mdash;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="700" />&ldquo;Poverty and destitution are rife in Dublin.  Many of our men and women are so weak from undernourishment that, even if employment were offered to them, they could not undertake any kind of work. Thousands of people are without sufficient personal and bedclothing. The never-ending struggle to provide food and clothing often results in non-payment of rent, and the constant fear of eviction.  The poor have no reserves of food and fuel for the winter.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is a description of the conditions in Dublin by the St. Vincent de Paul Society when making an appeal for money.  The plain fact of the matter is, and the Taoiseach has been compelled to admit it in the course of his speech, that the Government cannot provide work for the idle men and women.  Any effort to do so has been long since abandoned.  The best thing therefore to do for the idle men and women is to get rid of them by exporting them to Great Britain; the kind of genteel forced labour which is talked so much of on the Continent.  If any of them survive the exportation process, the thing is to give them rotational employment for three or four days per week, to give them a miserable pittance slightly more than they would get in unemployment assistance benefit.  That represents the high-water mark of this Government's policy for dealing with the unemployment problem.</P>
    <P>I am wondering what the Government hope to do when the war is over. When the war is over we will not have to send for the emigrants as we threatened to do in 1931 and 1932. Those emigrants may not wait until they are sent for.  We may not have to send ships to take them back.  We may not have to advertise and to comb the cities of America to get them back. They may be sent back to us whether we like it or not.  Some may express a desire to come back.  But, whether we like it or not, they may be sent back here.  Perhaps 250,000 may be sent back and we may be told to provide for them as Great Britain has enough of her own unemployed to provide work for.  We may very well <Col N="701" /> be told: &ldquo;You can look after your own people.&rdquo;  What are we going to do then?  We cannot solve the problem of unemployment by spraying Britain with our manhood to-day.  What are we going to do when the war is over, when these people either insist on coming back or are sent back?  The Taoiseach told us that somebody was planning for the post-war period, that that matter was being attended to, with, I suppose, the same efficiency as the whole supply position was attended to in 1938 and 1939.  It was so efficiently attended to that, when the war broke out, we had stocks of nothing except nonsense.</P>
    <P>I do not believe the Government realises the problem that is going to confront it when the war is over.  I do not believe it is budgeting in the slightest degree for the possibility that we may have to deal with an army of 200,000 or 250,000 people who will be drafted back here then, who will not be very patient when they are drafted back, and will not wait too long for a remedy to be applied to their economic difficulties.  I do not believe the Government has given a single constructive thought to the necessity for dealing with that problem.  Even if it has done so, I have no faith whatever in the Government's ability to solve that problem or to apply any effective remedy to it because, dealing with the much lesser problem at home, it has completely failed.</P>
    <P>The magnitude of its failure to deal with such a problem has only to be thought of to be realised.  Without purporting to be able to survey the post-war world, everybody knows that there will be sufficient disorganisation, sufficient eruption, sufficient social disorder and commercial chaos to make the task of finding employment for people after the war a more severe task than the problem of finding employment for people to-day.  In circumstances such as these, we have in office a Government which cannot deal with a relatively small unemployment problem at home and who then tell us that they are thinking of making such provision for the position of this country after the war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="702" /> The Labour Party's motion on this question of unemployment has been put down in a desire to test the Government's policy with respect to unemployment, to ascertain what proposals the Government have for dealing with the problem of unemployment. We take the view that involuntary idleness is criminal, economic waste.  Every idle man and woman has to be supplied with food and clothing and has to be provided with shelter.  Unless some external authority will give them the food, clothing and the shelter, they must, obviously, get it out of the pockets of those who are employed in this country to-day.  The effect of their being sustained in that way means that those who work must yield up a portion of their income in order to maintain an involuntarily idle army within the State.  We want to try to eliminate the involuntarily idle army within the State, to enable it, not merely to provide food, clothing and shelter for itself but, at the same time, to produce wealth which it will share with the whole community.  In short, to enable the whole community to free itself of the liability to provide for those who are kept out of employment to-day.</P>
    <P>There is an abundance of work to be done.  The Taoiseach has told us of the various efforts which the Government have made in different directions. My answer to that is that the Government have not gone far enough and have not gone fast enough, that the <i>tempo</i> of Governmental activity in these spheres should be much accelerated. In afforestation, drainage, land reclamation, the production of fuel, the demolition of slums, mineral development, the building of schools and hospitals and in the intensification of agricultural production, to mention but a few items, there is an abundance of work to be done in this country. There is an abundance of idle men and women to do it and the State to-day, according to the Taoiseach, is a solvent community, capable of sustaining the activities of our people on the raw materials of the nation.  If that is so, if we have idle men and women, if we have work to be done, then State <Col N="703" /> credits ought to be released in order to harness the idle man-power to the work to be done and, in that way, enable these people to create a standard of living for themselves and to enrich the whole community by multiplying its wealth-producing capacity.</P>
    <P>A nation can live only on what it produces.  The most criminal waste in this country to-day is to have tens of thousands of idle men and women and to export others when the roll of the unemployed becomes inconveniently large.  Our view is that, with work to be done, with men and women to do it, they should be put to work to create wealth.  If we cannot put our men and women to work, to create wealth in their own land, and if we cannot pay them a decent rate of wage for creating wealth for the nation, then, Article 45 of the Constitution notwithstanding, what we ought to do is to give every idle man and woman and every low-paid worker in this country a passport and let them go wherever they like in the world to try to find the standard of living and the employment which we cannot give them.  I refuse to believe that this country is so devoid of agricultural and industrial wealth that it must spray its mankind and <Col N="704" /> womankind all over the world.  I believe there is agricultural and industrial wealth here which, if properly organised, is capable of providing a decent standard of living for every man and woman born into this country.  But that requires organisation. We have witnessed the Government's attempts over 11 years to deal with the question of unemployment in this country.  We have witnessed its efforts over 11 years to organise the community so as to make it self-contained.</P>
    <P>The Taoiseach, by his speech this evening, has clearly acknowledged that the Government has no remedy for the problem of unemployment in this country beyond the exportation of our manhood.  We refuse to believe that that bleak outlook is the only thing that confronts this country.  The Labour Party believes that, given proper organisation, given enthusiasm for the work, the Government, with the help of every other element within the community, can yet organise a mass crusade in regard to this vital problem of unemployment.  It might then, by the exercise of energetic and courageous methods, show that what it forecast in 1932&mdash;and in which I believe it was right when it forecast&mdash; could at least be implemented in 1944.</P>

A petition against resumption lodged on behalf of the tenant was heard on 20th February, 1941, and refused by the Lay Commissioners.  Subsequently an application was made to the Appeal Tribunal by the Land Commission for an order authorising the resumption of the holding but this application was adjourned as the tenant instituted High Court proceedings against the Land Commission and the Attorney-General of Éire for a declaration that the provisions of Sections 7 to 11 of the Land Act, 1933, are <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution, for a declaration that certain provisions of the Act of 1939 relating to resumption are also <i>ultra vires</i> the Constitution and for an order restraining the Land Commission from prosecuting further the application made by them for leave to resume the holding.  The High Court proceedings are still pending as the case has not yet been heard.</P>
