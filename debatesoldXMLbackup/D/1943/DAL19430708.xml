      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce if he will cause inquiries to be made to find the number of dockers, carters, seamen and port workers who do not benefit in respect of holidays by the Conditions of Employment Act, because of &ldquo;broken time&rdquo;; and if he will provide for their inclusion in future legislation.</P>

      <P>Seamen are excluded from the provisions of the Holidays (Employees) Act, 1939.  With regard to the other classes of workers referred to in the question, I gave full explanations in reply to questions put to me on the 20th May and the 3rd February last.  On those occasions I invited the Deputies who put in the questions to make some practical suggestion as to how the difficulties of the position might be met, but no such suggestion has yet reached me.  Every effort has been made in conference with representatives of employers and workers to find a solution of the difficulty, but no practical proposal has yet emerged.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>Is the Minister aware that I accepted his invitation and put up a suggestion to his Department, but got no reply?  That is the reason why I have put the question down here.  I suggested that men who were working broken time&mdash;six months with one company and six months with another&mdash;<Col N="374" /> should get part-time holidays from each company.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The only letter I received from the Deputy on the subject was one in which he said that he was not in a position to put forward any practical suggestion.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>That is a practical suggestion&mdash;that, when men work six months with the B. &amp; I. and the other six with the L.M.S., each company should give them part-time holidays as prescribed by the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy knows quite well that those are not the circumstances with which we have to deal. A man who works six months for the same employer is entitled to the privileges of the Act.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I am asking the Minister to consider the desirability of introducing legislation to give holidays with pay to those casual workers.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The matter has been fully considered.  The Deputy, and everybody else, has been invited to give us suggestions, but has failed to do so.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>No; I have given that suggestion&mdash;a very practical one&mdash;to which the Minister could give effect.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The suggestion has nothing to do with the problem.  The problem relates to dockers who are employed by different employers in the same week.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>asked the Minister for Local Government and Public Health if a decision has yet been reached with reference to the Dublin Corporation's proposal to increase the allowances payable to blind persons; and, also, if he will receive the corporation deputation appointed to state their case.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>I saw the reply going to the Minister, with a statement from the Blind Persons' Association, making their claims.  I have seen it. Something must have gone wrong in the Minister's Department.</P>

    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Byrne Mr. Byrne">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>It is.  I am asking the Minister if he is aware that the Dublin Corporation sent in an appeal from the blind asking him to increase their allowances.  The corporation asked that a deputation be received.  The Minister has not yet received the deputation, although he said that he would do so if a statement on behalf of the blind were submitted to him.</P>

    <Speaker pid="SeanMaxEntee" hpid="Mr. MacEntee Mr. MacEntee">
      <NameTxt>Mr. MacEntee</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Byrne</NameTxt>
      <P>But will the Minister receive the deputation?  He said he would receive them if they submitted a statement.  A statement has been submitted to the Minister's Department, but no reply has been received. Will the Minister kindly make inquiries in his office to see whether anything has gone wrong there?</P>

      <P>I understand it is the intention that the House should adjourn to-morrow, probably until some date about the middle of October. When the Emergency Powers Art was passed in 1939 it was realised that, having regard to the powers conferred upon the Government under that Act, there would probably be occasions when the Dáil would adjourn for long periods.  On that occasion, in the last Dáil, an assurance was given by the Taoiseach that if representations were made to him by any responsible Party in the House that it was desirable to convene the Dáil for the purpose of discussing a matter of substantial importance, that request would be acceded to.  This is a new Dáil but I take it that the same arrangement will stand.  As the House is likely to adjourn this week for a very long period, I should like the Tánaiste to give an assurance that if the Taoiseach receives a request from any Party in this House to convene the Dáil for perhaps one or two days to discuss a matter of importance, that request in accordance with the previous assurance will be acceded to.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>When speaking on this matter last night, I called the attention of the House to the fact that agricultural wages under the régime of the Fine Gael Government were somewhere between 7/- and 9/- per week, that the minimum wages at <Col N="377" /> present are 36/- per week, and that the farmers are better able to pay that 36/- to-day than they were able to pay the 7/- or 9/ during Deputy Cosgrave's régime.  I invite the representatives of the agricultural community here to say whether they wish to go back to the period when the value laid on their work by the then Government was from 7/- to 9/- per week, the value not alone of their employees' work, but the value of the work of the farmers themselves, for every farmer worth his salt in this country works on the land. I want to know whether they are prepared to go back to that.</P>
      <P>We had a lot of statistics here last night.  I am sorry Deputy Davin is not here now because those statistics are rather interesting.  I have here the trade statistics for the years 1924, 1925, 1927, and 1932.  They are rather interesting, in fact very interesting.  For instance, in 1925 we exported 300,000 fewer cattle than in 1924 and we got for these cattle £5,000,000 less than in 1924.  We exported 182,000 fewer sheep in 1925 than in 1924, and we got £500,000 less for them.  We exported 13,000 fewer pigs and we got £550,000 less for them.  We exported 220,000 less cwts. of bacon and we got £420,000 less in respect of that commodity.  We exported 66,000 cwts. less butter in that year than in 1924 and we got £400,000 less than in the previous year. The total difference between what we got in 1925 and the amount we received in 1924 was £7,000,000 odd&mdash;a drop of £7,000,000 in the income in respect of agriculture for one year.  The drop continued still further in 1927.  In 1927, we got a further £2,000,000 less than we got in 1925.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We come on to a later period.  We hear the Party opposite talk about production and still more production. That is all right; it is the finest policy in the world for the agricultural community so long as they can get a market for their products.  That is what our Minister for Agriculture aimed at.  He aimed at having a market here at home for wheat, beet, and every other crop that we can produce, the price fixed to have some relation to the labour the farmer expends on his land.  I shall give you <Col N="378" /> an instance of how those things worked out.  In 1929, we exported 774,000 head of cattle and we got £13,000,000 for them.  In 1931 we exported the same number of cattle and we got £8,700,000 for them.  Although the farmer had the same trouble in rearing calves and in feeding cattle, he got £5,000,000 less in 1931 than in 1929.  He could kick up any row he liked in the Dáil about the price, but he had to take what he got. As regards sheep, he exported 211,000 sheep in 1929 and 240,000 in 1931, and for these sheep he got £542,000 in 1929, and £284,000 in 1931.  He got £2 11s. per head for his sheep in 1929, and for similar sheep he got only £1 9s. per head in 1931.  These are figures I want Deputies to think over.  I now turn to the fat pig.  The farmer got £7 6s. per head in 1929 and for a pig of the same weight in 1932, he got £4 4s.  He got £1,866,000 for fat pigs in 1929, and £804,000 for the same number of pigs in 1932.  Those are the facts.  They are rather stubborn.  They show what happened.  We shall pursue the matter a little further.</P>

      <NameTxt>General MacEoin</NameTxt>
      <P>Take 1933-34 for instance.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Take the item of butter. In 1929, the farmers received 164/10 per cwt., and in 1932, 95/- per cwt.&mdash;a drop of roughly 50 per cent., so that the farmer in 1932 would have to produce 2 lbs. butter to get the same amount of money into his exchequer as he got in 1929 for 1 lb.  That was the position under the policy of those gentlemen opposite.  I have gone through the whole of the items, live stock and butter.  The income from eggs exported shows a decrease of similar proportions.  In the four years from 1929, there was a drop every year in the income from these exports. That is why our Minister for Agriculture decided that the farmers should have something to fall back upon in their own country, that they should have some market that could be controlled here at home, and in which the price of their produce could be fixed here at home.  If the farmer was not getting enough, at least he had some redress.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the difference between our <Col N="379" /> agricultural policy and the agricultural policy of the Party opposite. Those books can be got by new Deputies in the library, and they can examine them themselves.  That is actually why I am at one with the Minister for Agriculture in his present policy as regards agriculture.  We do not agree, and we never would agree, that we are getting enough.  Sometimes the agricultural community look for too much&mdash;I say that honestly here.  Sometimes the Minister does not give enough.  The year before last the Minister did not give a sufficient price for beet, with the result that the acreage needed was not grown. Last year we endeavoured to force the pace a bit by demanding 90/- a ton for our beet.  We fought for that and the Minister for Agriculture and the sugar company decided on paying 80/-.  Whilst the Beet Growers' Association were still fighting the sugar company on the price, the farmers of this country, wiser apparently than the Beet Growers' Association, signed contracts with the sugar company for 52,000 acres at 80/- per ton, the price the Minister decided on paying, proving, to my mind, that we had looked for too much, and that we had overstated our demands.  Those are rather striking facts, but they bring the matter home to us.</P>
    <P>Last year I dealt with one particular question of the Minister's programme because in my opinion he could afford to allow the farmers to get a fair price for malting barley.  I would like to take the Minister's mind back for a few years, back to the last war, when the price of malting barley in this country was 52/- a barrel, and when the duty on the pint of stout was practically the same as it is at present, and the price of the pint of stout was practically the same also.  During the bad years afterwards when a Government was in office in this country which had no respect for the working farmer, the price of farmers' barley was allowed to drop until in 1931 and 1932 farmers were getting only 13/- a barrel for barley and were fighting for the market.  They delivered the barley to the brewer and they did not know what <Col N="380" /> the price was going to be.  They were glad to get it into the brewers' store and to wait for three months until the brewer announced his price of 13/- a barrel for Irish barley.  During those years the price of stout remained it the old figure despite the fact that the brewer had the difference between 13/- and 52/- to put in his pocket.  The duty on the stout was the same and the brewer got that extra profit.  I ask the Minister now here in the House to give us our chance, to give the agricultural community of this country who grow barley and who had to grow it at 13/- a barrel when the brewer was still fattening his pockets with the extra sweat of the farmers, to give them a chance now and let them deal on the principle of supply and demand with the brewers of this country.  Let us get our price.</P>
    <P>The brewers of this country are brewing stout for export purposes.  The price of barley in Britain is roughly 70/- a barrel.  The brewers want to buy our barley at 30/- to 35/- a barrel, and they are going to have for their own pockets the difference between those prices and the 70/- which they have to pay the Englishman for his barley.  In my personal opinion, and I think I may speak for 100 per cent. of the farmers who grow barley, that is a market which should be left open. Let us deal with the brewer, and let us extract some of the ill-gotten gains he shoved into his pocket during the years he had a Fine Gael Government to protect him.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy Norton can speak in his turn.  I am speaking here for the farmer, and I am pleading for him.  Deputy Norton can look after his own industrialists, but I have stated a position which cannot be denied in this House or anywhere else.  I will now go into another matter which, in my opinion, deserves the Minister's attention. I think the question of seeds, small seeds in particular, mangold seed, turnip seed, rape seed and kale, should be examined.  Those seeds were previously imported from Britain, and I have here the figures giving the cost <Col N="381" /> of seed when imported and the price the farmer had to pay for it.</P>
      <P>In 1938 we imported 10,765 cwts. of mangold seed at a cost, landed here, of £22,685.  The farmer paid £90,396 for that mangold seed&mdash;four times what it cost.  We imported 6,972 cwts. of turnip seed at a cost, landed here, of £21,689, and the farmers had to pay £52,057 for that.  We imported 405 cwts. of cabbage seed at a cost, landed here, of £3,938, and the farmer had to pay £15,752.  We imported kale seed, rape seed, carrot seed, etc., to the extent, of 2,586 cwts., at a cost landed here of £8,147.  The farmers paid £32,588 for them.  The total of the seeds imported cost £56,459, landed here, and the farmers paid £190,793 for them.</P>

    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Is it?  My job here for the past five years has been to call the attention of the Government to things that the so-called Opposition in this House were too lazy to look up and too much afraid to criticise.  Any Deputy over there will have just about the same trouble in getting those figures as I have had.  But Deputies over there were too lazy to look for them.  One of them who aspires to be the new Minister for Agriculture, Deputy Fitzgerald-Kenney, tired this House last night quoting a four-year-old speech because he was too lazy to make a new one.  No wonder there are only 32 Deputies now in their combined eight Parties.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>These are facts that I have been giving.  My principal reason for doing so is that I want to quote a new factor. Since this war started the farmers of this country have endeavoured to be self-sufficient as regards their crops. We have endeavoured to raise our own beet seed which the Belgians supplied us with before.  We have endeavoured to raise our own mangold and turnip seeds instead of having to import them <Col N="382" /> from abroad.  If we take last year, the farmers grew mangold seed under contract at, roughly, from 8d. to 10d. per lb.  That mangold seed was afterwards resold to the farmers at the stiff price of 2/9 per lb.  Pre-war, the price of mangold seed sold over the counter here was 1/6 per lb.  The profit now allowed on mangold seed from the time it leaves the farmer's haggard to the time it is sold back to him over the counter is 2/1.  If the farmers of this country grew the whole of our requirements in mangold seed, the quantity would be 16,145 cwts., for which they would receive £60,208 according to contract, while they would pay back for it under the fixed price £198,000. If we are going to build up new industries in this country, industries which will provide employment for our unemployed people on the land, we cannot afford to have those industries killed now by profiteers.  If our farmers grew all the turnip seed that is required by the agricultural community they would need to produce 9,500 cwts. of turnip seed.  According to the contract price paid by Associated Seeds, Ltd., for this turnip seed, the farmer would get £71,000 for growing the seed, while Associated Seeds, Ltd., at the present fixed price for turnip seed would get £496,000. These are the figures, and they show that the system of profiteering that is going on in this country must end. It must end if the industries that the farmers are trying to build up are to go ahead.</P>
    <P>The sugar company gave us contracts during the past three or four years, since the war started, for the growing of beet seed.  We grew on the land their beet seed at 8d. per lb.  The company helped us out considerably as regards manures, supervision and some other things that we could not do ourselves or that we would find it difficult to do.  That company is able to sell back the seed to the farmer at 1/6 per lb.  Those new seed companies which have come along are paying exactly the same price for the growing of mangold seed as the sugar company is paying for the growing of beet seed. In view of that, how is it that they are permitted to sell back the mangold <Col N="383" /> seed to the farmer at 1/3 per lb. more profit than the sugar company is getting on the beet seed which it sells back to the farmer?</P>

      <P>We have.  I am giving the figures, and I want to see this industry remaining in the country when the war ends.  I do not want to see it killed now.  Where is the farmer who to-day is paying from 6/6 to 7/6 per lb. for turnip seed going to go after the war?  Is there not going to be a universal demand to go back and buy the cheap seeds that we had before? This is an industry that would be peculiarly helpful to what I may call our small farmers and uneconomic holders in the West of Ireland, in Galway, Mayo, and portions of West Cork and in Kerry.  The growing of an acre of seed will bring in, roughly, from £100 to £130.  The greater portion of the labour needed for that work could be done by those young men and women who at present have to go over to England to pick potatoes or to do some other class of work, and would keep them in employment at home.  On the growing of an acre or two acres of seed they could earn as much as they are able to earn by going abroad, and the seeds grown <Col N="384" /> here could be sold in the country at a reasonable price.  If the sugar company are able to sell back the beet seed to us at 1/6 per lb., why cannot the mangold seed be sold back at the same price?</P>

      <P>I am not arguing with anybody.  I am directing my statements to the Ceann Comhairle and not to any particular Deputy.  But those are the facts, and facts are stubborn things.  In my opinion, this is an industry which should be protected and preserved.  It is one that would provide an enormous amount of employment for our people at home.</P>
      <P>I would like to say one word about the price of milk.  I cannot for one moment agree with the Minister as to the cost of producing milk in Cork and the cost of producing it in Dublin.  I would advise him to go very carefully into the enormous discrepancy there is between the price that is now being allowed to Cork farmers to produce milk and the price allowed to the Dublin farmers for producing the same article.  With regard to milk at the creameries, the situation was very peculiar.  I gave figures here half an hour ago showing that the price of creamery butter delivered in Britain fell from 164/10 to 95/- per cwt. in four years.  During the first few years of the Fianna Fáil Government, the price fell still lower, and, as a matter of fact, in 1940, the price for Irish creamery butter in Britain would not allow the Government of this country to pay 4d. per gallon for milk.  That is your outside market, and watch very carefully how you ever return to it. That is my advice to you.  Facts are stubborn things and the facts are there.  The fact is that if this country is to be forced to depend on an outside market in relation to its butter exports, it had better slaughter the cows.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Last night I gave one instance of the manner in which this Government had to step in to protect the dairy industry. They had to bring in a Stabilisation of Prices Bill, followed by an <Col N="385" /> enormous subsidy on exported butter. The people opposite argued that 4d. per gallon was too much to pay to the farmer for his milk and they trotted into the Lobby to vote against the fanner getting any more.  Deputy Bennett was a notable exception.</P>

      <P>I wish to emphasise that particular fact in connection with the present, price of milk, which I am leading up to.  I said last night also that I was not satisfied with the position of our premier industry.  I am not satisfied with the position in which the people working on the land are the worst paid people in the country.  I will just give one instance of what happened in order to bring it home to the House.  It brought the position home very forcibly to me.  Some time ago, Dr. Ryan decided&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>The Minister decided that the profit allowed to retailers on the sale of butter would be 1d. per lb.  There was war in Cork, where the traders, decided to sell no more butter. They bad deputations roaming around the streets looking for Deputies to tackle and I happened to fall in with some of them.  They wanted me to head a deputation to the Minister with their case.  I asked them what was their case aad one of them said to me:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;You know, Mr. Corry, we have to pay £3 10s. 0d. per week to the lad inside the counter who hands out that butter.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>I looked at them and said:</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>&ldquo;You want me to go to the Minister because you are paying £3 10s. 0d. per week to the lad who papers the butter and hands it over the counter.  That lad comes into work at 9 o'clock in the morning, with a nice collar and tie and polished boots, and he gets £3 10s. 0d. per week.  The poor man who has to get up at 5.45 and in the cold and frost, feed and milk the <Col N="386" /> cows and possibly on a wet, rainy day has to get into his cart and take the milk to the creamery, gets 36/- per week.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the difference between the farm labourers and the others.  I suggest that it should be the other way round, if there is to be a change.  It is time tho lad who has to get up in the morning at a quarter to six, milk the cows and feed them and take the milk to the creamery should get some decent remuneration for his labour. The only way that can be done is by an increase in the price of milk.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <P>There is one matter which should concern the Minister for Supplies of which I want to speak.  We hear a lot of talk about costings, fixed prices, and all the rest of it, but the farmer down in West Cork who, finding that he had no artificial manure, went down to the coast, got a load of sea sand, conveyed it to the railway station&mdash;because he would not be allowed to use lorries on account of the petrol shortage&mdash;and booked it to Dunmanway, last year paid 3/1 per ton freight.  This company, which has the monopoly of the whole carrying trade of the country, published a new scale of charges the other day.  The poor farmer down in <Col N="387" /> Dunmanway who paid 3/1 per ton freight on his sea sand last year must now pay 8/- per ton.  When the agricultural community look for better prices on that account, they are told that they are trying to hold the country up to ransom.</P>
    <P>The quantity of sea sand delivered up to June of this year was: in January, 840 tons; in February, 1,100 tons; in March, 1,300 tons; in April, 1,300 tons; in May, 1,200 tons, and in June, 1,300 tons, showing that the railway company, even on the basis of a 3/- per ton rate, got a fairly good whack.  Any Deputy who has to travel from Cork in the train at present knows that he may manage to get a seat in the corridor, but will not find very many inside the compartments, which shows that the railway company must be doing very well on passenger traffic.  I think it is holding up the agricultural community to ransom that a body of people who have a monopoly of the carrying trade of this country should increase their charges to the farmers.</P>

      <P>Deputy Anthony may not interrupt.  These are the matters in connection with agriculture with which I wish to deal.  In conclusion, as far as agriculture is concerned, I would like to say that, in my opinion, at any rate, we are on the right road.  We have been on the right road from 1932 onwards as regards agriculture.  We have continued along that road.  Our statements have been proved to be true.  That is the right road, namely, to produce for the people at home the food they require.  In times of stress, in times of trouble, this country was not going to be at the mercy of Deputy Dillon's friends, or dear friends of other Deputies, or of people inside and outside this House who hoped that by a campaign against the Fianna Fáil policy of food production at home they would drive this country into the position of having to beg from the foreigner the bread to feed our people and having to pay for that with the lives and the blood of our people. That is what Deputies over there tried to do.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I intend to deal with another matter, connected principally with local government. In generations past, when a person was discovered to be a malefactor or highwayman of any description, he was beaten and stoned and driven outside the walls of the city. My friends in Cork tried that policy on a body of people who were not malefactors, who were not robbers, people who had committed only one crime, the crime of being poor.  They were driven outside the walls of Cork City and the red city was built there for them and they were shoved into it. Those people are deprived of the social benefits that this Government has passed legislation to provide for the community.  Some thousands of families are suffering in that way. <Col N="390" /> There is no use in the Minister for Local Government expressing views that he has recently expressed in connection with this matter&mdash;why do not they extend the borough boundary? Those people, poverty stricken, without unemployment assistance, without the benefit of the voucher scheme, cannot continue during a ten year dispute between Mr. Monahan, the City Manager, and the Cork County Council on the extension of the borough boundary.  By that time a large number of them would have buried their children as the result of starvation.  This is a matter that should be immediately taken up by the Minister for Local Government.  Is there any reason on earth why a man living in No. 3 Spangle Hill should have 25/- a week unemployment assistance, so much free milk, butter and bread, and a man living in No. 5 Spangle Hill, with a larger family, in exactly the same position, should have nothing at all, merely because one happens to be inside a borough boundary stone and the other happens to be outside it?</P>
    <Speaker pid="FrankFahy" hpid="An Ceann Comhairle Frank Fahy">

    <Speaker pid="MartinJohnCorry" hpid="Mr. Corry Mr. Corry">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Corry</NameTxt>
      <P>Certainly.  Yesterday I submitted a question here to the Minister for Local Government in connection with one injustice that this City Manager endeavoured to inflict.  The unfortunate people out in that district, in addition to being driven outside the city walls, were paying outrageous rents.  These people happened, on account of legislation passed here, to be entitled under the Emergency <Col N="392" /> Powers Act to a bonus.  They went before a tribunal and gave evidence as to the extra cost of their bread, butter, tea and sugar.  That tribunal awarded them something between 5/- and 8/- per week to make up the extra cost of the bread, butter, tea and sugar.  Then the City Manager came along and took 1/- off the 5/- and 1/4 off the 8/- by way of extra rent.  That is one of the ways in which it was tackled without legislation.  We want to curb the Czar that has arisen in Cork.</P>

      <P>I regret I had to get the indulgence of the Dáil for that.  As regards the main attack that has been made here, the attack on the Government's agricultural policy, I stand over every bit of the Government's agricultural policy.  The Government's agricultural policy is all right.  The farmers are four times better off under it than they were under the Fine Gael Government or the Cumann na nGaedheal Government, or whatever they were called when they were the Government.  That is the position of the agricultural community.  In my opinion they are not properly treated. The agricultural community are the only producers in this country who are not paid a decent wage for their labour.</P>

Deputy Dillon seems to think that he can say what he likes to-day and nobody will think of it tomorrow; that he can preach one policy to-day and a different policy tomorrow. Deputy Dillon came into this House as an avowed protector of the farming community and as a completely independent Deputy.  Yet he attacked other Deputies last week for doing exactly the same thing as he did previously when in that position.  At that time he said he did not care for Deputy de Valera's national policy, that he did not care for his economic policy, and that he would not vote for him; neither did he vote against him.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I want to make it clear that it would be a reckless action to leave this country without a Government in a time of serious national emergency&mdash;and that is the proposition which was put before this Party. We consider that the largest Party in the House ought to be allowed to form a Government in view of the fact that there is no other Party at the moment in a position to form a Government. We are giving the largest Party in the House an opportunity to show whether they are prepared to deal seriously with the problems that face agriculture and, indeed, that face the nation generally.  If they fail to deal with these problems as they require to be dealt with, then we will deal with them as we think fit.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The main problems that face this nation at the present time are, first of <Col N="396" /> all, the problem of providing food for our people during the emergency and, secondly, the problem of planning for the future of agriculture when the emergency is over.  I found very little indication of a willingness on the part of the majority of the Deputies who spoke yesterday to face up to the immediate needs of agriculture and of the nation&mdash;that is, if they are to ensure that the people of the State will have sufficient food to carry them on until next year, and that sufficient provision will be made during the coming months so that there will be an ample quantity of food produced to enable us to carry on until the following year.  It is not only possible, but there is even a grave probability, that before this time 12 months we will have more serious problems to deal with in regard to the food supplies of our nation than are at present facing us, grave as they are at the moment.</P>
    <P>I am not satisfied that everything that could be done is being done to increase food production.  I am not satisfied that the food producer is being given the encouragement, the co-operation and the support which he is entitled to expect from the Department of Agriculture and the Government. First of all in degree of importance is our wheat supply.  Are we sure that sufficient wheat has been sown during the past year to carry us on until this day 12 months?  I have grave reason to fear that the acreage under wheat this year is not substantially higher than what we had last year.  The Minister may have some figures at his disposal in regard to this matter, but so far they have not been made public.  Whatever the position may be, there is a very urgent need to ensure that in the next few months a great effort will be made to increase the acreage under wheat. There are two ways in which encouragement can be given to the farmer to extend the acreage under wheat. You can encourage him by giving an increase in the price per barrel, or you can give encouragement by paying a direct subsidy per acre on every acre grown.  I strongly recommend the desirability of giving a direct State grant per acre.</P>

Notwithstanding that demonstration of independence of both the big political Parties, within a few months he had sold out his Party and he went into one of them. I do not know what induced him to act in that way.  There may have been some compulsion brought to bear upon him.  Deputy Dillon has always distinguished himself in this House as an advocate of free trade, and it sounds a little bit absurd to see this advocate of absolutely free and unfettered trade suggesting that the farmer should be compelled to grow a certain crop.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>I have no intention of dealing with the matter at any great length.  Of course, the wheat-growing season begins in September or October.  In the meantime, I should like the Minister for Agriculture and the Government to consider ways and means of getting the acreage under wheat extended.  The suggestion I put forward offers a reasonable method of getting that increase.  It is desirable because the farmer whose land is inferior would not reap as great a benefit from an increased price per barrel as would the man with superior land. To give the man with inferior land some encouragement, I think that a direct subsidy is desirable.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="399" /> In respect of another aspect of this wheat question, the Minister seems to have been lacking.  We have never been able to ascertain exactly how much and is under wheat until the harvest season is virtually approaching.  The position is completely different in regard to beet.  Beet is grown under contract and the sugar factories and the Government know exactly how much land is being put under beet before the sowing season commences.  I strongly suggest to the Minister for Agriculture that it would be in the best interests not only of the farmers but of the nation generally that the wheat crop should be grown under contract.  It would then be possible for farmers, in the month of September or October before the wheat-growing season commences, to enter into a contract to grow whatever acreage of wheat they thought fit.  The Department of Agriculture would know in the month of October exactly how many acres had been contracted for.  If they found that the acreage was below that which would be required, there would be ample time to make provision for an increase.  As the position is at present, the Minister can never ascertain exactly how much wheat will be grown until it is too late to remedy the situation. That is why I so strongly recommend the contract system in regard to wheat-growing.  I think that the Minister should seriously consider the suggestion.</P>
    <P>The contract system would also have advantages for the farmer.  It would enable him to secure seeds, manure and, perhaps, an advance for harvesting the crop on the security of his contract.  It would enable many farmers who are in difficult circumstances to go into wheat-growing.  My colleague, Deputy Meighan, referred to the difficulty of getting credit for seed wheat.  We all know that there is a county council scheme under which seed is provided, but a great many farmers do not avail of that scheme. It is rather humiliating to a farmer to have to appeal to a neighbour to secure him in a matter of this kind. In view of the urgent need for the greatest possible acreage of wheat, I <Col N="400" /> think that a seed scheme similar to that which obtains in relation to beet should be adopted.  Wheat-growing is the most urgent question that faces us at present.  It is a question that will have to be tackled before this House meets again.  In view of its urgency, and of the urgency of other matters relating to agriculture, I suggest that the House should meet again, if possible, in September.</P>
    <P>Of even greater immediate importance is, perhaps, the question of harvesting this year's crop.  We have been very fortunate as regards weather during the sowing season, and the early growing season this year, but we cannot be so optimistic as to hope that we shall be similarly favoured during the harvest.  We hope for the best, but we have also, in the interests of the country, to make provision for the worst.  Never have the people, whether they live on the land or off the land, been forced to depend so much on the harvest and on the weather as at present.  Whatever can be done in the way of recruiting and making available additional labour for the harvest should be done now. Plans should be devised to rush to the relief and assistance of agriculture the largest possible number of men, particularly if the weather proves unfavourable. If it is necessary to release large numbers of men from the Army, it should be done, and if there is urgency, it should be found possible to draft men who are in the Army to the assistance of the farmers.  That suggestion should command the Minister's sympathetic support.  These are two urgent matters.  We have got to make provision for the entire sowing of next year's crop, and we have got to ensure that the farmer is assisted and supported not only in the growing of wheat, which is so urgently needed, but in the growing and extension of the potato crop.</P>
    <P>I think that the Minister made a rather serious slip yesterday if he is correctly reported in the Press.  I was not present when he made the reference. He said that the acreage under potatoes last year showed an increase on that of the previous year.</P>
    <Col N="401" />
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickCogan" hpid="Mr. Cogan Mr. Cogan">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cogan</NameTxt>
      <P>The fact is that there was a slight decrease in the acreage and a very marked reduction in the yield and in the quality of the potato crop.  We Want to secure that next year there will he a substantial increase in the acreage under potatoes. For that reason, I ask the Minister to consider how the British Government has dealt with this question and how they have increased the acreage under potatoes until they are able to provide sufficient potatoes for their entire population. That has been achieved by paying a direct subsidy of £10 per cent under potatoes.  In addition, the Minister should consider the necessity for securing that everybody who wishes to grow potatoes in the coming year will be able to get assistance and facilities in procuring seed.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When we have dealt with the urgent need of food for our people in this emergency, we must consider the pressing need of providing an ever-increasing supply of food for live stock. We are extending our acreage under tillage.  In bringing more and more land into cultivation there is a danger of deterioration of the land, and it is, therefore, desirable that the largest possible amount of winter feeding should be carried on on our farms. For that reason, it is desirable that farmers engaged in stall-feeding during the coming winter should get every encouragement.  The position during the past few years has been that it paid farmers better to sell their live stock at the fall of the year and avoid the expense and labour of feeding cattle in out-houses.  That must not be allowed to happen next winter.  Whatever assistance could be given to farmers who engage in hand-feeding stock should be given them. That is an urgent matter because we cannot extend tillage unless we extend the hand-feeding of live stock. A little encouragement given by the Department of Agriculture to those who concentrate upon the hand-feeding of live stock would have a very beneficial effect.  Even an assurance from the Minister or from whoever speaks on behalf of the Government <Col N="402" /> in this debate that something in that direction will be done would be an encouragement to farmers to plan for the hand-feeding and stall-feeding of cattle.</P>
    <P>I notice that since the Farmers' Party entered the Dáil there has been a rapid growth of land-mindedness amongest all Parties.  We had the Taoiseach taking us back to the green valley of his boyhood and introducing us to young Eamon de Valera when engaged in farming operations.  I believe that if this process of land-mindedness continues we will in a short time have some of the leaders coming into this House with hobnailed boots, and perhaps the hobnailed boots will have on them a little farmyard manure.  This land-mindedness on the part of all Parties is very welcome.  It shows that Deputies on all sides are beginning to think seriously about agriculture.  I believe that the entry of the Farmers' Party to this House has achieved a very useful effect in bringing the old Parties down to earth.  It will also have the effect of bringing the people down to earth, by making them realise that it is by the land the nation has to live, and that it is upon the development of the land the future of this nation depends.</P>
    <P>That brings me to the second question to which I intended to refer, the planning of the future of agriculture when this emergency has passed.  Recently I came across a book entitled <i>Food and Farming in Post-War Europe,</i> the authors of which are P. Lamartine Yates and D. Warriner. They deal with the conditions of agriculture generally in Europe.  They refer to the emergency and then review the position of agriculture in Europe for the past 20 years.  They also make recommendations for the post-war period.  One of the things that impressed me in this book was the appaling condition of poverty and destitution of many people engaged in agriculture during the past 20 years.  With the exception of Denmark and Holland, the majority of the European countries have carried on food production under very primitive and unremunerative conditions.  It is against <Col N="403" /> these countries that we have to compete.</P>
    <P>We should realise that in Europe the standard of living of those engaged in food production has been very low.  When we hear people talking about competing with other nations in the British market we have to ask ourselves this question: Are we going to sink our people down to the very low standard of living which prevails in many other countries?  I do not think that is a policy to which our farmers would submit.  In the post-war period I believe we must plan to maintain a standard of living in agriculture as good as the standard that has been achieved in industry, in commerce and in the professions through the operations of the trade unions and the protection of the law. People engaged in industry and in commerce have secured a standard of living much higher than those engaged in the production of food.  They have achieved that through the organised efforts of the workers and by legislation passed through this House and through the British Parliament.  We want to ensure that in future people engaged in agriculture will not be expected to accept a standard of living lower than that which prevails amongst other sections of the community. If we are to compete with other nations in world markets then I do not think we are at present facing up to that problem.  In the book to which I referred there is a chapter dealing with marketing to which I wish to draw the attention of the House.  They say:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We sketched out certain proposals which might improve the efficiency of food production and enable the peasant to attain a bigger output of better quality produce with less expenditure of effort.  But efforts at real improvement in this direction will be of little avail if the peasant is unable to secure satisfactory markets for what he produces.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;In the modern world it by no means follows that commodities which have been efficiently produced <Col N="404" /> can be sold for remunerative prices, even if consumers in the same country or in other countries urgently need them.  In the present chapter we shall be concerned with the home aspects of market security, and while we shall say a good deal about State planning and guarantees of stability it must be remembered throughout that more valuable even than security will be the expanding market generated by policies of full employment and adequate nutrition.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;There were two kinds of ups and downs which in pre-war days afflicted the agricultural producer. One was the whole complex of fluctuations in world prices.  Those whose output had to face competition, whether at home or abroad, with the produce of all five continents, found that over a period of years the price which they received rocketed about in a manner which bore no relation at all to their own output or to the demand of the consumers for whom they catered.  The price which the Rumanian peasant obtained for his wheat was determined by the rainfall in Manitoba or the psychological tone of Wall Street.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;But even those producers who enjoyed a sheltered market at home experienced annoying and, to a large extent, unnecessary fluctuations in prices.  Fruit-growers, for example, found that when nature provided a bumper crop the prices obtainable hardly covered the costs of picking, whereas in years when prices were really attractive they had no produce to sell.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That indicates serious thinking in regard to agricultural problems.  The paragraphs I read are, I might say, a re-hash of what I have been advocating in this House for the past five years.  I have advocated, not that the farmer should be put in a position to compete in world markets, but that the farmer and the agricultural producer should be guaranteed, regardless of what price prevailed in the world markets, a reasonable price for his produce and security of market.  That can be done, and until it is done we <Col N="405" /> cannot look forward to any expansion in agriculture.</P>
    <P>I remember that when Deputy Cosgrave was in power I was farming in a small way.  In 1929 I started farming on my own, and I found that every line of production in which I embarked was completely destroyed and ruined by the collapse in prices which prevailed in 1929, 1930 and 1931, which collapse in prices was still further emphasised during the régime of Deputy Cosgrave's successors in office.  Perhaps I might be permitted to call to Deputy Cosgrave's recollection that at a meeting that was held in the Town Hall in Carlow, in 1932, I advocated that the Cosgrave Government should do something to relieve agriculture, but his view on that occasion was that to do anything, or to attempt to do anything, to relieve the condition of agriculture would be to interfere with the ordinary economic laws of supply and demand&mdash;laws which, according to him, could not be interfered with&mdash;and that, whatever the farmers were suffering was due to causes over which he, as head of the Government, had no control.  That was the attitude which was adopted by the Cosgrave Government. They adopted an attitude of complete irresponsibility in regard to agricultural prices&mdash;if prices were bad in the world markets, then the farmer had to put up with them and take the consequences.</P>
    <P>Now, that is an attitude which I do not support, and which I never have supported.  It was, however, unfortunately, an attitude which was continued by our present Government, to a very great extent.  Only in connection with a small number of branches of farming was an effort made to protect the farmer or the producer against the effects of world depression.  In the case of the majority of the branches of farming, the more important branches of agriculture, not only was the farmer compelled, under the present Government, to bear the full effect of world depression but, in addition, he had to bear the cost of the international dispute with Great Britain&mdash;generally referred to as the economic war.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="406" /> Looking back over the mistakes of the past 20 years, it ought to be possible for the Minister for Agriculture and the Government to plan so as to ensure that in the future the entire home market will be reserved to the farmer, first of all.  There is no reason why we should import into this country any agricultural commodity which can be produced here.  The present war emergency has shown how we can make ourselves self-reliant to a great extent in regard to agricultural seeds. It has shown how we can supply very many of the essential foodstuffs which we formerly imported.  When this emergency is over, the question will have to be considered as to what our attitude will be in regard to those-agricultural commodities which were formerly imported.  We shall have to consider our attitude in regard to imported feeding stuffs, for instance. There is a simple test in regard to imported feeding stuffs&mdash;as to whether or not they should be allowed into the country&mdash;and that is to take, for example, the fact that it takes 7 cwts. of certain concentrated foodstuffs to produce 1 cwt. of meat.  By comparing the price of the 7 cwts. of feeding stuffs with the price for the 1 cwt. of meat thus produced, it will be possible to arrive at a decision as to-whether the importation of those feeding stuffs is justifiable or not.  That is a simple test, and it is the angle from which this problem must be approached.</P>
    <P>Now, having assured the farmer of the home market, in so far as it is possible to assure him of it, even in regard to wheat, I think it will be necessary to have a decision, in the post-war period, in regard to wheat.  I believe that the wise and prudent policy in regard to wheat is that if we do not produce 100 per cent. of our requirements, we should produce at least such a quantity as would enable us in a time of emergency to increase the amount up to 100 per cent.  No matter what kind of peace may be arrived at, at the end of this war, I do not think it would be wise for us to bank on being entirely free from international complications, and under no circumstances <Col N="407" /> should the acreage under wheat, in my opinion, be allowed to fall below 50 per cent. of the nation's requirements. That would leave a sufficient margin to enable us to deal with the nation's needs in a time of emergency. In addition to that, it should be possible to arrange for the storage of large quantities of home-grown grain, and even of foreign grain.  It is desirable to have granaries established, under State or public control, so as to ensure that sufficient food supplies for man and beast would be provided.</P>
    <P>Next comes the question of planning in regard to those commodities of which we have an exportable surplus. I do not agree, and I have never agreed, that the price of any commodity of which we have an exportable surplus should be allowed to be depressed to the extent to which that commodity might be depressed in the external markets.  We should not, and cannot, in the future, allow our internal economy and our whole price structure to be disrupted by anything that may happen in external markets or by any depression that may be brought about in other countries.  Our producers, whether they produce for the home market or for the export market, must be protected in regard to prices. Ways and means must be found to deal with such a situation.  If it is necessary to export, as it will be found necessary to export, and if the price is not sufficient to cover the cost of production of the goods we are exporting, then ways and means must be found to supplement that export price.  We must remember that the agricultural producer who produces for export is really producing for the home market indirectly, inasmuch as he is producing a commodity which can be exchanged for some other commodity which the home consumer requires.  Therefore, he is as much entitled to protection as the man who produces directly for the home market.  Of course, I know that the home market can also be very extensively increased by providing a higher standard of living for our people.  If our standard of living is raised, there is no reason why our people should not be able to use a <Col N="408" /> great deal of the dairy produce, bacon and other things, which in pre-war years were exported.</P>
    <P>I think there is need for serious planning in regard to agriculture. Since agriculture is the basis upon which our whole economic system is founded, there is need for planning in regard to our whole economic structure. I hold that our planning should take the line of ensuring that, come what may, the man who produces essential goods, either for the home market or export, will be guaranteed at least as high a standard of living as the man who sweeps the streets or performs other duties of that kind, which are, of course, also essential. Even now, notwithstanding the display of irresponsibility to which we were treated in this House last week, would it not be possible, in order to get our economic problems solved, to get all Parties in this House to unite in the form of an economic council representative of all Parties here, similar to the Defence Council, which is dealing with matters of national defence? Surely the problem facing our people in regard to the provision of employment for our population, the provision of employment for our men who are in the Army, and for our workers who are now in Great Britain, and the problem of carrying this country through the difficult transition period after the emergency, are matters on which all Parties should be prepared to co-operate to the same extent as they have been prepared to co-operate in dealing with military dangers.</P>
    <P>I think that an economic council, representative of all Parties in this House, and meeting occasionally as the National Defence Council meets today, would be of immense value.  Unlike a meeting in this House, the meetings of that council would not be open to the public, and it would not be necessary for political Parties to indulge in the schoolboyish pranks which other Opposition Parties indulged in last week.  We would have no Press representatives present; we would be able to sit down and talk over the difficulties which face the nation; we would be able to exchange <Col N="409" /> ideas, put forward suggestions, and help in achieving security and prosperity for agriculture, thereby securing prosperity and stability for the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamTCosgrave" hpid="Mr. W.T. Cosgrave Mr. W.T. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. W.T. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I think that if the Deputy who has just sat down had examined the economic situation here, particularly in regard to agriculture, more from the point of view of the returns that are published than from the point of view of the information that is given in Government documents, he would not have committed himself to the very foolish statement he has just made.  It is not a part of the business of a legislator here to bring before the House his own shortcomings with regard to any speculations in which he may indulge, either in agriculture or in business.  What we have to consider here is: what is the situation for the whole of the country.  One of the besetting sins of the last 15 or 16 years in this country is that a few people, very glib of tongue, very persuasive, having almost immeasurable time at their disposal, have been going around sabotaging the public mind with regard to matters upon which their knowledge was very limited indeed. There was, in the world generally, a very serious economic situation from the end of 1928 down to 1931.  Not, I suppose, within the memory of living man has there been such an economic catastrophe affecting world conditions as there was in that time.  The genius of statesmen, the knowledge of economists, and the co-operation of all classes in endeavouring to find some means of preventing this catastrophe to mankind, were ineffective even in the most wealthy of the countries&mdash; perhaps more ineffective in those countries which had practically measureless resources than in some of the smaller countries.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The countries which the League of Nations reported as having best met the storm of that economic collapse was this country, and, I think, Denmark. Why was that?  Because the policy which had been pursued here from the time this State was established was a definite constructive <Col N="410" /> policy in regard to agriculture.  It was not any of the nonsense to which we have been listening here for the last few days or for the last 15 years.  It was a policy designed to meet any and every circumstance that could arise. One of the reasons why the economic blizzard did not affect this country as it affected others was that our agricultural economy was based upon live stock and live stock products and not upon the growing of cereals.  In those countries where there was wheat growing, maize production, and the lower forms of agricultural activity, the slump was greater and the losses were much more pronounced than they were here.  I do not know whether the Deputy has been following the trend of popular thought in Germany since the war started.  I imagine that, if he had, he would realise that there they have divided agricultural production into two classes.  There is what they call the lower order of agricultural production, which refers to the growing of cereals, and there is the other&mdash; live stock and live-stock products.  The intention, if they were successful in the war, was to persuade their neighbours to indulge in the lower forms of production, and to keep for themselves the more profitable ones.</P>
    <P>I have gone into the figures of our agricultural sales here over a great number of years, starting with the year 1927.  I will give the reasons for taking that year.  Up to 1927 a very considerable proportion of the seats in this House was untenanted.  Deputies opposite had not made up their minds to shed Republican principles, and in 1927, when they entered this House, we had what they call normal political conditions.  Allowing for the cost of every item of agricultural production which came into this country out of the money that we received for our agricultural exports, there was in the year 1927 a balance of almost £13,250,000 to the credit of our agriculturists. In 1928 the credit balance was almost £15,750,000.  In 1929&mdash;to which the Deputy referred as the year in which he lost money, the year in which he did not see any future for agriculture&mdash;the balance was £15,636,000.  In 1930 it was £16,329,000. <Col N="411" /> In 1931, the year of the slump, it was £13,425,000.  I will not weary the House with the exact figures in those cases, but I will give some which are of interest and which present the case in tabloid form.  Having paid for all agricultural imports to this country, the average income over those five years was £14,866,000 odd.  What was it in the succeeding seven years?  In the succeeding seven years we had put into practice the policy which the Deputy recommends.  Neither during this election nor during those years have I ever heard of any attempt made by the Deputy or his Party to put forward an agricultural economic policy.</P>
    <P>This policy of giving subsidies for this, that and the other thing is all moonshine.  As an immediate expedient, it is something that has a steadying effect but as a regular policy for the country it is futile as is the policy of tariffs to, build up industry, to promote industrial production or to give industrial employment in the country. The average income for the seven years in which we had this so-called change-over policy was £6,422,000 as against the £14,866,000 to which I have referred.  There is the answer to all the statements made by the Leader of that Party that they had won the economic war.  If they did, they lost the peace and it cost much more to win it than even the losing of the peace.  There was the greatest blunder that a country could have committed.  Not only did the Government of this country pay every penny that was in dispute but they paid much more and at the end of the period we entered into an agreement &mdash;we were bound to enter into it, whether by duress or otherwise&mdash;under which our agricultural produce was put on a lower plane on the market which had been open to us than it had enjoyed prior to entering into that contract. Not only that, but one of the great achievements accomplished by Griffith and Collins, in securing fiscal autonomy and sovereignty in this country, was completely undermined. We had to barter portion of it in order <Col N="412" /> to get a lower position on the British agricultural market than we had enjoyed there before.  I hope that when Deputies are dealing with a matter of this sort in future they will at least pay some attention to the facts.  They are there on record.  They can be found easily and if anybody has any difficulty in getting them I shall give him every assistance in my power.  At any rate before we get to the point at which we have got to plan an agricultural economy we should be sure of our ground.  Let us know where we are starting from and then let us map out where we are going.</P>
    <P>Listening to the Minister for Agriculture on this Vote yesterday I was inclined to feel depressed, but having 11 years' experience of the work of the Minister, the thought occurred to me that there was no use in getting depressed.  We shall have to grow up even though the growing process in the case of the Minister occupies a much longer time than we had expected. The Minister compares the events of the last few years with those of the ten or 11 years prior to his coming into office.  Apparently he must have been satisfied that there was something good in these 11 years or he would not have bothered about them.  To take one example.  During the last 12 months the Minister introduced a Creamery Re-organisation Bill.  When the original measure of that character was introduced here by the late Mr. Hogan it did not meet with anything like the same reception which the Minister's Bill received. Why?  Because at that time there was political capital to be made out of the measure.  There was an opportunity given to the members of that Party to go around from place to place, where there were redundant creameries, and to tell the people that the policy of the Government was to make it more difficult for them to carry on their business, that the closing down of a creamery here and the opening of one a couple of miles away meant interfering with their amenities and the convenience with which they could carry on their business.  We have moved away from all that now.  I think we have got away from that particular phase of idiocy, and we can <Col N="413" /> proceed in a more sane fashion than in those days.</P>
    <P>The Minister compared the output of butter from the creameries with that of some years ago, but he did not take into account the butter produced by farmers at that time.  If he does, he will find that the output is down by 100,000 cwts. as compared with ten or 11 years ago.  Assuming that he is perfectly correct and that the output of the creameries has increased by 8,000 cwts. over some years ago, is that anything to be greatly proud of? The policy laid down by the late Mr. Hogan aimed at the extension of the creamery business.  The intention was to increase the production of butter from the creameries, and if the Minister has achieved that purpose even, to the extent of 8,000 cwts. over ten or 11 years ago, has not something been done?  According to the Minister's own statement down in Cork some time ago he saw no future for the dairying industry.</P>

      <P>Reference was made here yesterday to the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  It was stated here, I do not know from what side of the House, that the Pigs and Bacon Commission or Committee was set up by reason of new marketing conditions on the British market.  I thought there was a better reason given at the time than that.  I hope that Deputies are not mixing up two particular terms, the Pigs and Bacon Commission or Committee or the Pigs Marketing Board. In any case whatever body was set up, was not it stated in this House that the real reason for establishing it was that there had been over a long period extraordinary fluctuations in the price of pigs, that people went into production on a large scale when prices were high and that when the price dropped they went out?  Again when there was a small production of pigs, the price went up.  It was to try to equate, in some measure at any rate, these extraordinary fluctuations that it was decided to set up the Pigs and Bacon Commission.  That was the reason given, as the Minister is aware.</P>

They had sent 600,000 cwts., and he expected before the year was out that they would send an equivalent quantity for the second six months.  In that particular case, the large exports which they sent closed us out of the cattle trade over there, and limited this country to a smaller quota of both store and fat cattle on the British market at that time.  That was the reason for the changes in respect of more orderly marketing, but they also arose out of those agreements in Ottawa, and it was the first time in our history in connection with the export of agricultural produce for the British market that any limitation had been put on the quantity we could sell.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>But they were on a different basis.  I would like the Deputy to realise that bacon was on one basis, and that the others were on a different basis.  As a matter of fact, we were excluded from regulation as regard beef and mutton, but included as regards bacon.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Does the Minister not remember that the quotas of fat cattle were lowered and that we were put <Col N="416" /> upon a 50 per cent. basis?  In the last year of office of my Government we exported 300,000 head and they went down to 150,000 in the years afterwards. Let us exclude the British market altogether, and remember that the purpose of the commission was to regulate the prices over a period.  It was done in this fashion: the commission was to consider what would be a fair price.  If the market prices were below it, they would borrow or raise money and they would pay in excess of the market price to keep it on the level.  Later when the prices went up, they would still give only the level price, and they would repay whatever sums they had expended in the earlier period to make up the price to what we will call an equitable level by reason of the savings they would effect under the new dispensation.  Very good. What happened?  For a long time, the price remained as it was, and then, after a while, some money was saved by this commission to be used when the price of bacon would go down. How was it employed subsequently? My recollection is&mdash;I put it no further than that&mdash;that the Pigs and Bacon Commission got permission from the Minister to allow them to reimburse themselves.  At that time there were some bacon curers on it.  My recollection is that that was how they used it. In any case, the sum and substance of the establishment of the commission was to ensure that they would avoid fluctuation in the price of pigs and that in order to keep the farmers in production, they would pay a fair price. The aim was to give the people who produced the pigs a sufficient sum of money to enable them to keep in production. After five or six or seven years how does it look?  The pig figures were never lower in our lives.</P>

      <P>&ldquo;During the two years of war, the Minister said, the dairy farmer has had to be subsidised and for the present that subsidy must continue. They could only mark time until the war was over and see what conditions were like then.</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Dr. Ryan said we might be compelled to discontinue some of the exports that before the war had become uneconomic.  The elimination of the export of dairy products, if such a course should eventually become necessary, would not be so disastrous to farming economy as might at first sight be feared, he said.  If, on the other hand, we decided after the war to continue in the export business, we could only do so by reducing the standard of living of our agriculturists or by reducing costs of production.&rdquo;</P>

      <P>From what I have learned from people in the business, they are not satisfied that we are getting the best out of the land.  A man who raises pigs more extensively than any other farmer who raises pigs&mdash;not on our side of the Border&mdash;informed me that they had brought out grasses <Col N="419" /> in England, and he was trying them in Ireland, where I believe there is better soil, which would put up to 3 lbs. per diem weight on animals.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>What are we doing to find out if anything like that is possible on our soil?  I am not the Minister for Agriculture and I think it is scarcely up to form to ask me what are my suggestions.  I say there is the line, start from it and go on building up our agricultural production.  That is the way to do it.  The Minister has experts, but I do not know if they are bothering their heads about things of this sort.  To my mind, we are not getting the full value of production in this country, and if the Minister devoted attention to that problem instead of to the making of political speeches it would be much better.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>It is a waste of time. I think you have to wait a little until people really learn.  But, apparently, the most important speech that can be made is to tell the people they have got freedom and then to warn the people that if they do not elect a particular Party there will be destruction. That is a new type of freedom.  Does the Minister understand it&mdash;tell the people they are free but that their freedom is limited by the way that they vote?</P>

      <P>While those philosophies prevail in this country, I do not see what progress will be made. People were not cowed before.  If they can be cowed now after they got their <Col N="420" /> freedom, then they got their freedom too soon, or, maybe, too late.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>However, we are dealing with agriculture.  What has the Minister to say about agriculture? The Germans say we feed our cattle on the most expensive diet in the country, on beef.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>That is right.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Could we not improve on that by giving those farmers the best information available for them from all sources, and any source, as to how they could make their industry more profitable than it is to-day?  I do not believe you can do that by a system of subsidies.  If we are going to subsidise agriculture and subsidise other industries in this country, how is it going to be done?  Is there not going to be something wrong in the whole business?  The real point is to provide our people with gainful occupations out of which they can make a profit.  If that is not done, then sooner or later you are going to have a crash.  I am quite sure, whatever mistakes the Minister may make, he would not like to see that occurring.</P>
      <P>Getting away from that aside, it must be admitted that the pigs and bacon business has gone down.  A silly statement was made from the opposite side when it was said that we had criticised the feeding of pigs with maize.  It was suggested that we had said that you could not have crushed oats, barley and other commodities mixed with maize.  We never said anything of the sort.  We said it was not the best method of feeding.  The people raising pigs know themselves what is best Under the admixture scheme, it now takes three weeks longer to fatten a pig and it costs £1 more.  If there is more money in that method, I would like to know where it is.  It is certainly not there for the farmer.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>The experiments do not prove what the Deputy says.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Whether they do or not, the fact is that people have practically <Col N="421" /> gone out of pigs.  I suggest to the Minister that he should examine the matter and see if there is any money in it at all.  It is an extraordinary thing that in this country, which was celebrated for the production of its pigs and bacon, we now have not got enough bacon for ourselves.  At one period our exports in pigs and bacon brought £5,000,000 a year into the country.  A foolish recommendation was made here some years ago to prevent the importation of bacon into the country so as to ensure the market for our own farmers.  When we did stop imports how did we stand with regard to the consumption of bacon?  We used to consume 800,000 cwts. a year.  That figure went down to 600,000 cwts.  Do not tell me that the 600,000 cwts. of our own bacon is better value for the people than the 800,000 cwts., because there are people who cannot afford to buy Irish bacon, but who could afford to buy the imported bacon.  Why we should put up the cost of living on them, and prevent them from getting certain meats when they could not afford to pay for others, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">
      <NameTxt>Dr. Ryan</NameTxt>
      <P>It was your Government that did that.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>I know that, but the Minister for Agriculture at the time told them that it would not improve or affect in any way the bacon industry, or pig production, in this country. Of course, we had to have that proven to us.  I was informed by a man who was down in the Minister's constituency that there was bacon in the shop windows, sometime about 1930 or 1931, selling at about 4d. or 5d. per lb. Of course, some of our modern economists would say that was a terrible thing, but there are people who can only afford to pay 4d. or 5d. a lb. for bacon. They cannot afford to pay 2/-.  It does not follow from that that if you get 6-lbs. for 2/- the person who will pay 2/- per lb. will buy a single lb.  for 2/-. By doing that you interfere with particular phases of our economy: (1) the person on a small wage, and (2) you give a better chance to the country to sell dear and buy cheap.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I do not know whether the Minister <Col N="422" /> is going to bend his attention towards bringing back the pig industry.  I think it would be well worth while doing that, but it is not going to be done from his office witli experts.  This year's Estimate includes a sum of about £10,000 for regulating the pig industry here.  The figure was £20,000 last year.  It is the pig producers who will have to pay that.</P>
    <P>You know that you could regulate traffic with perfect ease if you had Gárda officers on duty at the points where the lamps operate for the purpose of arresting any person who crossed the line before the lamp indicated to him that he should cross.  It is the same in regard to regulating the pig industry.  The fact is that we have too many regulators and too few pigs. If that £20,000, spent on regulating the pig industry, were spent in buying feeding stuffs for the pigs it would be far better.</P>
    <P>The Minister made reference to the improved situation, due entirely to the war, but what does it amount to? The figures show an income of £76,000,000 in respect of the total output of agricultural products for a year.  That includes, in respect of turf and timber, a sum of £4,500,000 over the figure for 1929-30.  The inclusion of the latter figure under agricultural production was a pure accident.  It was included because the use of turf in 1929-30 was almost exclusively employed in agricultural households.  If you deduct the £4,500,000 from the total, you are left with £71,500,000. The advance in prices accounts for about one-seventh of that sum, and when you make that deduction you are down below the 1929-30 mark.  Certain economists opposite thought that was not good enough for this country.  It would be a great matter for them if they had been able to maintain it during all their time.</P>
    <P>There are many ways in which it would be possible to improve agricultural production in the country. The first is that you must employ scientific methods to increase production. Secondly, you cannot expect an industry like agriculture to bear the increase in rates.  The rates on agricultural <Col N="423" /> land have almost doubled in the last 11 years.  In addition, you require to see what extra accommodation is needed on farms so as to make the business of farming a more profitable one than it is to-day.  You also require to extend electric current to our farms.  It would be well if the Minister considered what capital sum would be required to do that, so that farmers might take advantage of electric current.</P>
    <P>I agree with a good deal of the criticism that was made here yesterday by Deputy Dillon.  I think it is a deplorable thing that during the bad years, 1932 to 1938&mdash;I suppose the worst years that the country has experienced since the time of Cromwell &mdash;that taxes or tariffs should have been placed on the importation of phosphates.  If you require to improve or benefit the manure works in the country, give them a subsidy, but whatever you do in that respect, let the raw materials of the agricultural industry&mdash;the Cinderella of our industries&mdash;be free of tax.  Let them get their chance.</P>
    <P>Similarly with regard to machinery. If you require to benefit the firms making, agricultural machinery here, do it by subsidy, but do not put the cost on the industry of agriculture. People make the mistake sometimes of saying that we depend entirely on it.  We do not, but we could not do without it, and there ought to be no head-on collision between the interests of agriculture and the interests of other industries in the State.  They are all complementary, one to the other.  In the best of times, on the most prosperous farms in the country there are four or five sons and a couple of daughters.  They cannot all remain on the land, and employment must be found in some other direction for the larger numbers of the household. We have to bear that in mind, but, notwithstanding all that, for the last 50 or 60 years and perhaps for even a longer period, agriculture has been in a poor condition all over the world.  In the case of Great Britain until the war, although they had <Col N="424" /> £1,000,000,000 invested in agriculture, and made something like £100,000,000 per annum out of the industry, their primary industries, that is, manufacturing and other concerns of the sort, were of so much greater importance from the point of view of wealth and employment that they neglected their agriculture.  In America some time ago a cartoon appeared in one of the principal papers circulating in New York or Chicago of a farmer on all fours, with bankers, politicians, business men, professional men, and so on on his back, and their weight was put down in dollars as compared with the amount he was making out of his business.</P>
    <P>I think that no greater mistake could have been made by this Government than the imposition of these burdens on agriculture during the last few years.  If there was available to them the information which was available to Ministries in other parts of the world to the effect that a war was impending, it was surely, their bounden duty to get in phosphates.  The Minister gave us figures relating to the production of wheat.  He said that it was about 18 cwts. to the acre.  According to the Banking Commission Report, in the years 1932 to 1936 the yield was 20.4 cwts., so we have gone down.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesRyan" hpid="Dr. Ryan Dr. Ryan">

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>We are down in that respect.  I am not without hope that we shall learn after a while to concentrate upon endeavouring to make this industry more profitable for the people in it, notwithstanding these last 11 years, but I have not got that hope from what we have heard from the benches opposite or from any of the speeches made.  I am not without hope that they will learn that an agricultural policy for this country is rather a mixed affair.  We have live stock and <Col N="425" /> live-stock raisers around Dublin, Kildare and Meath: we have the tillage farmers of the Midlands: we have the farmers of West Cork, who are mixed farmers and the hardest workers in the world: we have the dairying farmers of Limerick, Tipperary and Clare: and we have the mixed farming of Wexford and Louth.  Not the same policy will suit all these, but whatever policy suits them, to criticise the importation of cheap feeding stuffs and manures is wrong.  You ought to try to enable the farmers to farm even more land than they have.  That was the policy of the late Mr. Hogan.  He himself had a farm of about 250 acres, but he farmed practically 400 acres by reason of the importation of cheap feeding stuffs from the ends of the earth which he sent out as live stock and live-stock products.  I am not at all satisfied that an economic council will settle this question.  I do not think politicians will settle anything and I think it was a mistake ever to mix up politics and agricultural production.  Until we get away from politics and get down to business, the position is not likely to improve, and I am satisfied that it must improve.</P>

      <P>I will make it as simple as possible for the Deputy and speak in words of one syllable, if I can.  We have been given a new index of national prosperity, an index by which Deputy Cosgrave proposes to judge the effectiveness of economic policy. What is that index?&mdash;the surplus in the value of agricultural exports over agricultural imports.  If there is a big surplus, we are prosperous; if there is a small surplus, we are ruined.  We were prosperous during his régime because there was a big excess in the value of agricultural exports over the value of agricultural imports, and we were ruined during Fianna Fáil's régime because we had a small excess. Is that not the index of national prosperity which Deputy Cosgrave has just given us?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>What was the purpose of reading out these figures?  Why read out the difference in the value of agricultural exports and agricultural imports in each of these years unless he was proposing to prove something by doing so?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="" hpid="Mr. Cosgrave Mr. Cosgrave">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Cosgrave</NameTxt>
      <P>Because the consumption of the remainder was practically level over the period.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If there was any purpose at all in reading out the figures, if there was any sense in the Deputy's remarks in relation to the figures, it supports my contention that the Deputy was giving us an index of prosperity, that the greater the excess in the value of agricultural exports over the value of agricultural imports, the greater was our prosperity.  That is what he set out to prove.  He is perhaps beginning to see the fallacy in the <Col N="427" /> contention now, and I am sure that many other Deputies of the Fine Gael Party saw it before this.  Some of them would never see it.</P>
      <P>If we take Deputy Cosgrave's general contention and reduce it to particular commodies, we will see the fallacy very easily.  Suppose we produce 600,000 or 700,000 cwts. of creamery butter every year and instead of consuming that creamery butter ourselves, we export it and import for our own consumption foreign margarine, then we are prosperous by that standard. The greater our exports of creamery butter and the greater our imports of margarine to make up for the creamery butter, the greater our prosperity.  The cheaper the margarine we import, the more prosperous we are.  It is a very simple calculation. We can produce an enormous excess in the value of agricultural exports over the value of agricultural imports if we do not confine ourselves to butter.  If we send out our fat cattle and beef and import frozen Argentine beef in substitution, if we send out good bacon and import cheap bacon, if we take every agricultural product we produce&mdash;and our main strength in the export market for agricultural goods is the quality of our goods&mdash;and export them, importing for our own use cheap substitutes, we are prosperous. That is Deputy Cosgrave's idea of prosperity.  That is the index he has just given us.  Does it appeal to the members of the Fine Gael Party?  Are they satisfied that that should be the aim of Government&mdash; to produce that statistical result?</P>

      <P>So far as the Deputy is concerned, he is, of course, allergic to facts.  He has proved that in the past, but he is, I think, exceedingly foolish in committing himself to statements which can be confuted by facts.  I have often in this House warned Deputies opposite to avoid making statements that cannot be supported by facts.  The greatest tragedy in political <Col N="428" /> life is to see some fanciful theory brought face to face with facts.  The theory disappears always if the fact does not agree with it.  The Deputy always avoids facts.  One of the most obvious facts in the statistics published by the various Government Departments is that our consumption of agricultural home-produced commodities has increased consistently year by year since Fianna Fáil came into office.</P>

      <P>I see.  O.K.  We have endeavoured to secure that a higher proportion of our total agricultural production would be consumed at home.  We have endeavoured to secure that because we realised that it is only in the home market we could give security to our farmers&mdash;security of sale and economic price.  In the export market we had to take any price we could get.  Deputy Cogan suggested that it was undesirable for Irish farmers that the export price should determine the home price.  That is a natural result where there is an exportable surplus.  Where the export price was entirely uneconomic, we tried to remedy the situation by effecting <Col N="430" /> arrangements designed to secure that the all-over average return for farmer would be satisfactory.  We did it in relation to butter.  Deputy Cosgrave referred to the situation in which we found the creamery industry. It was in a hell of a mess.  Everybody knows that.  I think the first legislative proposals brought to this Dáil by the Fianna Fáil Government were those designed to stabilise dairy produce prices.  Does the Deputy remember that?</P>

The Deputies representing creamery constituencies did not.  They were conveniently absent from the House when the vote was taken.  It was the policy of his Party to oppose it, and that measure was designed to secure that the total return to milk producers would be as adequate as we could make it, even though we could not get more for our exportable surplus in the British market than an entirely uneconomic return.  In order to try to offset that, we brought up the price in the home market, and we also provided out of national funds a subsidy to the industry.  Does the Deputy remember what was said about it? Deputy Cogan remembers quite well.</P>

That is clear.  There can be no certainty if we depend for our prosperity on agricultural exports. We must endeavour to secure that we will export produce of some kind sufficient to offset the cost of the products we must import but we can have no certainty that it is going to be a profitable undertaking for us.

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>That index, if it operated in the manner in which the Deputy suggested, could in fact record prosperity at a time when we would be very badly off indeed.  It could, on the other hand, show us to be very poorly off at a time when we would be enjoying real prosperity.  It is much better for us to try to secure that the products of our farms will, if possible, be consumed at home.  We can at home, at least, so arrange matters that the producers will get a fair return, will get a price for their products which will pay the cost of production and yield a fair margin for themselves.  Is not that so?  We cannot do that elsewhere.</P>
      <P>If we have to export, we may have to do it at a loss, a loss which we can spread over the whole community; it need not necessarily be borne by the individual producers of the exported products.  That, I think, is the fundamental difference between the Fine Gael and the Fianna Fáil Parties&mdash; that our conception of national prosperity is people better off in Ireland, a general improvement in the standard of living, not merely a statistical return which shows that there is a movement of money in and out of the banks.

      <P>On the contrary.  Take any particular industry and you will find that the record shows that what I have said is right.  I am talking about industrial employment, the employment of persons in the production of goods by industrial processes. During our period of office we were not as successful as we had hoped originally.  We ran into difficulties. We had not foreseen the impact of the economic war on our economic situation.  The opposition offered by Fine Gael and various other circumstances which arose hampered our efforts.  But we did succeed in establishing a number of industries which did not exist before.  We did succeed in procuring the erection of a very large number of factories, and the putting into employment of some 50,000 or 60,000 workers in excess of the number employed previously. That is not futility.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>If the Deputy takes the total additional number put into employment, he will find it was larger, but in the manufacturing industries the number of persons employed had at least increased by some 50,000.  It is true that we could have done more if circumstances had been more favourable. When in 1938 we succeeded in bringing the economic war to a successful conclusion, we thought we were in a position in which it would be possible for us to secure that the full fruits of our economic policy would be secured.  We felt then that at long last we were free of the shackles put on our efforts and that we could go forward to the full implementation of that policy in order to procure the results which we knew that policy was capable of achieving.  Instead, we ran into the world war, a situation which handicapped our efforts, in fact, reversed our progress in many respects.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But this war will end sometime. When this war ends, we will have to face again this question of a national economic policy, and what policy will produce the best results.  The best results are represented by a well-fed, well-clothed and well-housed people here, not by statistics.  How are we to do that?  Do Deputies contemplate that the new international conditions will be so fundamentally different from pre-war conditions that none of the policies that were debated in the pre-war period will apply?  No one can forecast with any certainty what the post-war world will be like.  It is reasonable to assume that it will not be so different that the principles and policies of the pre-war period will be inapplicable.  We believe that the particular policy that we applied in the pre-war period, and which produced tangible results of real benefit to our country, will be equally applicable afterwards.  It is easy to talk about the handicap placed on farmers by the effort made to establish various industries, but what sort of a mess would <Col N="436" /> the country be in if they had not been established?  Do you think we can still go to the ends of the earth for spades and shovels?  Deputy Dillon spoke as if it were a monstrous thing to conceive the idea of Irishmen in Ireland making spades and shovels when we could buy them elsewhere.  Is there any reason why we should not make spades and shovels here, or why our industrial activities should be confined to those, and why we should not have factories established and workers occupied in them making agricultural machinery?  It is all very well to talk of restrictions being placed upon the importation of manufactured fertilisers in the pre-war period.  It is not true to say that there was a tax on fertilisers.  The very reverse was true. There was a bounty paid out of State funds to make cheap fertilisers available to Irish farmers.  The existing factories are capable of manufacturing them if we could procure the raw materials and, to an increasing extent, we are getting the raw materials from our own soil.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>Practically nothing was received, if the Deputy will look up the figures.  Before the war we had plans for the establishment of a plant to produce nitrogenous fertilisers.  I know the opposition that would have been offered by the Fine Gael Party to the establishment of such a plant.  They are rather sorry now, as sorry as I am, that these plans did not materialise. In fact, they were upset by the war situation.  I think the contract with the Skoda works at Prague, for the erection of the factory here, was signed only a few weeks before the <Col N="437" /> German armies occupied that city, and that made the fulfilment of the contract by that firm impossible.  Would it not be better for this country if our industrial policy in relation to that undertaking had been brought into operation earlier and tangible results secured&mdash;if we had in this country, not merely factories capable of producing superphosphates, but also nitrogenous fertilisers?  Deputies are pressing every day of the week that we should do everything we can to secure supplies of sulphate of ammonia from Great Britain.  It is not possible to get increased supplies from that country.  Not merely have they not enough for themselves, but it is a munition of war and we cannot get it. But we can reach a situation in which we can produce it ourselves from raw materials in this country.</P>
      <P>Every single proposal for an industry from 1932 onwards was opposed by the Deputies opposite.  Is it not a good thing that these industries are here now, that their efforts to prevent their establishment were not successful; that these industries are there not merely to give us the goods we need. but also because they strengthen the economic organisation of the country which would be incapable of withstanding the strain of the war situation without them?  We can at some stage debate here this policy of free trade, in which Deputy Dillon and Deputy Cosgrave believe, and the policy of industrialisation through protection to which this Government adheres.</P>
    </Speaker>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy can speak for himself.  Deputy Dillon certainly did.  Deputy Cosgrave's remarks were as indecisive as they usually are and it is hard to attach any real meaning to them, but they appeared to support the views expressed by Deputy Dillon. The war has produced difficulties.  It has made it impossible to pursue the policy that we were operating before the war.  It has, in fact, reversed our progress.  Deputies, having left the cross-roads, coming in here must face this problem in a constructive way in <Col N="438" /> relation to the facts.  I was amazed to hear Deputy Davin speak as he did about the twin problems of unemployment and emigration.  What solution did he offer or attempt to offer? Housing.  Does any Deputy of the Labour Party think, or does Deputy Davin believe, that it is possible for us to proceed now with a housing programme upon the scale on which we carried it on before the war?  Do they not realise that there are required, for the construction of houses, materials which we cannot get and which there is no chance of getting in present circumstances?</P>
      <P>There have been references to the modernisation of our transport system. We would all like to embark upon that, but will Deputy Davin tell me how it could be done without steel, without metals of any kind, without any of the materials that would be required in the construction of transport equipment?  It is not good enough merely to come in here and talk about the undesirability of emigration.  The advantage of preventing emigration by giving our workers employment at home has been pointed out.  That is a contention with which we all agree, but has any Deputy given an indication of how it is going to be done?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>When Deputy Davin proceeded to reel off the list of works upon which he wanted to see Irish people employed, I was hoping that some new idea would, even by accident, have crept in.  Not at all.  We had references to afforestation, drainage, land reclamation&mdash;all the old proposals which have been debated here again and again.  Deputies who were members of the last Dáil know precisely what the Government have done, and what difficulties prevent an expansion of the programmes already embarked upon.  The lack of such a simole commodity as rabbit wire, which we cannot under present circumstances procure, makes it impossible for us to embark upon new forestry schemes. The areas which could be planted depend, of course, primarily on the supply of seedlings, which we cannot get in sufficient quantities, and even <Col N="439" /> the mere fencing-in of the young forest trees becomes a matter of impossibility under existing conditions.  I may say that there is a great deal being done in the matter of afforestation&mdash;all the work that can be done is being done in preparation for a post war development when the materials, that must be procured from abroad, will be obtainable.  There is very little more we can do at the moment.</P>
    <P>We set up a drainage commission which produced a comprehensive report, a report which has been accepted by the Government.  The legislation to implement the findings of that commission is being prepared, but every Deputy knows that many of the projects contemplated for the improvement of drainage are held up by inability to get materials of one kind or another&mdash;machinery, tools, equipment &mdash;and even fuel.  We are up against real difficulties, and we will not be able to surmount those difficulties merely by talking.  We cannot effect much by just wishing them out of existence. There is a scarcity of fuel, fuel-oil, petrol, kerosene, and coal. Does any Deputy believe that there is some course open to the Government which would make it possible to get additional supplies of petroleum products?</P>
    <P>If we are to have a large-scale productive programme of such dimensions that the emigration of our workers will cease, we must have not only the materials with which to work, but fuel to drive our vehicles and machinery. I read recently in British newspapers that munition factories in England were closed down because of a scarcity of coal.  Does any Deputy think that in such circumstances the British are going to give us additional supplies of coal?  We are getting substantial quantities of coal, but they are barely sufficient to keep our railway services, our electricity undertakings and our gas undertakings going; all the coal we are getting is required for these essential enterprises that cannot operate without coal.  Every day in the week we read of the destruction of oil wells in various parts of the <Col N="440" /> world and we read of the claims of belligerents that they have sunk so many tankers.  Modern armies eat petrol.  We have no sources of supply and, even if we had sources, we have no ships to carry the fuel to our shores. We have to depend on the goodwill of belligerent powers to get supplies to maintain essential services here.</P>
    <P>We cannot have an industrial expansionist policy under such circumstances. If there are ways and means by which we can put large numbers of people into useful activities, there is no reason why it should not be done. There is no financial difficulty&mdash;the finances are available.  There are large sums voted every year for the financing of public works.  If Deputies have concrete and useful suggestions as to how the supply difficulties can be overcome, let them produce those suggestions. I ask and I urge Deputies to do so; I plead with them, in the interests of the unemployed, to get away from generalities and to pool their ideas. Let them not be afraid that their ideas will be subject to hostile criticism. Any Deputy who is in a position to produce constructive ideas will be met in a constructive way by the Government. Useful ideas capable of being put into operation will be welcomed. Of course, ideas submitted by Deputies may, on examination, prove to be impracticable, but they will be gladly received and fairly examined.</P>
    <P>Our policy in relation to the temporary emigration that is proceeding has been explained time and again.  If Deputies want to alter that policy, let them indicate the alterations they desire.  Already we have restricted the emigration of persons under 22 years of age, except in special circumstances. We have also restricted the emigration of farm workers and persons skilled in turf production in the portions of the country where there is a danger of a scarcity of workers to meet the peak requirements of agriculture. In order to offset whatever hardship might be imposed on the workers in these areas, we have arranged for certain compensating factors.  We have established a special register of these workers, which means that they will be entitled to receive <Col N="441" /> amounts over and above what is received by those who are in receipt of unemployment assistance.  They are also given a preference in the matter of employment upon State-financed schemes, as well as exemption from the Employment Period Orders which operate in the rural areas and which affect other rural workers.</P>
    <P>We do not apply restrictions in the congested districts, the scheduled areas, scheduled because of the rather lower level of prosperity which exists in them as compared with the rest of the country.  Persons other than those subject to restrictions are allowed to emigrate if they are not in employment and if there is no immediate prospect of employment being available for them.  We do not believe we are entitled, in the case of an individual who we know is not employed and for whom there is no immediate prospect of employment, to prevent him getting work elsewhere in order to make suitable provision for himself and for his dependents.</P>
    <P>If we can, by any means open to us, increase the opportunities of employment at home, we will do it.  There is, in fact, a considerable additional amount of work available in rural areas.  It is in the urban areas that the effects of the war on employment have been most severely felt, for obvious reasons.  The building trade, for example, has been depressed; the output in that trade has decreased by 75 per cent. since the war began by reason of the dearth of materials.  The skilled workers of the building trade cannot be employed; there is little we can do to provide, for the skilled workers in that trade, work at their special vocations.  We can undertake schemes which will provide employment for unskilled workers, but for carpenters, bricklayers, electricians and other skilled workers of that sort it is poor compensation to be offered employment, using a spade or a shovel on relief schemes.</P>
    <P>The same thing applies to motor mechanics.  The number of motor vehicles on the road has decreased by 80 per cent.  The services requiring motor mechanics have considerably <Col N="442" /> decreased.  You cannot provide for unemployed motor mechanics on relief schemes designed for unskilled labourers.  I do not think we are entitled, as regards workers of that kind, for whom there is no prospect of employment while the emergency lasts, to hold them here against their will while there is a chance of temporary employment elsewhere.  That is our view.</P>
    <P>If Deputies have any suggestions to offer, let them express themselves clearly and indicate precisely what modifications they would be inclined to make in the existing regulations. We must, however, get away from generalities.  We all agree with the principle of endeavouring to arrest emigration by increasing the opportunities of work here, but there are practical difficulties in the way.  We would like to overcome these difficulties and in that connection we are prepared to consider whatever proposals Deputies may feel inclined to submit to us.  If suggestions can be brought forward as to how difficulties that, at the moment, appear to be insurmountable, can be removed, we shall welcome those suggestions.  The members of the Labour Party, in particular, should be able to help in this regard because they, through their trade union affiliations, will have personal knowledge of the very material problems that affect employment in many industries.  If there is any way by which these problems can be minimised or overcome, they should be in a position to indicate it.</P>
    <P>One of the results of the war has been to redress the absence of balance between the remuneration of persons engaged in agricultural pursuits and the remuneration of persons employed in urban pursuits.  There has been a considerable improvement in the cash position of farmers.  Deputies must not leave that fact out of account.  Not merely has the net value of our agricultural output substantially increased, but the cash position of Irish farmers has substantially improved. There has been almost 100 per cent. improvement in the cash income of the Irish farmers as against an increased cost of living of 50 per cent. affecting farmers.  Deputy Davin <Col N="443" /> suggested that we should endeavour to offset the difficulties of butter production by giving 1/- a gallon for milk delivered to the creameries.  There was behind Deputy Davin's suggestion the idea that an increase in price for milk would automatically result in increased production.  I think that that remains to be proven.  There is no reason to assume that increased production will automatically follow on an increase in price.  It may be so, but the fact is that our records would not appear to support that contention.  If Deputies will take the precaution of drawing graphs representing the trend of milk prices and milk production over any period in the past, they will get an astonishing result.  They will find that, in fact, the production of milk for manufacture into butter inr creased when the price fell, and decreased when the price rose.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>I am merely putting the contention that the assumption that it is axiomatic that increased production will follow upon an increase in price is unsound.  In other occupations, that assumption has been proved to be unsound.  In our own experience, in the case of workers following dangerous or unattractive occupations, we found that an increase in wages did not result in greater production.  The workers preferred to take the benefit of the increased wage in the form of greater leisure to taking it in the form of increased income.  The British Government had precisely the same experience in relation to their coal mines.  They found that production was being impeded by what was called absenteeism&mdash;the unwillingness of workers to work six shifts per week.  To offset that absenteeism and to induce workers to work more and produce more, they increased the rate of wages. They found that they were getting a lower output afterwards than they had been getting before; that there was more absenteeism and that the workers preferred to take the benefit of the higher rate of wages in increased leisure to taking it in the form of increased wages.  It may be that some similar cause will affect agricultural production here but, clearly, we cannot assume that the whole problem of production is one of price.  In the case of milk and of bacon, there is the problem of the supply of feeding stuffs and there is no way by which we can adjust price to overcome the difficulty caused by the inadequate supply of feeding stuffs.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Davin approached this problem in a typical manner.  He recognised that if we were to give 1/- a gallon to the milk producers for milk delivered to creameries and manufactured into butter, there would have to be a higher price for butter.  A higher price for butter would not be popular with the people who support Deputy Davin.  Therefore, he suggested that the effect of the increased price of milk upon the price of butter should be offset by a subsidy.  That is a very glib suggestion, but it requires careful examination by this House. Other Deputies have suggested that <Col N="445" /> other processes should be subsidised. We can provide out of national funds subsidies for particular purposes, but we should do so with considerable hesitation because it is a dangerous course on which to embark.  I asked Deputy Davin who would pay the subsidy. He admitted that the subsidy would have to come from taxation.  I asked him what tax he would vote for. He will not vote for any tax.  That has been the weakness of the Labour Party, and it will remain a weak Party so long as it fails to face up to the unpopular as well as the popular consequences of its policy.  It is easy to say that the milk producers should get more for their milk, that nobody should suffer, and that the consumers of butter should not be affected by the higher cost of production.  It is easy to make that sort of suggestion, but our consumers and milk producers know that there must be some means found of bridging the gap between the higher price of milk and the cost of the butter manufactured from that milk.</P>

      <P>I am prepared to deal <Col N="446" /> with the whole question of money. Deputy Davin suggested that this higher price which he suggests should be paid to the producers of milk should be provided by means of subsidy. We can provide subsidies by two methods&mdash;by taxation and by borrowing. If we provide a subsidy by taxation, we have got to make sure that the people we propose to benefit will be better off as a result of the subsidy. That need not happen.  There are certain taxes which can be imposed. There is no use in talking about taxes on luxuries which people can do without or on commodities that are purchased only in limited quantities. The money must be got by a tax on incomes or tobacco or beer or tea or sugar or other commodities which people must buy.</P>

    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="SeanFLemass" hpid="Mr. Lemass Mr. Lemass">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Lemass</NameTxt>
      <P>The Deputy must stop interrupting.  He is not entitled to a fool's licence here.  The other method by which money can be found is by borrowing.  I know that the Labour Party have the idea that the temporary difficulties of the war period should be overcome by recourse to borrowing. That is a very dangerous expedient and one that we should only embark upon with a full knowledge of the dangers associated with it.  We can, in fact, produce here a position of uncontrollable inflation, and all the economic forces are tending at present to produce an inflationary position. That has always been the case in wartime. The Government here is trying to control that situation, and we have succeeded to an extent, but we are not sufficiently strong to prevent it entirely. Inflationary tendencies, in fact, have already been produced here.  We can at least prevent these tendencies <Col N="447" /> from getting out of control, but if we move with them, if we have recourse to borrowing or to the subsidising of prices to an undue extent, then we can let these forces get beyond our control, and, if they do get beyond our control, they will produce in this country precisely the same disastrous effects as they have produced in every other country.  There is no reason why we in this country should expect to escape the disastrous results that have followed in other countries as a result of the lack of control of these inflationary tendencies.</P>
      <P>I think that the Labour Party have failed the workers of this country in their inability to recognise that it is the workers who will suffer most from inflation here.  It is always the workers who suffer in any period of financial instability, whether caused by happenings abroad or by the foolish financial policies adopted by Governments at home.  It is always the workers who suffer by such policies.  That is a historical fact, and it is easy to find out that it is so.  It is not the owners of property or the owners of wealth who suffer as a result of such a policy. The only people who suffer are the workers, who depend on the buying power of their week's wages to get the necessities required for maintenance of themselves and their families.  All through history, in times of financial disturbance, it has been the workers who suffered.  It was in order to overcome for the time being the disastrous results that follow from inflation that the Government made re-regulations with the object of controlling these inflationary tendencies in the best interests of the workers themselves, because otherwise it is the workers, and only the workers, who would be sacrificed.  Inevitably they would have to carry the full burden. They have always had to carry it, all through history, in other countries, and it would be the same here.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I suggest, therefore, that it is not fair for the Labour Party to ignore the consequences of their advice upon the people in whom they are especially interested.  We are just as much concerned with the interests of these <Col N="448" /> people as the Labour Party are, and it is because of that that we are exercising controls, unpopular as they may be from a Party point of view, that may arrest or at least slow down the various inflationary tendencies that are at work.</P>
    <P>I urge that the problems&mdash;the very real problems&mdash;that this country is facing, should be approached in a constructive way here in the House.  Of course, we all made speeches in the elections which were designed to appeal to the emotions rather than the intelligence of our audiences.  It is not possible, in an election campaign, to approach these matters in the same way as one can approach them in the calmer atmosphere of this House.  Statements are made at election meetings, at the cross-roads through the country, which cannot be critically examined or verified, but the atmosphere in this House is different, and no contention that is made here should be accepted until it is proven, or no alleged fact accepted until it is verified; nor is any policy worth following until all its implications have been worked out.  That is why Deputies here should approach these problems, not in the spirit of election meetings at the cross-roads, but in that of people coming here, to a legislative Assembly, for the purpose of producing a policy in the best interests of the country.  Every Deputy here has the same right.  Everybody is here as a representative of the people and is entitled to respect, as such. Whatever his ideas may be, whether we agree with them or not, those ideas are entitled to be seriously considered and examined, and I ask Deputies here to approach our problems in that spirit.</P>
    <P>The problems that we have to face are very considerable.  We had very grave problems to face before the election, but it is my conviction that the problems we had to face then will fade into insignificance compared with the problems we shall have to face in the future.  The longer the war lasts, the greater will our problems become, and if increased activity between the belligerents should develop around the coast of this country, following the establishment of a Second Front, then <Col N="449" /> we shall be faced in a very short time, both in regard to supplies and other matters, with very severe hardships for our people, unless we can ensure that the burden will rest evenly on all section and that no section will have to bear these burdens unduly.</P>
    <P>I think, Sir, that I have referred to all the matters that were raised in this connection.  Various matters were referred to last week, but I think we shall have an opportunity of dealing with them again.  Unfortunately, the Vote in connection with my Department has already been dealt with, which deprives me of the opportunity of throwing back the missiles that, I am sure, would be thrown at me. However, in connection with the Vote for which I am responsible, particular problems will be adverted to, and I want to say that I quite recognise the incapacity of any individual, or any group of individuals, to provide perfect solutions for all of them, and that it will take the combined brains of the whole Dáil to secure solutions for them.  In my opinion, the only way to secure solutions is by a critical examination of these problems by all Deputies in this House, and if there is merit in any proposals put forward by Deputies of this House, no matter from what side, that merit will soon emerge, and if it is there, then I promise that such proposals will be taken into account, and that legislation will be introduced to make them effective.</P>
    <Speaker pid="BenMaguire" hpid="Mr. Maguire Mr. Maguire">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Maguire</NameTxt>
      <P>In the course of the debate during the last two days, emphasis has fallen more on agriculture than on any other item.  It is true that agriculture is our principal industry and, as such, is deserving of the most serious consideration which it has received in the debates here for the last two days.  It would appear from the various speeches that have been made that the position of our country, when the war is over, will have to be considered, and that when the various armies or war workers are disbanded and sent back here we will have to see how far it is possible to make provision for them, and extra emphasis is <Col N="450" /> laid on the necessity of planning now for that provision.  As long as I can remember, I have listened to wise people in this country saying, from time to time: &ldquo;Well, when all is said and done we will have to get our people back to the land; that is the solution of our problem.&rdquo;  I believe that it is that attitude that creates the problem&mdash;why they &ldquo;have to.&rdquo;  Why is it necessary, in connection with the principal industry of the country, to have to apply compulsion in order to make the getting into that industry a matter of reality?  You have that running underneath the whole tillage scheme.  We have had a lot of criticism of that scheme and of its result.  The tillage scheme has shown, in fact, that we have not got, under a compulsory tillage scheme, the results that we should really expect under ordinary tillage.  Why?  Because of the &ldquo;have to&rdquo;, the compulsion. People who are compelled to do something will do it reluctantly.  People who do something because they are attracted to it and because they find it advantageous will do it much better. The Minister for Agriculture, or anybody else who may be studying statistics and wondering why it is that we have not got from 500,000 acres of tilled land a yield in proportion to that which we got from 250,000 acres, must remember that the cultivation of the 500,000 acres was the result of compulsion, whereas the work of cultivating the 250,000 acres was freely undertaken by people who had a personal interest in it.  The moment anything is made compulsory, the people will comply with the law, but the will to succeed is not there.  The personal interest and good husbandry necessary to make tillage a success are absent.  There may be other explanations for the disappointing yield.  Bad harvesting seasons and the absence of labour have been responsible for substantial losses.  I suggest that some scheme by which the standing Army or the labour corps would be made available to assist the farmers during the harvesting season is essential.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>We have to remember that our principal industry, agriculture, must absorb the great majority of those of <Col N="451" /> our people who are bound to become unemployed when the war is over.  We will have to plan for the creation of that employment, that absorption of our people, so that they will not merely go back to agriculture as a last resort but will find that work as lucrative and as attractive as any other occupation.  We have listened to Deputies from the Fine Gael Benches claiming that the line of action adopted by them many years ago in regard to agriculture was the proper one.  Statistics have been quoted to prove that.  We had Deputies from the Fianna Fáil Benches indicating that their line of action was a better one, and they had figures to prove that. We had farmers and Labour Deputies participating, over a number of years, in a definite Party programme.  We have to anticipate that large numbers of our people will come back here when hostilities are over, and the only industry here which is capable of absorbing them is agriculture.  We must bring the standard of living of those who are engaged on that occupation up to the level of that enjoyed by people engaged on other occupations. We have heard complaints from Deputies about the appalling tragedy that agricultural workers can receive only 30/- or 36/- a week, whereas those engaged in other occupations receive a much higher wage.  Is it any wonder then that we have the problem of the flight from the land?  Is it any wonder that the farmers are unable to find workers to help them with the harvest which they are compelled, and rightly compelled, to put in and save because the needs of the community require it? I suggest that we ought to tackle this problem seriously, and the only way in which we can hope to absorb our people who come back here is by bringing the standard of living of those engaged in agriculture, the industry in which we must find employment for them, up to the level enjoyed by people in other industries.  Give them the same wage, give them the same conditions of employment, give them the same facilities, give them, as nearly as possible, the same atmosphere of convenience, and there will be no hesitancy.  It will not be a <Col N="452" /> question of having to go back to the land, they will go back willingly.</P>
    <P>We have had, not only here, but I suppose in other countries also, legislation dealing with conditions of employment of workers, wages of workers, holidays for workers, and various other amenities of that sort. To what extent have those conditions any application to the farmers of this country?  How many of them get a holiday with pay?  What about their hours of employment?  What about their Sunday work?  Is there any extra payment for that?  I suggest that no Government in this country has ever seriously tackled our fundamental problem, the improvement of conditions in our principal industry.  I suggest that we ought to set up an agricultural board, representing the biggest industry in this country; an industrial board representing the industrialists of this country, and a labour board representing the workers of this country.  Those three responsible boards must come together and settle the problem, which is an internal one.  There is no use whatever in trying to do this sectionally.  One section of the farmers will look for an increased price for dairy produce; another section will look for an increased price for tillage products, a bounty on wheat, a bounty on potatoes, and so on.  If they get away with it, for the time being that section has improved its position.  The same applies to the workers; the same applies to the business people.  They all have great power if they are organised, but unfortunately all that they achieve is the temporary alleviation of sectional grievances.  The advancement of the interests of the community as a whole has never been seriously tackled.  I may be told that it would be difficult to set up a board representing the farmers of this country and their agricultural interests.  I say that it is no more difficult to do that than it is to set up a board representing the electricity supply interests, or a board representing or controlling any other industry.  Let those people come together, realising that, unless each section of the community gets a fair share out of the total pool, then condiditions are wrong.  I believe that by <Col N="453" /> setting up such an organisation we could arrive at a fine balance between the various interests and the various industries which compose the entity of our economic life here.  I do not believe that our tillage programme is giving that result.  I am quite satisfied that it is not.  I believe that, in order to make our tillage scheme a success, it would have to be much more seriously considered and applied than it is at present.  We should not be content with telling the farmers that they have to till the land.  The planning of tillage should be considered by scientists in advance.</P>
    <P>There are areas which are particularly suitable for the growing of certain types of crops.  I know districts in which there is very poor land, but much better potatoes can be grown on that land than on land that is regarded of superior quality.  Wheat growing areas do exist in this country but the haphazard method of compulsory increased tillage, without the smallest consideration as to the suitability of the soil for the production of wheat as against the production of oats, barley or potatoes, reveals the absence of any considered plan.  The production of wheat, if it is to be continued in this country, must be conducted along lines which, while yielding an economic price to producers, will enable consumers to buy it at a price that will in turn enable them to engage in other activities the products of which have to be sold in competition with the products of other countries.  The wheat areas will have to be defined, the necessary machinery for the tillage will have to be available on the spot, and the amount of labour involved will have to be reduced to the minimum.  Harvesting facilities will have to be concentrated in particular areas so that the necessary number of workers will be available to ensure that, in our uncertain climate, the maximum of the crops can be saved.</P>
    <P>In my opinion, the country could be divided into areas in which wheat, oats, barley, or other crops could be most successfully grown.  A system of that kind will have to be rigidly applied unless the export markets are <Col N="454" /> capable of absorbing the entire surplus of our agricultural produce.  Nobody is so optimistic, I think, as to believe that that will happen, but unless it should come to pass I am afraid that we shall have to limit the production of pigs and poultry to the poorer areas so as to provide the small farmer with an outlet for the employment of the members of his family.  I can visualise, if the worst comes to happen, that the 30 or 40 acre farm, which we have come to regard as the standard size economic holding, may very well disappear, and that, instead, we shall have to cater for farms of from two to five acres. In my opinion, if a planned constructive policy were put into operation, we would get much better results from farms of that kind than we are at present getting from our present farms ranging in extent from 30 acres to a couple of thousand acres.  I can see the agricultural industry&mdash;and it is our main industry&mdash;surviving only after we have brought our experts to produce a plan to show us the most economic methods of utilising the land for the production of the various crops we need.</P>
    <P>Similarly, I can see the dairying industry surviving only by the adoption of a system which will ensure a more intensive milk yield from each cow fed on the land.  That can be done in two ways.  One is by the encouragement of cows with a high milk-yielding strain. In that connection, I suggest that a very serious situation is developing. The price paid for young heifers for export likely to become good milch cows has risen to such an extent that there has been a considerable diminution in the number of such young cattle now left in the country.  We shall have to deal with the specific problem of increasing the milk yield of our cows, if dairying is to be continued on an economic basis.  That is recognised by the Department of Agriculture and steps have been taken by the Department to encourage an increase in the number of cows of the best milking strain.  That is a very difficult problem, but anybody who has an elementary knowledge of the production of heifers will know the uncertainties attached to cattle-breeding. <Col N="455" /> Where you are waiting and hoping to get a heifer calf, you may get a male calf and you are then thrown back along the line.  While waiting for the production of a milking strain, the farmer may be compelled to sell the cow with a chance of &ldquo;springing&rdquo; in order to realise ready cash.  His whole effort of years is frustrated in that way. I suggest that the Department of Agriculture should step in, take a census of all cattle that, in their judgment, are suitable for producing a milking strain and endeavour to retain these in the country, even if it should be necessary to pay the farmer a subsidy for the retention of these cattle.  The farmers might be paid subsidies to keep suitable heifers in stock just as farmers are paid premiums for the maintenance of suitable bulls.  If heifers were subsidised in that way, a satisfactory foundation stock might be retained and farmers would be encouraged to produce cattle of a milking strain and so make the most of their land from the dairying point of view.</P>

      <P>In addition to the development of high-yielding milk strains amongst our cattle, farmers should be encouraged to cultivate crops suitable for winter feeding or winter dairying.  That is just one point on which our dairying industry has failed to maintain its position.  The Deputy asked if I had engaged in dairying.  I have, and engaged in it successfully.  Twenty-five years ago, <Col N="456" /> and even long before that, there was a tradition on the farm on which I was reared of using grass in a very scientific way, as ensilage.  Speaking from experience, I can say that the use of grass as ensilage is very beneficial for winter dairying.  It is at least as good as the best hay that can be saved from the same field plus the cabbage which any dairying farmer knows is one of the best milk-yielding adjuncts that can be utilised on a farm.  I know that the Department has encouraged the use of ensilage in recent years.  The method which I inherited was a very old-fashioned method.  The grass was built in the open and there was considerable loss as a result of air penetrating from the outside.  Modern methods have adopted the use of a silo in which the grass is put and ought in the ordinary way prevent that wastage from the outside caused by the penetration of the air. But, unfortunately, I found that where many of these silos have been built under grants from the Department of Agriculture, for some reason the wastage there, too, has been excessive.  I do not know whether it is due to the carelessness of those who used it, or what is the cause but the grass has sagged away from the silo concrete, and wherever that occurred, again there is wastage.</P>
      <P>I would recommend that the Department of Agriculture should endeavour with their utmost efforts to ensure that those silos which have been subsidised should be so successful that farmers generally will adopt them, because, speaking from experience, I know they are of great value for the winter production of milk and their general adoption would to a large extent contribute to the success of the dairying industry.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>As regards pigs, I heard criticism here yesterday from Deputy Dillon. He cited a case where a fair was held somewhere and there were no buyers at it.  The result was that the pigs had to be sold below the fixed price, at whatever price was offered for them. Owing to the absence of the required number of buyers, the market was flat and that was the reason for the sale of the pigs below the fixed price.  I have <Col N="457" /> known it to occur, too, but I must say this in fairness to the Pigs Marketing Board, that on my taking up a similar case in Mohill last year, the Pigs Marketing Board immediately made provision for the arrival of a buyer in Mohill.  Every pig was taken from the fair, earmarked, and sent to the factory, and full payment was sent back the following week.</P>
    <P>If Deputies would only realise their full duties instead of making contentious points at a later date they could be of immense value to the people among whom they live.  The Pigs Marketing Board is clearly not a satisfactory board, in the opinion of the great majority of pig producers.  A statement was made by Deputy Dillon in this House, and I cannot believe that any Deputy would make an untrue statement here, that he invested £300 in a bacon curing factory and that two years afterwards he was presented with £900, showing 300 per cent. profit.  If that be the fact, there is no question whatever about it that these bacon curing factories have been extracting extortionate profits from the pig producers, and I say that the matter is one that should be fully examined.  It is a statement made by a responsible Deputy, and even if it were far less than it is&mdash;if the profits were only 100 per cent., or even 50 per cent., or even 33? per cent.&mdash;these profits are excessive and it is the duty of the Government to ensure that the farmer who produces the raw material should have a share of the profits at the manufacturing end.  The bacon curing factories of this country should be under the control of the farmers who produce pigs just the same as the creameries are under the control of the farmers who produce the milk.  I see no serious difficulties in the way of this at all.</P>
    <P>Again, as regards this problem of having to go back to the land, surely it is past the stage when we have to do that.  &ldquo;Back to the land or die of starvation.&rdquo;  Land does not belong to the farmers; it never did.  The farmers are trustees.  They hold land as owners, but in every period of time, in every country in the world, whenever the country is in stress and the land of the country is required to provide <Col N="458" /> for the whole of the people, the alleged ownership of the individual farmer is set aside.  He is compelled to use his land, so far as it can be used, to provide the needs of the whole of the community and not as he considers he should use it himself.  If that be so, why not try to make the lives of those engaged in that essential occupation more attractive than they have been?</P>
    <P>Look at all the trouble we have had in trying to encourage Governments to give small grants to build a bit of a road to a farmer's house, to build a bit of a road to the bog or to do a bit of drainage that would relieve the farmers from flooding.  From my experience I say that the farmers I know, if they were not herculean, would not have withstood the miseries they have had to undergo.  They are compelled to pay rates to build steam-rolled roads&mdash;roads which they rarely use, and which are generally a menace to them and to their vehicles.  The men who are compelled to build these roads often have to plough with their pony or donkey and cart over a field sodden with rain, and I have known children going to school ploughing over that sodden track and getting their feet wet through before they reach the main road.  Bringing home the turf in wet seasons is the same.  That is the occupation we feel we will have to utilise if a real emergency comes.  Is it any wonder that we use the expression &ldquo;have to go back to the land&rdquo;? Farmers go out and do a bit of tillage in an emergency period.  They know the risk they run, but there is increased tillage.  When they have done that, as I have seen last year, their crops are often destroyed or carried away, if not covered by water.</P>
    <P>It is not necessary to wait for the application of a big national drainage scheme to remedy many of these grievances, but they are left unattended to and the flooding brings ruin to those families.  When crops are destroyed they are a national loss and still the Department&mdash;I do not know why&mdash;are unable to act.  A little redress could mend a lot of things, but there is too much rigidness in the Departments. The work does not belong to the Land <Col N="459" /> Commission, although they are operating in the area; it does not belong to Local Government or the county council, although they are also operating in the area; it belongs to another section. There are all these water-tight compartments of officials operating in an area where abuse is apparent, and still it is nobody's duty, and the difficulties go on and remain, and in face of that we wonder why our people want to leave the countryside.  We wonder they do not find great enjoyment in sodden feet and children travelling through the mud to school because of the absence of a road, although they have been contributing to the making of roads so magnificent that they are incapable of travelling in safety on them when they do not own motor cars.</P>
    <P>There is the picture as I see it, and I suggest that the problem can only be faced in this way: that the conditions of those engaged in the major industry of this country will have to be brought up to a level similar to that of those engaged in any other industry&mdash;Civil Service, business or transport, let it be what it is.  Conditions, with holiday facilities, will have to be improved for everybody engaged in that national industry.  Their lives and home surroundings will have to be brought up to the level of the suburban dweller in the city.  It can be done.  We are a small, poor community.  There is no use in fighting sectionally&mdash;labour demanding increased wages for one section and forgetting another; farmers demanding increases for dairying and others demanding increased bonuses or bounties for tillage farming, and industrialists demanding protection for their products. They are all engaged, each fighting the other sectionally within the one field. Let us pool our resources.  Let us have an industrial board and a business board, and see that even justice is distributed to each person engaged in these industries.  Until that is done, in my opinion, all the Parties we send to the Dáil will do nothing more than defeat their own ends and achieve nothing.</P>
    <Speaker pid="WilliamNorton" hpid="Mr. Norton Mr. Norton">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Norton</NameTxt>
      <P>This debate has been <Col N="460" /> remarkable in one way, that we have had from Deputy Corry, sitting on the Government Benches, probably the most striking indictment of the Government's agricultural policy that has yet been delivered in the House in the course of this debate.  The Deputy quoted from a wealth of statistics which he assured the House he had taken great care to prepare and still greater care to analyse.  He told us that, notwithstanding the fact that we have a Prices Commission in operation, and notwithstanding the other virtues which I am sure he claims for the Government, the people who are engaged in the production of small seeds for agriculture were at present getting away with swag estimated at a profit of 250 per cent. on the prices which they are paying for the seeds to the producers.  Deputy Corry quoted the prices of mangold, turnip, rape and other seeds.  He gave us the prices which the producers are paid for these seeds, and told us the price which the farmers have to pay for the seeds to the retailers.  He finally worked out the percentage profit on all these small seeds at about 250 per cent.  He then asked the question: what is going to be done about it&mdash;piously hoping that the Government might do something about it.  It seems to me that even if half of what Deputy Corry has said is correct, and I am prepared to discount his statement by 50 per cent., you get at a situation in which he admits, as a member of the Government Party, that the profits on the production of small seeds are about 125 per cent.  His own figure was approximately 250 per cent.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Deputy Corry also told us of the way in which his heart bleeds for the farmers who produce barley.  He told us that Messrs. Guinness and Co. are compelled to pay the British farmers 70/- a barrel for barley, but that the Fianna Fáil Minister for Agriculture has such a benevolent interest in Messrs. Guinness and Co., that he would only permit them to pay 35/- a barrel for barley to the Irish farmer. Messrs. Guinness and Co. are paying 35/- a barrel for Irish barley and are sending it to Britain in the form of <Col N="461" /> stout, although in Britain they are compelled to pay 70/- a barrel for barley of the same quality which they are also converting into stout in Britain.  I think Deputy Corry was quite right when he asked for an answer to the question: why the Irish farmer will not be allowed to make his own price with a millionaire firm like that of Messrs. Guinness?  Why is our farmer being exploited in the interests of Messrs. Guinness; why is he being tied down to a maximum price of 35/- a barrel for barley when he sells it to Messrs. Guinness, while the latter is compelled to pay 70/- a barrel for barley in the Six Counties and in Britain?  We ought to have an answer to these questions in the course of this debate, because it seems to me incomprehensible that farmers, endeavouring in present circumstances to grow barley on small holdings and with heavy domestic commitments, should be compelled to sell their barley to Messrs. Guinness when that firm is apparently quite willing to pay 70/- a barrel for barley bought in Britain for the production of stout to be sold there.</P>
    <P>Apart from these statements made by Deputy Corry, and apart from his indictment of the Government's policy in not controlling prices and of the manner in which it allows the farmers to be fleeced by everybody who regards the farmer as a good chicken to pluck, there are aspects of this discussion on agriculture which are of outstanding importance to the nation as a whole.</P>
    <P>The one aspect of agricultural policy upon which there is general agreement is that, notwithstanding that we have very fertile land which is the envy of many other countries in Europe, we are, nevertheless, in the position that the acreage under corn and root crops in normal times has continued to drop calamitously.  There was a fall in the acreage under corn and root crops between 1921 and 1929, and even if you take the period 1936 to 1939 there was another fall in the acreage under corn and root crops.  It cannot be said that the fall between 1921 and 1929 or between 1926 and 1939 was explained by the absence of fertilisers.  There was an abundance of fertilisers available <Col N="462" /> in those years, but yet the application of two agricultural policies, by two different Governments, did not succeed in arresting the decrease in the acreage under corn and root crops. Even to-day, in the midst of war and as a beleaguered nation in this the fourth year of the war, we find, notwithstanding compulsory tillage, a relatively stagnant position in regard to agricultural production.  The best evidence of that is to be found in the fact that here in this country with 12,000,000 acres of arable land available for cultivation, we are experiencing, and have experienced, a shortage of sugar, a shortage of bacon, a shortage of eggs, and, in some areas, a shortage of milk, a shortage of flake meal, and recently a fairly extensive shortage of potatoes.</P>
    <P>I would like to hear some member of the Government Party endeavour to explain to us why, with 12,000,000 acres of arable land available and with 80,000 acres of that land capable of giving us all the sugar we require, we should be short of sugar in a country possessed of such agricultural potentialities. Why are we short of flake meal in a country with 12,000,000 acres of arable land available, 9,000,000 acres of which are not under cultivation to-day?  Last year we had the Government Press organ telling us that there was a shortage of sugar because approximately 54,000 acres only were under beet.</P>
    <P>This year the acreage under beet has jumped to approximately 80,000.  Why? Because, in the meantime, the farmer was encouraged by better prices to grow beet.  If the farmers had been encouraged&mdash;it is the job of the Government to encourage the farmer and not to drive him&mdash;to grow more beet we need not have had any sugar shortage last year; we need not have a sugar shortage to-day, and a sugar shortage need never recur in this country.  The fact that there is a shortage of all these primary products in a country abounding in fertility and in arable land is, it seems to me, the clearest indictment of the type of agricultural policy which has been pursued here over the past 21 years.</P>
    <P>I think anybody who has given any <Col N="463" /> thought to the matter will recognise that the land of this country is our greatest source of wealth.  The use we make of that land determines the standard of living for every man, woman and child living here.  Agriculture to-day represents our greatest source of employment.  Out of every 100 persons gainfully employed in this country no less than 57 get their livelihood in agriculture.  Every farm in this country is an agricultural factory, and we would be fools if we did not realise the great wealth that resides in the land, and still greater fools if we did not exploit that wealth in absorbing a greater number of our people into employment.</P>
    <P>Deputy Maguire who has just sat down, put his finger on some important aspects of our agricultural policy and of our national activities which, I think, deserve attention.  Like myself, he apparently agrees that agriculture is capable of absorbing more of our people into employment.  In the world into which we shall be precipitated after the war, unless we develop our agricultural potentialities to a much greater extent, we shall be faced with a post-war situation which from the unemployment point of view will be without parallel so far as this country is concerned.  Remember that approximately 350,000 of our people have gone to Britain in the past ten years and that there are large numbers of our people in the British armed forces to-day.  One of these days the guns will cease to bark, peace will reign again, armies will be demobilised in a chaotic and disordered world, and nations will seek to give first preference to their own citizens.  We may be in a situation then in which we shall not have to send to America for emigrants because we shall have hundreds of thousands of them dumped back on us from Britain.</P>
    <P>Has anybody given any thought at all to the situation which would arise here if we were suddenly notified by the British Government that they were providing transport to send back a quarter of a million of our people? Remember that these people will not have come from cloisters.  These <Col N="464" /> people will have been in bombed and blitzed cities in Britain where they will have been earning high wages and living under conditions which taught them that courage, strength and physical endurance, and not cheque books, were the real things that mattered in life.  They will have seen wealthy people fall under the rain of bombs; they will have seen, the biggest buildings and mansions tumble down in dust; and they will have seen the most gigantic ships and the most gigantic guns made powder under the instruments of death produced there.  If these people come back they will not be quiet.  They cannot be led around by the hand.  If a quarter of a million of these people, having experienced a new life, having a new outlook on life, and having a new determination and a new objective in life, are suddenly thrown back here, will not a nice situation confront this country?</P>
    <P>What do we propose to do in such a situation?  So far as I can discover, this Government has no plan whatever for expanding agriculture, for expanding the production of goods which will probably be in greater demand when the war is over than at any time previously.  The Government appear to have no plans whatever for expanding agriculture, either because the products of agriculture will be marketable the world over, or as a means of absorbing into that constructive, reproductive craft the large numbers of our people who will inevitably be thrown back on this country when the war concludes.</P>
    <P>The Minister for Agriculture some time ago went to Cork to deliver a lecture on agriculture.  I read that lecture twice.  It was a recital of the <i>De Profundis</i> over post-war agriculture in this country.  No bleaker or more miserable picture was painted for the farmers than was painted by that Minister in the course of his lecture in Cork last year.  The big problem, of course, which confronts agriculture to-day, and which has always confronted agriculture in the circumstanees of this country, is that the farmers are financially impoverished.  They <Col N="465" /> have not sufficient liquid capital to enable them to stock or work their lands, and that want of capital has prevented the farmer from exploiting his land sufficiently to intensify the production of wealth or to enable him to employ additional labour.  Any enlightened agricultural policy must break with the tradition which keeps the farmer financially impoverished. and withholds from him the necessary capital to enable him to exploit his land to the fullest.</P>
    <P>One of the essentials, if we are to rehabilitate and re-vitalise agriculture, is to make available to the farmer loans free of interest in order to enable him to stock his land, to purchase implements to use on his land, to fence, drain and to fertilise his land, so that he may engage in the tillage of land instead of the quarrying of land which unfortunately is the position on many farms throughout the country to-day.  But, even then, you would have done nothing more than to touch the fringe of the farmer's problem. One of the biggest difficulties confronting the farmer is the price he can get for his produce.  The industrialist can fix a price and be sure of getting that price because his commodity is in demand.  The worker, in so far as he is organised in a protective organisation, such as a trade union, can make some effort to fix the price at which he will sell his labour. The farmer, unfortunately, is not so well organised and the State does not take in him the interest it ought to take, with the result that, except in the stress of war, the farmer has been compelled to rely upon any price he can get in the market for his produce.</P>
    <P>There has been a welcome departure from that policy in recent years, but it has been a departure not of a very satisfactory character for the farmer, because the prices which have been fixed for agricultural produce have not been prices which have given the farmer an adequate return for his labour.  An enlightened agricultural policy must take note of the necessity for giving the farmer a decent price for his produce, just as every other person in the country is entitled to get a decent return for his labour. <Col N="466" /> That can best be done by giving the farmer a guaranteed price which will take note of his costs and of the standard of living which the farming community is entitled to enjoy.  If the farmer is given a decent price for his produce, it must go hand in hand with ensuring for the agricultural workers a wage which will raise them above the agricultural serfdom in which many of them are wallowing to-day.</P>
    <P>The test of prosperity in agriculture is not the number of fat cattle a rancher can sell, and not the price or the income which the wheat rancher can get.  The test of prosperity in agriculture is the standard of living in the homes of the agricultural workers of the country, and if one were to go through the homes of agricultural workers in the country, one would find there an appallingly low standard of living, a standard of living which does violence to those pious expressions of economic security and prosperity which are enshrined in the new Constitution. Fancy, in 1943, an agricultural worker being expected to keep himself, his wife and six children for seven days a week on 36/-.  Fancy 36/- being our conception of the standard of living we ought to give to an agricultural worker, his wife and children.  Fancy taking 36/- into a clothing shop in this city or in any provincial town to-day and trying to clothe a family of eight with that sum.  Fancy trying to buy boots and shoes for children, to buy bread and butter at 2/- a lb. for a family of eight with that amount.  We allow 5/- per day to keep that family of eight.  The detention of some of our people as miscreants in jails throughout the country probably costs more than we are paying sturdy. honest, hard-working agricultural workers to keep themselves, their wives and families.  That is a situation which is blandly allowed to continue. Nobody apparently feels that there is any Governmental obligation to remedy such a condition.</P>
    <P>Probably the most striking contrast is at political meetings in the country. or after Mass in the country.  There is no hesitation whatever in picking out the agricultural worker.  He is badly clad, he has bad boots, he is obviously <Col N="467" /> undernourished.  His children bear the hallmark of their father being an agricultural worker.  They are badly clad and, in the main, they are in their bare feet.  Such clothes as they have are in tatters.  In the home of the agricultural worker the same blighting poverty exists.</P>
    <P>To me at all events it seems the plight of the agricultural worker is the most appalling reflection on our assertions here that we are steering this country on the road to prosperity. Unless we can rescue the agricultural worker and the small farmer from the stagnant condition in which they are to-day, from the poverty and misery which abound in their homes, we need never claim to have made any effective contribution towards agricultural prosperity.</P>
    <P>I am sorry Deputy Dillon is not in the House at the moment.  We had yesterday from that Deputy a characteristic free-trade speech.  Deputy Dillon believes that the one solution of all our problems in this country is to buy in the cheapest market and, of course, sell in Deputy Dillon's spiritual home, Britain.  I do not believe in a policy of buying in the cheapest market, because if you develop that policy you will often buy goods produced under coolie conditions of labour.  In any case, as a nation, our problem is to provide a living and a livelihood for our people.  If we accept the philosophy of buying in the cheapest market, we ought to close down every industry in this country to-day.  We ought to give up tilling in peace times.  We ought even to give up ranching in peace times because every commodity that is produced here, every article of clothing that we wear, every article of household furniture, can be produced more cheaply in some other part of the world than it is produced here.  If you think of buying eggs, you can buy Chinese eggs.  If you think of buying poultry, you can buy Polish or Chinese poultry.  If you think of buying butter, you can buy butter in countries where it is sold cheaper than it is produced and sold here.</P>
    <P>The suggestion of buying in the <Col N="468" /> cheapest market is the crystallisation of a free trade outlook.  While that policy may have suited Britain, it is a policy which never suited the economic destiny of this country.  Deputy Dillon, of course, I know, believes that the British market is the best market.  In my view, the best market for our people is the home market, because it is in the home market, and only in the home market, that you can control prices, that you can regulate the conditions of production and marketing, and it is because you have control over these vital factors that-the home market is the valuable market for our people.</P>
    <P>The British market is a market exposed to every economic, fiscal and agricultural wind that blows.  Production for sale in the British market exposes to competition with every country in the world which has agricultural or industrial products to sell. Some of these countries may have natural advantages in respect of agricultural production; or may have advantages in respect of high capitalisation of industries, scientific machinery for the production of goods and patents which enable them to produce goods under conditions under which we could not produce them here.</P>
    <P>It seems to me our task here is to cultivate, as far as possible, the home market for our own people.  I realise, of course, that we must sell our surplus commodities in order to import other commodities which are not produced here, but in the past what we have been selling abroad has not been our surplus products.  We have been selling abroad products which were not surplus to our requirements but which could not be consumed here because of low wages; large scale unemployment, and endemic poverty in many parts of the country.  I hope that, in the interests of our people, whatever the complexion of future Governments may be, each and every one of them will abandon the policy of free trade in agricultural and industrial production, because free trade, as we have seen it in operation under an alien Government and to some extent under a native Government, <Col N="469" /> has given us a depopulated countryside, has given us a situation in which the bullocks have increased while our men and women, pride of every nation, have been driven to the emigrant ship, forced to seek elsewhere the livelihood that was denied them here.</P>
    <P>Deputy Dillon, in the course of his remarks yesterday, appeared to me to regard industrial development as the one and only enemy of agriculture. Deputy Dillon appeared to imagine that if you produce in this country buckets, ploughs, spades, forks, agricultural boots or any of these commodities which the farmer requires for his domestic life or his agricultural work, immediately you become an enemy of the farmer.  I do not believe that.  I do not see any conflict between the development of our secondary industries and the protection of our agricultural industry.  One has only to go to Sweden to see land used to the fullest possible advantage and gigantic works and factories manufacturing goods for industrial use.  They are not merely manufacturing them for Swedish use.  At the docks in Sweden you will find freights of machinery labelled for every country in the world.  One of the things that strike one about Denmark is that, while it is largely an agricultural country, it has some excellent industries.  There, again, one sees the products of Denmark being sent to almost every country in the world. The Danes do not put all their eggs in one basket.  They do not depend solely upon agriculture as a means of livelihood and a way of life.  They developed agriculture to the fullest, it is true, but, at the same time, they did not neglect the development of their secondary industries.</P>
    <P>What Sweden and Denmark can do in permitting industry and agriculture to develop side by side, one complementary to the other, we ought to be able to do here.  The example of these small countries ought to be an object lesson for us.  We ought not to take as our pattern and our guide the agricultural and industrial methods in a country which is an empire, controlling probably 20 per cent. of the <Col N="470" /> world's surface.  It is noteworthy that Sweden and Denmark are the two countries in Europe where the workers and the mass of the people enjoy a standard of living not approached by our workers or by industrial workers in any other country in Europe to-day. In Denmark and Sweden one does not see the insulting wealth that is visible in other countries.  One does not see the poor in the slums and the hovels that one sees here and in other countries.</P>
    <P>Denmark and Sweden have been able to balance their agricultural production with industrial production.  We ought to aim at a policy of that kind here.  There are some people, particularly new industrialists, who imagine that once you start a factory and employ some people, nothing else matters but to develop the factory and maintain the industry.  I take a different view.  In a country such as this the great bulk of our population and the great bulk of our customers are in the rural areas.  If you cannot make agriculture prosperous then you can get no prosperity in the towns and cities.  If the farmer and the agricultural worker are impoverished by low wages, then there is no demand for the goods produced in the factories in the towns and cities.  There is no employment in the shops, there is no employment in the offices.  If you can bring prosperity to agriculture by giving the farmer guaranteed prices, on the one hand, and the workers a guaranteed wage on the other hand, then you will immediately set up in the rural areas a demand for the goods produced in the city and town factories, you will create a demand for the goods shops have to sell, you will create a demand for the services available in the towns and cities, and you will provide employment in the commercial offices, in consequence of that trading activity.  If you can create that prosperity in agriculture on the one hand, then the demand for the goods which agriculture requires will in turn provide a substantial amount of employment for town and city workers.  When you provide employment for town and city workers, you, on the other hand, set up a demand for the goods which farmers <Col N="471" /> have produced in the rural areas and are willing to sell at a fair price.  In that way you create an ever-widening circle of prosperity from the rural areas into the towns and cities, radiating back into the rural areas again.  But that policy requires for its success the adoption of good prices for agricultural products, good wages for workers who are employed in towns and cities and on the land, regular work, the abandonment of emigration as a solution for unemployment, and the organisation of the nation on the basis of the eradication of the stagnation which, unfortunately, is such a feature of our agricultural and industrial life.</P>
    <P>In all this situation money, of course, plays a vital part.  In the old days it, was thought to be the business only of financiers to be interested in the part which money plays and the functions of money.  There is a more enlightened opinion abroad to-day.  Throughout the world a new school of thought, an intelligent progressive school of thought, has come into being, a school of thought which recognises that money is an instrument of production and exchange, that with money controlled by the State and made available by the State you can induce the creation of new wealth; and with that new wealth made available that you can issue money in the form of State credits or currency anchored to the new wealth which has been created and financed by the new wealth which has been created, and that that type of guarantee for the issue of State credits is of a much more enduring kind than the type of money which is being issued to-day without any gold backing whatever.</P>
    <P>Britain has long ceased to have any gold backing for her money; Britain has ceased to have any backing at all for her money in the form of currency; Britain is issuing millions and millions and millions of pounds every day, the backing for which is not gold or agricultural production, but the gigantic armament programme to which the British Government is committed. Britain is not an exception in that <Col N="472" /> respect. Germany, Italy, the United States and Russia have all long since abandoned gold as a backing for their money.  They are backing their note issues by the expectation that they will win the war and that, having won the war, they will he able to settle down to the creation of wealth that will justify the continuance in circulation of the money which was issued without any gold backing during the war situation. If Britain can, with the benediction of her former orthodox financiers issue money backed not by constructive work, but by the manufacture of implements of death, is it not much easier for us, in our circumstances here, to issue State credits which will induce the production of wealth, so long as these State credits are anchored to sound constructive work the exploiting of our land, and the creation of new wealth with a new outlook for our people?</P>
    <P>I do not want to delay the House further on this matter, because I understand there is a kind of tacit agreement to finish the Vote on Account to-night.  I do, however, want to say that unless we recognise the fundamental need for a change in our agricultural methods, for an abandonment of that hopelessly stagnant conservative outlook with which we have been afflicted for the past 21 years, then this Dáil will go out of existence, and ten other Dála will come and go, and yet the position of agriculture will be just as bad and just as stagnant as it is.  I would urge on the Government and on everybody interested in the creation of a prosperous agricultural industry that we should pool our best thoughts on the matter so as to endeavour to rescue agriculture from the morass into which it has been allowed to sink during the last 21 years under native Governments.  I believe the policy of this Government is not calculated to rescue agriculture from its present unsatisfactory position.  However long the Government may remain in office. I urge them during whatever time is available to them to recognise that their past methods have given most unsatisfactory results.  After nearly four years of war, they have given us <Col N="473" /> a shortage of primary products.  There must be an abandonment of methods and policies which have given such unsatisfactory results, and a reliance on methods more calculated to stimulate agriculture and to give the agricultural community a better return for their excellent services in the production of food for the nation.</P>
    <Speaker pid="PatrickFlorenceODris" hpid="Mr. O'Driscoll Mr. O'Driscoll">
      <NameTxt>Mr. O'Driscoll</NameTxt>
      <P>I am interested in this debate mainly so far as it concerns agriculture, and particularly mixed farming.  The most important product of mixed farming is milk, and the present price of milk is not economic. Milk cannot be sold below the cost of production.  Pig feeding, which is also important in connection with mixed farming, has declined very much.  If an increased price were given for pigs, the scarcity that exists would not continue.  The poultry industry is also an important one, especially in the poorer districts. That industry should have received more attention from the Minister for Agriculture than it has received, and I hope that more attention will be paid to it in the future.  With regard to the pig industry, I suggest that the abolition of the Pigs Marketing Board ought to be considered by the Minister, and that a minimum price should be fixed for pigs.  The holding of fairs in country towns should be encouraged, because, since pig production went down, these towns and villages have deteriorated.</P>
      <P>I would ask the Minister for Local Government to consider the position of old age pensioners.  I have had experience of pension committees, and I found that very deserving cases were not given proper consideration.  If a person's income is over £39 5s. a year, he is deprived of his pension.  That is not fair to old people.  I suggest that that should be raised at least to £50 or £55.  I should also like to call the attention of the Minister for Supplies to the scarcity of many essentials at present.  In my district there is a great scarcity of binder twine.  Some farmers have over 100 acres of wheat, yet dealers have been refused permits to supply them with binder twine.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I am also interested in the important matter of the provision of sea sand <Col N="474" /> for farming purposes.  Some farmers complain that they cannot get the amount of sea sand they require, and there are also complaints with reference to a shortage of oil for the boats that are used for hauling the sand.  Has the Minister any explanation to offer in that respect?  He should endeavour to have adequate supplies issued to these boats, because this sand is very essential for the production of food. Every effort should be made to keep these boats going in order to have the sand conveyed to the farmers.</P>
    <P>With reference to Deputy Corry's statement to-day about the increased railway charges for the hauling of sea sand for manurial purposes, I have some knowledge of the matter and I think the Government should take immediate action to effect some remedy.  Deputy Corry's statement was quite to the point.  We have had a communication from the secretary of the county committee in Cork complaining with reference to this matter. There was one thing that Deputy Corry omitted, and that is that there were a number of men thrown out of employment because the farmers cannot afford to pay what is demanded.</P>
    <P>This sea sand is costing more to haul over a distance of 20 or 30 miles than it costs to land it on the quay where it is first delivered.  The increases are very stiff, representing 100 per cent. to 200 per cent.  The imposition of these charges is very unfair to the people who so urgently require the sand.  The sand is particularly useful for the purposes of food production and the Minister should make every effort to see that the railway company will not be allowed to take this matter into their own hands, and that they should have some consideration for the people who require the sand in order to help them in the production of food.</P>
    <P>I should like the Minister to consider these points.  I have already sent forward complaints to the Minister for Agriculture and the Minister for Industry and Commerce with reference to the action of the railway company. The production of food is hindered if the sand is not made available for manurial purposes.  I may say that the sand has given good results in the last <Col N="475" /> three or four years, when it was utilised in substitution for the artificial manures which were not available in that period.</P>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bennett Mr. Bennett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>In the concluding portion of his speech Deputy Norton said what I think all the House has come to recognise, that on the success of agriculture depends the prosperity of every other form of industry in this country.  Almost every aspect of agriculture has been mentioned in the course of the debate.  We have had reference to the shortage of sugar beet, of butter and of other commodities.  I shall endeavour to confine myself to the position of the dairying industry. The Minister has been criticised because there is not a sufficiency of butter in the country to provide a full supply for our own people, not to speak of exporting butter as we used to do at one time.  The reason the Minister gives is that there has been an excessive consumption of butter in this country within the last two years.</P>
      <P>It is probably true that the people of the cities and towns have consumed more butter during the emergency period than they used to consume in other years.  But I think there are other reasons for the shortage.  I believe the main reason for the shortage of butter is that the farmer has found it increasingly difficult to produce milk and, subsequently, butter at the ruling prices.  At the moment the farmer is getting a little more for his milk than he received at any period within the last 10 or 15 years, but I suggest that it would pay a farmer better to engage in any other form of agricultural activity than in dairying. For instance, it would pay him better to let his land on the 11-months system. In my own county grazing land is let on the 11-months system at prices ranging from £9 to £12 an acre.  When you consider that it takes two acres to keep a cow for the year, you will realise that the farmer would be better off to put £18 or £24 in his pocket and let some other person utilise the land.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>The Minister says that there is an excessive consumption of butter.  There is, mainly on the part of the people in <Col N="476" /> the cities and towns.  There has not been any marked increase in consumption among the farmers or the farm labourers, because they cannot afford that.  The mere fact that there has been an excessive consumption, almost a double consumption within the last two years, is in itself a proof that butter is probably the cheapest commodity the people can get.  The Minister commented yesterday on the statement that was made that the excessive butter consumption was probably due to a shortage of fats.  He told us that there were lots of fats in the country. If there are lots of fats to be had, then there is definite proof, if there is an excessive use of butter, that the butter is the cheapest commodity the people can purchase.  It is the only commodity that is being retailed at or under the cost of production.  Deputy Norton said that agriculture is the foundation of prosperity in this country. Carrying the argument further, I might say that dairying is the foundation of all agriculture, in this country, and it follows logically that dairying is the foundation of that prosperity. The question that the Minister for Agriculture and others have to answer is this: is the dairying industry essential to our agricultural economy?</P>
    <P>Is there any fundamental alternative in our agricultural economy?  If there is an affirmative answer, that dairying-is essential in our agricultural economy &mdash;as I believe it is&mdash;then we have to find some way of maintaining and, I hope, expanding dairying, some way of making it an attractive proposition for the farmers.</P>
    <P>There has been a lamentable decline in dairying in the districts with which I am acquainted&mdash;Limerick, Tipperary and parts of Cork.  I did not observe many statistics produced by the Farmers' Party.  I would not give a crack of my fingers for statistics; I do not believe in them.  If one had the time and energy to go over a district, I honestly think he could confound all our statisticians.  Any person who tells me that there has not been a decline in the dairying industry is telling me something that I cannot believe. Every creamery I visit tells me the same story.  So far as herds of cattle <Col N="477" /> are concerned, where there used to be 25 or 30 there are now only ten or 20. It was a common thing in my own county, ten, 20 or 30 years ago, and also in Tipperary and the adjoining parts of Cork, to see herds of 50, 80 and even 100 dairy cattle.  You could travel 40, 50 or 100 miles to see a herd of 40 cattle now.  I do not know if there is a herd of 40 in my district. There are very few herds of 30; they consist generally of 20, as many people have gone out of business.  Every newspaper that one reads announces auctions of dairy herds, and those who are not selling out are reducing numbers.  That is the position in regard to this vital industry.  I asked this question before: Is it an essential industry or not?  If it goes down what will happen?</P>
    <P>Deputy Norton spoke for some time about tillage, and other Deputies dealt with the same subject.  If we omit the war years, during which every one of us is eating bread grown from wheat that we produce here, where will we be in regard to tillage?  Does anyone believe that after this war, any form of compulsion that the Government announces is going to make people here eat bread made from third-class flour when they can get better bread made from wheat grown in other countries?</P>
    <P>That may be an unpopular thing to say here or elsewhere, but I am as certain as I am speaking in this House now, that in five or ten years, whenever the war is over, the people of this country will demand and will get bread that is made from the best flour that the world produces.  I know as much about wheat as any Deputy that has prattled about that crop in this House during the last week or during the last five years.  Probably I know more about it than most Deputies.  I stated here ten years ago, when the Government Party first introduced their tillage policy, that it would be folly for us to grow third-class wheat when, for half the price that we are paying for it, we could get first-class wheat; that it would pay us much better to sell our produce at a fair price and to buy good wheat cheaper than the price at which <Col N="478" /> we could produce inferior wheat.  I uttered a challenge, which was never taken up, that if any Deputy here or elsewhere could produce one grain of wheat grown in this country that I or any other person would grade up to No. 2 Manitoba I would acknowledge my mistake.  I never heard of such wheat being grown here.  It cannot be produced because of our climate and our conditions.  Let those who rattle and prattle about wheat think that over.  The foundation of our agriculture must be dairying and, if you like, the production of cattle for export which would consume the tillage the people are asked to undertake. If there is any future for the growing of wheat and cereals it depends on the cattle that I hope will be raised here.  It must be made profitable for dairy farmers to produce livestock to eat the cereals that we hope-to continue to produce.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>I was coming to that. They could not exist without dairy farmers.  The present price of milk is 9d. a gallon.  It is the best price that dairy farmers have been paid for some years, but it is not enough.  As Deputy Norton stated that price is not sufficient to enable dairy farmers to pay labourers a sufficient wage on which to live in comfort.  It is not sufficient to give the labourers an income on which to live in comfort comparable to workers in villages and towns.  Of course the villages have now been practically wiped out.  Deputy Norton also stated that a labourer cannot provide a living for himself, his wife and children on 36/- a week.  He cannot, but there are many small dairy farmers with six or eight cows who have not 36/- a week to spend on their families. Anybody who understands the position <Col N="479" /> knows that.  Some of us in this Party do not like subsidies.  I believe that subsidies are the last refuge in these matters, but once a policy of extreme tariffs was adopted then there has to be a policy of <i>quid pro quo</i> for agriculture, and the only way to give that <i>quid pro quo</i> is by means of subsidies. Let those who dislike subsidies get that into their heads and think about it.  If we are to get away from subsidies on agricultural produce we will have to drop tariffs on manufactured goods.  We cannot have it both ways.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>Lower the cost of production by removing the taxes, and make production more profitable if you like by increased production.  People talk about increased production as if it was going to be produced by a wave of a wand.  The Irish farmer is not less intelligent than the farmers in any other country.  We have had comparisons made between this country, New Zealand and Denmark.  For God's sake let us drop such comparisons. Conditions in New Zealand and Denmark and conditions here are as different as the conditions between here and the Behring Straits or the Polar regions.  New Zealand is blessed by nature for milk production as there they can out-feed their cows all the year round and they do not produce cattle for sale.  It does not matter twopence to the Danish farmer whether a cow produces a rabbit or a calf, except in so far as it leaves him with a supply of heifers to renew a herd.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>New Zealand is in the same position. Here, rightly or wrongly, we have adopted the principle of the dual capacity cow, founded on the production of as much milk as possible, and as a result we produce the best off-spring and the best beasts in the world.  We cannot ever achieve the success in relation to gallons per cow that they can achieve in Denmark and New Zealand unless we stop producing the best cattle that can be produced.  I heard this question argued outside the House. The Minister for Education said at an election meeting in my own county <Col N="480" /> that low production was the fault of the farmers themselves, and that they ought to take a lesson from Denmark. He pointed out that, some years ago, production in Denmark was as low as it is here, but that the farmers there, without Government help, had raised production from under 300 gallons to 700 or 800 gallons.  He said that they did that by their own exertions, by denying themselves things and by going into the banks, mortgaging their farms and borrowing money.  That is what the Minister said to the electors of Limerick.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Bennett</NameTxt>
      <P>But he could not stagger me.  I came after the Minister and I pointed out that the comparison of this country with Denmark was a false comparison.  Then, I came to the titbit&mdash;that the Danes had mortgaged their farms and borrowed money to build up their herds.  I asked the audience whether the Minister had not cheek to tell them to mortgage their farms.  Some years ago, when farmers had a somewhat worse time than usual&mdash;and we have always had a bad time&mdash;the small farmer could face the bank manager and ask for a loan of £10 or £15 and the bigger farmer could ask for a loan of £50 or a £100 with a clear conscience.  The bank manager would tell me, when I asked for a loan of £100 on those occasions, that he would give it to me.  My land was security in those days, but times have changed.  It is useless now for the farmer, either of five acres or 50 acres, to walk into a bank and ask for a loan on the security of his land because he will be told that the land is no security.  He will have to get the assistance of somebody who has a deposit or an investment with which to secure him.  Yet, the Minister had the audacity to tell us that the Danes did this and that we should do likewise.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I now come to the argument regarding increased production.  I hope that some method of increasing the production of milk per cow will be arrived at.  I see on the Farmers' Benches a couple of Deputies who have taken a deep interest in this <Col N="481" /> matter.  Some of us have been engaged for years in an attempt to bring that about&mdash;with very little result. We thought, in the first instance, of intensive feeding.  But many farmers were unable to undertake that at the price available for milk.  I tried it, and it did not produce the results expected.  I have been 30 years at the job, and I know all about feeding.  I never was reduced to the state in which I had to starve either myself or a cow.  We have, then, the cow testing method&mdash; an excellent method.  I advised every farmer to go in for cow testing.  But all cow testing does is to tell you with certainty what you knew already but were not sure of&mdash;which was the bad cow and which was the good one. When I got rid of the bad cow, the cow which I obtained in her place was oftentimes little better.  Small farmers could not afford to replace such a cow.  There is no certain method of improving the milk yield so long as we have to produce a dual purpose cow&mdash;a cow to give a certain quantity of milk and the best possible calf afterwards.  I know a very eminent authority, not in this House, who will argue definitely that if the people outside the dairying industry will not come to its assistance, then the people in the industry should get away from producing good stock and confine themselves to the production of a beast that will give a good supply of milk.  We could go in for the Holstein or some other cow that would give a fair yield of milk.  But would it be fair to the people if we, in Limerick, Clare, Cork or Tipperary, gave up producing the best cattle in the world and confined ourselves to production of cattle for milk purposes only, such as the theorists tell us the farmers in New Zealand and Denmark have done?</P>
    <P>We cannot have it both ways.  We can dispense with the dual-purpose cow, producing a certain percentage of milk and the best store cattle in the world, and go in for cattle with a high milk yield.  It is for the Minister for Agriculture to lead the country on that question.  I think that it is wiser to continue on our present lines.  I think that we should produce as much <Col N="482" /> milk and butter as we can produce and then let us all get together in a common examination of the problem to see if we can improve the position and keep the industry alive, at least, for the duration of this emergency, so that we shall have, at worst, a sufficiency of butter for our own people. The Minister for Supplies asked, in an interjection yesterday, how the money was to be found to increase the price of milk.  I say that it can be done by raising the price of butter.  That may be unpopular, but the Minister has told us that the consumption of butter by people outside agriculture has doubled.  The Minister stated definitely yesterday that the people in the cities and towns had doubled their consumption of butter in the past four or five years.  Neither the farmer nor the farm labourer has been able to do that.  They live on a lower standard. Though they produce the butter, they cannot eat it, but the people of the cities and towns have been able to consume double their normal quantity. Why is that?  Because butter was the cheapest form of food they could buy. It was the only food they could buy at, or under, the cost of production.  If it is 3d. or 4d. more, they will buy all that we can produce in the next two or three years.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Dillon</NameTxt>
      <P>Would not 2d. a gallon mean 5d. a lb for butter?</P>
    </Speaker>
    <Speaker pid="GeorgeCBennett" hpid="Mr. Bernnett Mr. Bernnett">
      <NameTxt>Mr. Bernnett</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, it would, and if butter was at 2/5 a lb. you would have illimitable quantities of it, and the Minister would have to take rationing away.  If some shopkeeper could put up in his window &ldquo;Butter at 2/5 a lb.&rdquo; he would need to get the police and the horse guards to stop the people from coming in.  Let nobody tell me that butter is the one food that is costing the people too much.  It is the only food that they are getting at anything approaching a reasonable price.  It is so cheap that although the Minister says that there are lots of other fats available in this country, the people will not buy these fats, but will only buy butter because they consider it cheaper and better. Deputy Dillon has pointed out that there are only two ways of improving <Col N="483" /> the position.  One is by means of subsidies.  As I have said, I do not like the idea of subsidies, but as I have pointed out already, once you resort to tariffs for the protection of industries in this country, then you have to provide a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the farmer, and if you deny him a subsidy, then you have to do away with your tariff system, because the farmer will not stand for it and the country will not stand for it.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>On the other hand, if you do not do these things, there is only one hope for the dairy farmer, and that is to get back to the position&mdash;and does anybody want that?&mdash;where the Revenue Commissioners wanted us to pay 6/- a week for milkers, or, alternatively, where the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures advocated in this House, six or eight or ten years ago&mdash;he said it across the floor of the House, to me, above all men&mdash;that we should get our milkers to milk 15 or 20 cows.  You had the Revenue Commissioners advocating 6/- a week, and you had the Minister for Co-ordination of Defensive Measures advocating getting our milkers to milk 15 or 20 cows.  If we got to that position, then, possibly, we could produce cheap butter, but does anybody suggest that we should get back to that position? Deputy Norton says that 36/- a week is too low a wage.  I agree.  Agricultural labourers are often referred to in this country as being unskilled, whereas they are amongst the most skilled workers in the country. The agricultural worker is a Jack-of-all-trades. He has to be a bit of a doctor, a bit of a veterinary surgeon, a bit of a milker, a bit of a carpenter, a bit of a wheelwright, a bit of almost every trade.  There is no end to the jobs that he has to do.  Put that man in a factory for ten minutes, or at any rate for two hours, and you will find that he will be able to do his job. These men go over to England in hundreds and thousands to work in the factories there, and in about three weeks' time they are found to be as good as the most skilled labourers in the world&mdash;so good that they are put in responsible positions in the factories, <Col N="484" /> and doing the hardest work that there is to be done in England.  Yet, here, they are described as unskilled workers &mdash;God help us&mdash;and until we get away from that position there is very little hope for prosperity in this country.</P>
    <P>Let us, if we can&mdash;and, with a combination of all the best brains in this country, we certainly can&mdash;lift up our agriculturists, whether by means of subsidies, or in any other way.  I do not care a damn how it is done, so long as the farmer can get a fair price for the commodities which he produces: sufficient to give him and his family a fair competence and to provide him with reasonable comfort and to enable him to pay his workers&mdash;the hardest workers in this country, particularly the milkers, who have to be up at five o'clock in the morning and who finish their work long after everybody else is finished&mdash;a decent wage. Until we get to that position, whatever your hopes may be, you will not get real prosperity in this country.</P>

With the exception of a very few Deputies&mdash; a small minority, I think, of Fine Gael &mdash;all of us have accepted that principle, and that is a very hopeful and promising sign for the future of this country, and I hope that no future Dáil will depart from that policy of protection for our farmers, without having all the facts in connection with free trade, as encouraged by Deputies Dillon and Bennett and a few other Deputies, before them, and without a thorough examination of these facts.  I hope that the policy advocated and encouraged by Deputies Dillon and Bennett will not be embarked upon again by Deputies in this House without having all the facts before them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>It has been suggested by Deputy Norton and, I think, by Deputy Bennett, and probably by qther Deputies. that if the farmer were guaranteed <Col N="485" /> fixed prices for his products it would enable him to pay a higher wage to his labourers, and that that policy should be embarked on now.  I think I should be opposed to that, and I think that the vast majority of farmers in this country would be opposed to it.  In my opinion, whatever interference by the Government has occurred heretofore in regard to fixed prices, it has been opposed by the farmers, and the Government has been accused of having too many inspectors and interfering too much with the farmers' business. You cannot have regimentation in farming or in the production of commodities produced on the farm in the same way as you can have regimentation in a factory.  It is absolutely impossible to have regimentation of that kind in connection with farming, and I think it would be a bad day for the farmer if you were to have that kind of regimentation, because it would mean that you would have to have hordes of officials, and I am afraid that it would take years and years to reach such a state of efficiency as would justify the tackling of the problem in that way.</P>
    <P>Surely the farmer, as much as anybody else, requires a free market to some extent, and I think that he would be well able to hold his own. With the free market that you have at the moment, how can it be said that farming is in a bad way?  If, as Deputy Bennett admits, grazing is going at £12 an acre on the 11-months' system, farming cannot be in a bad way.  If you have to look for conaere in the West of Ireland, it is amazing the prices that are offered for it, and that is in a free market.  Therefore, I would warn people against this plea for regimentation, so far as these things are concerned.  I think that if regimentation were to be introduced, whereby farmers would be controlled in connection with everything that they did on their farms, they would rue the day. At the moment, the farmer is fairly free, and I think that there is no quarrel, as far as the vast majority of farmers in this country are concerned, except on the question of prices.  That is a question that is debatable and arguable.  There were arguments about wheat prices, beet prices and oats <Col N="486" /> prices, but those are things that can be argued in the Minister's office or here in the Dáil.  It seems to me that the question of prices is the only one on which there is any difference, but I think that farming is in a fairly healthy condition otherwise.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cogan made an excellent suggestion about wheat growing.  He said that wheat growing should be on the same basis as beet growing and that it should be by contract; but I am afraid that that would be a bad system and, again, I fear that you would have too much regimentation. If that were to be adopted, it would mean that every man who contracted. for the growing of an acre of wheat must contract for the selling of that acre of wheat at the same time.  That would be the implication.</P>
    <P>Are all the people in the country who produce wheat prepared to hand over that wheat to the mills at the fixed price in the same way as the beet growers are prepared to hand over their produce?  If contracts of that kind are made, will it not be necessary to have a vast number of officials to go into the farming areas, and, within three months of embarking on that course, will not the farmers and probably the farmers' representatives complain that we are again increasing officialdom to the detriment of the farmers and other members of the community?  I think we should not go too far with this question of regimentation.  If a reasonable price is given for wheat&mdash;if the price offered is not a reasonable one, the case can be argued&mdash;and if the vicious circle of argument against wheat-growing, at a time when we are dependent solely on Irish wheat, is stopped at least for the period of the emergency, and if Deputies on the opposite benches who have a bad record as far as wheat-growing is concerned will forget that, as we are prepared to forget it during this emergency, and go in for the production of wheat at a reasonable price, I think we will get enough wheat for our people.  Judging by the rough figures which are available I have hopes that there will be an excellent supply of wheat in the coming season.</P>
    <P>On the question of land division it <Col N="487" /> has been said by the Leader of the Farmers' Party that we would not require all the inspectors if the two Governments which were in power for the last 20 years had expedited the division of land; that, if they had given land to the emigrants and kept them here, those people would have tilled the land without any inspectors. On examination, I think the Leader of the Farmers' Party will find that that statement is not correct.  To my own knowledge, one particular county in which land was given to landless men has the worst record for tillage in the whole of the Twenty-Six Counties. I refer to the County Roscommon. Land was given to the landless men there, and that is the county where extra inspectors were required and where the courts had to be resorted to in order to force those men to till a perch of the holdings that they got. That is proof that those landless men, when they got land, failed to do their work for the nation.  They did not even give any indication that they were prepared to work the land which they got.</P>
    <P>The Minister was told by a Deputy representing Roscommon &mdash; Deputy Meighan, who knows Roscommon very Well&mdash;that the majority of the farmers in that county are opposed to him and his policy.  I think the Deputy was probably correct in that.  Without meaning to be in any way disrespectful to him, I should like to point out to the Deputy that the majority of the farmers of Roscommon are the worst farmers in Ireland.  They were the last to respond to any scheme for the production of food in this country.  It was only when coercion was threatened that they helped in any way in the production of vital food for the people.  It was not on the question of price they held back; they were very slow to respond to the call for tillage at all.</P>
    <P>I know it is difficult to divide land now, but, if the Minister would consult the tillage inspectors throughout the country, I think the lessons that are to be learned now about land division, and about the men who are willing to work the land, are lessons which <Col N="488" /> will enable any Government in the future to divide land expeditiously amongst the men who will work it in their own interests and in the interests of the nation.  I may have misinterpreted the Leader of the Farmers' Party when I understood him to make a plea for the division of laud amongst landless men.  I am strongly opposed to landless men getting land in this country, and I hope that the Minister concerned will never adopt that policy, while there are thousands of uneconomic holders, bog holders, if you like By the time their holdings are made economic there will be no more land left for division.  Our uneconomic landholders should receive first consideration. They have the first claim on the land, and not the landless men, with the exception of course of men who may lose their employment because a particular estate is being divided.  I hope the Farmers' Party will study that question before they demand that landless men should get land, because they will find many rude shocks awaiting them if that policy is carried out, to the detriment and exclusion of uneconomic landholders in congested districts.</P>
    <P>Deputy Cosgrave made a great case for increasing the milk supply.  I only wish he had been in the House when Deputy Bennett was speaking. Deputy Bennett very effectively answered Deputy Cosgrave, and I presume that, as a dairy farmer.  Deputy Bennett knows more about that subject than I do, and certainly more than Deputy Cosgrave.  He said that you cannot have it both ways; that you cannot increase the milk production and keep the herds of cattle we have in this country at the moment; that you must sacrifice the cattle trade if you go in for increasing milk production.  That should do away with the silly arguments advanced here by certain Deputies that the Government are responsible for the low milk yield, and that it is disgraceful that the Minster for Agriculture does not do something about it.</P>
    <P>There is another important matter which has not been dealt with&mdash;I think it is one of the most important branches of agriculture&mdash;and that is <Col N="489" /> the egg industry.  It has been shouldered out of this debate altogether, although it is a very important industry and although it is now in a very precarious condition.  In the circumstances at the moment, I think there is too much interference with that industry by the Department of Agriculture. In war time they are trying to keep in operation peace time regulations and rules, in spite of the fact that many things are making egg production difficult and practically impossible in certain areas.</P>
    <P>The amount of first grade eggs produced in this country to-day is negligible, and that is due principally to the shortage of food.  Oats are not now being fed to fowl to any extent.  It has come to my notice that, in the congested areas, wheat is more extensively fed to fowl than oats.  That is a pity. The oats are not there, and the fowl are fed on food which will not enable first grade eggs to be produced.  While that is so, inspectors of the Department are going around as actively as ever, and they find that, after a few days, eggs which had been labelled &ldquo;first grade&rdquo; are only second grade owing to the unsuitable quality of the food on which the fowl were fed.  The Minister should look into that question immediately and take some steps to call off the rigid inspection that there is in connection with the egg industry.  It is one of the most valuable sections of our agricultural industry, particularly in congested areas, because the people have a weekly egg account while they may have only a quarterly account in connection with other branches of their industry.  Again, I would urge the Minister to pay more attention to this very vital branch of the agricultural programme.</P>

      <P>I hope to be able to convince the House that Deputy Ó Cléingh was wrong when he objected to the giving of land to landless men. What does he say about the ploughman who is skilled in the production of food?  I have before me the case of a ploughman in County Dublin who is now 73 years of age and who has applied for the old age pension.  He <Col N="490" /> has half an acre of ground, and I have here the report of the Government inspector who says that he is capable of getting £61 10s. 0d. worth of produce out of that half acre.  But Deputy Ó Cléirigh would not give land to the ploughmen of this country.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>Deputy O Cléirigh has referred to land division and I am replying to what he said.  I say when land is to be divided no man has a greater claim than the ploughman and the agricultural labourer because they are capable of using the land.  I shall not say very much on that point.  In all that has been said here this evening about land, we have heard very little about the agricultural labourer. I should like to draw the Minister's attention in particular to the sad plight of agricultural labourers, their wives and dependents, in County Dublin.  For hours to-day we have listened to statements by Deputies to the effect that the farmer and the agricultural labourer belong to the most important section of the community in the nation.  We are all agreed on that point, but do we agree that they should be treated as slaves?  If any Minister doubts my statement, I can take him to the homes of agricultural labourers in County Dublin to-night in which the occupants have not their breakfast for to-morrow.  Let us be honest and face up to the position.  Everyone admits that without the agricultural labourer, we could not exist.  Take the medical man.  He is looked up to in this country because he cures disease. I hold that the agricultural labourer is more important because by the production of food he prevents disease; yet we treat the agricultural labourer in the same way as if he were a slave.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I hold that the agricultural labourer, <Col N="492" /> and those who give their time to agricultural work, should get at least equal treatment to every other section of the community.  I have worked as an agricultural labourer for 33/- a week, but when I come here I get £10 10s. a week. Yet I say I was a greater asset to the nation when I was producing food than I am here.  Let us be honest about the position.  I say it is a sad thing that in a Christian country like this we should praise and boost up these unfortunate men, pretending that we have an interest in them, while we are deceiving them.  I have heard it suggested by, I think, Deputy Maguire that we should set up a commission to do this or that.  Have we not been elected to this House to do these things ourselves?  I say the first thing that should be done by this House is to ensure that the agricultural worker will have sufficient means to preserve his wife and children from hunger.</P>
    <P>Is it not sad to think that an unfortunate man who has to work from Monday morning to Saturday night, every day in the year, without any holidays, is obliged to go out on Sunday morning to get the loan of a bike to come into Dublin because his clothes are so bad that he cannot go out amongst his neighbours?  The man I describe is no wastrel.  I have no place for the wastrel.  The man I refer to is a Pioneer.  For the whole of the week he is engaged in the most essential work of producing food for the nation; he is the father of seven children, and yet on Sunday morning in this Catholic Christian country he is forced to get the loan of a bicycle to hide himself from his neighbours. And then we say that the Fianna Fáil policy has succeeded!</P>
    <P>I do not intend to dwell further on that point except to say that the agricultural labourer is very badly treated indeed.  Quite recently in a case where the wife of an agricultural labourer was ill I had the sad experience of approaching a certain Department to see if I could get a gallon of paraffin for use in that house.  I was told that that could not be allowed.  I say in particular that agricultural labourers and those who derive their living from small farms, such as exist in County <Col N="493" /> Mayo, are very badly treated.  It is very poor compensation for the small farmer and his wife in Mayo that they are to be used for nothing better than to rear up beautiful boys and girls to build up other nations because we can do nothing for them here.  I hold that the mothers of Mayo are entitled to better compensation from a national Government.</P>
    <P>On the question of cottage purchase, when the Fianna Fáil Party went to the country and asked for an over-all majority they promised the farm labourers and cottage holders that they would bring forward a Cottage Bill that would be acceptable to the cottage tenants and farm labourers. But they failed in that promise.  They gave the farmer a reduction of 50 per cent. in his annuity but they did not fulfil their promise to agricultural labourers.  They would give them a reduction of only 25 per cent.  I happened to be one of those who approached the Minister to make an appeal to him in connection with this matter, and he said that as long as he was Minister he would not think of giving a greater concession to the farm labourers of this country.</P>
    <P>I should like to refer for a moment to matters concerning the Local Government Department, and in that connection to mention specially the case of old age pensioners.  When the Fine Gael Government were in power they took 1/- off the old age pensioners, which I say was bad politics to say the least of it, because I do believe it had a great effect in bringing about the downfall of the Fine Gael Government. I say now that the old age pensioners are amongst the worst treated section of the community.  I am sure other Deputies are aware of the position in other counties, but I know as far as County Dublin is concerned&mdash;and I speak with a knowledge extending over many years of County Dublin&mdash; it does not matter who in County Dublin reaches the age at which he or she is entitled to apply for a pension, he will not get it in full.  Take the case of the ploughman I have referred to.  He worked until he was 73 and he was not fit to work any longer.  Then he applied for the old age pension, <Col N="494" /> and his means are returned as £61 10s. 6d. out of his half-acre garden. That is only one case.  I have here the case of an ex-farm labourer residing in Cappagh, Finglas.  He worked until he was two years over the age, and then he applied for the pension.  The pensions officer informed him that, although he has not a quarter of an acre, not a rood of a garden, it is capable of producing 7/- of an income per week, and he is allowed only 3/- pension.  The Old Age Pensions Committee of which I happen to be a member&mdash;though we all differ in our stations of life&mdash;were good enough to grant him a pension of 10/- and here, to-day, there is an appeal against it.</P>
    <P>There is an old man after a life-long struggle, without a day's comfort in this world, offered 3/- a week by a native Government when he comes to the age of 72, while the ex-Minister can get ten guineas pension.  The highest wage this man ever earned in his lifetime was under £2 and he reared a very large family.  Is that Justice or honesty?  Old age pensioners are being treated much worse now than by the previous Government, because there is a rigid means test.  We have the case of a man in receipt of 6/- a week outdoor relief.  Before he receives that relief he must be destitute, because the poor relief is only for the destitute.  He applies for a pension and his means are returned as 6/- a week.  I would appeal to the Minister for God's sake and for Ireland's sake to change that cruel position.</P>
    <P>Take the case of widows' pensions. We have the name of an Act in force in this country.  As far as the contributory section is concerned, it is something towards a pension, although the amount is not half sufficient, but as far as the non-contributory side is concerned, it is an insult for any Government to present it to the people.  I have here a letter sent by the Minister for Local Government to the widow of an agricultural labourer in County Dublin, which reads:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;With reference to the non-contributory pension payable to you under the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Act, I am directed by the Minister for Local Government and <Col N="495" /> Public Health to inform you that as the result of re-investigation it has been decided that your net weekly means, as calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Act, amount to 5/4.  As this sum exceeds the rate of pension of 5/- per week to which you would be entitled had you no net weekly means, you cease to be entitled to a pension as from 28th October, 1938.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>It is very strange that this letter should coincide with the passage of a Bill to give pensions of £500 a year to ex-Ministers without any means test. They take the 5/- away from the widow in County Dublin and give it to the Minister.</P>
    <P>I have gone back to 1938, but between 1938 and 1943 I have come across many similar cases.  I would take the case of 1943.  Here is a letter sent out on the 31st May, 1943:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Further to my letter of the 8th April regarding the rate of pension awarded to Mrs. Julia Lawless, Grange Road Raheny, under the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts, I am desired by Dr. Ward to state that her net weekly means amounted to 4/4, and she is consequently entitled to a pension at the rate of 1/- per week only.  I am to add that the Widows' and Orphans' Pensions Acts provide that a referee's decision on any matter referred to him shall be final and conclusive. Consequently Mrs. Lawless's case cannot be reopened unless a reduction in her means occurs&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;a reduction in 4/4, to the mother of an invalid daughter.</P>
    <P>This lady lives at Raheny and has an invalid daughter in a chair for 30 years.  Her only means in the world are four hens.  There is a bit of an old garden that neither herself nor her daughter is able to till.  Yet we are told we have a Christian Government. This Government asks those people to live on 1/- a week.  Is that justice?  If that is justice, then I am the greatest fool that was ever born.  I would appeal to the Minister to have this case investigated and to have this injustice remedied forthwith, otherwise <Col N="496" /> those people must go to the Dublin Union.</P>

The same complaints can be made in the case of blind pensions and National Health Insurance.  How, in God's name can people live on 15/- a week?  They are forced to go to the relieving officer and make paupers of themselves.  Mind you, there was a period when the Irish people in days gone by would not do that, but we have gone a long way from that now. How can a man with five children live on 15/- a week?  In the first week he does not even get the full amount. Therefore, I would appeal to the Minister in charge of the Department of Local Government to have that type of people looked after.

      <P>I am not appealing for legislation.  It is a case of administration and justice.  I think that I am justified in raising this question of hospitals.  We are supposed to be in possession of many million pounds for the provision of hospitals.  Yet in spite of that fact, it is a sad thing that if a little girl in the County Dublin, residing with her family, is certified to be suffering from tuberculosis, there is no hospital to take her to.  Perhaps if her treatment were undertaken in time she could be cured.  I would appeal to <Col N="498" /> the Minister to do something in connection with that.  It is a dreadful thing that when persons are certified by the doctors to be suffering from tuberculosis they are sometimes left in their homes for 12 months, and oftentimes two years, before being removed for treatment.  That is no credit to whoever is responsible.  So far as the working classes in the County Dublin are concerned, the only hospital whose door is open to-them is the Dublin Union Hospital. My next point deals with the question of supplies.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Tunney</NameTxt>
      <P>There is one matter that I want to bring to the notice of the Minister for Defence, and that is the unequal treatment given to the I.R.A.  We know that there are some men who never fired a shot drawing huge and lavish pensions, while there are other men who gave good and faithful service and they have been denied a pension.  That is a rather serious statement to make, and I ask the Minister to look into those cases. The statement is one that I can prove. I know there are men in receipt of pensions, and I say it is robbery that they should be getting them.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Not only did they not fire a shot but the people who were in the movement were afraid of them.  Deputies may laugh, but I do not care as long as I am telling the truth.  I defy contradiction of any statement that I make here.  In connection with I.R.A.  pensions, I have here a letter which I received from a lady on the 5th July. This lady's husband served in the Irish Army in which he held the rank of sergeant in 1941.  He was sent to the County Wicklow where a mine was washed ashore, and during its removal he was killed.  His widow was left with three young children, and from our Irish Government she was given neither a pension nor compensation. That is the position of the dependents of a man who gave his life in the service of this country.  They have received nothing.  I hope that is not Government policy, and I would <Col N="499" /> appeal to the Minister to take a note of the case.</P>
    <P>I would like to have some statement from the Taoiseach as far as the national position is concerned.  I think he owes a statement to this House because of statements made by his supporters in the County Dublin during the recent election.  They went out and told the people&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I do not blame the Government for certain things.  I know that there are certain essential commodities that must be procured from outside, but as regards the things that we are capable of producing from the land I think the Government have failed hopelessly.  We heard a lot to-day about the 12,000,000 acres of arable land which we have in the country.  In view of the fact that we have that area of land, and a population of less than 3,000,000 people, it is a poor consolation to think that we are not fit to find sufficient food or work for them <Col N="500" /> at the present time.  If that is the position now, I dread to think what it is going to be when the war is over which, I hope, will be in the near future, when the 250,000 of our people who have had to emigrate return. Surely, if ever a Government were given the opportunity to find work and food for the people within the country it is at the present time.  Our people have had to leave and take up work in another country making implements for the destruction of life.  That is the position of many of our beautiful boys and girls, the finest and purest in the world, who would be capable of building up any nation.  They have been forced to go to a foreign country where they are employed making instruments for the destruction of life.  To-morrow, if the war were over they would only be regarded as scrap.  Here in Christian Catholic Ireland we are not capable of patting them to work, producing something that would be for the betterment and happiness of humanity, and while that is so we say that the Government is a success.</P>
      <P>If this nation is to survive, it cannot do so on emigration and doles and the starvation allowances that are being given to our poor people.  Do not forget that within the Constitution of this nation there is a clause under which we are in duty bound to support the aged and the widow.  I want to say, in the presence of the Taoiseach to-night, that I could take him to hundreds of homes where people are starving.  They are not being supported even though there is that clause in the Constitution drafted by himself.  There is a duty on the nation to see that those people should not be hungry, and I hope the Government's. duty in that respect will soon be realised.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>In this little country, why should one small section have every comfort that the world can give, while a &ldquo;standstill&rdquo; order is made against the workers so that they can get no increase in their wages?  They are getting nothing at all.  I say it would be no-wonder if the Irish people had risen against the Government.  They have left themselves open to it.  They got into power on promises which they <Col N="501" /> have made a very poor effort to fulfil.</P>

      <P>They got into power in this nation on deceitful and deceptive promises.  There is no question about that.  They promised that they would raise the standard of life for the masses of the people.  They did.  They raised the standard of life for certain people, the relations and friends of certain Deputies and Ministers who could get farms of land and positions. As a matter of fact, I would nearly go so far as to say that they had special Acts of Parliament to get jobs for a few of them who fell by the wayside. That is not equal treatment for all our citizens.  I implore the Government to give equal treatment to all our citizens.  If there is going to be poverty then let us all share it.  Why should one section have luxuries?  Why should the members of this House go on holidays from now until the harvest &mdash;for a period of two months&mdash;while the farm labourer never gets a holiday during his whole lifetime?  Let us be fair.  Is that equal treatment? It is not.  Just as there is a responsibility on parents to set a good example to their families if they expect their families to be an asset to the nation, there is a responsibility on the heads of the State to set an example to the citizens. If there is to be sacrifice, let us all share it and let us all be poor together.</P>

Yesterday evening we heard it stated that certain men, if they were at large, would involve this country in war.  Deputy Dillon can go out publicly and ask the country to go into the war.  That is a privilege which many people have not got.  What I say is that those of us who supported the Sinn Féin policy feel that this Government has betrayed all the ideals of Sinn Féin.  At that time, we led the Irish people to believe that this was a self-supporting nation. Now that we are given our opportunity, what will be the position when this war is over?  Do you think the Irish people will burn turf again after the heart-scald they have been caused and after the way the matter of turf has been handled?  I honestly believe, and I say it in all seriousness, that if a cart of Irish turf goes through some of the streets of Dublin when the war is over, the people will go out and upset it, such is their hatred of turf and of the way in which they have been robbed in connection with the turf business.  I will give one illustration.</P>

      <P>Since this Dáil assembled last week, the greater part of the time has been spent in discussing the problem of agriculture, and in so far as I have heard any of the debates to-day or on the previous days, I heard the policy of the Minister for Agriculture being lambasted hip and thigh, condemned root and branch, examined in all its principles and details and found wanting in respect of all these things.  Notwithstanding that, Deputy Cleary can tell the House to-night that it is a rather remarkable thing, and one full of good omen for the future, that the Minister has had the approval of every Party in the House for the principles of his policy.</P>
      <P>I read in the newspapers a statement made by the Reverend President of the Irish Agricultural Organisation Society in respect of milk prices this year.  He said that if the farmers could only sell for what was offered to them, they would have conferred a benefit on mankind and would have done something never before done in the history of civilisation, that is, they would have shown it was possible to sell at under the cost of production and, apparently, to make some livelihood for themselves.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I gathered from the Minister for Agriculture in the last couple of days, when challenged with the statistics <Col N="505" /> which the Department of Industry and Commerce produce with regard to milk and butter, that all he can say is that the statistics in the early part of the years were overstated and that there have been changes.  But, in any event, this emerges from the statements, and even the revised statements: that there has been less milk in certain years sent for manufacture into industrial products than there was in 1929, and yet the Minister gets more butter out of less milk.  That is another of the modern miracles the Minister has worked.</P>
    <P>I take a series of selections from outside the House.  The problems of agriculture and its plight have been dealt with by many eminent clergymen in the country.  The Bishop of Kilmore, in addressing his flock in a pastoral this year, talked about the devastating flight from the land and asked whether there was a cure for it.  He said: &ldquo;The typical Irish home will disappear if the people continue to leave the land, and hence every effort to improve the prospects of agriculture, to make farming more pleasant and profitable, to make country life brighter, is a blow struck for the Irish home.&rdquo;  He went on to show what were the defects in the policy of the present Government in regard to that. The Archbishop of Tuam had much the same comments to make, founding his comments also on the devastating flight from the land, and saying that if it went on, if the same drift were allowed to persist, we would certainly see at no distant date many country schools closed.</P>
    <P>Dr. Lucey, lecturing on farming economics in many places in this country, urged a new land policy&mdash;I use only one phrase&mdash;&ldquo;a blight has fallen both on the land and on the people who get their livelihood from the land.&rdquo;  Dr. Doorly, of Elphin, comments very much along the same lines.  The Bishop of Galway mentioned this matter speaking to an address by Dr. Lucey to some Society in Galway.  He said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must plan nowadays not merely for economy and efficiency but also for liberty and natural human rights.  And the most important <Col N="506" /> natural right is the right of a man to bring up his children in his own home and not to have them taken from him by the State.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said later:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The way of helping fathers is to encourage the production of houses, clothing, food at moderate prices. Production and hard work are what we want in this country, and we should beware of any scheme which will encourage idleness.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He added this, and he is not reputed. to be a very severe critic of the Government:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;It is a poor commentary on us as a people that in this fertile land so blessed, by God we have not enough butter or bacon, or grain or sugar.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>He said later that he had always maintained that if Ireland were drained of its people it would be always starved and anæmic.</P>
    <P>We know the result of the policy of the Minister for Agriculture at this moment is that the emigration which had risen to enormous heights here at the outbreak of the war and which last autumn had fallen somewhat, is now in full flight again.  There is an average of 5,000 people leaving here per month&mdash;60,000 in the year&mdash;and that at a time when I understand from farmers they find it hard to get labour to help them to get in the harvest. There are 60,000 going out of this country.  We see the flight from the land, the decay that has fallen upon farms and the people who live there. At the end of that we are told by Deputy Ó Cléirigh that the Minister's policy has the approval of every Party in this House.  Neither here nor outside the House has the policy of the Minister for Agriculture the approval of the people.</P>

      <P>Whatever may be his policy and whatever may be its results <Col N="507" /> in the future, the pessimistic outlook of that man on the future of this country is what matters.  I believe the speech to which I referred on a recent occasion was questioned by the Minister for Agriculture to-day in the House.  I want to emphasise the conditions under which this particular matter was raised.  It was not a question of a speech made on a public platform when the Minister's tongue might have been betrayed into saying things he did not entirely mean.  It was not that he was interrupted and that these things shot out by way of answer to the interruption.  This was when he was invited to address a particular Students' Society in University College, Cork, when he went down with a prepared paper which he read, in the preparation of which he no doubt had the help of his Department officials.  He called it &ldquo;The Flight from the Land&rdquo;, and he started off by saying that &ldquo;those who advocate a back to the land movement must have some vague idea that we can place more people on the land than are there at present.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Let me pause there.  At the time the Minister was speaking he had lifted from the land 30,000 to 40,000 people who used to be on it.  He had cleared such a number as that.  But even with the lowered number he said that there must be some apparently vague idea in those who talk about a back-to-the-land policy that we can place more people on the land than are there at present.  He said:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If we do, it can only mean a reduction in the average size of holdings followed by a smaller income per person for those engaged in agriculture.&rdquo;</P>
      <P>Yet, his leader tells the people of this country that he wants this country to be a nation of 8,000,000 people, and I suppose he is going to have a back-to-the-land policy when that 8,000,000 population arrives here.  The Minister for Agriculture continued:</P>
      <P>&ldquo;If the farmer's holding is very small and if he has to maintain a family, he cannot do more than produce food for himself and his family, and he has no surplus to sell.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>
      <Col N="508" /> He criticised very severely this form of what he called &ldquo;subsistence farming&rdquo;. Then he went on to say that this country had to buy certain necessary imports and the only way we could get the currency to pay for them was by exporting.  He said there was nothing to export, except agricultural products, and he turned to that phase of his paper.</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We must, therefore,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when this war is over, continue as far as we can to export agricultural produce.  We shall do so, however, in the knowledge that we cannot control the price of our exports.  We must, in fact, compete against the big exporting countries all over the world.  We may be compelled to discontinue some of the exports that before this war had become entirely uneconomic.  The first of these, and the one that will interest the present audience most, is dairy products.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he continued about this being a country of small farmers, with a long winter during which the cows must be housed and fed, and he said:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We cannot compete on equal terms with the Antipodes.  The question is often asked why our farmers cannot compete with New Zealand in the production of butter.  Before the war we were both on the British market, and it may appear strange that New Zealand so far away could increase her exports and evidently build up a profitable business while our exports declined, even though we helped producers through an export bounty.  The farms are bigger in New Zealand and can be more easily mechanised than ours. They have practically no winter to provide for.  Their milk yields per cow are higher.  They can, therefore, produce a much larger volume per person engaged in agriculture than our farmers, can here.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>The next part of his lecture was that we had subsidised certain of these dairy products as an export because we believed it was only a temporary decline and that the subsidy would only have to continue for a few years. Having said that, he said he must confess himself wrong in that idea.</P>
    <P>
      <Col N="509" />&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we must admit now that the difficulty was more than temporary and that the same conditions may prevail when the war is over.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he turned to this&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The elimination of the export of dairy products, if such a course should eventually become necessary, would not be so disastrous to farming economy as might at first sight be feared.  The question would obviously have to be examined very carefully and the object&rdquo;</P>
    <P>&mdash;the object of eliminating our dairy products as exports&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;achieved by deliberate and careful planning.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>That is the future he looks forward to in this country.  He said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;We can only reach the New Zealand output per person by undoing the work of the Land Commission over the last 20 or 30 years, that is, to clear the small holdings and to re-create the larger ranches. It is not possible to do this, and from the social point of view not desirable.  We cannot improve the climate, and we dare not enlarge our farms.  We should, and I hope we can, improve our milk yields.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They are the factors that make for uneconomic production in this country and the ones the Minister spoke of, and the only one, I suppose, in respect of which he can hold out any possibility of improvement was milk yield. But he did not say how, and he has no programme for it.  Even if we are going to eliminate dairy products as an export, the Minister said it will not be so disastrous after all if we carefully achieve that object by deliberate planning.  I would have expected that he would at least tell us what the substitute policy is, what he will replace these valued exports by, because we must export something to buy the necessary imports.</P>
    <P>Having killed off dairy products exports in that way, he said:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The second line that may have to be reviewed is bacon... When the war is over, the price of exported bacon will probably be lower <Col N="510" /> still, and I have no doubt the free import of maize meal will be advocated for the feeding of pigs.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>Then he talks about the home consumer subsidising the export.  Eventually he comes to this:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;If such should occur, therefore, the obvious thing to do is to reduce pig stock to about our present number, which is only sufficient to supply the wants of our own consumers.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>So pigs are gone, too, in the post-war the Minister looks forward to, and dairy exports may have to be regarded as permanently uneconomic, but it will not be so bad when the first jolt is over.  We will probably then get some substitute policy for it, but the Minister for Agriculture does not know what it is.</P>
    <P>That is the outlook&mdash;that is the pessimistic outlook&mdash;probably bred in that Minister by looking back on his own conduct from the year 1932 on. When he looks at the devastation he has caused in a once healthy agriculture, it is no wonder he may despair of the future as long as it is in his own hands.  He got, as far as agriculture was concerned, a total output of £62,000,000, weighing agricultural exports and deducting agricultural imports.  When he came into office it went down to £38,000,000, £42,500,000, £47,000,000, £53,000,000.  It is only when we come to the war year, with inflated prices, we get to £60,000,000 of a surplus.  In the seven years, 1925 to 1931, the total of our agricultural exports over agricultural imports gave us a balance of £113,000,000.  In the seven years from 1932 to 1939 the excess of these exports over imports was almost £66,000,000.  Notwithstanding that, men representing farmers behind the Minister say that he put agriculture on its feet.  It is no wonder that bishops, clergymen, economists and men interested in farming are lamenting the state to which agriculture has been brought.  It is no wonder that the Minister who has brought most of this devastation on us should feel pessimistic with regard to the future as long as that trend is to continue, and he gives no indication of any new policy to put <Col N="511" /> these particular lines of approach of his into reverse.</P>
    <P>Another of his colleagues decided that, while it was bad enough to have the dairy products trade wiped out and the pig industry wiped out, it was not going far enough.  Deputy MacEntee decided that he would sport his figure at a function in University College, Dublin.  He went there and told the audience that, so far as he could see, the price for cattle was going to go down after the war, in which case, he said, we must look forward to the virtual extermination of the cattle trade.  When the two of them have done their business, when the dairy products export trade possibly is wiped out and pig production providing only for the needs of our home consumers, these two Ministers do not tell us on what we are to live.  We are to have self-sufficiency.  We are to have the self-sufficiency that enabled the Minister for Supplies in the month of July, 1941, to say that we were facing a severe shortage in food supplies for human consumption, in animal feeding stuffs, in artificial manures, in fuel, and in most of the raw materials of industry.  That is what the attempted self-sufficiency brought us at that time.</P>
    <P>Artificial manures were one of the things the Minister said we had not too much of.  If you examine the statistics, you will find that, during the period of the giant tillage programme of Fianna Fáil, the importation of fertilisers went down by one-third from what it had been, say, in the years before they came into office, and the Minister for Industry and Commerce kept a tax on imported superphosphates until after the beginning of the war.  I believe that was denied to-day.  If the Minister denies it further, then let him get the Finance Accounts for the year 1939-40 and he will find that they record as a Customs duty receipt a certain amount of money gathered on superphosphates. If he goes over the five years before, he will find that an average sum of £2,200 was brought in.  But the man who is bemoaning that we have not <Col N="512" /> fertilisers kept a tax on them until they were unprocurable.</P>

      <P>I am sure the new farmer Deputies would like to learn of two documents to which I should like to give them a brief introduction to-night.  There is a certain amount of decay and corruption when vultures gather together.  I want to parade two groups of them before this House.  I understand that last night there was some talk about the Pigs Marketing Board, and that Deputy Dillon was speaking of its depredations in the country when the Taoiseach interrupted him to say that what Deputy Dillon was speaking of was what the board had avoided.  What that particular matter was, I do not know.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>But I know that the particular intrigues and achievements of the board were brought to light by a Government Commission, and Deputies, particularly those who are new to the House, may be interested in this sorry <Col N="513" /> tale.  Before I come to what was revealed by the Government Commission, let me explain that the board was set up with the grant idea of rectifying the position wherein, when prices were good, farmers got into production and pigs were plentiful in the markets, but when the prices went down the farmers got out.  Then, when they went up again, everybody rushed in once more.  The board set up a scheme to equalise prices through what was called a hypothetical fund. There was a hypothetical price and money was paid into the fund.  When prices were low, the idea was that money would be paid out to raise them in order to keep the farmers in production.</P>
    <P>The scheme worked to this extent, that the extra money was levied from the pig producers and was paid into the fund.  Then, when the Government Commission was set up to examine what happened to the fund, they found that at a particular time there was about £137,000 in the fund, and then it disappeared.  They examined why it disappeared and they found it had been shared out between the bacon curers on the board.  The commission, after examining how the money was paid out and on what basis, say in their report:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless the amount of the available fund be taken as a measure, there appears to have been no exact basis on which the amount of this payment was determined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>You have read of cases of larceny in the newspapers where men robbed a till.  There may have been some squabble about how they divided what they got, but they took all that was in the till.  That is what the curers did with the hypothetical fund.  The commission's report, which is a sober one, says:</P>
    <P>&ldquo;Unless the amount of the available fund be taken as a measure, there appears to have been no exact basis on which the amount of this payment was determined.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>They scooped the pool.  They did not leave one penny of the hypothetical fund built up to increase the price of pigs when the price fell.  That was reported. <Col N="514" /> Was there any Government action?  We raised the matter in the House and the Minister for Agriculture said he could not defend it.  But he did not charge these people, he did not bring them before the court.  If a man takes a stamp from another unemployment insurance book, though the stamp has not been previously used, and puts it in a new book to make up the proper number he has to have to get unemployment insurance, he is charged in the court with fraud, with getting money under false pretences. These people did away with £137,000 put in to help in the production of pigs and all the Minister can say is: &ldquo;I do not stand over it.&rdquo;</P>
    <P>But the commission went on to report that not merely did they do that, but it was clear, according to their calculations, that they took extortionate profits in four years amounting to £308,000.  I think the £137,000, which I suggest they pilfered from the fund, is included in the £308,000.  If it is not, it adds to the crime.  In any event, there is a sum of £308,000 which they say, on their calculation, was taken in extortionate profits.  What was the result?  If you look at the statistics of bacon consumed in this country, you will find that 200,000 cwts. of bacon were taken off the breakfast and dinner tables of the people&mdash;bacon consumption declined by that amount.  But, while consumption was going down, the curers were making excessive profits amounting to £308,000.  When that was brought to the notice of one curer, his remark was that, even if that were true, it only meant that the curers during the four years charged about one-eighth of a penny per Ib. too much for bacon.  I want to emphasise that, because there are matters we have to consider in regard to industries in this country.  When one-eighth of a penny per lb. on a consumption of bacon reduced by 200,000 cwts. can mount up to £308,000 in four years, that shows where the takings are in this country. Am I right in describing the people who behaved in that way as the vultures who gather around the decay of Government administration?</P>
    <P>One other thing that the farmers in <Col N="515" /> this country are interested in is the growing of wheat.  Wheat eventually makes its appearance before us as bread, but before it does so it has to be milted into flour.  The firm of Rank arrived in this country and that firm at one time came under the scrutiny of a particular Government commission, and there is one marvellous paragraph in page 32 of the commission's report.  This commission, I might mention was established by the Government to inquire into &ldquo;the prices charged for wheaten flour by persons manufacturing such commodity in Saorstát Eireann&rdquo;.  This is what the report contains:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The recent, flotation of Messrs. Ranks (Ireland) Ltd., is even more eloquent.  Concerns previously capitalised at a lower aggregate figure were incorporated in a new company with a nominal capital of £700,000, and it was possible for the promoters to make a successful flotation on the basis of a market value of £1,452,500. Their success in disposing of the shares offered to the Irish public for a sum of, presumably, £533,750, despite the fact that effective control over the company was not transferred with such shares, must have been largely due to the following assurances contained in their prospectus:&mdash;</P>
    <P>&ldquo;The amount required annually to pay the dividends on the 350,000 6 per cent.  Cumulative Preference Shares is £21,000; on the basis of the average profits for the last three years the dividend on the said 6 per cent. Cumulative Preference Shares is covered more than seven times, and on the same basis the amount available for dividend on the Ordinary Shares, subject to Reserves, is over 38 per cent.' &rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>I ask you to realise what that vulture company makes out of this community.  All the taxpayers who pay the subsidy on flour will want to know how much Messrs.  Ranks (Ireland) and Messrs. Ranks (England) are getting out of that subsidy.  If you <Col N="516" /> analyse that paragraph you will find it comes to this.  Certain companies were amalgamated and they were said to have a nominal capital of £700,000.  I understand that the fact is that the price paid for these concerns was about half of £700,000.  In any event they were supposed to have a nominal capital value of £700,000.  They were a flotation on the basis of a market value of £1,452,500 and the Irish public put up £533,750.  The Irish public paid Mr. Rank of England all he had put into the purchase of the Ballantyne mills and gave him £100,000 over and above.</P>

    <Speaker pid="JamesLarkin1937" hpid="Mr. Larkin (Senior) Mr. Larkin (Senior)">

      <NameTxt>Mr. McGilligan</NameTxt>
      <P>£250,000 over and above.  He got £533,750 from the Irish public and retained a nominal holding of £900,000 in shares himself.  He got his whole capital paid back, and a couple of hundreds of thousands in addition.  He has been repaid all his capital, and whatever dividend now comes, he shares in the proportion of nine to five.  That is the position, notwithstanding that he has repaid himself every penny he was out of pocket. We are subsidising that man through the subsidy on bread and flour.  How much in the way of dividends has gone out of this country in over-payment for flour and bread to the man who has recouped himself for every penny he put into this business?  How much is going to the Irish shareholders? We might like to see something going to the people who put money into the business, but it is a matter of opinion whether we would like to see anything going to the man who fleeced the Irish public and who now continues year by year, without the Minister ever saying &ldquo;Boo&rdquo; to him, to fleece the country of its dividends at a time when we are subsidising flour.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>If it is the policy of the Government that they are going to continue the devastation of the Minister for Agriculture, and if we have to subsidise these commodities and allow these tributes to be pulled from us by people who have no right to them, then we have reached a shockingly bad position.  The Ministers over there know these things, because <Col N="517" /> these reports have been debated already in the House.  What has been done to Messrs. Ranks (England), not Messrs. Ranks (Ireland), since, and to the bacon curers?  Are the Government prepared to continue that policy, and do they consider it is in the interest of healthy agriculture here? Must we, the taxpayers, pay to have these foodstuffs subsidised to this extent, when we know that so much is going to a person who at the moment has not a penny of his own capital involved in that concern?</P>
    <P>This policy has been carried through in such a way that the purchasing power of the £ has been reduced to 12/6.  It is all very well being a good Republican and wanting to knock the King out of the Constitution; but when we get to the point at which we knock a crown and a half out of the £, then we are bringing politics to a really comical pass.  But that is what the Government have done.  That is what they have imposed, not merely on the income-tax payer, but on the man who is given a subsistence allowance, the old age pensioner upon whom Deputy Tunney picked, the person with the dole, the person in receipt of unemployment insurance or unemployment assistance, the man getting £2 or £3 a week, the middle-class families living on the proceeds of some little investments.  All these people have deducted from them 7/6 in the £ before they start to spend anything.  And that is the policy that some people in this country want to have continued.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>The wealth of a nation can best be judged by the prosperity of the people of that nation.  That applies to Ireland just the same as to any other nation on God's earth.  I feel that no matter what amount of speech-making there is in this House, it will not alter the position that exists in the country.  One gathers from the speakers on the opposite benches that there seems to be a certain amount of hatred, spite and envy in what they have to say.  They do not seem to come here in order to give straight, honest-to-God criticism, to give a helping hand to whatever Government is in power.  They seem to pride themselves on the fact that the <Col N="518" /> Government have made mistakes and they like to expose the Government's mistakes.  That can be applied to the Fine Gael Benches as well as to the Fianna Fáil Benches and perhaps it could be applied to our own benches.</P>
      <P>Unless we get down to solid work, become more Christian-like and begin to realise that we have responsibilities, we cannot hope to progress.  We should realise that we are sent here to work on behalf of the people, and not so much to work on our own behalf or to speak to the gallery.  That is all wrong, and until we reflect and try to help in putting right whatever we believe is wrong, and give brotherly advice, friendly advice, and assist in every possible way in this country, I am, afraid we will not be able to make much progress.</P>
      <P>As regards the Department of Local Government and Public Health, I observe that they require a sum of something over £500,000&mdash;£523,000, is the actual figure.  I would like Deputies to consider how our people are being treated, people who wish to get hospital treatment, people who are suffering from various diseases, tuberculosis in particular.  I could instance the cases of two very dear friends of mine, two women, one 25 years of age and the other, a mother, 40 years of age.  The mother had to stay with her family&mdash;her husband died&mdash;for two years.  She had no other place to go.  She died.  We have a tuberculosis hospital, I believe, near Ballinrobe, in the South Mayo constituency, but our doctor did not seem to be able to get her in there.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I consider that that is wrong.  If we are asked to vote over £500,000 for public health, we should be careful how the money is spent and see that it is put to the very best use.  Many millions of pounds have been spent during the past 10 or 12 years, since the Hospitals Sweepstake was established, and I can never understand where such sums are going in a country like this.  I ask the responsible Minister to give the matter consideration. The disease will not be relieved, either in the cities or the rural areas, if you are to allow men and women to remain in thatched cottages <Col N="519" /> in congested districts or to live in company with large families.  The persons concerned should be removed.  This is a very serious matter and deserves due consideration.  The Minister for Local Government and Public Health should provide some remedy in the near future or things will take a very grave turn.  We are asked to vote £4,500 for Fisheries.</P>

      <NameTxt>Mr. Cafferky</NameTxt>
      <P>Although the Estimate is not before us, I should like, with the permission of the Chair, to make a passing reference to the matter.  In a neighbouring constituency to mine&mdash; I refer to North Mayo&mdash;the fishing industry is dwindling right along from Ballycroy to the Bangor Erris district. There, the people depend on the industry for a livelihood.  It is rather sad to reflect that that industry has not been developed and that it has not become a national industry on a sound basis.  We have only three deep-sea trawlers for that industry while, in 1939, we had nine.  Whatever happened, they have diminished to three. We have a fine port at Blacksod Bay capable of accommodating an adequate fishing fleet.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>I should like to remind the Minister that it is impossible to purchase material for the lining of the currachs or small fishing boats.  It would be well if his attention were given to these matters and thus relieve the unemployment created by the lack of interest which the Minister for Lands or the Minister for Fisheries has taken in the fishing industry, particularly in western Ireland.  We are asked to vote £1,265,000 for old age pensions. The system by which the means test is applied in the case of old age pensions is not fair.  If you have an income of £15 12s. 6d., you are entitled to a pension of 10/-, but if you have an income of £39 15s., you are only entitled to 1/-.  I do not think that that is very Christian-like, especially when we come in here and accept £40 a month. Somebody has interjected that I need not take the £40.  After all, I think that I am as much entitled to take it <Col N="520" /> as any man who sits on the benches on the other side or on this side.  That does not alter the argument.  Is the sum of £39 15s. plus 52/-, sufficient to maintain for a year a man or woman, whether they live in a city or in a town or in the country?  I do not think that it is.  Then, an inconceivable amount of red tape is involved before, the pension is obtained.  A certificate has to be obtained, one has to go before the pensions committee, where he may be turned down.  Then, the local pensions officer comes to visit him and, perhaps, makes a wrong report, which must be the case on many occasions.  Six months elapse before the pension is obtained.  I think that the work could be done much more easily and expeditiously.  What would be wrong with the individual concerned writing to the local council or to the customs and excise, getting his certificate, sending it to the Department and getting his 10/-, if he comes, within the, regulations?</P>

      <P>That is right.  I am sorry.  As long as we have unemployment, poverty and emigration, so long will this country find itself in its present condition.  Some remedy must be found, and my suggestion is that we cannot find it if Parties come here merely to criticise whatever Government may be in power.  If a voluntary commission were set up, consisting of Deputies from all Parties, which would not be any burden on the State, ways and means could be discussed to solve unemployment and to develop our natural resources.  In that way we would be getting nearer to business. Until that is done I am very much afraid that people will lose the respect they should have for the National Assembly.  People are losing respect for it because they feel that some Deputies come here and have a good time.  It is no wonder they were told that at the general election.  I hope that future discussions here will be on a more friendly basis, and that there will be a better understanding when business is discussed.  It should be discussed in the national interest and not in Party interests or vote catching interests, or for a display of eloquence in this House or for the Gallery.</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Before I deal with some of the larger questions involved I should like to settle a point that arose between Deputy Davin and myself. The Deputy gave certain statistics and made a number of statements in regard to them.  I questioned his figures.  The first statement of the Deputy was that since Fianna Fáil came into office, and since Dr. Ryan became Minister for Agriculture, the value of agricultural production has gone down by £15,000,000. That was a very definite statement.  I had got the statistics examined and I could not find any figures to justify the Deputy's statement.  I pursued the Deputy's remarks in order to have the matter debated.  The Deputy stated yesterday that, according to Table 59 of the Statistical Abstract for the year 1932, the total agricultural production for 1929-30 was £64,865,000, and he gave Table 58 from the Statistical Abstract for the year 1939, in which prices are given for 1937-38, as showing the total value of agricultural production for that period as £49,662,000.  He asked me to subtract the two figures and said that I would get £15,000,000. Of course, I was very innocent, and when I heard that that was the case since Fianna Fáil came into office and since Dr. Ryan became Minister for Agriculture, I naturally expected that I would find the figures related to the beginning and the end of that period. But that is not Deputy Davin's method.  The Deputy picked the year <Col N="523" /> 1937-38.  Why?  There was no reason for choosing that particular period.  I can see no reason for doing so.  In order to get a figure of that kind he had to go back to a period even before the getaeral election previous to the last.  What was the purpose of that?  Is that straight dealing?  If he told us that in 1937-38 the figure was so and so and that in 1929-30 the figure was so and so, we could understand it, but to keep from us the fact that he took as a beginning the year 1929-30, before the present Minister came into power, and when prices were still higher than when he took office in 1932, and then to take a period half-way in our period of office before the previous general election is not, I think, fair to the House.</P>
      <P>If we are to argue intelligently here and to use statistics honestly, we ought, at least, be given an opportunity of knowing what the figures relate to in order to see if the conclusions are justified.  The first period was 1936-37.  Why was that chosen? The Deputy told us that he took the <i>Statistical Abstract</i> for 1938 and suggested that it gave the latest available figures.  Everybody knows that there was a <i>Statistical Abstract</i> published in 1939, in 1940, in 1941 and 1942. The Deputy did not choose any one of these.  Not merely did he choose the one for 1929-30, which was two or three years before the Minister took office, and a time when prices and the value of produce were far higher than in 1932, but apparently he was not aware of the fact, and did not trouble to make himself aware, that there was a change in the basis of calculation as explained in 1938.  Where he gave £64,000,000 and compared it with £49,000,000, in fact, the two sets of figures in that form are not comparable at all, because the basis was changed.  If the Deputy wanted to compare the figures, instead of £64,000,000 he will have to use £62,000,000.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>Having regard to the statement made by the last Deputy, if we are to do useful work here, we must give up the rhetoric and try to give consideration <Col N="524" /> to facts.  We ought to be told here what is the position and if there are any evils connected with it, let them be pointed out.  If we want to look at the future, let us do so on the basis of the truth is we see it.  If we proceed in that way then we will be a useful Assembly and will be doing useful work.  I have another figure from Deputy Davin's statement and, if he were in the House now I would ask him to show me where he got it. I cannot find it.  The Deputy stated that the value of our agricultural produce consumed in this country had gone down by £8,500,000.</P>
    <P>I cannot find that.  I have here a very extensive table going back to the year 1929-30, which Deputy Davin took.  There is a gap because, apparently, the figures were not worked out for the years 1931-32, and a few subsequent years but I have the figures for 1938-39, 1940-41, 1941-42, and when I look along these figures I can see no indication whatever of any figures that would lead to the conclusion that there has been a reduction in home consumption of £8,500,000.  I do not want to go through all these figures that I have.  Naturally, during the depression, the figures were lowest in value, although the percentage was not necessarily the lowest.  The value of home consumption was low back in 1935-36, and lower still in 1934-35. It rose steadily, however, between &mdash;I am giving the figures in million now&mdash;from £26 to £27, to £30, to £32, to £33, to £47, to £54.  In other words, there was a steady increase in value, and that is the value of the agricultural produce consumed at home, to which the Deputy refers.</P>
    <P>In the same way, I have the percentages of the value of the total output that was consumed at home, and here are the figures.  The figures I have just given were the absolute figures in millions of pounds sterling, but here are the percentages.  In 1935, the percentage was 66.9.  It then went down to 65 per cent., then down to 62, and in the following year was again 62.  Then there was a slight increase from 62 to 62.6, and then the <Col N="525" /> percentage swung up to 69 and then to 71.4, at which it stands at present. Where, then, is the basis for the statement that there has been a decrease in home consumption?  I cannot find it.  If we are to argue to a point at all, and not be at cross purposes, we must be able to see what is the basis of figures that are quoted.  It has been said that you can use figures to prove anything, and there is no doubt that figures can be wrongly used and that wrong conclusions can be drawn from them.  In fact, it is not easy to draw the right conclusions from statistics.  Very often, it requires experts to determine where there are charges of one kind or another to make sure that the figures used are comparable.</P>
    <P>I think that a lot of the statements made in this debate were on a par with the statements made by Deputy Davin. They are statements made without any basis, in fact.  Nothing is easier than to use phrases such as &ldquo;No good,&rdquo;&ldquo;Dismal failure,&rdquo;&ldquo;Inefficiency,&rdquo; and so forth.  I have heard parrots taught to say &ldquo;No good,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dismal failure,&rdquo; and things of that sort.  You can teach any parrot to say things like that, and those who have criticised the Minister for Agriculture have followed that line.  I do not think that any person dealt seriously with what were the principles of the policy at all.  If we were making it our general peacetime policy, then I would say that Deputy Dillon touched upon it, although I do not agree with his argument, because I think it is ridiculous. Deputy Dillon, in effect appreciated, what was in his right hand and depreciated what was in his left hand.  He completely ignored the real basis of values.  However, I take it that it was not the policy of peace time, but the policy that is being pursued at the moment that is in question.</P>
    <Speaker pid="JamesMatthewDillon" hpid="Mr. Dillon Mr. Dillon">

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>Yes, but it was the policy at the moment that was criticised. Deputy McGilligan referred to the flight from the land.  Every evil <Col N="526" /> that exists in this country is attributed to the policy of the Minister for Agriculture. My goodness, if the Minister for Agriculture were able to do all the things that it is suggested, by the attacks made on him here, it is possible for him to do, he would be one of the greatest geniuses in the world.  He would be more than a man: he would be almost a god.  He would be able to remedy all the evils that exist in our society.  I have been in this House a very long time, and I have never heard a more unfair attack than the attack that has been made on the Minister for Agriculture.  There is only one explanation of it, and that is that he is the cause of the war.  I see no other.  It is only if you can put at his door the responsibility for the present war that you can blame him for the evils that exist at the present time.  Is he responsible for the war?  I asked that question before.  Were we responsible for the war, and are we to be held responsible for all the things that have followed almost inevitably from the war?</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>It is not.  It is a fact that the things that the Minister for Agriculture has been accused as being responsible for are things that have followed almost inevitably as a result of this war that is raging around us.  It is easy for anybody going through this world of ours to be able to point to the very many evils and dangers that exist.  I suppose the world is going to be a vale of tears to the end of time.  I agree that it should be our duty to try to do our utmost to relieve all the miseries that we can relieve, and that, so far as it is humanly possible for us to do it, we should use all our efforts to remedy these, but it is one thing to be able to point out an evil and quite a different thing to be able to show an effective remedy.  Some people try to find remedies, as I myself am inclined to, by a process of reform, trying to end each evil as we see it.</P>

      <P>I believe in that, because there is one advantage in that method of procedure, and that is that you have the evils before you and can see them, and if you can correct one of them without introducing extra evils, then you certainly have a definite improvement.  Very often, however, when you remedy one evil, the method by which you try to remedy it introduces, other evils.</P>

    <Speaker pid="EamonDeValera" hpid="The Taoiseach Eamon de Valera">
      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>You have to try to calculate&mdash;sometimes it is a very nice calculation&mdash;whether or not the remedy you propose is a genuine remedy.  But at least you have the whole of the facts; you can find the result of your change, and you are able to judge whether your remedy is effective or not.  Other people will say: &ldquo;The whole system is wrong.  Let us end it.  Let us take the whole thing away and try a new system.&rdquo;  My objection to that as a method of dealing with those human evils is that you do not know where you are going.  You get rid of a certain number of evils, but you have no idea of the number of other types of evils that you introduce, and they may be far worse in their ultimate effect than the evils you are trying to remedy. That is my philosophy.  I take the reformist line in regard to those social and economic matters, not the revolutionary line.  I do that for what I consider the good sound reasons I have given.  Perhaps there may be something in one's own character which helps one to approach it in that particular way.  I believe that I adopt it not through any want of courage to face the other line, but it is my conviction that you do make more progress by the method of reform, getting rid of the separate evils that you see, than you do by the other method.  Looking out upon life generally, it seems to me that progress is made as a result of the operation of two forces.  There is the progressive force, which is always putting out its tentacles, so to speak, trying to find a spot where it can survive.  If circumstances are such that it can survive, <Col N="528" /> then it is established and you have definite progress.  If the circumstances are such that it cannot survive, that ends the effort in that direction.</P>
      <P>Those are the progressive forces, always trying to move forward.  Then there are the conservative forces, which try to maintain what has been got.  I do believe that it is in the balance of those forces that most progress in human affairs is made.  I only say those things because I think it is wise that we should try to approach all those questions from some fundamental point of view, and that we should have some general principles on which to work.</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>With regard to our general policy here, we in Fianna Fáil definitely believe that, in our particular set of circumstances, greater progress can be made in producing prosperity and happiness for our people on the basis of attempting reasonable self-sufficiency than on any other basis.  If anybody wants to know what our policy is, if anybody wants to talk about the policy of the Minister for Agriculture, the policy of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, or any other part of our policy, he will find that there has been a definite, steady movement along those particular lines. Have we been successful or not? Time alone will be able to tell that.  We know perfectly well that a good deal can be said for the free trade arguments.  We only say that, in our particular set of circumstances, those arguments are not sound. You could regard us as at one side of the scale, and you could regard Deputy Dillon&mdash;as far as I have ever heard or understood him&mdash;as at the other.  I believe that Deputy Dillon's policy generally would result in this country becoming a large ranch.  It would mean the end of the idea of the wider distribution of ownership of property.  You would have, very definitely, to enlarge your holdings if you were going to compete in the British market with relatively undeveloped countries like New Zealand and the Argentine, where there is vast, untapped wealth.  The Minister for Agriculture was quoted here by Deputy McGilligan.  Deputy McGilligan always <Col N="529" /> makes his speeches by reading long quotations.  It is an easy way to make a speech.  If you get long excerpts, you can speak for half an hour, an hour, or several hours by reading out those quotations.</P>

In the long run, it does not matter a thrauneen to us whether the Minister for Agriculture is optimistic or otherwise.  The whole question is: Is he right?  Is the future which he envisages going to be the future, in fact, or is it not?</P>

      <P>&mdash;&mdash;but I deny it, because the circumstances in which we are testing it at the moment, or the circumstances in which we were able to test it during the economic war, are not normal circumstances.  We have not been able to test it yet.  But suppose it had been tested, would it not be a reasonable answer if I were to say to the Deputy: &ldquo;That is the result&mdash;a diminution if you like&mdash;of our policy, but in heaven's name what would it be if the opposite policy were adopted?&rdquo; It has not been tested, but I think it is reasonable to suppose that, if we have to compete with the Argentine and New Zealand in an open foreign market, we will have to approximate to the conditions which enable them to do it.  During the last election, I pointed out that the price of butter in the British market in 1934&mdash;the open price, not the price after the British had taken off their penal tariffs&mdash;was 7d. a Ib. the equivalent of 3d. a gallon for milk; 2? gallons of milk go to make 1 Ib. of butter.  To-day, we are talking about 9d. a gallon not being enough, but 3d. a gallon was what the farmer was going to get for producing butter for the British market at that particular time.  We had to subsidise it.  At that time, we gave him 1/2½, or within a small fraction of it, for 1-lb. of butter. We had to give him more than double what he was getting on the British market.  Was there any way out of it? Again, at the same time, I pointed out that the British Minister for Agriculture, when some people went along to try to get a better price for our produce, said to them:&mdash;</P>
      <P>&ldquo;Come down with me to the Smithfield market, and I will show you beef from the Argentine, meat which any of you gentlemen will admit that you will be glad to eat, and it has been landed at 1½d. a lb.&rdquo;</P>
    </Speaker>
    <P>That is the sort of competition you would have to meet if you were relying <Col N="531" /> on the foreign market alone.  That is the sort of competition that agriculture would have to face and that is the sort of competition even in a worse form that you may have to face after the war.</P>

      <P>I do not know.  There may have been a lot of other factors. There may have been subsidies for all I know.  The Minister for Agriculture was criticised by Deputy McGilligan because he stated we would have to face a position of that kind.</P>

      <P>We are faced with the fact that, if we are to depend to any extent on an outside market, we shall have to be in a position to produce here at rates comparable to the rates at which farmers in the Argentine and elsewhere can produce.  I say that the result of that competition, during the period of the depression, meant that the price you got for butter was 7d. per Ib. and our whole dairying industry was being destroyed.  We had to come along and subsidise it.  We had to build up that price so as to give the farmers at home, not 7d., which would be the equivalent only of 3d. per gallon, but 1/2½d. per Ib.&mdash;or at least a price much nearer 1/2½d. than 1/2.  That is to say, we had to more than double the price which we got on the British market.  Now it is said that we are going to be in a very parlous condition&mdash;&mdash;</P>

      <P>I am simply dealing with the position we have to face and I say, in view of that, it is obviously good policy for us in this country to try to give our farmers as much of the home market as we possibly can.  I say that the more we use of their produce in the home market, the more we see that a high proportion is used at home, the more we should be pleased, assuming that at any particular stage production is as high as it can be.  By all means, let us increase production, but the Minister for Agriculture cannot go in on every farm.  He cannot go out in the morning and tell every farmer to get up or keep at his elbow all day or do things of that kind.  He can only indicate general principles and pursue a definite policy.  The policy I have been trying to indicate to you is the policy that has been consistently pursued. That policy has been that, at times like those of which I have spoken, when owing to this terrible competition in outside markets we got unremunerative prices, we said: &ldquo;Give the farmer the home market and do not bring in from outside bacon and other commodities that can be produced here at home.  If the price he gets for animal products is not remunerative let him use his land in other ways.&rdquo;</P>

      <NameTxt>The Taoiseach</NameTxt>
      <P>If we import less, we shall have to export less.  We have to export to buy the things we cannot produce here at home, but if there are things which we can produce at home, why compel us to import them and to export other things at unremunerative prices in order to do that?  If we were in the position which Deputy Dillon suggested, that by rearing cattle and selling them as beef we could get twice as much out of an <Col N="534" /> acre of land as by producing wheat on it&mdash;if that were true it would be quite a different story, but it is not true. Away back in 1928, when we sat at an economic conference it was proved from the figures officially supplied that an acre of land turned over to wheat production was giving more to the community&mdash;more food, more money value even&mdash;than an acre of land either producing beef or milk.</P>
      <P>The time allotted to me is exhausted, but we shall come back to this subject on many occasions.  All I want to say now is that we have never suggested that the Minister for Agriculture is a superman, but he is a better man to be Minister of Agriculture than any other man I see here. He is certainly better than the gentleman who came here to criticise him, and who, I presume, expected to be selected to fill his place in a coalition Government.</P>
